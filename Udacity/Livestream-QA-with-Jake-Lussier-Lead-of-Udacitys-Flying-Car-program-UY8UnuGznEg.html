technical difficulties I am Jake Lussier
I'm product lead for the flying car
nanodegree and since this is a brand new
nanodegree program we thought it'd be a
good time to open it up for questions
let people ask questions about what
flying cars are what the nanodegree is
anything that comes to mind around the
curriculum careers anything so this will
be a time where we'll have a couple
different slots in the next half an hour
hour where students can message in any
questions they'd like to start though
I'll just give a little bit of
background about myself and what brought
me to the flying car nanodegree program
so as a little bit of background I've
been working in data mining machine
learning for over 10 years now a lot of
my work used to be on the web and then
when I got to Stanford for a PhD program
I started working with Sebastian Thrun
the Udacity founder and we started doing
a lot with well he's been doing robotics
for a long time and I started working in
perception robotics so we did crazy
stuff like inventory tracking and
something like Amazon go almost and I
actually spun that out worked in it for
a little bit but then on the side
through weird twists and turns started
working a bit in flying cars and that
path led me here so now I'm heading up
the flying car narrow degree and we're
super thrilled about this program and
really excited to share it with you all
and answer any questions that you might
have so I guess to get started we'll
just talk a bit about the program how it
runs and what kind of topics we'll cover
so this is a six-month program broken
into two terms and each term is three
months long so the first term is going
to be aerial robotics so you can think
of this at just the foundations to get a
robot to fly hover move in interesting
maneuvers not necessarily going full-on
flying car yet but just how do you get
something to fly and how do you get it
to fly autonomously so in this first
term we're going to cover estimation
controls and planning usually those
might be covered in
order but in the spirit of getting you
flying stuff quickly we're actually
gonna switch up that order and do it
reverse so we're gonna start with
planning so you'll have the opportunity
to immediately get your drone to fly
around simulated environments and even
if you port your coach a real drone
which we'll talk about later you can get
it to fly around in specific paths and
say your backyard as long as it's safe
and then we'll move on to controls and
then finally into lower level estimation
so that's all term one and again that's
the foundations building up to a full-on
flying car curriculum it's the second
term where we then cover intelligent air
systems where we're gonna go a bit more
advanced we're going to talk about
flying car specifics and we're going to
move even beyond a single flying car and
we're going to talk about entire complex
environments where you might have
collections of drones collections of
flying cars all of those moving about
autonomously in a coordinated and safe
fashion so in that second term we're
gonna start off with a primer on
fixed-wing flight so a lot of what we
call flying cars differ from drones and
that they're not just quad rotors they
might be either full on just regular
fixed-wing planes or they might be some
kind of hybrid VTOL design so the very
first module in that second term is
going to be about fixed-wing flight from
there we'll go on to more of topics in
fleet coordination so we're gonna have a
little bit about mission optimization
and then we will have more about
coordinating all of these vehicles in a
way that takes into account the
communication between them and also to a
central central coordination system so
in a lot of different countries this
this might involve governments in some
way so that's that's just like a very
high-level overview of what we'll be
covering in the course I think as I
mentioned earlier the the application
window for this first inaugural term is
actually closing very soon so you have
until Wednesday at midnight Pacific time
to apply and
we think this is a really exciting
opportunity for these students to get in
the very first cohort and also have a
one-time offer where the typical tuition
will be discounted 25% so you actually
save $300 so we definitely welcome all
applications for the entire duration of
this NAMM degree we're extremely excited
to see applications this first time
around so that's a bit about me that's a
bit about the program so I guess what
I'll do now is I'll launch into a little
bit of QA we will get to live Q&amp;amp;A we got
a lot of some questions submitted
beforehand though so just to start we'll
start going through some commonly asked
questions and some specific questions
from some specific students in our slack
communities so okay so I guess the first
question appropriately so is what do we
mean when we say flying car and how does
it fit into the future of air
transportation so this is this is a bit
of a tricky one I would say that to
define flying car it's useful to think
about when people ask how is it actually
different than a helicopter and that's a
good place to start because when we
think of a helicopter some really
important features there are that
helicopters right now are really
difficult to access in that they're
quite expensive they're difficult to use
and that they require really
sophisticated training if you've ever
even just tried to flown fly a quadrotor
drone there's like all these different
controls and just to not destroy it you
have to actually be quite skilled so
it's expensive it's difficult to use and
a helicopter with its single rotor is
actually not safe really either so
they're not used so widely that we see
accidents and say urban environments but
they're actually in terms of accidents
per ride they're quite dangerous and
they're not super reliable there's not
much from done redundancy built in so so
think about that as a helicopter so then
what is a flying car is it is
essentially a flying vehicle
on all of those accounts offers
improvements and is in some way almost
opposite to a helicopter which is to say
that a flying car is a flying vehicle
that provides easy access and that it
should be quieter it should be cheaper
it should be easy to use so the
autonomous controls or at least
intelligent controls should make it so
that it doesn't need expert licensing or
perhaps any pilot and also it should be
tremendously safe and that again the
autonomy provides safe ways to navigate
and also the design of the vehicle
offers redundancies so a flying car
doesn't refer to any kind of one design
or one use case and more refers to a
vehicle that fits these descriptions and
in doing so is able to address more
everyday use cases and I think that last
part is is a really important feature of
what we call flying cars is that we're
not thinking of helicopters that are
when you go on vacation to some island
and we're not thinking of planes for
when you go from San Francisco to LA
we're thinking about more you go to work
and you have a long commute and there's
going to be a day where everyone flies
every day so this these features and
that kind of imagined use case really
gets to the impact then which is that as
we want more people to move more often
as we want more Goods to move more often
as we want even our services to move
more often and as we want them faster
right now a lot of our transportation
exists in a world where people are
collecting in three dimensions and going
up and into tall buildings and doing so
all at the same time for work and then
all going to two dimensions and getting
congested at that time with these
natural bottlenecks
so all these aerial transportation
solutions offer the opportunity to break
that constraint and have things fly to
us immediately seamlessly cheaply so
this is this is the promise of the
flying car also a drone but for a flying
card this is
this is the promise specifically for
transportation so so yeah so that's a
bit about flying cars a bit long-winded
but I guess in summary it's just easy to
access easy to use safe flying vehicles
that we use for everyday use now I guess
this dovetails nicely into the next
question which is how do drones relate
to flying cars and what role will they
play in the future so a lot of the
things that I just described go back to
this point of trying to move things
right now we're stuck in two dimensions
right now we want more of those things
which is making that system even more
congested and as I said flying cars
allow you to break that constraint so
drones have that same advantage
obviously when we're talking about
drones we're talking about smaller
vehicles that are moving layer packages
so I think we can think of drones then
as these flying vehicles with these
features that are optimized to move
goods to us especially light or urgent
goods very quickly and very very cheap
so they're not really designed to carry
you know a sofa probably in the future
if you want to order a sofa and have it
deliver next day you'd be better served
by a self-driving car than a ginormous
drone but when you look at what's being
delivered to most people daily there are
these statistics like see Amazon
eighty-six percent of their packages are
under five pounds and Walmart has said
that 70% of all Americans live within
five miles of a Walmart so when you
combine these two a lot of things that
we're trying to get moved to us are
actually very minimal - what drones can
provide so again I think the short
answer here is that the value
proposition of the flying car drones
have a very similar similar value
proposition for moving light goods to us
immediately again in everyday use case
so those are great questions super
appreciate on the high level points of
flying cars and of drones so those are
very frequently asked questions that we
see all the time on slack so now to get
to some specifics we have this one
question in here submitted by an exhibit
L and the question is what type of drone
should we get for the course and what
are the sensor is in other hardware
required for the course so this is one
that we're actually going to share out a
post about this maybe today or tomorrow
where we talk about more about what
students will be building and how the
development path will work and culminate
in some building on actual physical
systems but as a little bit of a teaser
I guess what I can say right now is that
you don't need anything so if you just
want to learn the fundamentals of
autonomous flight and if you want to be
able to practice with those and get
real-world experience but in simulation
and the flying card nanodegree is
already something that you can tackle
and you'll have everything you need to
have an experience that is offered
nowhere else and will prepare you really
well for your career that being said we
know that a lot of students really value
the opportunity to port their code to
hardware I think especially with drones
it's really magical to see something fly
so not just in simulation but to be able
to have it on a little a big drone
outside or a little drone right in your
office and we also know that experience
doing so isn't just fun it's also
something that is practical and when you
go to job interviews if you can say and
even better yet show where you've gotten
your code running on a real robot that's
super powerful so with that in mind we
are offering a couple recommendations
for a first fully featured
a bit more heavy-duty but still dy I
drone and then another very inexpensive
drone that is not heavy-duty but it's
something that you can just fly around
in your house so on those points on the
first one in the classroom we're
actually going to be doing a lot of
instruction and explanation with the
Intel Aero which is a drone that has
both the autopilot and the flight
computer so in addition to running
low-level code on the autopilot you can
also even run your Python code in a very
high-level way for for problems that
aren't super time sensitive and don't
need to be real-time so will will be
offering a bit more detail on that but
the Intel Aero is one really good
solution for this course it is a bit
heavier duty it is a bit larger it is a
bit more expensive so on the other side
we will also be pointing students to the
crazy fly by a bit craze and that is a
drone that when you get the stem bundle
can actually be less than $200 and I
actually just tweeted out the other day
a picture of one of our team members
Tucker flying it around in the office
and just being able to poke it down and
have it come right back up so I think
these two options depending on what
you're really looking for are really
really good and can provide you with
some real world experience getting these
things to fly so again summary you don't
need anything if say you can't afford
anything or if you don't really have an
interest in a drone buzzing around then
that's fine and absolutely you'll have
everything you need for this course if
you so choose to get drone hardware then
we'll point you to those and we will
also provide instructions for the code
that you'll be developing in the
classroom how to get that onto your
drone easily so hopefully that's clear
if there are any other questions feel
free to ask now hit me up on slack and
I'll be happy to offer more
clarification hopefully we'll do so a
bit more formally in the neck
day or so okay so another question now
by Abdullah Al Totten apologies for her
pronunciation the question is are we
going to design an attitude controller
for instance PID or lqr also what kind
of microcontrollers are we going to be
using in this program so I think Andy
Brown our curriculum lead is going to be
able to offer you really detailed
explanations about these probably far
better than I but what I can tell you is
that at a high level you'll be designing
a nonlinear cascaded controller which
basically means that you'll have these
different controllers that involve some
nonlinearities and you'll be developing
and implementing that whole system as
part of that yes you will be designing a
PID controller and specifically yes you
will be doing it for attitude I guess if
since there are likely a good number of
students from the self-driving car
community out there I think that since
it is a PID controller it will be
similar to what you develop there or in
robotics but in robotics
and in aerial robotics systems the
control problems are a lot more
challenging dynamic a lot more variables
to consider so it will be a unique
challenge to to look at how you control
a drone specifically okay so the next
question we have here is from burned
right burg and the question is regarding
the program will be will we be learning
to control the autopilot of drones as
well I'd love to control my drone in
extreme weather or tried to program
extreme evasive maneuvers
such as flips and stuff all right so I
guess on that question again the answer
is yes so and and for a bit of
background for other listeners who might
not be as familiar on a lot of drones
there is both the flight computer which
is used for a higher level computational
tasks
and the autopilot which most the time I
would say people aren't tinkering with
because that's much lower level controls
and this program we are trying to really
offer a broad look at the entire system
and really give you expertise and
experience and in the full stack so with
that in mind yeah in this program
planning is an example of a problem that
you can likely just have on the flight
computer but then as we go into control
and estimation and we're trying to do
things that require a high frame rate in
those situations yeah we'll be having
you write things on the autopilot and
simulation and then if you want to put
it to your drone then yes you would do
that as well and for your for your fun
or aspirations here yes well also as
part of our projects we'll be hopefully
having you not just control a drone and
variable maneuvers but get to play
around with doing more acrobatic
maneuvers and also like slalom and and a
bit more advanced things so I think
we'll do that if I'm not mistaken both
in first term and second term so that
should be that should be pretty good fun
and pretty cool all right now second
part to this question is about
autonomous flight and regulation here so
it's which countries do you think are
best prepared for autonomous flying
drones so that that's a that's a big
question I would say that there's a lot
of exciting innovation happening in
startups in a lot of countries maybe we
can discuss that a bit more later in
terms of which startups are doing what
kinds of things I think you see it in
the States I think you see it in Europe
in Asia South America you're seeing it
you're seeing really interesting large
companies and startups do a lot of
different things so I think they're all
really positioned to to try to lead this
area
I think regulation it's it's obviously a
complex complicated question and it
from location to location I think we're
being pleasantly surprised though so if
we take the United States for example
the FAA is being quite innovative and
doing a good job at supporting
innovation so for example in in building
the unmanned traffic management system
they're doing a lot of development
themselves and they're also working with
the private sector to try to understand
how to best develop this system so while
maybe it's sometimes it might slow
innovation I think it's it's natural and
necessary in this world where we do have
robots flying on the sky so it needs to
be extremely safe and I would say in
general they're they're doing so an
appropriate pace and actually
stimulating a good amount of innovation
so I think I think the the regulatory
bodies are acting appropriately and a
lot of countries are going to have
really cool opportunity to really
transform transportation in their
countries and abroad ok so let me see
all right have some additional questions
here
okay so I guess a first one here from
Musab is in the intro of the course the
professor showed a px for autopilot are
we going to learn how to build our own
autopilot or just learn how to interface
with the existing auto pilots yeah so I
guess I would offer one small correction
say not just learn how to interface I
think that's that's a really important
thing to learn how to do too so and in
this Nan degree we will offer you an
opportunity to do both so as I mentioned
before as soon as well absolutely
when building low level control and
estimation code have the opportunity to
dig into what an autopilot system looks
like and get to play around a bit with
how they would handle low-level
considerations like that but as you go
into the real world and you build a
career in this space I think a lot of
Engineers will be not just not digging
down deeply into those parts but
actually building on top so a really
important part of this program is also
saying here are some interesting open
source widely used tools out there such
as the px4 autopilot and how can you use
that how can you develop on on top of
that so both of these will be really
important so I guess I will answer just
one more and then we'll move on okay
this question from Musab is will AI and
machine learning topics be covered in
the program so that is a really good
question and the answer is yes I think
as someone who comes from data mining
machine learning and AI flying systems
provide actually a super interesting
domain to experiment and work on AI and
that the current supervised learning
classification algorithms out there that
have been riding this wave right now and
most people can just kind of use them as
black boxes for certain narrow use cases
those have some applicability in the
domain but really it's it's a more
challenging environment
where safety and reliability are really
important constraints so I think in the
flying car nanodegree you'll get to see
what machine learning looks like in
autonomous systems when you have to be
extremely aware that your robots in the
sky and that if you have an algorithm
that you just treat as a black box and
you think on average should work it's
just not sufficient so you have to be
creative about how you use machine
learning but still we we will cover how
machine learning is used in flight
autonomy okay so I think that's maybe a
good first batch of questions so moving
on I think it would maybe be good before
I continue answering some questions to
talk specifically about one area where I
know a lot of students care and there
have been a lot of questions which is
just the flying car nano degree and how
if and how it will prepare students for
careers and specifically careers in the
space so the very high-level point here
is yes this nano degree is a job ready
career-focused nano degree just like
robotics just like self-driving cars and
as with any of these Udacity nanodegree
nano degrees we will offer students
clear advantages and tools and in three
important ways that are again typical of
everything that we offer Udacity the
first is that what you'll be learning
and what you'll be building the course
are directly useful in industry these
are informed by our conversations with
industry leaders both really large and
really small startups so what you'll be
learning and the projects that you'll be
building we're really confident that
when you go to interviews with these
kinds of employers that you can show
them this stuff and they will
immediately recognize its applicability
and be excited about what you've built
and what skills you have so first one is
just we're gonna prepare you really well
in the classroom a second one is that we
as a alluded to we do work really
closely with industry
so we are confident that everything that
we're offering is relevant and also that
as you reach the end of your time in the
flying car nano degree that we can
position you for success in this area so
this leads into a third point which is
that in the Udacity nano degree we also
have ruksar team in the careers team at
Udacity that is dedicated entirely to
student success so you'll learn relevant
things we have connections to hiring
partners and then we have careers team
at Udacity that can make sure that you
know how to prepare for interviews that
you know where to look for the right
jobs everything that you need given all
the expertise you will have built to go
out and find a career so that's that's
generally high-level Udacity things that
are true for all of our narrow degrees
and I think another point here to make
for flying cards in that I think a lot
of people have questions like okay
flying cars are not as established as
machine learning or even as self-driving
cars I think an important point here is
that in this nano degree we're going to
be offering a a look at the full stack
for intelligent air systems and flight
autonomy so the skills that you build
there are I think really applicable
nearly everywhere in modern technology
companies and that you'll be learning
about machine learning control
estimation software development robotic
systems autonomy
so with this skills you can potentially
apply them outside of the field if you'd
like then beyond or perhaps within that
there's the aviation sector which even
if you're not looking at you know flying
car startups it's already we see that
autonomy is disrupting a lot of these
current systems I mean if you look at
planes for example already the plane
that you take to fly across the country
it's already flying itself for most of
the trip and even during takeoff and
landing where a pilot is involved it's
already leveraging technology and
autonomy a lot so there's there's all
these jobs outside of aviation there's
even kind of like maybe old-school
aviation that is being disrupted by
these technologies and then we do think
that the drone industry is already
growing really rapidly and especially in
Silicon Valley we see that the flying
car industry is taking off really
quickly and having Sebastian involved in
this program especially we're able to
get kind of an inside look at how these
companies are growing what they need
what engineering talent shortages
they're seeing and how our students can
plug into this now and certainly in the
future so so that's a bit about careers
there's all this stuff that you'd acity
offers all of our narrow degree students
and for flying cars specifically we
think that there's an existing industry
and a really rapidly growing smaller one
in flying cars and drones so that's
that's just to speak a bit about career
specifically because we know that that
is what a lot of students care about so
again if you have any questions feel
free to shoot them over now or direct
message me on slack or ask our community
so I guess now we'll we'll move on to a
bit more Q&amp;amp;A so I mean I guess the very
first one says specifically what career
opportunities will be presented after
the nanodegree program I think we we
just spoke a bit about that but to be
even more specific I think you know
autonomous system engineer software
engineer at all of these drone and
flying car companies in the valley
really even like data mining and machine
learning positions at these companies
like there are a lot of software
positions in aviation as a whole and in
this growing community so I think all of
those positions when you look at our
curriculum you're gonna be super well
prepared for any
those positions see next year yeah so
another one we have is what is the
status of the flying car industry in
Silicon Valley and when will it take off
so I think it's really interesting
talking to Sebastian on these issues
because what he has seen and what he
makes very clear when he's talking about
drones and about flying cars is that
there's not there's not any kind of like
big science risk there's not huge
unknown technical risk in this area so
the basic science of how things fly is
pretty known the hardware to get things
to fly is pretty known and the software
to do so reliably is pretty known but
the thing that is perhaps missing is
more of the system level innovation
where you take all these known elements
and you combine them and you show how
building higher-level intelligence on
top of that can provide a reliable and
robust transportation mobility system so
I think that's the stage that we're at
right now in Silicon Valley and abroad
where we're seeing a lot of these parts
being put together and it's like it's
kind of a lot of simultaneous invention
where we see certain kinds of VTOL
designs certain kinds of imagine systems
and we're seeing these tackle really
important problems so it's it's kind of
putting these things together and really
starting to take off into hopefully very
consumer focus facing offers soon
because I think that's that's a huge
thing that will be important for the
industry in the next coming years is to
immediately start to show value in
perhaps like emergency response or even
ecotourism or these things so that
people can immediately start to see how
drones and flying cars are not far out
but actually really immediately viable
and super compelling
okay let's see here
okay so an interesting one here from
James walmsley is is the flying car
capable of instrument only flight or low
to zero visibility so I think so first
of all when we say the flying car it's
important to realize that say unlike
large jets for commercial airlines the
flying car industry has not really
converged on a single design so even for
even for the same mission different
companies are coming up with different
solutions and then as I think as the
field matures we'll see four different
use cases convergence on different
designs so there's their whole bunch of
flying cars but until your question
specifically will be able to fly with
low visibility it's actually really
interesting I think for flying cars it's
easy to generalize from self-driving
cars and just say like okay it's a it's
a big robot it needs to move
intelligently so it's got to have this
like spinning lidar system and these
cameras and everything and just think
about it as a similar kind of robot but
in the sky but when you when you think
broadly about the different missions
that these two kinds of robots have to
accomplish on the ground there's just
like so much stuff that you can hit so
for self-driving cars it's really
important that they be able to have
really powerful computer vision and
sensor fusion systems so that you can be
sure not to get these things in the sky
there's there's not as much to hit so
you don't need to have a vehicle decked
out with as much sensors so in the sky
it's it's much more a situation of being
able to coordinate these different
systems and making sure that so to
answer the question maybe even if you
just have like one camera or potentially
even no cameras to start can you fly
very safely so I think if there's really
bad weather and low visibility it's
really important that they still be able
to fly and I think it's also very
possible that they'd be able to because
unlike the self-driving car system we
have the bill
to kind of build this one from the
ground up so yeah I think I think there
likely will be uses of perception
especially for obstacle avoidance and
for precision landing but I think that
we absolutely will see vehicles that can
fly even in the absence of strong data
from those sensors okay a a question
here from Dmitry is how much overlap is
there with a self-driving car in an
degree program so this is a good one
it's one that we've heard a lot
obviously a lot of self-driving car
students are potentially interested in
the flying car nanodegree and the the
kind of messy answer is that there there
are definitely commonalities and it's
for those I think a really great
opportunity to strengthen your skills
and say if you're interested in
self-driving cars really build your
resume and your experience and
autonomous systems and there's also a
lot of really specific different
considerations when you're in the sky as
I just mentioned with perception the
main challenge for flying cars is not
necessarily being able to see a woman
flying across the sky because there are
no such obstacles in this guy so
concretely I think in this program the
first term is going to touch on certain
foundational elements of any robotic
system so in that way there will be some
things that you'll have the opportunity
to practice that you may have seen in
self-driving car or in the robotics
nanodegree program but you'll already be
seeing new considerations when you're
building something that's flying in
three dimensions and when you're
developing using software tools that are
used for flight so already in term one
you're gonna be seeing some some similar
things and some very different things
and then I think term two is where we
really can see that it's it's pretty
wildly different than self-driving cars
because the the things that we're
thinking about then after you've built
that foundation is how do you build a
flying car what kind of hybrid design
you use between fixed wing and rotary
aft and then okay you have all these
vehicles they're all traveling at let's
say 120 160 miles an hour you can't just
break in the sky so how do you how would
you design a transportation system if
there were a minimum speed limit and you
all have to keep zooming and if there
are unpredicted things that pop up how
do you make that system robust so this
starts to be where it's not just the
same kind of a planning control
estimation but this guy but entirely
different considerations if we're going
to build the future of Transportation
and do so in the sky so I think it's a
really exciting opportunity to build on
what you know and learn about entirely
new things all right Musab here asked
are we going to be using mostly Python
or C++ so again we will be offering a
bit more detail on this in the coming
days but I think the the SPARQL version
is that the development cycle here is
going to look like look like one where
you start in the classroom and in the
classroom what's really important is
that you get the principles you get the
concepts you understand them and that
you can kind of play with things to
really tink around understand what's
going on so there you'll be coding in
Python and you'll be using a really nice
responsive pretty visualizer with unity
and that will all be in the browser so
there'll be kind of no messiness of
getting things set up or any anything
like that it's just gonna be a really
excellent learning tool and a really
exciting excellent learning environment
then from there for for those topics
that can stay kind of high level if
they're more planning mission
optimization fleet coordination you will
continue developing in Python but for
those projects where it's important to
do more real-time stuff it will be
important to actually transition that
code translate it from Python to C++ so
in
if the first phase is Python in the
browser second phase for those will yes
B C++ and a simulator that's a bit more
stripped-down but it has has more
accurate physics and is also just a
better environment to do like really
real-world testing and then if you
choose to port to hardware the the C++
is really important too because if you
want to get code on your autopilot then
you're not going to do so in Python so
there's gonna be this this combination
of of languages in accordance with the
use case that you'll be tackling all
right I kind of fun one especially given
my background here from Mohammed Kazim
is what is the research future in this
area if I want to pursue a PhD in this
area so I I can't say that I'm I haven't
been doing PhD research in flight for
for a while I think really excellent
resources for that one are going to be
our rock star lineup of professors so we
have Raph d'andrea who's a professor ETH
we have Angela show Luke is a professor
at University of Toronto we have Nick
Roy MIT we have Sebastian at Stanford so
they have all turned out some of the
deleting research in this field but I
can tell you just in looking at what
they do and talking with them there are
there are a lot of really interesting
low-level problems in order to get
drones to do really interesting things I
I think nowadays there are even more so
really interesting system innovations
similar to what are required to make say
the flying car industry take off there
are really interesting research problems
when you start to think about how in the
case of rapid Andrea's lab for example
how can you get multiple flying robots
to be able to coordinate hit a ping-pong
ball back and forth or construct a
building together or do some kind of
actually creative things like
like perform alongside Peter as RAF has
done so I think there's all these
systems innovations I think Angelo's
doing a lot of really interesting stuff
using machine learning for more
efficient and reliable controls problems
so I would actually point anyone who's
interested to go check out those
professor's pages check out their
publications and then also feel free to
hit me up or hit other people up in the
slack to hopefully start some
conversations about what we what we
think is interesting in that area all
right
next up okay so a I'll give a partial
answer to this one which is is there any
element of GPS denied flight in the
course this mode is required for a large
portion of drone based solutions that
can be offered to clients and that is
from Newman and Eve so right now given
the the focus on on both flying cars and
drone delivery systems and emergency aid
providers a lot of these use cases
actually are going to assume that you
have GPS because their outdoor systems
where that's really going to be how
you're you're localizing and how you're
trying to deliver your solution
we are talking about adding on some GPS
denied content to the first term because
we know that for indoor robotics which a
lot of people are interested in that you
will be denied GPS and that you will use
computer vision and sensor fusion to do
your localization and your motion
planning so the answer is that right now
the main focus is going to be in problem
settings where you where you do have GPS
but we understand that students are
interesting that we'd love to hear from
you guys what you want and if people are
really interested if we if we're
definitely seeing a strong industry
demand for it then we you might see us
adding this GPS denied focus
okay so I guess if I combine a couple
questions here from Alex in from Audrey
there's questions about do you need
background and knowledge in robotics and
also do you need the background in
physics so I think our what our
prerequisites state is that you need a
pretty solid background in programming
and then software so you need to be very
competent say with at least one language
preferably preferably Python or C++
since that's what we'll be developing in
but I think if you've had a lot of
experience in any language then and if
you're eager to learn you'll you'll
probably be able to do really well in
this course so so that's a prerequisite
in terms of physics we we do require the
students have a basic understanding of
advanced math math and physics so you'll
need to learn you need to know some
about probability statistics linear
algebra and yes physics but if if it was
like you learned in high school and in
college and you understood those back
then you're just a bit rusty I I think
you'll do really well just with our with
our curriculum that will help you brush
up on those things a little bit and and
if if students need additional help just
brushing up on those things I think will
absolutely be able to support that if
you just haven't seen these physics
principles at all it might be a bit
tougher but I think you'll be able to
manage if you have some familiarity and
similarly with robotics we again want
you to have really strong competence in
programming but if you haven't developed
specifically for robotic platforms this
program will still be something that you
can tackle and succeed in so what's
what's really important is just that you
know how to cope with complicated
systems and then we'll teach you kind of
the tools that you use in robotics to
specific paradigms if you're not fully
familiar would say event-driven
programming well we will have these
exercise
that will build up and you comfortable
develop in these worlds okay let me see
if there are any other final questions
here
okay so I guess maybe end on this fun
one given a lot of the self-driving car
community here which is uh which is
gonna happen first self-driving car or
flying car so I think when I talked to
David silver and self-driving car what
he says for self-driving cars it's not
so much a question of when but where and
that self-driving cars are already being
trialed in certain communities and
they'll be perhaps even fully
operational pretty soon so if you look
at say voyage for example which is a
self-driving car company that spun out
of curiosity already there they're
working with retirement communities
because it's a community that the
value-add is very clear the navigation
environment is pretty controlled and
known they have the ability to map
things out really in high fidelity so
self-driving cars you already see in
certain environments flying cars also
flying cars and drones perhaps flying
cars we don't see large fleets that are
operational but I think we can kind of
expect them in certain use cases pretty
soon drones so already for example
zipline a company has a fully
operational fleet in Rwanda because
again they found a use case where the
value proposition is sufficiently
compelling for the customer in this case
the country of Rwanda to take that jump
and work with them and that's because
zipline works with emergency aid where
they shoot off fixed-wing drones they
fly very low powered they drop the aid
to where it's needed and they're able to
save lives using that technology so
already these things are are being used
right now and I think that the
interesting question will be in which
which needs States do these different
technologies address and for what kind
of scenarios are the different kinds of
robots able to most optimally solve
these problems and in the future I think
we'll actually see solutions that are
even hybrid where there could be a robot
on the ground a robot in the sky that
are either collaborating or one of the
so I think there might seem some tension
but I think it's actually a really
exciting place well they'll both be
succeeding and doing cool things so I
guess that's a that's maybe all the time
we have right now for some questions but
I definitely encourage everyone who is
here to continue the conversation our
slack community to ask us questions you
can ask me questions directly and then
really iterate again how we're super
excited about this program we think that
for anyone interested in flight autonomy
and flight systems this is going to be
really useful knowledge really
applicable knowledge and will help
students build a career in the area so
applications are closing very soon this
Wednesday February 7th at midnight
Pacific time so if you're excited about
it and interested in being part of the
inaugural class please do check out that
site apply today and we really look
forward to seeing your application and
hopefully you see you in the classroom
so thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
