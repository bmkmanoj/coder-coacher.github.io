may have looked like so in this version
of the experiment he ran through the
experiment five times in the first run
through when he led the ball to roll one
unit of time he measured a distance of
one unit after two units of time he got
4.0 339 point 0 7 and 4 16 point 18 now
he was a good scientist so of course he
repeated this process multiple times and
this is the date he got in each of those
following repetitions now with all this
wonderful data now he has to analyze it
but how does he take advantage of the
fact that he's collected each piece of
data multiple times presumably he wants
to find patterns in this data but how
does he use all of it he's collected it
he should use it all well the answer is
he takes the average and so I'll quickly
review when averages in case you've
forgotten or if you don't know to
calculate an average so for example if I
want to calculate the average distance
rolled in each of these units of time
and I've indicated average distance by
Adi with a bar over it and in physics a
bar over a letter generally means the
average what I'm going to do is add up
all my data and divide by the number of
data points so here I would add up 1.00
plus 1 point 0 1 plus OH point nine nine
plus point nine nine plus 1 point 0 1/5
because that's how many data points i
have one two three four five and when I
calculate that well I can average of
1.00 can you calculate the average for
the other three time measurements enter
your answers in these three boxes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
