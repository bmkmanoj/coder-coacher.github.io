is efficient communication across
address faces the client-server paradigm
is used in structuring system services
in a distributed system if we are using
a file server in a local area network
every day we are using a client-server
system when we are accessing a remote
file server and remote procedure call is
the mechanism that is used in building
this kind of a client-server
relationship in a distributed system
what is the client in the server on the
same machine would it also not be a good
way to structure the relationship
between client and servers using RPC
even if the clients and the server's
happen to be on the same machine it
seems logical to structure client-server
systems even on the same machine using
this RPC paradigm but the main concern
is performance and the relationship
between performance and safety now for
reasons of safety which we have talked a
lot about when we talked about operating
system structures you want to make sure
that servers and clients are in
different address spaces or different
protection domains as we have been
calling them even if they are on the
same machine they may be running on
different processors of an SMP but
they're still on the same machine what
you want to do is you want to give a
separate protection domain for each one
of these servers from the point of view
of safety but what that also means
because we are providing safety there's
going to be a head-on performance
because of the fact that an RPC has to
go across these address spaces and
client on a particular address face
server on a different address piece so
that is going to be a performance
penalty that you pay now as operating
system designers what we would like to
be able to do is to make RPC calls
across protection domains as efficient
as a normal procedure call that is
happening inside a given process if you
could make the RPC across protection
domains as efficient as a normal
procedure call it would actually
encourage system designers to use RPC as
a vehicle for structuring services even
within a same machine why is it a good
idea well what that means is that you
know we've talked about the fact that in
structuring operating systems a
microkernel you want you want to be able
to provide every service having its own
protection domain what that means is
that to go across these protection
domains you're making a protected
procedure call or an RPC call going from
one protection domain to another
protection to me and if that is going to
be more expensive than simple procedure
call it won't encourage system designers
to use these separate protection domains
to provide the services independently so
in some sense again is the same question
of wanting to have the cake and eat it
too so we want the protection and you
also want the performance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
