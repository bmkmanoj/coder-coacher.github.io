describe the work required to move a
bucket of mass M of a height H this is
the potential energy that a bucket has
once it's at this height for potential
energy we use the letter U and since
there's many types of potential energy
I'm going to use the subscript G term -
we're dealing with gravitational
potential energy now one thing I should
point out is that this height in this
equation seems to be really special out
of the bucket know its potential energy
should be related to its height above
what this water level why couldn't it
have been the height what could the
height of the negative as when the
buckets below some reference point in
fact all of these choices for our
reference zero-point of potential energy
whether it was here or down here or even
up here are totally valid where we
choose our zero-point is completely
arbitrary but once we choose your zero
point we have to be consistent while
we're solving a problem and you'll see
what I mean by all of this when we keep
solving more problems now of course the
question is why is this idea useful why
do I care about potential energy well
why don't we solve a problem that you
could not have solved ten minutes ago</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
