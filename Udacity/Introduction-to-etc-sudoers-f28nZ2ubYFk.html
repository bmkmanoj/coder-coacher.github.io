the student user let's try and run of
sudo command we'll try and run sudo cat
etc password we're asked for a sudo
password for the student which is just
the standard password we set for the
user when we initially made the user we
don't get this warning a student is not
in the sudoers file this incident will
be reported our student does not have
permission to use the sudo command so
let's fix that I've switched back to my
other terminal where I'm logged in as
vagrant this is a user we know can run
sudo commands they can perform
administrative tasks now the list of
users that are allowed to do this is
within the et Cie sudoers file let's
read that file using sudo cat et Cie /su
doors here we can see that the root user
is listed along with a few groups using
% and then the name of the group on some
systems you would just add the student
user just like this using a special
program called VI sudo that's allowed to
edit this file but on Ubuntu it handles
it a bit differently if you look at the
very bottom of this file there's a
directive here that says include dear
etc slash sudoers D this command tells
the system to also look through any
files in etc' slash suitors D and
include those as if they were written
directly within this file this is a
common pattern since distribution
updates could overwrite this file and if
that were to happen you would lose all
of the users you added by keeping your
customizations in this other directory
the system eliminates that risk let's
see what files are currently included in
that directory by running sudo LS ET c /
through D we see a file here called
vagrant and that makes sense since we're
actually using sudo here even though
vagrant was it within our etc' slash
sudoers file itself this file is being
included by this directory giving this
user the permissions it needs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
