collision we should have a longer hash
value now the question is how many bits
should we have in a hash value so that
it is not feasible to find two different
messages that have the same hash value
suppose the hash value has outfits then
there are two to the L then many
possible hash values according to the
birthday paradox we can think about we
have to do L that many possible
birthdays therefore if we have a square
root of two to the l that is true to the
l / to that many messages then there's
fifty percent chance that two of them we
have the same hash value in other words
the attacker only needs to search 2 to
the power of l divided by 2 then many
messages in order to find collision
therefore if l is 64 which means the
hash value has 64 bits then there are
two 264 there many possible different
hash values this means that the attacker
only needs to search to to the 32 that
many different messages in order to find
a collision and this is quite feasible
with today's computing power therefore
we need hash value to be longer than 64
bit therefore in hash functions the hash
value is at least 138 bits</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
