values we can do a few things personally
my favorite thing to do when I bring a
file in is to immediately run the field
summary tool on it to see details about
the data I'll add the tool in add
browses to it and run the workflow if we
look at the interactive output we can
open the window from the browser and we
can immediately see that there are
missing values across several fields by
the red part in this line here there are
missing data in all of the fields except
for the client ID field if we expand we
can see more details about the fields to
actually remove the blank value records
from the data set we add a filter tool
and filter where the value of contract
field is not null and then we do the
same for the industry and the average
number of tickets fields and then we add
one more filter tool for the last
variable which is number of employees we
also need to make sure that this is not
know and when we run the workflow we see
that we have a hundred and seventy five
records remaining another way to count
the number of records that come out of
the true side is to add a tool called
count records and when we run the
workflow the number of records passing
through is shown here 175 next we'll add
the scatterplot tools to the workflow
one for all of the data and the second
for the data with missing values remove
and then we'll run the results Oh to
browse window and look at the to scatter
plot side by side in looking at the to
scatter plots side by side we can tell
that but looking at the y axis that the
slope of the line has definitely changed
the scatterplot on the Left contains all
of the data and as you can see on the y
axis the slope goes up and over 100
number of tickets whereas on the right
side
the scatter plot is of the data with the
missing values removed we can roughly
calculate the slope of each line from
the scatter plots with all of the data
we can use the points along the x-axis
for 200 and 100 employees with 200
employees the average number of tickets
with all the data is approximately 20
tickets with a thousand employees the
average number of tickets is
approximately 105 the slope is equal to
the change in Y divided by the change in
X the slope of the line is approximately
105 minus 20 divided by a thousand minus
200 or 85 over 800 which is 0.1 one
using the same method for the scatter
plot with the missing values removed we
can see that the average number of
tickets for a thousand employees is
approximately 40 and 4 200 employees
that number is approximately 25
therefore the slope is equal to 40 minus
25 / a thousand minus 200 or 15 over 800
which is 0.02 the slope of the line has
definitely decreased let's see if
another imputation method will be better
for our analysis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
