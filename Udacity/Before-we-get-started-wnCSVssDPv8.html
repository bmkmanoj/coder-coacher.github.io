how to evaluate whether or not you're
ready to take this class to take this
class you should answer yes to all the
following questions first have you
already fulfilled your foundational
requirement for the program that's going
to give you experience receiving
educational technology which should
really be all the preparation you need
for the content of this course second
are you comfortable with writing this
course is going to involve several short
and a couple long essays so to succeed
you need to be comfortable writing
essays third are you comfortable with
the course it's going to evaluate
participation as a first class object in
the grading because this course is built
on the discussions and conversations
we're going to explicitly evaluate
whether or not you participated in the
course fourth them are you comfortable
with taking on a big open-ended group
project as part of your work for this
class or alternatively are you
comfortable with taking on a big project
all on your own because the goal of this
class is to produce something that set
an actual contribution to the
educational technology community the
scope of the project will be very large
so you need to be comfortable with that
kind of project for this course fifth
are you passionate about education and
educational technology do you already
have some ideas for the kinds of tools
you might want to build or the research
you want to conduct because this class
is built around the project and because
you'll specify your own project it's
really important that you be invested in
what you're working on and lastly are
you comfortable with a class that's
really built on these big open-ended
student-driven projects in this class
you're going to propose your own project
executed and delivered at the end of the
semester the requirements will be very
fuzzy the grading will be very informal
and there's not really a schedule of
what you need to do or watch or read and
when and that kind of structure can be
very frustrating for some students now
before we move on let's also talk about
the things that aren't required you'll
notice that I didn't ask any questions
about programming ability and in fact
you can take this class and you can
complete this class without writing a
single line of code by doing research or
user testing or design and note that I
also didn't ask if you have experience
with educational technology this class
is built so that the only real
experience you need is the experience
you've already gotten in the LMS program
so you don't really need either of those
things to succeed but you do need to
answer yes to the previous questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
