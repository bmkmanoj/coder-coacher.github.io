adapting cases this method uses
heuristics expressed in the form of
rules a heuristic is a rule of thumb
let's take an example imagine that you
went to a new city and you want you to
find out where the downtown was but how
could you do that a simple heuristic is
that you just look around and you find
with the tallest buildings are at least
in North America the tallest buildings
tend to be in the center in the downtown
of the city and this heuristic doesn't
work all the time I'll say North America
this realistic sometimes fails and
that's the point a heuristic is a rule
of thumb that works often but not always
to see how the heuristic method works
for adapting cases consider a problem
imagine that we're at a restaurant and
we need to go back home
recall that we just found a solution for
going from the home to the restaurant
having foundered solution having
evaluated and executed it we stored it
as a case in memory so now when we have
to go back from the restaurant at the
home we can retrieve that previous case
of going from home to the restaurant
given a new problem and a case how do we
adapt the case to achieve the new
problem in this case we may have a
heuristic which says that to go back
from where you came originally you
simply have to flip back all the tones
this might give us a solution that is
shown here
note that this heuristic men are always
work a su rule of thumb it works often
but of course we know that we cannot
reverse all the turns all the time so to
return to our programming example we
were doing file input and file input is
often a very resource intensive process
so let's say I'm designing a new program
and for this new program efficiency is a
much bigger concern I might have a rule
that says when doing file input it's
more efficient to read entire arrays of
data at a time instead of just reading
one byte at a time the previous case
that I'm adapting might have had file
input as one byte at a time but I'm
going to use that rule to adapt the case
to read arrays of data at a time so in
that way that rule has helped me design
a file input method that's more
efficient David to generalize on your
answer to design designers often use
heuristics of the kind that you
ancient for example if you want to make
an artifact lighter try a different
material there's a heuristic expressed
as a rule</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
