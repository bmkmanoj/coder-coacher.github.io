problem report what happens next any
problem database like bugzilla the
problem goes through a number of stages
initially the problem port is
unconfirmed if all the information in
the problem report is valid then it goes
into the new state that's when a manager
or the software change Control Board
assigns the bug to an individual
developer who now works on it the
developer now resolves the problem and
for resolving the developer can choose
between multiple resolution it can be
fixed we need meaning that the problem
has actually been addressed the problem
can be marked as a duplicate meaning
that the problem already exists
somewhere else in the database and
therefore possibly somebody else is
already working on it the problem can
have a resolution of invalid meaning
that the problem is not a problem or
does not contain the relevant facts a
resolution of won't fix means that the
problem will never be fixed which is a
somewhat sad outcome for the one who
originally submitted it and then we have
works for me as a resolution meaning
that the developer could not reproduce
the problem note that if the bug report
is invalid or duplicate this may also be
found out at earlier stages and the
problem immediately gets resolved of
sorts if the resolution is fixed then
the fix would typically be verified by
the Quality Assurance team and as soon
as the final product finally ships with
the fix in it then the bug report is
marked as closed in case the problem
reoccurs again it goes into a state of
reopened and then needs to be reassigned
to a developer this can also happen from
the resolved state if additional
information becomes available for
instance that makes the original
resolution obsolete</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
