education and that basically means that
whoever you are wherever you are as long
as you have a computer and internet
connection you can learn so what I think
really makes nanodegrees stand out is
the fact that we're curating content and
we're developing curriculum to get
students jobs and we ensure that happens
by partnering with industries so
partnering with companies like AT&amp;amp;T and
Google and Facebook to design programs
that will help students fill open
positions that they're trying to hire
for what I think really makes
nanodegrees stand out is with video you
see someone with personality with
pizzazz and it just makes you really
engaged and want to learn we found that
a lot of students want to write iOS apps
that's why we created the beginning iOS
development nanodegree it can help those
students take that first step we try to
keep things engaging by allowing
students to work on actual iOS apps but
taking away all of the things that are
complicated so for example one of the
projects is a battleship clone which
we're calling pirate fleet in this
program we've done everything like build
the grid spaces and give them ship
images and the students will write the
code to actually put those ships on the
screen add hidden mines and then also
total player score they can then really
focus on their programming skills but in
an actual iOS app a lot of people that
I've spoken to think that in order to
write these great iOS apps that they
interact with every day they think they
have to be some kind of genius but the
truth is you really don't you just have
to just take that first step in coding
and that's exactly what this nanodegree
program is going to do
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
