exercise we set up an index I which will
it run over all lines if the coverage
array now I is running from zero to the
number of lines minus one however in
coverage lines are started with one and
not with zero so we check whether I plus
1 is in the set of lines covered for
that specific file name if the line is
in the set then we print out a star
followed by the line since the line
already includes new line characters we
omit this by adding another comma at the
end if the line is not covered then we
output a blank in front of the line
let's see whether we get a nice listing
together with the covered lines
unfortunately our webpage IDE strips
away all leading blanks but what we see
still is the executed lines prefixed by
stars and the non executed lines which
have no such prefix again we can see
that we do have a number of lines that
are not executed at all that is for this
particular input food without HTML
markup a coverage tool such as this one
can be very helpful in debugging as it
is in testing in testing you would like
to come up with tests that cover as many
execution features as possible so if you
see for instance that what we have
executed so far does not cover these
lines you may wish to come up with
additional test cases better coverage
tools would also count the number of
times a line has been executed or save
coverage that has been achieved so far
in a file and thus allow for
accumulating coverage over multiple runs
with different inputs for now however
we're going to use the computed coverage
for debugging purposes namely to find
lines whose execution correlate with
failure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
