contagious disease a straightforward
approach maybe to model individual
persons as either infectious or
susceptible
if one infectious and one susceptible
person meet there is a certain chance
that the susceptible person becomes
infectious - and then the first
infectious person as well as the newly
infected person further spread the
disease this seems to cry out loud for a
spatial model in which we take care of
the location of these persons that would
be complex luckily there is another way
this is a much simpler way of thinking
about such diseases the SI our model we
do not look at the spatial distribution
at all we simply say that our population
is made up of susceptible infectious and
recovered persons and we only look at
the total number of these persons
susceptible persons can get infected and
then become infectious the rate of that
process is controlled by the number of
infectious people the more infectious
people there are the larger the
probability is that a susceptible person
meets an infectious person hopefully
people are going to recover from that
disease so there's a process that takes
us from infectious to recover and in the
standard version of that model we assume
that the recovered persons are immune
and cannot be infected again so they
form a third compartment this is a much
simpler way of dealing with that problem
we forget about the spatial distribution
altogether and simply construct a
mechanical model if you will in which
the population consists of three
compartments susceptible persons
infectious persons recovered persons
depending on the number of infectious
persons susceptible persons become
infected and hence infectious and after
a while infectious persons recover and
we assume that recovered persons I Moon
against the disease and cannot be
affected again this is the si R model
susceptible infectious recovered</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
