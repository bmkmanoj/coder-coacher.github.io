told you there's just these those two
strategies but there's actually a bunch
of other strategies you can play against
tit for tat and it's worth thinking
through how do you compute a best
response to some finite state strategy
so tit for tat is a finite state
strategy and then it has these two these
two states and the strategies expressed
in terms of transitions between those
two states but in general if we have
some kind of finite set rata G like tit
for tat how do we figure out how to
maximize our own reward in the face of
playing against that strategy so in this
picture here that I drew the states are
labeled with the opponent's choice the
the finite state tragedy's choice okay
mm-hmm the edges that's in black the
edges and labeled in green here are
labeled with our choice so for example
if we're in this date of the sorry if
our opponent is in this state mm-hmm we
have a choice we can either cooperate or
defect on this round mm-hmm so the green
arrows tell us how that will impact the
state of the opponent and then these red
numbers I just I just added the
information about well I know that if
the opponent is about to cooperate and I
choose to cooperate I can just look up
in the payoff matrix that that's a minus
1 for me all right agreed so I just
annotated all these edges all these
choices with these extra numbers so one
of the things that's cool about this is
unlike just the payoff matrix
representation that we had before our
choice impacts the payoff which is the
same as that but it also impacts the
future decisions of the opponent and
that gives us this structure here and
also says that this is maybe a little
slightly harder thing to figure out
because of the fact that we can't just
maximize our with the number we actually
have to think about where that's going
to lead us in the future as well
so two things then one I was always fond
of saying that the matrix was all that
you needed but that really only made
sense when you were just playing once
yes that's right right and 2 I look at
this and it's a finite state machine but
you know it also looks like to me it was
like an MDP excellent it is indeed in
MVP now in this case my opponent's
finite state strategy is deterministic
so it's a deterministic MDP but it is
it's a discounted MVP gammas playing the
role the discount factor these the
entries from the payoff matrix are
playing the roles of rewards our action
is
the choice of the choice of our action
and the opponent's internal state
structure is playing the role of our
states so it is it's an MDP and so how
do we figure out what an optimal
strategy is against a finite state
strategy yeah exactly so so any any
method for solving an MDP can then be
used to actually compute the strategy so
what is the strategy going to look like
it's going to be a mapping from states
of the opponent to action choices for us
right but that's fine because I mean the
state is doesn't have to be your state
it's just what matters so what matters
in this case is what the opponent's
gonna do right so so now what are the
strategies that could be meaningful
against tit for tat so we could if we
cooperate mm-hmm
then we're gonna stay in this state and
it's always going to be the right thing
to do to cooperate so always cooperate
is one if we always if we defect now we
have a choice again so we could defect
from this state which would cause us to
defect forever so always defect is
another one but what's the other thing
that could happen well we could tit for
tat ourselves well sorta I mean so we
could defect so we could defect against
cooperate but cooperate against defect
which would actually cause us to do DC
DC DC so those are the only oh I see no
you're right I'm not sure how to say it
but the policy is defect when you're in
this state and cooperate when you're in
this state but the effect of that is to
go back and forth against tit for tat
right basically take this loop here and
those are the only policies that matter
and in this case we worked out that
always cooperate is good against tit for
tat if it has a high discount factor and
always defect is better if you have a
low dis come factor but we can get that
for real by actually solving the MVP and
the reason those are the only three if I
get this right the reason those are the
only three that make sense is because if
you think of this as an MDP then it's it
has no history so when you're in C
there's really only two choices and when
you're indeed there's only really two
choices so if you look at the way you've
drawn it you either stay where you are
in C or D or you take the loop and those
are really the only three options
because the rest of them would require
you remember what you did you know a
time step or two ago
and there's no way to do that in an MDP
at least not as you've written it well
there's a way to do it it just would
never be better than than doing it this
way so an MDP always has a Markov
deterministic optimal policy right so we
only need to consider those I think
that's the same thing that I was trying
to say but with different words okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
