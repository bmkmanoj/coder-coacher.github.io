Udacity the first we'll call form
exercises form exercises involve some
combination of traditional form elements
such as short answer boxes and
multiple-choice questions here's an
example this is a simple multiple-choice
exercise from knowledge-based AI here
also like one of the radio buttons at
the bottom then I'll click Submit I'll
see some feedback on the right and then
I can try again after I've successfully
completed an exercise the dot at the top
will change color exercises can get
pretty complicated for example here's
one from knowledge-based AI that
involves filling out several blinks note
that at first your only options are to
look at the instructions again by
clicking view instructions or to submit
an answer to move forward you must
attempt the exercise at least once
however after attempting it you may
choose to view the answer if you're
having trouble with the exercise note
that most of our courses don't assign
credit for exercise completion they're
really just here for your benefit but
some of the courses do make sure to read
your courses syllabus carefully to find
out if you'll be graded on your
participation in these exercises</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
