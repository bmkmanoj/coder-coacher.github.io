sort of how we go from sort of
adversarial mindset to being the
adversity and thinking about how to
exploit the humans or the other end well
I think what our adversaries do and you
want an adversarial mindset week so you
can form this this this thinking and
look for these vulnerabilities before
someone else does I think typically what
they'll do is they'll probe the
perimeter of a system looking for a
vulnerability and it's really on
multiple layers you can think of the
technical layer and if the system is
secure technically which is a very rare
thing but let's assume that's the case
or maybe they've decided the amount of
work the work factor involved to bypass
something technically just too expensive
in some ways then they'll go looking for
the ever-present weak link which is the
human and often times that by studying
to get the given users finding their
weaknesses themselves their personal
vulnerabilities those can then be
exploited so I tend to think against
well resourced and motivated adversary
that the adversary will always prevail
given enough time and resources to put
into it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
