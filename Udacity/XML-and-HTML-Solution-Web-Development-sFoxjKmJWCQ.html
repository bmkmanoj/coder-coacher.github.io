not true you know that there's despite
the similarity between the two HTML can
have things in it that are not valid in
XML the good example was the void tag
the BR tag with Noah no closer all XML
is HTML this is also not true but is
borderline acceptable you know you could
certainly if you had an XML document
that was full of all HTML tags it would
be very close to HTML and it'll actually
be probably render in a browser just
fine for example if you included in your
browser something like this and opening
and closing br tag it would actually
probably render it is fine actually
that's a good question I'd invite you to
see if this enters one new line or two
honestly don't know if the top my head
and I'm not going to quiz you on it now
the next answer HTML can be expressed in
XML that is true when we use the doctype
XHTML instead of just HTML that says the
following HTML document is actually
going to be a valid XML document and you
can parse it as such you know you don't
have to look for broken tags you know
you your browser doesn't can do less
work it's not expecting the HTML to be
somewhat sloppy as HTML often is if you
say it's an XML it better be an XML
though because the browser is not going
to be quite as lenient on you and the
final answer xml and HTML share common
lineage this is also true remember their
ancestor is sgml which stands for
standard generalized markup language and
it has you know there are actually many
other types of documents that descended
from sgml and HTML and XML are the two
that will affect our lives in this
course okay let me just show you some
doc types in the browser now that we
have a little bit more of a framework to
understand these so if I were to go to
Wikipedia and I were to view the source
of Wikipedia I would see that the
doctype is HTML and this this means
html5 I know it doesn't say five but
trust me on this one doctype HTML means
html5 which is the most modern version
of HTML we have now if I were to go to a
particular Wikipedia page the wikipedia
page for sgml for example and I were to
look at the source of this page we see
that the doctype is actually XHTML it's
actually XHTML transitional which
basically means
the documents going to be an XML but
we'll have some some non-standard thinks
I'm not going to get into too much of
how this affects things but it does make
some browsers behave differently why
wikipedia has two different doc types on
two different pages I cannot explain to
you although I can offer one guess which
is the sgml page is probably generated
dynamically and the front page is
probably a nearly static page that are
served from two different servers or two
different machines which is fine you see
things like this all over the internet
but when you see XHTML that means you
know every tag in here should have a
closing tag and you can see for example
some of these header tags actually have
are these little wojtek that have the
closing slashes and you wouldn't see
that in most html5 documents although
any browser would would accept it
because it doesn't actually hurt
anything</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
