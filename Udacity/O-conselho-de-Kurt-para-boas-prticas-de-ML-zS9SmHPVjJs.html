and don'ts to keep in mind in data
science I think I would mention two one
is a bit more qualitative and one is a
bit more quantitative so on the
qualitative side I would say the first
thing is any problem you're looking at
it's always very valuable I find to
start by thinking about what sort of
things do we know what what sort of
expectations do we have and what sort of
qualitative things can we get from an
exploratory analysis of the data so as I
mentioned using things like k-means
clustering and pca are a good way to
start to do some sort of dimensionality
reduction some way of getting the data
down to a point where you can look and
get some qualitative insights understand
the general structure of it and quite
often in in certain topics that we work
on you have some intuition of what you
would expect things to look like you can
start to see patterns emerging data that
you know that makes sense that that
either confirm or you know possibly go
against other theories or ingrained
beliefs that people have so so I think
getting data down to that point is very
important the more quantitative
suggestion I would have has to do with
trying to understand causal connections
so this is a very common thing that
comes up in building predictive models
you may have a number of features that
you put into a model to predict some
outcome and it's very very important
when doing that so often the question
comes up not just being able to predict
an outcome but understanding which
features are actually causing it it's
important to use a lot of caution around
that to never just sort of dump a bunch
of data into a model with lots of
features and then just naively look at
the things that have the strongest
weights in your model and say oh here's
what's driving it so it's very important
when you're asking those kind of causal
questions to proceed very carefully and
rigorously</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
