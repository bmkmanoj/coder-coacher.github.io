let's go over the first one first and
let's go back and take a look at the
code so most of these are arithmetic
operations and if you remember from the
RAM model that we've been discussing in
the lecture that according to the RAM
model we've been using all arithmetic
operations take constant time so that
means this this this and this all take
constant time the only thing that
doesn't is this for loop right here so
how many times does the for loop
executes well it executes based on n the
value of the input about square root of
n times and if everything else is
constant time and this tape executes
square root of n times well then we're
on the order of the square root of n so
we can go ahead and check this so this
next part is really pretty tricky and it
hinges on getting this first part right
so if you had trouble with this that is
totally understandable
so first let's remember that we can
represent n with a logarithmic number of
digits which is what D is what this
means is that N equals C where C is just
some constant that we're multiplying by
times 10 to the D minus 1 and as an
example of this let's say that n is
4,000 like we had before so 4,000 equals
C where C is something times 10 to the 1
2 3 4 D is 4 minus 1 is 3 and well then
that means that this has to be 4 4 times
10 cubed is 4,000 so this is how we're
representing n by D and C is just some
constant to make everything work out and
since this is Big O notation we're not
really that concerned with constants now
if we know this and we also know that
the algorithm has a running time of on
the order of square root of n when we're
talking about it in terms of n well then
we can put these together so square root
of n is the square root of all of this
and we're going to have to do a bit of
math here well we can separate these two
out to be square root of C times the
square root of 10 to the D minus 1 Wow
we can describe this by saying it's 10
to the D minus 1 over 2 since that's
exactly what square root is now we can
pull this out and so now we have these
nice three separate terms and again
since we don't really care about
constants we can just kind of get rid of
these we can say that square root of C
times 10 to the negative 1/2 is just
some other constant we don't really care
about called K since the only thing we
really care about is D so this is K
times 10 to the D over 2 and this is
exactly what we need to say what this
algorithm is in Big O notation and so we
can say that in terms of D the running
time of this algorithm is Big O of 10 to
the D over 2 now if you didn't get that
or if you had problems with it don't
worry about that that's really kind of a
challenging problem and if you still
don't understand it then I'd recommend
checking out the forums and discussing
it because this is really the kind of
basic math calculations that you're
going to have to do and part of the
problem here that a lot of people run
into is these constants that we just
drop or don't care about really and
that's the kind of thing that makes Big
O notation really very powerful that we
can just drop those and say we don't
really care you care about those in the
grand scheme of things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
