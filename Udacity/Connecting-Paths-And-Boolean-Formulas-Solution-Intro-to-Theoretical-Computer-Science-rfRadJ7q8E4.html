because the answer is 2 to the power of
n minus 1 the important thing to notice
here is the following so you still have
two possibilities of visiting this part
here so there's still two possibilities
and you also have two possibilities for
this part here and all the other ones in
between as well but hear something
interesting happens if we choose to
travel up here then down here then it
costs as one extra edge to visit clause
number one as opposed to if we had gone
from this vertex here to this one
directly so just one extra edge now
watch what happens if we go down here if
we were to visit this vertex immediately
then we are over here which means we
haven't yet visited these two vertices
here so we need to go backwards then up
here and then back something like that
so this is not going to be a shortest
path because we're starting to visit
cities multiple times and even if we try
to do it another way so maybe just with
the DCO first then we can't go down here
again because then we would again visit
cities twice also going over here then
up here then backwards through this also
we visit this city here twice so what
you can see is that on a shortest path
if we want to visit this vertex down
here then we must take this route if we
do not have to visit this vertex then we
don't have to take this route then we
can sell choose arbitrarily the number
of shortest path between a and B if we
have to visit that vertex has been
reduced and that is pretty neat because
that means we can only visit this vertex
here on a shortest tour if we are going
the right way and now you can already
see the relationship if we connect this
clause here to this part here which
represents a variable in the right way
so that we can only visit the city if
the variable is set in the right way
because we said going up here means true
going down here means false then we can
ensure that a shortest path from A to B
visits this vertex here which means that
we can also have a satisfying assignment
for this clause here and I'll illustrate
this for you in more detail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
