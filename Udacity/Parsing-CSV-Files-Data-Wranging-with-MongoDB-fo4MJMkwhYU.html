data wrangling for ourselves we're going
to look at parsing CSV files in Python
in this case we're going to be reading
the CSV data into our program and
creating one dictionary for each item in
that file so you might ask yourself why
would we do something like this why not
just open it in a spreadsheet
application one reason is because if the
file is big let's say tens or even
hundreds of megabytes opening it in a
spreadsheet application like Excel can
be slow inefficient or maybe even
impossible the rapp might do the
software equivalent of this another
reason we might want to programmatically
process tabular data is because we might
have a whole lot of files to process so
doing it manually in a spreadsheet
application simply isn't an option
alright let's take a look at the code
provided here you can see we have a
parse file application in this exercise
we're going to be working with the
Beatles discography data one more time
you'll be working in the parse file
function in the provided code and your
assignment is to use the Python function
split to parse each row into a
dictionary for each dictionary the names
of the fields will serve as the keys and
the value you find on a given row will
serve as the values for those keys you
should produce an array of these
dictionaries one dictionary for each
item remember and you should return that
array from the parse file function now
one final instruction here is that
rather than processing the entire file
you should only parse the first ten
lines in this file if you go beyond that
you run into trouble with this
particular data set since this is the
first exercise we're looking at in this
course let me talk a little bit about
this test function here we're providing
this as a means for you to test your
implementation of parse file this will
run a little bit of code which calls the
parse file function and sample the
result that it gets back from parse file
checking to see if it has the expected
values when you actually submit your
program we'll be running some different
test code possibly on a different data
set</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
