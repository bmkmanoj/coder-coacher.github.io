throw a couple more vocabulary words
into our mix first I much talk about a
special kind of expression in fact the
kind that we've seen most up to this
time these are polynomials a polynomial
is an expression made up of constants
variables or both that are combined
using addition subtraction or
multiplication so this basically means
that we have one or more terms like
we've talked about before added together
the variables in a polynomial also have
to have non-negative integer exponents
so as an example of a polynomial we
might have something like 5x cubed minus
one-half x y plus 7 or maybe Z plus 6 z
squared minus 7 plus 9x cubed plus eight
X to the fifth so some polynomials that
we see will have more than one variable
in them like these two right here but
oftentimes will also see polynomials
that have just one variable involved or
maybe even none so an example of that
might be something like 4 n cubed plus 3
n squared plus 1 but again any
combination of constants and variables
using these operators and only these
kind of exponents makes a polynomial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
