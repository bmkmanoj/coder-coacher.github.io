the extended format commonly used in
Linux each file on the disk has a data
structure called an inode associated
with it the inode is fixed length it
contains the metadata for the file and
it serves as the glue linking the data
blocks together in the right order it is
a scaling function that is the most
interesting the inode stores 15 data
block addresses or pointers the first
twelve of these point directly to the
first twelve data blocks of the file
this makes the strategy efficient for
small files the 13th of these addresses
points to a block that consists of a
table of addresses for the next blocks
in the file this vastly increases the
number of blocks that we can use in a
file the downside is that we've
introduced a layer of indirection if
this doesn't give the file enough space
then we use this fourteenth pointer and
not one but two layers of indirection
giving us even more space and if this
isn't enough we have a fifteenth pointer
which uses triple indirection for more
space still just like in fat directories
are treated as files only instead of
mapping a file name to the first file
block and map a file name to its inode
that path for accessing /foo slash file
dot txt would look something like this
we start at the inode for the root
directory and then following its data
pointers we find the data for the root
directory there we find that foo maps to
another inode following that address we
consult that inode and find the address
for there it's data block looking in
there we find the contents so / foo
that's a directory so it's going to map
the file name file txt to the
appropriate inode and then using that
inode structure we're able to piece
together the data that we need</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
