is that you start any company with an
operating plan and a financial model
what's an operating plan well it's the
business plan and the belief was all I
need to do is spend a lot of time
writing this plan and then all I need to
do is execute it and somehow magically
magical thinking said if I thought hard
enough and if I was smart enough to do
all the great market research in the
librarian and looking up all the data
and then put together a forecast the
magic 5-year plan in the back of the
business plan somehow magically all I
needed to do is hire the people to
execute that plan if that doesn't sound
silly to you now don't worry because it
didn't sound silly for 40 years but we
now know that's kind of ridiculous what
we now know is that no business plan
survives first contact with customers
the first years on a startup is
completely unpredictable now what you
think you're doing on Monday turns out
to be completely wrong on Tuesday and on
Wednesday you discover something new and
on Friday you're almost out of business
but on Monday you gets next Monday you
get sold for a billion dollars I start
up as an incredible rollercoaster
unpredictable series of events that
there's no way you could put together in
a five-year plan yet somehow investors
and educators thought that maybe we
could just teach you how to put this all
together in a nice spreadsheet
no one ever noticed that the only other
people to do 5-year plans were these
guys the Soviet Union and we kind of
know how well that turned out as well
though much like the fallacy about
business plans and financial forecasts
that lasted for about 80 years the good
news is and we now know that business
plans and financial forecasts first are
just as silly as it was in the Soviet
Union
so no business plan survives first
contact with customers this doesn't mean
we shouldn't have any planning but it
actually means what we need is planning
before the plan and what that really
means is you need to figure out how to
actually do some planning and then you
get to write the business plan so
be clear I'm not suggesting we never
want to do an operating plan and I'm not
suggesting we never want forecasts but
you need some real facts before you
could do them and one of the ways we're
going to organize our facts is with
Alexander Osterwalder z' business model
canvas will talk about this canvas in
some excruciating detail in the
following lectures but you should know
we use the canvas for two things one is
initially we're going to use it to
organize our thinking about all the
hypotheses about every part of our
business but second is we're going to
get out of the building and actually
turn those hypotheses into facts as
we'll find out how to do later and then
as we turn those hypotheses into facts
we'll be updating the canvas on a
regular basis and it will become a
scorecard a way to keep score for our
progress of how much we've learned so
what this means is instead of writing
the operating plan and financial
forecast first we're going to use the
business model canvas to actually
capture our hypotheses first for the
search for the business model we're
going to start with a model first and
then after we find the model we get to
write it up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
