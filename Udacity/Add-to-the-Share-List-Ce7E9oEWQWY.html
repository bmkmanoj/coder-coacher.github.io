but not the ability to share lists with
those friends I'm going to split up the
actual sharing code into two parts the
first thing we'll do is to Sibley keep
track of who is shared on what list the
second part is making sure that when a
user is shared they get a copy of the
list in their own user lists and then on
top of that whenever a list anywhere is
updated that all of the copies of that
list are simultaneously updated let's
start by focusing on this first part
okay so here we are back at the sheraton
flow and we're going to focus on the
show listactivity specifically because
we already dealt with how to add friends
what I press the gray plus button here
there needs to be a change in both the
UI of the share list activity and the
data in the database so let's talk about
what that change will look like well for
the UI that change is pretty easy I'll
see a green check next to the name of
the person that I just shared the list
with in the database you're going to be
changing around what is in the shared
with list we can see the change here
since I added Lila in shared with under
the same push ID as the list I've
interested in so right here we have the
user data for the user that I just
shared with so basically when you press
this plus button it should add that
users user data to the shared with list
for the shopping list that you're
sharing and again that shopping list is
specified by the push ID here and when
you press that button again it should
remove that user from the shared list
and put the UI back to the grey plus
button alright hopefully that's enough
for you to get started I'll send over
the spec right away</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
