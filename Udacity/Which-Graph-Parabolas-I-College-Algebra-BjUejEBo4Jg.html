parabolas even though they might not
quite look like it right now with a
little bit of rearranging though all of
these can be put into that general form
for equation of a parabola which you'll
remember is y equals ax squared plus BX
plus C where a is not equal to 0 now
this first equation 3x squared plus 3x
minus 7 equals 0 does not contain a y
variable the only variable has is X so
this is just an equation that we can
solve for x but it's not something that
we can plot there's no information here
about why that will let us graph on a
coordinate plane or at least not on the
kind of coordinate plane that we've been
interested in with two variables this
equation actually already is in standard
form the Y just happens to be on the
right side and the other expression on
the left side but you can see that a
equals negative 1 be the second
coefficient is 5 and c is negative 6
this one is also in standard form we
have a equals 1 B equals 0 and C equals
1 however the only requirement we had
about general form was that a couldn't
be 0 either of the other two constants
can be and we'll still get a parabola
I'll show you the grass for all of these
in a second but first let's look at this
last equation briefly the only thing
that's preventing it from being in this
general form is the negative sign in
front of the Y if we just multiply both
sides of the equation by negative 1 and
rearrange the terms on the right-hand
side we end up with the equation of a
parabola in the form that we can
recognize y equals x squared minus 2x
plus 1 now let's peek at these graphs
this red parabola down here is produced
by the equation y equals negative x
squared plus 5x minus 6 this purple one
corresponds to y equals x squared plus 1
and the orange is yellow one goes with y
equals x squared minus 2x plus 1 now
just take a second here and to think
about what's different about these
graphs and that's different about their
equations just form some ideas in your
head and keep them in mind for later
we'll keep revisiting a lot of different
kinds of parabolas and of course the
differences in their equations that
produce them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
