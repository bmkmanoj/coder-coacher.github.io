scanner here we're reading an integer
here we're reading a decimal number and
before we read anything we have a prompt
one prompt for the age one prompt for
the weight finally there is an important
piece that you've not seen so far look
up here this is what's called an import
statement as it happens the scanner
class is in a different location than
the classes that you've used so far that
location is called Java dot util it's a
utility class and we have to tell the
compiler that's the place to find it
whenever you use the scanner simply
place this statement at the top of your
code let's go ahead and run this the
console window pops up here is my prompt
okay I'm going to lie about my age here
now if that had been my age of course
the program would be right next year at
B 22 not much one can do about one's age
it does increase every year and I lie
about my weight too but I appreciate the
sentiment that hopefully next year it'll
be less that of these should be under my
control all right now you've seen how to
read input and I'd like you to do it in
another program
remember this program in which we added
a sunset effect to a photo now here we
used a value of 25 to increase the
redness it might be nice to experiment
with other numbers but instead of
recompiling the program with all sorts
of different numbers let's turn this one
into a user input now we can't put the
input statement here because this method
is called for every single pixel and we
only want to supply the infant ones so
here's the plan take out this constant
and add a parameter here then here in
the main method prompt and read the
input here before entering this piece of
code by the way don't worry about this
loop statement here we're going to be
covering that in a couple of lessons now
here is the place that the method is
called
that's why you should pass the added red
variable so that each time the read and
method adds that amount of red go ahead
and do that now if you have blue J it
would be best if you first develop the
program in bluej and then when you're
done put your result into the Udacity
IDE if you don't have blue J that's okay
just do it straight in the IDE but then
you won't be able to supply your own
input you'll have to live with the input
that Udacity gives you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
