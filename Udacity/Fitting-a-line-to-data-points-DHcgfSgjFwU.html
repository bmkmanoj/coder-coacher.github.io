this set of data and fit a line to it
using linear regression let's say we got
a line something like that and to look
at the statistics of that linear fit one
property is the slope when we fit a line
what's the slope of that line let's
assume it turns out to be 1 for this
particular stock and its relationship to
the S&amp;amp;P 500 this slope and financial
terminology is usually referred to as
beta with this symbol or just the word
beta and what beta means is how reactive
is the stock to the market so if beta is
1 and we have a slope here of 1 it means
on average when the market goes up 1
percent that particular stock also goes
up one percent if we have say a higher
number say two that would mean that if
the market were to go up one percent
we'd expect on average for that stock to
go up two percent there's another factor
you can see here when you look at where
that line intercepts the vertical axis
that is called alpha and you've probably
heard about alpha and investing circles
and what that means is that this stock
is actually on average performing a
little bit better than the S&amp;amp;P 500 every
day if that number alpha is positive if
it's negative means on average it's
returning a little bit less than the
market overall so that's how you can
plot the data fit a line to it
and measure a couple aspects of its
performance with regard to the market or
with regard to some other stock</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
