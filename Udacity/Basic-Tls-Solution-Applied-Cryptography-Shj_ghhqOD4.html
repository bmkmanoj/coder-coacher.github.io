client should send the random value
encrypted using the server's public key
both of the first two options assume
that the client and server already share
a symmetric key if this was the case
well they wouldn't need this whole
protocol they could use that symmetric
key right away to start communicating
and the fact that they're able to
communicate using that key verifies that
they have authenticate each other this
solution does not work well for web
applications there's no way for me to
easily establish a shared symmetric key
with Amazon before the protocol begins
the fourth choice would be useful for
integrity
if the server knew the clients public
key then it could verify that this
random value came from that client but
this would expose the random value to
anyone else who intercepted the message
and also knows the clients public key
and it provides no authentication that
the server is who the client expects so
the right answer is the third one that
we want to send the random value
encrypted so it can't be intercepted but
that it can be decrypted by the server
and the server has the corresponding
private key to decrypt this now once the
server receives this message it can
decrypt it using its private key we'll
use the value of R as a session key and
after this both the client and server
have the shared session key and can
communicate now we have a secure channel
between the client and the server
encrypted with the symmetric key Kay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
