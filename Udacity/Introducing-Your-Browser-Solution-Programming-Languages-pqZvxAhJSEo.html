rendered by the web browser you have
will have built by the end of the class
in this problem we asked you to generate
the HTML that creates this page a skill
in becoming a computer scientist and a
programmer is the ability to look up
information on your own we asked you to
look up a few of the tags that are used
here and figure out how they apply in
order to generate this page I will
briefly go over the tags that are used
to generate various parts of the page
and then I'll quickly show you the HTML
as a finished product every webpage
begins with and end with HTML tags to
use the level 1 heading we had h1 tags
we created paragraphs using the P tag
and we had two paragraphs we created
this unordered list unordered because
each item in the list is just a bullet
and not a number using the UL tag each
item in the list begins with an li tag
standing for list item within the list
item we can have another list in this
case it's an ordered list which is
defined using the olt standing for
ordered list in each item liked in the
unordered list is defined with an li tag
and now we have most of the structure
for this web page i'm going to go back
and highlight a few instances of tags
that change how the page looks for bold
we use B tags for talax we use I and
there's also small and big tags that
change how large or small the font sizes
we can change how the font looks with TT
tags one last thing the note for
changing how the text looks is the
strong and emphasized tag elements we
use the strong instead of bold when we
want to describe the meaning of the text
opposed to the formatting of the text we
went over how hyperlinks work in class
but as a reminder we put the text of the
link in between two anchor tags and we
set the target as the hyperlink
reference for an image we use the IMG
tag and set the source of the image as a
URL our relative paths to the image in
this case we've defined
CS 262 PNG in the same directory as this
page is being wondered for details like
that we recommend that you check out
Steve Huffman's class CS 253 now to look
at the finished product let's go quickly
to the IDE here I have the finished HTML
and it should look strongly similar to
what we worked out together with just
the output keep in mind that the HTML
that you created can look different in
many many ways for reasons such as
different white space and things like
new line spaces etc while the output at
HTML page looks the same</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
