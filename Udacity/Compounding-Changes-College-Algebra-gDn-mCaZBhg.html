grants interest is compounded just one
time a year if you invest that same
$10,000 at that same three percent
annual rate then after four years he'll
have this amount of money as we saw
before let's talk about what this means
this expression here ten thousand
represents the principal this initial
amount of money he invested and it goes
right here point 0 3 here is the
interest rate written as a decimal three
percent becomes 0 point 0 3 then last
but not least we have our exponent for
this represents the number of years that
the money has been invested in the
account now this worked fine for
compounding just one time of year but
it's not going to work as well for
compounding twice a year if we switch
the compounding to twice a year instead
of once a year then this is the
expression we came up with so what can
we say about comparing these two
expressions we've just seen I'd like you
to tell me that by filling in the
sentence when we switch from compounding
interest once a year to twice a year
what happens to the interest rate and
what happens to the exponent here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
