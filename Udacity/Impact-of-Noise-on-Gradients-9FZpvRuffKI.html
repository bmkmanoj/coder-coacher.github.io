throw a little bit of a wrench into this
whole analysis method we're going to use
a 1d example to help us understand this
imagine a 1d signal basically has a lot
of value down here minus 1 then a ramp
up and positive 1 you can imagine this
to be a simple signal that basically
could be an image which has black here
and white there and of course we're
scanning it this way and of course it's
some sort of blurry boundary between
them therefore the ramp of course now
the question is what happens when I
actually do a column by column that is
just in this direction a differential of
this there's a lot of noise here and you
can see some of the noisiness there the
derivative of this signal just the 1d
signal in its X will only be kind of
capturing the details of the local
differences and in fact when it gets to
this point here you can see a little bit
of change but not much and in fact by
looking at this you can imagine that it
would be hard to actually look for a
sudden change in gradient just because
it's mostly capturing the noise so
distance in essence it's really gets
harder to detect an edge when there is
significant noise in the signal
something we will have to start thinking
about how we can avoid</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
