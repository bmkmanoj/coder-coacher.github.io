what computation is with the goal of
eventually being precise about what it
can and cannot do we said that the input
to any computation can be expressed as a
string and we assume that whatever the
instructions there were for turning
input into output that these two could
be expressed as a string using a
counting argument we were able to show
that there were some functions that were
not computable in this lesson we're
going to look at how input gets turned
into output more closely specifically
we're gonna study the Turing machine in
the classical model of computation as
we'll see in a later lesson Turing
machines can do everything that we
consider as computation and because of
their simplicity they are a terrific
tool for studying computation and its
limitations massively parallel machines
quantum computers they can't do anything
that a Turing machine can't do Turing
machines were never intended to be
practical but nevertheless several have
been built for illustrative purposes
including this one from mike davy the
input to the machine is a tape onto
which the string input has been written
using a read/write head the machine
turns input into output through a series
of steps at each step a decision is made
about whether and what to write to the
tape and whether to move it to the right
or to the left
this decision is based on exactly two
things the current symbol under the
read/write head and something called the
Machine state which also gets updated as
the symbol is written that's it the
machine stops when it reaches one of two
halting States named accept and reject
usually we're interested in which of
these two states the Machine halts in
though women want to compute functions
from strings to strings then we pay
attention to the tape contents instead
it's a very interesting historical note
that in Alan Turing's 1936 paper in
which he first proposed this model the
inspiration does not seem to come from
any thought of an electromechanical
device but rather from the experience of
doing computations on paper in section 9
he starts from the idea of a person who
he calls the computer working with pen
and paper and then argues that his
proposed machine can do what this person
does so here I am a computer with my pen
and paper
and we'll follow Turing's argument that
his machine can do but I can let's take
an example he's talking about computable
numbers so I'll compute a very simple
number Alan Turing his age when he wrote
the paper so we'll take 1936 - 1912
which is equal to 24 he argues that any
calculation like this can be done on a
grid like a child's arithmetic book he
says I assume he means something like
wide rules graph paper he argues that
all the symbols can be made to fit
inside one of these squares then he
argues that the fact that the grid is
two-dimensional is just a convenience so
he takes away the paper and says that
computation can be done on a tape as
someone who has to carry out the
computation I don't much care for this
but I can still do my job then he points
out that there are limits to the width
of my perception so if I happened to be
reading a very long mathematical paper
the phrase hence applying this big
theorem number we have then when I look
back I probably wouldn't be sure at a
glance that I had found the right
theorem I would have to check maybe
three or four digits at a time crossing
off the ones I had matched so as not to
lose my place something like this so I
matched the first four then the next
four and so on and so forth eventually I
will have matched them all and can
reread the theorem now since Alan Turing
was going for the simplest machine
possible he takes this idea to the
extreme and only lets me read one symbol
at a time and only move right or left
one square on the tape at a time
trusting to the strategy of making marks
on the tape like I did with this theorem
here and my state of mind to accomplish
the same things as I would under normal
operation with pen and paper and with
those rules I have become a Turing
machine so that's the inspiration not a
futuristic vision of the digital age but
probably Alan Turing's own everyday
experience of computing with pen and
paper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
