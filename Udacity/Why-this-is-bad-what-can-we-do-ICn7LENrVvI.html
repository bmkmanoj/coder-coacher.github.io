situations like this where we don't have
data between two separate dates now you
might think gee let's interpolate and so
we would estimate what a line is between
those two dates and then fill in at each
point an interpolated value why not do
that well the the truth of the matter is
between these two dates
there was no trading there really was no
price for that data but if we're going
to do something like for instance
compute a rolling average or a mean over
that data and there's Nan's there
that'll wipe out our entire calculation
so we can't leave it empty
but we shouldn't interpolate it either
so here's what we might do one thing
that we can do is we fill forward going
from we go over all the data and when
there's some missing data we fill
forward from the last previous known
value so for instance if we were to do
that here we would get these values up
until that date worse it takes over
there we would fill forward here and
fill forward here now notice there's a
big gap between there but and there's a
big gap here but that realistically
reflects what was going on with the data
now the reason we do this instead of the
interpolation is is the following let's
suppose we were looking for patterns in
the data and we had rolled back time and
we were simulating history and let's
suppose for a moment we had this
interpolation and let's suppose were
right here in time and we're trying to
figure out what's going to happen next
we're looking for patterns and so on
we're actually giving ourselves
information about the future we're
observing that the price is going up so
if we were to make a calculation here we
would actually be peeking into the
future and that is not allowed we do not
want to do that so we need to stick with
only filling forward a last known price
if we do that then
not peeking into the future so let's get
rid of that ugly nasty peeking into the
future okay so now we've actually filled
in all our gaps and we have continuous
data from this start point all the way
to the end however there still is
missing data here at the beginning and
because we need some value here in order
to calculate rolling averages or
whatever sort of statistics we want to
do it's better to have some value here
instead of not a number and in this case
we fill backwards so remember if you're
going to fill your data to resolve
problems with gaps fill forward first
and fill backwards second that way
you'll avoid to the max extent possible
peeking into the future now we'll hand
it over to Dave and she's going to show
you how to do this in code here's to you
