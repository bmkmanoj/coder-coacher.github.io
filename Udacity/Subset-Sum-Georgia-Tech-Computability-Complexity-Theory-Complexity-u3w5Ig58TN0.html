have to define the subset-sum problem
first we're given a multi set of numbers
a consisting of numbers a1 through a.m.
where each element is a positive integer
a multi set by the way is just a set
that allows the same element to be
included more than once so this set
might include three fives two 20s and
just one 31 for example and we're also
given a number K the problem is to
decide whether there is a subset of this
multi set whose members add up to K one
instance of this problem is partitioning
and I'll use this particular example to
illustrate imagine that you wanted to
divide assets evenly between two parties
maybe we're picking teams on the
playground trying to reach a divorce
settlement dividing spoils among the
victors of war or something of that
nature then the question becomes is
there a way to partition a set so that
things come out even each side getting
exactly one half in this case the total
is 18 so we should choose K to be equal
to nine and ask if there's a way to get
a subset to sound to not and indeed
there is we can choose two ones and a
seven and that will give us nine so yes
so we're choosing four and five of
course that's the subset-sum problem
note that the problem is in NP because
given any subset it takes polynomial
time to add up the numbers and see if
the sum equals K finding the right
subset however seems much harder we
don't know of a way to do it that's
necessarily faster than just trying all
to to the M subsets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
