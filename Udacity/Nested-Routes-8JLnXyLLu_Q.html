shows nothing a menu view and an item
view let's say that an item has stats
like nutrition facts but we only want to
show them if the user wants to see them
better yet what if we wanted to send a
link to a friend that takes them right
to the strawberry puddings nutrition
facts we can do all of this with embers
nested routes embers nested routes are
really powerful and make building
seemingly complex applications well
actually pretty easy when I think of a
template I think of just a chunk of
standalone HTML ember templates can also
be thought of as containers the base
container is the application template
and contains all other templates any
site wide HTML should go in here like a
sites header navigation and footer the
menu template is contained inside of the
application template and the item
template also goes inside the
application template we want to create a
nutrition template that's contained or
nested inside of our item template
everything starts with the route and
that will be item and then the dynamic
segment which will be the menu items
name and then nutrition how does ember
know how or where to insert the item
template into the application template
or nutrition into item we'll look at
that after we generate the nutrition
template let's create the nutrition
route and have it nested inside the item
round again ember CLI updates the router
and creates a route file and a template
in a new item subfolder notice that
nested routes are created inside a
function that's been added as a last
argument to the containing round let's
add some content to the nutrition
template and let's add a link in the
item template to the nutrition view
fantastic the apps really starting to
come together the application template
contains item an item contains nutrition
do you see these here this tells ember
to insert nested templates right here
you can do anything with this code
though move it anywhere you want put it
inside HTML or even delete it careful
when deleting them though if I delete
this one the no other templates will
show up since they don't know where to
be nested
so I'll return each one to the way it
was</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
