overview of the course and motivated the
need for software engineering in this
lesson we will present and start
discussing several traditional software
engineering lifecycle models we will
talk about their main advantages and
also about their shortcomings we will
also talk about classic mistakes in
software engineering that is well known
in effective development practices that
when followed tend to lead to bad
results and covering those will
hopefully help us to avoid them in the
future and because in this lesson I will
discuss some fundamental aspects of
software engineering to suitably
introduce these topics I went to the
University of Southern California to
interview one of the fathers of software
engineering professor Barry
I do it do next and how are my do it
because there are a lot of different
ways you can make that decision I need
to figure out which models were good for
which particular situation good book
that's called balancing agility and
discipline under what conditions
analyzing the situation planning
new alignment
typically if the project is small where
it's three ten people Angela works
pretty well
300 people
an effect on the defect is lost effect
or a limited funds and the advil is fine
loss of life then you know
on the other hand if you have a
situation
in some cases you may have a project
where you want to do waterfall in some
parts and agile and others have so these
are the kind of things that make the
choice of lifecycle process model very
important that very interesting in the
subject to insert</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
