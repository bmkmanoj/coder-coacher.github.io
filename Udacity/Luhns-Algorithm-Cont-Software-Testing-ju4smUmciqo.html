little bit more detail so remember that
what you're writing is a random tester
for a credit card transaction processing
system so the core of this random tester
is going to be a function called
generate which is what you're going to
implement generate is going to take two
parameters the first one is the prefix
which is going to correspond to the
issue or identifiers and this is a
sequence of digits which is given to you
which has to appear at the start of the
credit card number that you're
generating second parameter is a length
that is to say an integer parameter that
determines the total length and digits
of the credit card number that you're
going to generate so job then is to
construct a credit card number which has
the given issue or identifier or prefix
has the required total length as
completely random integers in the middle
here and has a valid checksum digit is
computed using one's algorithm plus this
little procedure for turning a lunch
exome into a digit which makes an
overall credit not credit card numbers
checksum come out to be zero and
therefore be valid so let's just look at
code quick so what you're writing is a
function called generate it takes the
prefix and the length and so your code
is going to go here and so we might call
it like this we might say the prefixes
3725 42 so this happens to be the prefix
for a credit card that I have in my
pocket and a 15 digit credit card number
and now you're going to create a valid
credit card number with the required
properties to do this you're probably
going to want to implement a function
called lunch exome which computes the
check sum of a number and this auxiliary
function is long valid simply checks if
the lawn checksum for a given input is 0
so what I'd like you to do is implement
that now and if you get totally stuck if
get totally stuck and you'd like a
little and you'd like kind of a hint
there's something you can do which is
look up luns algorithm on Wikipedia and
the reason that's kind of cheating is
because on this week a pd a-- page for
Ron's algorithm they actually give you a
Python code that works and so don't go
there unless you actually want to see
the real answer okay so take a few
minutes now write the code and what our
API will do is use it to generate a
number of credit cards and check if
they're valid if they're not valid it'll
tell you what the it'll give you some
indication of what the problem is and if
they are valid then it will tell you at
the end and you can move on to the
solution before I let you go hack on
this I just want to give you a quick
reminder about something that should
save you some trouble so in the
discussion I did hear about luns
algorithm I assumed that new digits were
numbered starting at one so for example
number one here is an odd number digit
this is digit number two which is an
even number digit number three is odd
etc now on the other hand Python strings
are indexed starting at zero so that's
something you're going to have to watch
out for or else you're going to get a
little off by one error in your code
that makes it a pain to debug</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
