extend your existing app or game or
create new ones just for the big screen
the most important thing to remember
here is that it's Android it's the same
platform you already use to build your
phone apps in fact most of that code can
be used for the TV app as well it can
even be in the same apk here are the
differences first you've got to declare
the activity that's intended to run on
the TV this is done in the manifest
second you want to update your UI to use
the Leanback support library it's not
strictly required and if you like making
things hard on yourself then don't use
it for the rest of us interface widgets
such as browse fragment details fragment
and search fragment make building a
great TV you I fast and easy the third
and final step is to make your app and
content available to the user in the
first step you will have declared the
Leanback launcher intent filter so that
your app shows up in the apps row on the
home screen to have it show up in the
games row instead you just need to set
is game to true in the manifest there's
also the opportunity for your content to
appear in the recommendations row or
through search the recommendations row
is a central feature of the home screen
it gives users quick access to dynamic
and relevant content is essentially a
bunch of cars that represent a system or
app action notification activity or
piece of media will show you a little
later how to get your content shown here
search is important too because users
often have specific content in mind and
browsing for that content is usually not
the fastest or easiest way to find it
however you can add a search action in
your app which you should do but why
stop there we'll also show you how to
get your content and Android TVs global
search as well that's it three major
steps to getting the great experience
for your content on Android TV declare
your activity use the Leanback library
to make everything look and feel as it
should on the TV and then integrate with
recommendations in search</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
