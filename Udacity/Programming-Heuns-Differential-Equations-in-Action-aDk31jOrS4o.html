rather than with force because
acceleration is already offered by the
rest of the program and I said before I
can reuse one of these accelerations
which is why I store the initial
acceleration in this variable called
well initial acceleration here comes
EULA as we know it these two lines and
then I formed the average of the
velocities to go to the next step and
they form the average of the
accelerations to go to the next step
and that's all if you run that program
you see two series of data the upper one
is the one that we know the arrows of
the forward Euler method and the lower
one are the errors of Horne's method and
you see these are really low so it's
really this method really works out on
top of that you see that this seems to
be a parabola
whereas Euler's method almost forms a
line here hans method forms a parabola
so it's good and it even gets better as
we shrink the step size there is a price
to pay
we call that acceleration function twice
if you look at what we get for that
price that really pays off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
