problems have been solved by just
selecting the correct architectural
style there are still some issues one
important one is that for real systems
big systems it may require more than one
architectural style we call that a
heterogeneous system you can imagine for
example that the system might have some
client-server elements it might have a
GUI and make it reactive it may be the
combination of a variety of different
approaches and the systems you still
have to have an architecture so that so
you have a single concept for how the
system is going to work secondly some
situations although they call for having
an architectural style style are very
domain-specific for example imagine in
the military context of a particular
kind of airplane it may be the case it
is the case that that airplane comes in
a variety of variants however the
control systems for the airplane is
pretty much the same across variants
that is it shares more than it differs
in this situation we call it a
domain-specific software architecture or
DSS a another term sometimes used is the
reference architecture that is the
reference architecture describes what's
common and then for any particular
variant the architects are responsible
for saying what those variants are and
how they're going to be dealt with the
third issue is one of semantics it's
easier for me it's easy for me to lay
out and say a client server is XYZ but
what exactly does that mean it's
important and as the field of software
architecture evolves to get more and
more precise definitions of what the
styles mean which will then enable reuse
of existing solutions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
