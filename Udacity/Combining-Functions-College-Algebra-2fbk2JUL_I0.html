shows p plus q the far right one shows p
minus Q and this for this left one shows
Q minus P and this is quite similar to
what we did before except at this time
as you can see both of our original
lines have non zero slope an alliance
happens pretty much the same way as we
did it before all of these additions and
subtractions can happen the same way
graphically as we dealt with them before
it just feels a little bit more
complicated because our lines have
nonzero slopes adding the two lines
works just as it did before and we can
see that connecting these lines gives us
what looks like the middle graph because
we're adding different length lines to
all these different points along the
graph of Q we're going to end up with a
line whose slope is different from
either p or q now of course I could have
done this the other way around and drawn
lines up to Q and add it those two P by
the way would give us the same result we
can see however that switching the order
of subtraction changes the graphs that
we get</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
