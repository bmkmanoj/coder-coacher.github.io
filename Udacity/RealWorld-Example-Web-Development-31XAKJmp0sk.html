logged into my development gene machine
for Hipmunk we use Postgres as our
database and I'm gonna log into that
database right now psql is the Postgres
command okay and we have a table for our
hotels for our hotel search product so
we can say select count star count is a
sequel command for counting the rows in
a table from hotels okay so you can see
we have three hundred and two thousand
rows in this table okay so let's run a
quick sequel statement in this against
this thing we're gonna say select name
from hotels where ID equals five one
four nine two this is a hotel ID that I
happen to know exists okay it's called
the hotel Karl Steiner Steuben so one of
the things we can do in Postgres is I'm
gonna run the same command again the
same sequel statement again with explain
analyze and what this is going to do is
this is gonna run the query and then
explain to me what it did what this says
is that it did a sequential scan on
hotels that's our table named hotels
sequential scan on hotels filtering for
ID five one four nine two and it took a
hundred and forty two milliseconds to
scan that table of three hundred
thousand hotels and find the one with
the correct ID now if I already create
an index on that field on the ID field
things should get faster so let's go
ahead and create the index create index
Hotel ID on hotels ID this is the sequel
command for creating an index I'm not
going to quiz you on this but this is
what it looks like create index this is
the name of our index Hotel ID on which
table so in this case it's the hotel's
table remember that's that's the table
we're using and and then it takes in
parentheses which field we're going to
use and in this case we're going to give
it the ID so I submit that Postgres
creates our index and now let's run this
explain analyze command again so now
instead of doing a sequential scan we
did an index scan using Hotel ID that
was the name of our
neck's here on the table and in this
case we can see the total runtime went
from 142 milliseconds to 0.16 3
milliseconds that is a substantial
improvement and let's go ahead and drop
that index drop index hotel and will
rerun this command one more time to see
it slow again tada
we went from 0.16 three milliseconds to
a hundred and forty-one milliseconds so
that's just a quick real-world demo of
know what an index can do and it's
pretty handy that the Postgres database
will you know explain to us what exactly
is going on alright anyway let's move on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
