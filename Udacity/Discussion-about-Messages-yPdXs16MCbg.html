messages these are much simpler than
data items in that they encode simple
byte arrays and there are no guarantees
of delivery if you send a message and
the remote device is not connected or
out of range then the message will be
lost it's your responsibility to deal
with this and use messages in scenarios
where they can be lost without causing a
failure here's an example of how to send
a message you can see here that we use
the send message call this is a bit
different than data items and that we
need to specify the ID of the node to
send to a path representing the message
and a byte array of any content we want
to send note that you should ensure the
byte array is limited to about 100
kilobytes otherwise you'll get an error
code returned if you try to exceed the
internal limits so you may be wondering
about where we get our node ID from
there is a method called get connected
nodes that can return a list of nodes
that are available we use the a weight
method to make the call immediately and
it'll block until the list is available
to you this cannot be done on the UI
thread however because it blocks once a
weight returns then you can do a loop on
the list and do whatever you want with
each node ID such as sending a message
to each node using the previous code
that we just showed so these are the
building blocks for sending messages and
you can see the API is very simple how
do we go about receiving messages well
we can put that in our my service dot
Java file what we do is override another
method on message received which is also
defined in wearable listener service
similar to what we did for data items
this method is passed in a message event
and you can retrieve the path of the
message would get path and the byte
array using get data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
