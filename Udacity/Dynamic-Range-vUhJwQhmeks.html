let's first define the term luminance
luminance is basically a measure of the
intensity of light per unit area and
this is again kind of accounting for
also the light travelling in a given
direction so anytime hid light is
hitting any surface area the direction
it's coming in from and the luminous
intensity per unit square area of that
region is what we're looking for and
that's what the measure of luminance is
and it's cat measured in Candela per
meter square CD over M Squared to help
us quantify this let's look at the whole
range of luminance now I know we've in
the past always look at a black and
white image or a range of 0 to 1 or 0 to
255 in a different set of numbers but
now we're going to look at it in terms
of luminance on a surface or an object
or a scene and in this case let's look
at these values and again basically I'm
showing you this is a log plot going
from eight six four two zero minus 10
minus 4 and minus six so of course
that's why it kind of has a linear thing
but these are again numbers that are
much more in detail kind of showing you
things about what's happening in an
image and I've just now marked in this
range basically an indoor sunlight
sunlight is much brighter and in fact
there's even something much even
brighter than that indoor images would
have these types of ranges here so this
point is basically showing sunlight this
would be indoor these the kind of images
we looked at it if it the scene was lit
by just moonlight directly captured
that's what we would have and of course
this is starlight now one thing to note
the human vision system can measure
static contrast ratio that is being able
to kind of see the range at any moment
when i'm looking at a scene from 100 to
one so 10 raise to 2 1 and again the
human eye in a static case can also
adjust itself by about 6.5 f-stops
remember the term of f-stop
we looked at from the camera world when
we actually look at what would the f
stops and we looked at variety ways of
what happens and they basically means as
how wide the aperture is opening up that
allows us to capture more light or less
like depending on the size of the
aperture now I do categorize this in two
different ways 1 i'm talking about
static contrast ratio now another one is
dynamic contrast ratio that is meant
force the scene is dynamically changing
and in this case a human vision system
can actually do much better and in fact
we see a range from 1 million 10 raise
to 6 21 and basically this can be
captured with about 20 different f-stops
so notice the range goes from 6.5 to 20
when we go from static to dynamic now
the big difference that I want to point
out between static contrast and the
static scene basically is nothing is
changing or dynamic is when that the
illumination in the scene is changing
now this could be because the scene is
dynamically changing or somebody's
changing the lighting conditions and
this could be again the Sun is moving
around their shadows and stuff like that
so that's the difference of course human
eyes system as we've talked about before
is a pretty impressive bit of technology
and it can adapt quite quickly to
variety of shades and again something to
think about when you start thinking
about the human Sekot system and I
encourage you to look at that kind of
stuff on the web because allows you to
kind of adapt very quickly from one
brightness to the other now partly what
we are trying to do with this
representation of dynamic range is to
create images that will allow us to
actually capture dynamic range in one
static image that actually is somewhat
similar to what our human vision kit
system can do by moving our eyes around
in circles and stuff like that we can
see a lot of dynamic range and our eyes
adapt very much too bright in low-light
situations and we can see much more
detail of course camera as a present
cannot do this and that's one of the
questions for computational photography
is how do we kind of bring in the
computation to make it to the adaptation
to what it's seeing in the light and
being able to capture images and of
course at the end of it we want to
create sometimes a just a static image
that captures it you'll see more
examples of this as we continue talking
