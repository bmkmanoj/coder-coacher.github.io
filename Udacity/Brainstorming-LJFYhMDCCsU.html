at our possible inputs if we were to
take none or an empty matrix as an input
we return 0 because for sure there would
be no islands in this case but we could
also have this as an input so what I'm
thinking here is we start at the first
element that's a 1 so i'll probably want
some sort of island counter variable and
I'll initialize that there and increment
it by one and then I get to the zero and
that's not part of any island so don't
need to do anything there and I gets in
this next element right here so that's
actually part of the same island so I
need to keep track of what ones are part
of the same island hmm maybe what I
could do is I could look at the elements
on top and on bottom and then check if
they're part of the same island and then
keep track of that somehow yeah no
that's third approach but you know if
you're looking at that first element for
example there's another one below it but
there's nothing above it so what would
you do in that case all right because
since there's not a one above that we
probably get some sort of runtime error
so first I'd want to make sure to check
that there's actually an element there
before I check if it's a one or zero hmm
so I'm going to need to keep track of
the somehow maybe this is some sort of
data structure yeah does this approach
or the problem or anything you've been
walking through remind you of anything
yes since this matrix can sort of be
like represented as a graph this might
be a breadth-first search problem so
what i could do is when i find the first
one i can look at the elements around it
and i can add those elements Duke you
check if those are ones and then if
they're ones I could set them to another
number so they're marked as visited and
then I could keep going yeah that sounds
really great right so it looks like his
test cases came in handy when
brainstorming his solution sure did he
was able to use test cases two inches
way towards developing a solution
something else I noticed was that he had
great communication with the interviewer
he took the interviewers cues to guide
him towards the correct solution yeah a
big misconception that future interviews
can have is they think that their
interviewer isn't on their side but
really the interviewer is there to help
you and being able to take in their
feedback demonstrates your teamwork
skills not to mention it helps you solve
the problem sometimes an interview he
might get so nervous that he or she just
completely ignores the interviewer
suggestions this can be a big turn-off
for the interviews so what if the
interviewee was still stuck after
looking at his test cases and edge cases
well one thing that interview mentioned
was that this problem reminded him of
the breadth-first search algorithm often
different interviewees stuck on a
certain portion of the problem they can
begin to brainstorm algorithms and data
structures the interviewee may have
noticed that a graph can be represented
as a matrix and that a breadth-first
search algorithm would fit here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
