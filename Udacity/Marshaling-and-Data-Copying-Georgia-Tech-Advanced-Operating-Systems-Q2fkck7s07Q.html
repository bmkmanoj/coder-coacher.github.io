the overhead and marshalling the
arguments and the data copying just to
jog your memory marshalling refers to
the fact that the semantics of the RPC
call being made between the client and
the server is something that the
operating system doesn't have any clue
about so in other words the arguments
that are actually passed between the
client and the server has semantic
meaning only between the client of the
server the operating system has no
knowledge of it and therefore marshaling
is the term that is used to say let's
accumulate all of the arguments that is
there in the call and make one
contiguous Network packet out of it so
that we can give it to the kernel and
the kernel can send it out that's what
is being described as marshaling and the
biggest source of overhead and
marshaling is the data copying that's
gonna happen and I'll explain that in a
minute
potentially in doing the marshaling that
could be three copies involved where are
these three copies coming about well
first of all the client is executing
when a client is executing a procedure
all the arguments for the procedure call
that it wants to do is living on the
stack of the client and there is an
entity we've introduced this terminology
even before called the client stub and
the role of the client stub is to take
the arguments of the call which are
living on the stack and converted into a
contiguous sequence of bytes called an
RPC message so the RPC message has no
semantic meaning it is just a contiguous
string of bytes which you can pass to
the kernel and the kernel can then send
it out on the wire just like any other
message so that's the first thing that
the stub does and that's the first
source of overhead the client stub is
making the first copy from the stack in
order to create an RPC message now
remember that the client is a user
program so it is living in the user
space outside the kernel and so this RPC
message which has been created by the
stub it is part of the clients address
space which is living outside the kernel
so this RPC message is in users
pace and the colonel has to make a copy
of the RPC message from the user space
into its own buffer the kernel buffer
and that's the second source of overhead
the second source of copy in doing the
marshaling of the arguments so now it is
in the buffer of the operating system
kernel now the operating system can kick
the network controller and say hey go
ahead take this buffer send it all on
the wire to the desired destination and
the network controller at that point is
going to move the bits from this buffer
which is in the system memory of the
operating system into its internal
buffer using DMA and this is the third
copy that is happening the copy that is
done by the network controller using DMA
to move the bits of the RPC message
copied from the user space into the
internal buffer of the kernel and now
this movement is being orchestrated by
the hardware to move it from the kernel
buffer into the internal buffer of the
network controller so that it can then
get out on the wire so those are the
three copies involved in marshaling the
arguments of the call before it can be
put out on the wire and the copying
overhead is the biggest source of
overhead for RPC latency now how do we
reduce the number of copies well it
turns out that the third copies if
you're looking at here moving the bits
from the system memory into the network
controller this is a hardware action and
it is unavoidable and therefore we're
going to live with it understand network
controller is completely redesigned if
the network controller is saying well I
need to DMA the bits from the system
memory input into my buffer well I have
to DMA the bits from the system memory
into my internal buffer before I can put
it all on the wire then this third copy
is inevitable so we live with it but we
would like to see if we can try to
reduce a number of copies involved here
the first idea is can we eliminate this
copy that is done by the client stub why
is it happening well it has to create a
network message in order to send it out
on the wire as we said that the
semantics of this call is only known to
the client
and the server and the client stub is
taking the arguments and making a
network packet out of it and it was
doing it in userspace and so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna marshal it
directly into the kernel buffer in other
words we've now moved this stub the
client side stub from the user space
down into the kernel if you can move it
into the kernel then from the stack the
stub can directly marshal it into the
kernel buffer and so that intermediate
copies that we had here creating an RPC
message and copying it again into the
kernel buffer is avoided if the stub can
directly work on the stack and write it
into the kernel memory so what this
means is that at instantiation time the
client stub is installed inside the
kernel at bind time when the client
binds with the server at the bind time
what we're going to do is we're going to
say that here is a client stub please
put it inside the kernel so that later
on you can use that in order to do the
marshalling so the synthesized procedure
is installed in the kernel for each
client call so for each client server
relationship we synthesize a procedure
which is the client stub install it in
the kernel for use every time I make
this call this stub can be invoked to
convert the arguments that are living on
the stack into a network message and
directly put it into the kernel buffer
so this obviously will eliminate from
the two copies down to one copy because
the intermediate copy of converting the
arguments into an RPC message is now
eliminated now the problem with this
idea is that we are saying let's dump
some code into the kernel and that may
not be something that is so palatable so
this is a solution that's possible if
the RPC service that is being provided
between the client and the server is a
trusted service and therefore we can
trust who is putting the stub into the
kernel in that case this solution may be
a reasonable one to adopt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
