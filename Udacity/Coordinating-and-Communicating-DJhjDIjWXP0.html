look at a little example so let's
imagine we've got two agents agent one
and agent too and agent one has a kind
of a goal or some kind of reward
function that it's dead it's running and
to make that reward function to have
high reward agent one needs an apple now
the apple is not far away but it is very
close to agent too so what are some
things that agent one could do to
satisfy its goal it could walk over to
the Apple good anything else well once
it gets there can say I thought you were
giving me an iPad and then kick agent
ooh IC wrong Apple this is the food kind
of but you're right that probably this
particular agent one would put like an
Apple watch yes well actually this
particular agent one has an Apple watch
then let's see the other thing that
could happen is agent one could ask
agent to to bring him the Apple good and
I guess presumably agent one could just
all so just do nothing and just wait for
agent 22 for the Apple to just show up
losing our works like you know maybe
agent to would would bring it by I guess
if maybe not apples but like almonds
there's certainly agents that bring
agent one almonds mm-hmm and ice cream
yeah have you gotten ice cream in a
while oh yeah okay then yes okay that's
too bad oh it looks like your looks like
your Apple watch exploded my dad that's
okay I'll just get another one yeah cuz
this one's broken anyway when we're
doing planning or sequential
decision-making we need to decide
amongst these different options if you
will or different courses of action that
we could take how do we usually do that
in the frameworks that we've been
talking about well if we're living in an
MVP like world we actually define the
MVP and I think the secret sauce there
is figure out what the right rewards are
right and the reason I said it that way
is because in the game theory case we
usually call those utilities and not
rewards and I just want the
differentiate between the two of them
okay and then what do we do with those
well once we have rewards or utilities
we then find a policy that maximizes
them we maximize our rewards or utility
actually I guess we maximize our utility
it seems like we could do this sort of
thing in the scenario where we've got
multiple agents and they need to
coordinate and communicate with each
other but it turned out it starts to get
a little bit hard to define exactly what
the costs are and what's the likelihood
that this is actually going to work
and so forth so what's what we're going
to do is actually think about just like
we did when we talked about palm DPS we
said that they allow us to strike a
balance between actions to gain reward
and actions to gain information and we
didn't have special like a special other
way of reasoning about that it all ended
up being folded into one model where
actions are being taken and they might
have informational impact and they might
have reward impact the informational
impact is subservient to the reward in a
sense right so the agents just tries to
figure out I will take an action to gain
information if it helps me get more
reward in the long run and so this the
deck palm dps is a similar sort of idea
that's going to let us put coordinating
and communicating along with actions
that they become actions just like
everything else like this ask for it
becomes a kind of action and walk to
Apple becomes a kind of action and the
agents can reason about whether that's a
good idea or not depending on how to
maximize their utility hmm sounds
promising</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
