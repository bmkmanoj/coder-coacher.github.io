everything you see around me was once
completely submerged in water the only
reason why the Netherlands is still dry
today is because a series of dikes have
been constructed around the country now
even with these dikes we still need to
constantly move water from low to high
or as will learn to say by the end of
this unit we need to do work on the
water to move it from places of low
potential energy to places of high
potential energy today the dikes that
surround the Netherlands help to keep it
17 million inhabitants safe but without
human intervention all the areas that
you see in blue would be submerged since
so much of the country is actually below
sea level of course the setup isn't
perfect water constantly must be
transported up and away from land one
tool the Archimedes screw uses power
from the Dutch windmills to transport
this water and keep the Netherlands dry
we learned about forces in the last unit
but thinking in terms of forces may not
be enough to understand this complex
problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
