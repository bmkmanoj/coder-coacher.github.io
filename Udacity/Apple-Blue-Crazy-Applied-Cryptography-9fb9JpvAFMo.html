from the voters those are inputs to a
random permutation let's say this is
controlled by the apple party and what
the permutation does is randomly
scramble the order of the votes so now
the position of the votes that came in
doesn't match the position of the votes
that came out we also do some encryption
and we'll get to that in the next
question part and those are passed along
to the next party let's call that the
blue party the blue party also scrambles
the votes in some random permutation and
then those are passed along to the next
one and we'll call this one the crazy
party so our parties start with the
letters a B and C and the crazy party
does the same thing it selects some
other random permutation or it randomly
selects the permutation and it scrambles
the positions of the roads so in order
for this to work we want at the end of
this to know what the actual votes are
the question is what values should we
use for X to enable this chain and our
security assumption is that the Apple
the blue and the crazy party all hate
each other that they wouldn't possibly
collude so they can be trusted not to
collude with the other parties but
otherwise they can't be trusted they
want to try to change the election
change the votes do everything they can
so the question is which one of these
would be the best choice for the X I
values and neither of these is a correct
choice neither of these will work
securely we're going to have to do some
other things but which one of these is
the best starting choice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
