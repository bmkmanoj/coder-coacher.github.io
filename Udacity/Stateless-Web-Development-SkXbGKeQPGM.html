gave us two new properties that are
really nice one is that our cache
survives restarts before when we're
using that dictionary cache if we
updated our code either locally or in
production our cache gets cleared that's
not a good quality or if you know in
production if Google for some reason
moves us to a different machine or
something like that what's going to
happen
our cache will get cleared which is also
you know it's not a good property
especially if you have a lot of traffic
and our app is now stateless which is
the key to scaling what stateless means
is our app between any two requests
stores no state then that means we
properly come from this you know there's
no state between requests which means
our apps are not interchangeable which
means we can have multiple apps without
any drama you know we have our load
balancer we have our memcached and in
between those two pieces of technology
are as many app servers as we need you
know adding more app servers is easy
likewise removing an app server is also
easy and not painful and it means our
apps can be scaled independently of our
cache in our database so we've got our
app servers you know we've got our our
database and you know we've got our
cache and if we find ourselves needing
more out servers we can add one let's
add our load balancer in here for good
measure and so now I've got all these
pieces we need another app server we add
one if we need another memcache we add
one having lots of caches means we won't
have to scale a database quite so fast
but if we need more databases we talked
about this in unit 3 you know we can go
with replication or we can go with
sharding but now you're starting to see
the kind of the bigger picture of how a
website might grow if they're really
data heavy you have lots of databases
and maybe lots of caches you know if
your databases is very read heavy but
not it's not actually a lot of data
you'd have more caches if your if your
application is very computationally
intensive maybe have lots of app servers
and you don't need so much database
support or not so much cache support but
what we want to do is we want to make
sure that on all of these different
pieces can grow independently and that's
kind of what scaling is all about is
putting yourself in a position so that
when your app is constrained in
different ways you can grow each part
kind of independent of the others and
now that our app is stateless it's
really easy to do that
and memcache helps a lot because all the
all the state is either stored in
cookies the DB or memcached but not the
apps and that's really handy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
