problem set is essentially an extension
of what was already done in the first
problem instead of checking whether a
Sudoku board is valid we're actually
going to be solving the stokke board and
coming up with a valid solution assuming
that it is valid so we're going to be
extending your check Sudoku function
since I don't know what you wrote then I
invite you to paste this in or paste it
into the something else run it locally
and then give you findings on the form
in the code for people to analyze and
hopefully break
now our Sudoku solver is going to be
essentially an extension so it should
return none for broken input just like
checks Adobe does false for inputs with
no valid solutions and a valid nine by
nine Sudoku grid containing no zero
elements at the end so any 0 elements
that are in the board that's passed in
assuming it's valid should be solved and
changed into numbers 1 through 9 that
give a valid solution there are a lot of
ways you can do that there are a lot of
clever ways to solve a partially
completed Sudoku board you could always
just go with a brute-force recursive
solution maybe not the best idea if
people end up testing against very very
difficult puzzles and you can come up
with some really pathologically evil
Sudoku puzzles if you don't have a fast
algorithm the one I'll be showing you in
the solution video is essentially just a
brute-force algorithm so please give
some examples of some Sudoku puzzles
that maybe it wouldn't fare so well
against or maybe it would take a very
very long time to complete so we're
going to be running this in the crater
against these same Sudoku puzzles Hart
has commented out by default because for
a more naive pseudo cooze solver it will
take a little bit of time maybe five to
ten seconds or so depending on exactly
how
cut it up to actually solve this one and
there are going to be multiple different
solutions depending on exactly how you
code this up so we aren't going to be
checking that will be simply be checking
that it's a valid Sudoku board with no
zeros and again I invite you to post
your solution code in the forums how you
coded up what you think it might be
vulnerable to and to break other
people's code and see how you would test
against a Sudoku solver which is a bit
more complicated of a piece of code than
the checker itself so there are a few
more ways that things can go wrong so
okay I hope you have fun with this and I
hope you enjoy breaking everyone else's
code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
