both of these tasks ask us questions on
the discussion forum if you are stuck
someplace in this and the next video I
will highlight some common constraints
related issues that students in this
class have been having so I change the
image for this button and it now looks
like a rabbit I also want to make sure
that it lines up well with the other
button so I will move it around and use
these blue dotted lines as my guide
there now to add constraints to this
button I can hold down the control key
on my keyboard and add a constraint to
the top space after that I can add a
constraint to the trailing space also
now I want to make sure that the leading
space here is equal to the trailing
space here to do that what I can do is
select this constraint and drag out the
utility area and under size inspector I
can see that the value of this
constraint is a constant 30 points so I
can now select the other constraint the
trailing space constraint and change its
value to 30 also finally for the stop
button let me scroll down a bit so we
can see it properly I can add a
constraint so that we Center it
horizontally and I can also make sure
that it is pinned at a constant distance
away from the bottom of the phone okay
let me run this project and see how it
looks I'm gonna go to the second screen
and there it is all three buttons are
showing up in the correct location
although it seems that these two buttons
are way too close to each other I will
let you play around with the leading
constraint here and the trailing
constraint here so that these two
buttons look evenly spaced on the screen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
