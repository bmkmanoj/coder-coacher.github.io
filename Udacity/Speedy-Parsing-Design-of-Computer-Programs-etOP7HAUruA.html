really quick we didn't have time to go
over a lot of the details and if you
hadn't seen anything about parsing or
languages before I may have been too
fast for you and I apologize but part of
the idea was to teach a little bit about
language theory but more the idea was
just to give you a tool and to show you
how these tools are built and how you
can use them so don't worry if you
didn't get all the details of exactly
how the parser works and if you are
interested there's another course you
can take and there's some other
documentation that you can read to get
up to speed on it I just want to talk
about one more thing it's something that
bothers me here which is say we have an
expression one single expression that's
really long and we start parsing it this
way and we say let's go left to right
well do the first alternative first
parse the term and it parses this big
big big long term and then tries to
parse the plus or minus and it says oops
I hit the end there's no more plus or
minus this alternative fails now I try
the second alternative the second
alternative says start with the term and
we go back and we parse this whole big
term all over again so we've doubled the
amount of work and it can be worse than
that because inside of each of these
terms there's more little pieces that we
can be doubling each of those pieces of
work so that seems really inefficient
what we'd like to be able to do it's fix
up our parser so that once we've done
this work we don't have to do it a
second time in case this version fails
don't worry about doing the work of
saying what if like five out of six of
these got parts just worry about the
individual atoms and saying if I did the
work of computing the tree for an
individual atom I don't want to have to
repeat that twice the quiz question is
can you go into here and modify this
parse function so that it has that
property that it doesn't repeat the work
twice once it's done it once it's a
strip to do it a second time it doesn't
repeat the computation it just does the
computation once that may seem like a
daunting task but there is a solution
that's really simple that you have the
tools for to be able to solve</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
