solve this problem first we'll look at a
way of solving it using a while loop so
we'll define our find element procedure
we'll use P as the name of the list and
T is the name of the target the element
that we want to match will define the
loop to go through the elements of P
similarly to the previous while loops
we've seen that go through lists so we
have our while loop we've introduced the
variable I will use that as the index to
go through the loop the stopping
condition for the while loop is when I
reaches the Len of T so we want our test
for the while loop to be I is less than
Len of P in the block of the while loop
we want to check if the current element
matches T so we get the current element
using P index I and then we use the
double equal to test if it's equal to T
if we find a match meaning the two
values are equal then we want to return
the index that we found so the result
should be the value of I which the index
where we found the matching element the
risky thing about using while loops
instead of for loops is it's really easy
to forget that you need to increase the
index variable if we just left the loop
like this it would run forever
because the value of I would never
change unless the first element matched
in which case we return zero the loop
would just keep going on forever again
checking the first element so we need to
increase the value of I and that's the
end of the while block the way we
describe what the find element procedure
should do if the element was not found
it should return negative one if we get
to the end of the while loop without
returning that means we've gone through
the while loop for all values of I up to
Len of P minus one we didn't find any
element that matches so we sure do
return negative one so that's one way to
define find element I'll also show you a
way to define it using a for loop so the
reason it's more natural to start
thinking of defining find element with a
while loop than a for loop is because
the value that we want to return from
find element is the index itself when we
use a for loop with the standard syntax
of going through the elements of the
loop we don't keep track of the index we
just see each element in order so we
need to add something else to keep track
of the index because that's the value we
want to return so we still need to use a
variable to keep track of the index
we'll use I as that
variable just like we did in the wine
loop version now instead of a while loop
we'll have a for loop we don't need to
think of the stopping condition here
because it will just go through all the
elements similarly to the body of the
while loop we check if the current
element is equal to T in the for loop we
can get the current element using the
variable e that's what gets assigned
each time we go through the loop body to
the value of the current element so our
test is using double equal to compare e
and T if they match just like we did in
the wild version we should return the
result the result we want to return is
the index where we found the match in
the wild version that was clear it made
sense because we were looking at element
P index I in the version with a for loop
we have to be more careful to know where
that index is we're using the variable I
to keep track of that index so we'll
return I I starts at zero each time
through the loop we need to increase I
so we keep track of the current index as
we go through the elements as with the
previous definition when we had the
while loop if we got to the end without
finding it that meant that the element
did not exist in P and we should return
negative one we'll do the same thing
