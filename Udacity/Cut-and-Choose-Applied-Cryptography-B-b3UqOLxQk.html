a set of blinded messages we're blinded
message B equals the original message m
times are a random non-space to the
power e mod in and so the question is
given the random knots are how do we get
em from be there are two very similar
ways to accomplish this and i'll talk
about both of them in the first way the
first step is to calculate the inverse
of our mod in i'd like to talk for a
second about what this means and how to
calculate it so in normal arithmetic not
modular finding the inverse is easy we
can just divide by r is a simple example
we have 3x equals y can find x by
dividing by 3 but with modular
arithmetic this doesn't work to hear the
same example 3 x equals y mod 5 and set
y equals 2 if we just divide we get x
equals 2 thirds which doesn't make sense
X has to be an integer it turns out the
answer is actually for because 3 times 4
is 12 and 12 mod 5 is 2 so what we need
to find is some Z such that three times
Z is congruent to 1 mod 5 it's fairly
easy to see that C equals 2 accomplishes
this three times two is six 6 is 1 mod
five so going back up to our original
problem we can solve three X's can grow
into why I mod 5 for X by writing a ex
just congruent to 2y mod five so y
equals 2x is 2 times 2 which is 4 and 4
mod 5 here all the inverses 1 x 1 equals
1 2 x 3 equals 6 which is congruent to 1
3 times 2 equals 6 which is congruent to
1 and 4 times 4 is equal to 16 which is
congruent to 1 and so we can calculate
in versus using the extended Euclidean
algorithm which is implemented in the pi
crypto library in crypto utila inverse
so now that we have the inverse of our
mod in we can calculate our bided
message we should calculate B to the
power D which equals M times re to the
power D and since e and d are the public
and private keys of RSA encryption we
get m to the power D and our mod in if
we multiply by the inverse of our we get
em d mod in and if we apply the public
exponent we can get in the second way of
solving this problem first
take our random notes to the power e and
we'll call that our we're going to
calculate the inverse of our if you take
our blinded message times the universe
of our we get our message times re times
our since re and capital are inverses
they cancel and we're left with just our
message comparing the two ways the
second way is quicker it only involves
one exponentiation in 1 inverse is the
first way requires two exponentiation in
one adverse in here is my solution in
this first step we calculate what i
called capital R big knots we use the
inverse function from the pi crypto
library to calculate the inverse of our
big notes modulus the RN value we can
then remove the knots from our bill by
multiplying the bill times the knots in
verse again modulus in and returning so
in the verify function itself we loop
through all the bills and nonces move
the knots check the value or message
value does some good versions to change
message which is an integer into bits
make sure the padding is right and then
convert the bits to a string and then
check the value of that string we then
see if the test value is equal to our
target value if it's not return false
because we don't need to verify anymore
if we've passed all of these return true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
