method that we were looking at earlier
we were trying to figure out what
exactly is going on in here from what
we've learned so far it looks like
there's a textview object and the
variable name is called order summary
texts you then it has a bunch of code
that we don't really recognize but on
the next line we use that variable order
summary textview and we try to set the
text on it to be this message let's find
out more about how to call methods like
this on objects when we call a method on
an object it has to follow this format
first we write the object variable name
in this case its title textview then we
add a dot then it's followed by the
method name which is set text in this
case this method is defined exactly this
way in the textview Java class the
method declaration also specifies that
there's an input parameter of a string
so we put parentheses and then pass in a
string as input then we end the
statement with a semicolon
when you write this line of code it
modifies the title textview object so
that it displays this on the screen the
reason we use the object variable name
here is because there could be multiple
text views in your app so make sure
you're calling the method on the right
object instance when you're specifying
input arguments make sure you're
specifying the right arguments in the
right order according to the method
declaration so if there's no inputs you
would just have an empty set of
parentheses the way we pass inputs to a
method is the same as we learned earlier
in lesson 3 and remember to separate the
object variable name and the method name
with this dot here's another example on
that same title text view object we're
going to call a set text size method on
it this method takes an integer as input
for the new text size so in this case we
just pass 18 as the new text size when
the Android device execute this line of
code is going to change this title
textview to have a larger font size of
18 in this example we're calling a
method on the textview object that is
called warning textview the method is
called set text color and it takes as
input a new color notice that the color
is specified
as colored red so if we look at the
documentation for the color class then
we can scroll down and see that red is
defined here there are a bunch of other
colors that you can use here as well so
when you call set text color you could
call color blue or color dot black and
lastly here's an example of calling a
method on an image view this image view
object has a variable name of welcome
image view and we call the method set
image resource on it this method takes
its input the new image that we should
set on this image view we specify the
new image as a resource ID in the format
of our drawable dot and this is the file
name this is just another use case of
using resource IDs in Java code to get
the full list of methods that you can
call on a text view object just open up
the text view Android documentation page
I can get to it by just searching for
text view Android than clicking here so
this is a page we already recognize and
we already know about the XML attributes
that are listed on this page if I scroll
down further then I can see a list of
all the public methods in the textview
class if you want to find something you
can just use command F or control F if
you're on Windows I'm going to look for
the set text color method which we used
earlier here's the set text color method
and it takes an integer color as an
input prim all these methods were
declared as public methods in the
textview class that's why we can call
these methods now if they were declared
as private methods we wouldn't see them
show up here when you're calling these
methods make sure you're checking what
input parameters it requires and you're
passing in the inputs in the correct
order and of the correct data type when
you're looking at code sometimes you
might not see the dot notation when
calling methods the difference matters
whether you're inside a class or outside
of a class let's look at an example than
the textview class we have the set text
method defined as well as some other
method say that you want to call the set
text method from this other method you
can do so by calling set text and then
passing in the input pram but where's
the dot and where it's the object
variable name well this line of code is
actually short for this dot
set text hello this refers to the
current object instance and then set
text is being called on this object this
is a format we're more familiar with for
calling methods on objects however the
dis dot part is implied and it's
optional so to make our code more
concise we can just call set text hello
so notice the difference between calling
set text within the class and calling
set text outside of that class when you
think about it this makes more sense
because it's very clear which texts you
you want to set the text on in case you
have multiple text views within this
class here's another difference between
being inside the text view class versus
being outside the text view class within
the text view class you can access
private variables and private methods if
you're outside of the text view class
you can't use methods that are private
and you can't access private variables
within the main activity class you can
only access public methods and public
variables from the text view class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
