here today and how about this one which
is really cool because it has moving
parts can you tell us about that and so
this is just a it's the basic cloth
sample and this actually it's kind of
funny this one kind of comes with a
machine when you buy it but the really
cool thing about it is that when you
design something like this it used to be
that you would design something like
this send it overseas get a mold made
and they would eventually around three
months in send it back to you would cost
you about forty thousand dollars and
that's on the low scale but now I can
design this in the afternoon print it
that night on my at home 3d printer or
take it to a service like Shapeways or
any of those places and have it back
within a week for about you know
anywhere between fifty to a hundred
dollars and I can see if things fit
together I can see you know if there's
things that need slight adjustment
before I go into some sort of mass
production or maybe I don't even need
mass production you know it could just
be for at-home use visits us printed as
a single thing or did you snap it
together or house network yeah so this
one's really cool it actually is printed
as a single object so what it does is if
you will it just sits in a bed and the
bed think of like an inkjet printer
where a pads coming over it when that
pad comes over the first time it puts
little droplets down to put that first
layer and on the way back it hits it
with an ultraviolet light which hardens
that object and then builds it up with
support materially inside the support
material is water soluble so at the end
of it when it all comes out I can then
take it and wash it off with a Waterpik
and take all that support material out
leaving me with a very functional object
so support material is so that it
doesn't sag or what'swhat's the port
material about support material is is
just that it's there for moral support
it's there for them to support the peace
so if you think about inside of here if
you had to build something in space that
was just going across this plane there's
no way you could really do it cuz it
can't build on nothing you can't just
put something out into midair yet and
but so that's what we do is we actually
put support material material in there
for this to build on top of and then we
can rinse that out so we can have things
with a giant cliff or you know a weird
angle at it that you wouldn't normally
be able to just work your way up to
layer by layer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
