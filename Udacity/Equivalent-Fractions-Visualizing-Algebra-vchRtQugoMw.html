that when 1/2 is equal to 2/4 I also
know that 1/2 is equal to 3 6 so how
exactly did I do that how did I change
this into this well if I look at this
shape and this one I notice that I just
doubled the number of pieces that are in
this shape and I doubled the number of
pieces that I have shaded so I doubled
both the numerator and the denominator
and I got 1 times 2 which is 2 and 2
times 2 which is 4 or to force now let's
look between the 1/2 and the 3 6 this
time I took my shaded pieces and I
tripled them so I multiplied them by 3 I
also took the total number of pieces I
had two and now I have a total number of
pieces of six so I also tripled my
number of pieces 1 times 3 is 3 and 2
times 3 is 6 but let's think about why
we can do this
I know 2 divided by 2 is really just 1
so I'm just multiplying one-half by a
form of 1 I'm not changing the value of
1/2 I'm just changing what the fraction
looks like the same is true down here
I'm taking 1/2 and multiplying it by a
different form of 1 and I'll get 3 6 so
we know 1/2 is equal to 2/4 which is
equal to 3 6 these are all equivalent
fractions ok but let's look a little bit
more closer at this 2 over 2 and 3 over
3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
