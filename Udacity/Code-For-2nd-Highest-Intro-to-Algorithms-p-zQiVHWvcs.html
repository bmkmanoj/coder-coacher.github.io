second largest name in that list it
starts off opening the file that has the
year of birth 1995 data in it and
instead of having just one max value
that we're keeping track of we keep
track of the max name and the maximum
value we've seen so far and the second
highest name and value that we've seen
so far initialized to zero because all
the values in this father are greater
than zero actually five or greater and
then we loop through the lines of the
file for each line we pull out the name
sex and count using our split and make
sure that that count is not a string
anymore but an integer and we check to
make sure the sexes female because
that's the way we're doing it for this
question if the count of this new person
that we just encountered this new name
is bigger than the best we've seen so
far then what we're going to do is take
what used to be the best so far and move
it to the second best what used to be
the best is now going to get filled in
with the current individual on the other
hand if the count is not bigger than the
largest we seem so far but it is bigger
than the second largest we've seen so
far then we just replace the second
largest we've seen so far and then when
this loop is all completed and we've run
through all the names we just print the
value and name that has the maximum and
the value in the name that has the
second maximum so we can run this and we
can see that jessica is the highest
valued name and ashley is the second
highest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
