that is going to be a boolean formula
with n variables and these are going to
be as always X 1 X 2 and so on until you
reach X and and we're also going to
specify the number of clauses and I'm
just going to use the letter M here so
we're going to say we have M clauses and
I'm also going to give them names so I'm
going to call them c 1 c 2 and so on
until you reach cm and we're now going
to construct a graph that represents or
encodes this boolean formula here and we
are going to do this just as we have
done before so this part here is going
to represent x1 this part over here is
going to represent X 2 and so on and
this one here xn now the question of
course is how long these parts for each
X need to be and that depends on the
number of clauses because we're going to
attach clauses to the variables here in
order to make the safe we should
construct this part so that we have M of
these edge crossings here because then
we know that for each Clause we have an
edge where we can attach that clause to
now if we have M of these crossings here
this means that we have M plus one of
these groups of three vertices here so
we have three times n plus 1 vertices in
this part here and then we have one more
vertex here on my vertex here so plus
two we extended like this and this holds
true for all of the other parts here as
well now for each clause where of course
also going to add a vertex like so and
again this vertex here is going to
represent Clause number one this vertex
here is going to represent clause number
two and so on until we get to Clause
number M so my first question for you is
how many vertices are we using to
represent the variables so to represent
X 1 X 2 and so on until we get to xn and
I would like you to enter this as four
numbers so it's going to be some number
times n plus some number times M plus
some number times M n plus possibly some
constant so please give me these four
here to correctly count the number of
vertices that we have here to represent
variables</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
