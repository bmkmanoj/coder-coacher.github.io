of designing a robot that can walk on
water let us suppose that that
particular target problem results in the
retrieval of a source case of a robot
designed if you've already encountered
one they can walk on ground now the
question becomes how can we adapt this
particular designer for robotic can walk
and ground into a robot design they can
walk on water let us now suppose if we
reuse this particular problem of
designing a robot to walk on water as a
probe into the case memory and now the
case returns to us the design of the
basilisk lizard that might happen
because the design of the basilisk
lizard is indexed by its functional
model walk on water so it is a pragmatic
similarity between you two we now have
the design of a robot that can walk on
ground and we have the design of a
biological organism the bustle if lizard
that can walk on water for the basilisk
lizard we also have a complete model a
complete explanation of how its
structure achieves its function now that
we have a partial design for the robot
this is the design of the robot that can
walk on ground and we have a design of
an organism that can walk on water we
can try to do an alignment between these
two this alignment will be based on the
similarity between relationships created
the objects here and the objects there
are very different once we have aligned
these structural models of the robot
that can walk on ground and the basilisk
lizard I can walk on water then we can
start doing transfer we can transfer
specific features of this structure of
the basilic lizard for example the shape
of its feet to this model of the robot
that can walk on ground in order to
convert it into a robot that can walk on
water having constructed a structural
model for this robot that can walk on
water then we can try to transfer the
behavioral model and then the functional
model and in this way we have a complete
model of a robot that can walk on water
along with a explanation of how it will
achieve its function this is sometimes
called compositional analogy we first do
mapping the level of structure and that
mapping at a level of structure helps us
transfer some information
that interns us allows us to transfer
the information at the behavioral level
once we have transfer the information
the behavioral level we can climb up
this abstraction hierarchy and transfer
information a functionalist we can now
revisit of a computational process for
analogical reasoning initially we had
presented this particular process like a
linear chain retrieval mapping transfer
evaluation and storage in general
however there can be many loops here we
may do some initial mapping for example
that may result in some transfer of
information but the transfer then may
lead to additional mapping and then to
additional transfer and so on there is
another brief example from biological
inspired design in this case we want to
design a robot that can swim underwater
in a very stealthy manner this
particular function is swimming
underwater in a stealthy manner reminds
a design team of a copepod a copepod is
a biological organism that is a large
number of appendages it moves underwater
in such a way that it generates minimum
wake especially when it moves very
slowly on the other hand when it moves
rapidly then the wake becomes large when
you wake is small then this motion is
very slowly when the wake is large its
motion is no longer still the analogical
transfer of knowledge about this
particular copepod gives us a design for
the Mike robot for slow velocities this
analogy decomposes our original design
problem we had the additional design
problem is moving underwater in a still
d manner now that we have a design of an
organism for moving underwater at low
velocities we are still left with the
sub goal of moving underwater at high
velocities the goal of designing a
MicroBot it can move underwater in a
steady manner at fast velocities may
remind the design team of the squid the
squid uses a special mechanism like the
jet propulsion mechanism to move
underwater and install the manner at
pretty high velocities now we have
created the design of a MicroBot where
part of the design comes from the
designer the copepod and the other part
comes from the designer the squid
instead of borrowing the design from one
source case we are boring parts of the
design for multiple source cases
this is a compound analogy notice
there's a problem evolution going on we
started with one problem we arrived at a
partial solution to that which then
leads us to a problem evolution at the
problem transformation we are now have a
new understanding of the problem so in
this example we saw how we fasted
analogical retrieval of the copepod
organism then mapping then transfer that
then led to additional retrieval in this
case of this squid once again this
process is not linear just like we can
iterate between mapping and transfer
similarly we can iterate between
transfer and retrieval</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
