this statement down here is not correct
the clique cannot contain multiple
vertices from one of these groups and
the reason why that is is that in a
clique all vertices as you know must be
connected to all other vertices but this
is not how we constructed the graph when
we constructed the graph all we did was
draw edges between vertices from
different groups but we did not allow
any edges between vertices in that group
so if you find a clique that can only
contain exactly one vertex from each of
these groups here so if the graph has a
clique of size m and the clique cannot
contain multiple vertices from a closed
group this means that you have to have
exactly one vertex from each Clause
group in your clique so this statement
here is definitely true it contains at
least one vertex from each Clause group
but actually we can even make a stronger
statement and say it contains exactly
one vertex from each Clause group and
now we're almost done with our reduction
because if you think about it so we
solve clique for this graph we have
constructed here and we ask the decision
problem does the graph have a clique of
size m where m is the number of clauses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
