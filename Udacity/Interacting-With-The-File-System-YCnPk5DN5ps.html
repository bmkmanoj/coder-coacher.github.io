start by simply declaring a new task and
specifying the type of the task as
copying of course this task won't
actually do anything because we haven't
told it what file we would like copied
and to where the simplest example is to
copy the contents of one folder to
another we use the copy tasks from
method to add sources and the into
method to specify the destination this
copy task will copy the contents of the
images directory into the build
directory we can specify files to
include or exclude our filters can use
wildcards allowing us to do things like
include all files that match a certain
pattern or have a particular file
extension this combination of source
destination inclusions and exclusions is
called a copy spec let's configure our
tasks to only include JPEG images by
calling the include method and passing a
file pattern we can also configure a
single copy task to copy from multiple
sources copy specs can be hierarchical
which is particularly useful when you
want to exclude certain files from
particular subfolder or specifically
include them in another let's configure
a copy task which copies all JPEGs into
one folder and all gifts into another we
define to child copy specs one to
include only JPEG files and the other to
include only gifts we also specify the
folder we want to copy these files into
these folders will be created as
subfolders under the route copy
destination the result being that JPEGs
will be copied to build slash JPEG and
all gif files will be copied to build /
gif Gradle provides task types for
creating archives like zip or tar files
archive tasks are nearly identical to
copy tasks except instead of specifying
a destination directory we specify an
archive name let's zip up all files in
our images directory we use the zip
tasks base name and destination der
properties to tell Gradle what to name
the archive and where to create it note
that the destination dirty takes a Java
file object luckily the Gradle project
interface provides a convenience method
for creating files we can do similar
things with archive tasks and child copy
specs we can create an archive which
puts JPEGs and gifts into their own
directories inside the archive the only
difference from our copy task example is
that we specify the archive name and
destination sometimes we want to delete
files during our builds usually to clean
up previous build outputs we can use the
delete task to delete files or folders
in our project here we have a task that
deletes the build folder</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
