talked about car sharing and what
classes one might be able to use to
implement a car sharing simulation and
we hit upon the classes car person let's
go ahead and actually implement those
classes so we'll imagine a bunch of
people that all gather at the departure
location there's a long road with
destinations that we'll just label one
two three and so on
each of the people wants to go to at one
of these destinations maybe this one
wants to go to three same with the
others and then we'll have cars that
also have destinations let's say this
car wants to go to a destination for
then of course this car can pick up
whatever passengers want to go to
destination one two three or four but
not one that wants to go further and of
course the car can only load as many
passengers as they have seats make that
one less because the driver also needs a
seat so now we need to figure out what
are the responsibilities of the classes
let's start with the person class a
person should know their destination in
our simulation we also want to give
names to people so of course the person
should know that too a car should be
able to pick up a passenger provided of
course and only the car will know that
whether there's room and whether the
destination is on the way and of course
there's another thing that a car should
be able to do it should be able to drive
it looks like the person is the easier
of the two let's look at that first
here's the person class you can see we
have two properties a person has a name
and a destination property with a getter
for each of them
these are read-only properties once a
person has been constructed with a
particular name and a particular
destination that doesn't change remember
it's just a simulation these are not
real people but just objects for use in
our simulation program here is the car
class most importantly a car collects
passengers a car also knows how many
seats it has the name of the driver will
just use that for reporting the current
location
it starts at zero and goes up by one
every time that the car drives to the
next location
and the digit destination we construct a
car with the driver name number of seats
in the destination initially it has no
passengers and is at location zero so
now it's your turn I'd like you to
implement the try to add method where we
add a person to the car or at least we
try because if there's no room or the
passenger wants to go further then the
car wants to go then it's not going to
work in that case you shouldn't add P to
the passenger arraylist but you should
return false on the other hand if you
can't accommodate the person go ahead
and add it and return true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
