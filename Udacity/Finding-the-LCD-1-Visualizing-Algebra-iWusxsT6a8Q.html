these denominators we want to factor
them first but since these are monomials
we can use our factor tree method to
figure out what they share I know 9 and
15 share a common factor of 3 and the a
share a common factor of 1 a the highest
power of B that's in common is B squared
so 3a b squared is my greatest common
factor the other factor for this
denominator is 3a squared if we multiply
these two together we'll get our
original denominator whereas for this
fraction the missing factor is 5 B
squared if I multiply these two together
we'll get 15 3 times 5 a and then B
squared times B squared or B to the
fourth we multiply all these factors
together to get our LCD so our lowest
common denominator is 3 times 3 times 5
which is 45 and then a squared times a
which is a cubed + B squared times B
squared which is B to the fourth I said
earlier that you want to use the highest
power of any factor for the lowest
common denominator notice that we have a
cubed and a a cubed is the highest power
in either denominator so we want to make
sure that appears in our LCD likewise
between B squared and B to the fourth
this fourth power is higher so we know B
to the fourth needs to appear in our LCD
this is a quick way you can check to
make sure your variables or your factors
are correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
