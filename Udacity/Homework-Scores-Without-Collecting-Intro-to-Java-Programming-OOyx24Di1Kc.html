some of the code that i was using in the
hint videos here's the homework scores
class and so far it's keeping track of a
sum and the number of scores this code
returns the sum but doesn't actually
think about excluding the lowest the way
I see this problem there are two key
insights the first is that to return the
total excluding the lowest we don't
necessarily need to permanently remove
the low score if we can find the low
score we can return the total minus the
low score just subtract it off at the
last moment the second insight is that
we don't need to save all of the scores
to know what the lowest scores we only
need to save the value of the lowest
score itself so instead of a method that
finds the lowest score I'll create an
instance variable to track the lowest
score so far I'll define it as private
double lowest should probably make these
private too now I'm going to need some
special cases in my get total excluding
lowest because if the number of scores
is zero I want to return 0 but if the
number of scores is one I want to return
that one score which is currently the
sum and if there are more then I want to
return the some without the lowest score
to keep track of how many scores there
are i'm using the counting pattern i
start with the number of scores being
zero and when i add a score i increment
the number of scores by one now for this
new variable lowest score or lowest as
i'm calling it i need to come up with an
initial value ideally i would initialize
it with the first score but i don't know
what that is yet in the constructor so
I'll initialize it with minus one and
promise never to look at it until I've
added at least one score this is a good
example of why you want to keep your
instance variables private people using
the homework scores class might not
realize that lowest isn't always
initialized only the homework scores
class knows about this implementation
detail and when you mark this as private
it shows that the homework scores
objects are responsible for interpreting
the data inside of the lowest score
variable so Outsiders don't need to
remember things like I shouldn't look at
the lowest score until I've added scores
so now I've initialized the lowest score
but I need to think about how it's
changing I'll need to make sure that in
add score when there aren't any scores
yet I should initialize lowest to be the
given score then I need to think about
what happens when I add additional
scores the lowest score seen so far can
change whenever I add a score this is a
lot like looking for the minimum score
in a loop when I see a new score if the
score is less than the lowest so far I
update the lowest to be score now it
looks like under both of these
conditions num scores is zero or the
scores less than the lowest i change the
lowest to be the score so let's make
this into one if statement if num scores
is zero or score is less than lowest
then lowest equals score they can get
rid of this repetition and then these
two statements happen no matter what
whenever I see a new score account that
I've seen another score and I add the
score to the sum so now if i compile and
fix my syntax errors i can run the
homework scores tester and the homework
scores class behaves as it should</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
