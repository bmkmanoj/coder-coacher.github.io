class there are many many many white box
criteria and we're not going to have
time to cover them all so what I like to
do now is just to give you the flavor of
some other criteria but just mentioning
them and send a couple of things about
the way they work and the first one I
want to mention is path coverage and
impact coverage the test requirements
are all the paths in the program so what
that means is that to satisfy this
criterion we need to generate enough
test cases such that all the paths in my
program are covered as you can imagine
this is incredibly expensive because any
non-trivial program has got a virtually
infinite number of paths and therefore
we will need a virtually infinite number
of test cases to satisfy the path
coverage criteria another family of
criteria when I mention our dataflow
coverage criteria and in dataflow
coverage criteria the focus shifts from
the coverage of individual elements in
the code to the coverage of pairs of
elements and in particular the coverage
of statements in which the content of
some memory location is modified and
statements in which the content of the
same memory location is used so in this
way our tests will exercise the
assignments of values to the memory and
the usage of those assignments finally I
want to mention mutation coverage and
this is a fairly different and new idea
so the key concept in mutation coverage
is that we want to evaluate the goodness
of our test by modifying the code like
for example here in small I'm showing
that I might change an if statement from
K greater than 9 to K greater than or
equal to 9 and the reason why I want to
do that is that if I generate enough
mutants in that variation of my program
then I can use them to assess how good
are my tests at distinguishing the
original program and the mutants and
because I'm changing the code based on
the way I expect to introduce errors in
the code the more my test can identify
mutants the better they are at
identifying real faults this is a very
high-level view but just to give you the
intuition and the idea behind this
criteria and I'm going to provide as
usual additional pointers to go in more
depth on these topics in the notes of
the cost so now let's go back to our
test criteria sub sanction hierarchy and
see how all of these criteria fit
together in this context let me start
with multiple condition coverage as we
saw mc/dc is sort of a smarter way of
doing multiple condition coverage in the
sense that it doesn't consider all the
combinations but only the ones that are
more likely to matter and as such mc/dc
exercises
subset of the elements the multiple
condition coverage exercises and
therefore multiple condition coverage is
more thorough than mc/dc and substance
and it's also as we saw incredibly more
expensive path coverage subsumes branch
coverage because if I cover all of the
paths in the code I necessarily cover
all the branches however it doesn't
subsume multiple condition coverage
mc/dc or branch and condition coverage
because this criteria have additional
requirements involving the conditions of
the predicate that path coverage does
not have as for dataflow coverage
criteria mutation coverage criteria
they're really in no relation with the
other criteria because they look at
different aspects of the code so they're
not really comparable and therefore
we're just going to put them on the side
without any relationship with the other
ones the reason why I want to represent
them all anyways is because I want to
make an important distinctions between
these different criteria and that's the
distinction between practical criteria
which are criteria that are actually not
too expensive to be used in real
scenarios and theoretical criteria which
are criteria that are useful in theory
from the conceptual standpoint but they
are not really applicable in practice
because they are too expensive because
they require basically too many test
cases to be satisfied</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
