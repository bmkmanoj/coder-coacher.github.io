is Mark I'm a co-chair at Udacity or the
intro to programming now in degree
joining me online is Luke
he is also another coach here and today
we're just going to do a little
broadcast and talk about functions what
are functions how do we use functions
what are the tips and tricks to use
functions or word to come gotchas and
the common things that you need to look
out for in functions cuz yeah majority
of everyone will be learning Python
right now and you will be learning
functions or half learn functions and we
feel like this is a very important
concept such as much like loops and
decisions things like if and else
statements you know these functions make
up a core I think a very very core core
concept in programming what do you think
look like how poor are functions in just
in program without so functions are I
mean they're one of the most basic
things they're one of the most
foundational things you do in
programming everything you do if you're
a competent programmer will involve
writing lots and lots of functions
they're sort of the one of the smaller
bits of bits of the programming world
that you will use constantly it's it's
very very foundational it's something
that you have to you really should make
sure that you understand very well about
what it is how to use it everything like
that yeah so yeah great thanks for your
in be a point look at I agree with you
if just did not exist if we would not be
able to program as efficiently and as
eloquently as we can in this world so
again if you want one thing they should
walk away from this broadcast is
functions are very important and you
should invest a time until practicing
praying as many functions as you can
because I trust me trust us this will
this will help you with
for the rest of your program in Korea
great so we're going to start do our top
start talk about our our presentation so
but if you have any questions related to
functions please post these online and
we'll address these questions for you as
well so Luke you'd have the floor okay
so the first thing that we really should
establish from we're talking about
functions is exactly what a function is
so functions which will also probably
refer to as procedures since they're the
same thing in Python they're bits of
code that you can call repetitively now
generally when you think about functions
you're thinking about something with
defined input and defined output but
foundationally in Python functions are
something that you can define once and
then use as many times as you'd like so
if I were to screen share a little bit
here so the first thing to as far as
using functions that you should know is
how to make them so you start a function
with the keyword def that's your
definition of the function then you give
it some name the the name would be some
function here and then these two
parentheses are necessary for a function
it is where you define some parameter if
you had one we'll go over what those are
later but you need here there's we're
gonna use just a function with no
parameters whatsoever
then you need a colon and then whatever
is inside that indentation is going to
be your function that's going to be the
code that you can reuse however often as
you want to say hey look start to take
her up to you but I just want to really
emphasize how important indentations are
in Python you will find some other
programs they don't care about
indentation but in order to be able to
define your functions appropriately you
need to indent all the lines that belong
in your function or
your function will not work and as we're
going on with indentation it's on
indenting back to where the function was
the same level the function was defined
at that ends the function you can also
end a function with return statement
which we'll go over later but that's
that's not really anything where the
definition would end that's just ending
where the code will stop running but the
in Python the function end is where it
uninvent
but so as we are kind of going over with
with a function you you give it some
code to run here so let's just say we're
going to print hello world so that's
what the function does now to call the
function you simply pull it by saying
the name no death no colon here and with
the with the given parameters you're
going to use so if I were to run this
but diet obviously just had right before
we started I'm going to get the output
hello world in fact if I can do this
however many times I want with calling
the function and it will run three times
here three times
hopefully all that's visible for you but
yeah
so now as we as we keep going here so
there's a few things to note about
functions that are very important
functions create something called the
local scope so a variable that you make
inside of a function doesn't exist
outside of the function this isn't can
contrast with a global scope where it's
the some variable that you make will be
available at all times so as a quick
example of that let's just make make
some function that does something pretty
simple so here we're having a global
variable called a equals six and we're
having a local variable called a equals
five so both variables are named a but
they're not the same variable so we can
see that
I when we're running our function
printing out a string that prints out a
and remember we redefined a here's is
equal to five and then after our
function is done running we can print
what the global variable is and as we
run that whole thing you'll see that
inside the function N equals five and
then outside equals six because it never
got redefine this eight this a has
nothing to do with this a although they
have the same name they don't point to
the same object one thing to note here
is that this a right here after we run
some function it's destroyed it ceases
to exist
so that's with how global works if we
were to take out this a equals five
you'll notice that we the function
should still work all of a sudden we're
just using the global version of a since
we never make a local version of a
however if we take out this this string
a right here is going to produce an
error so if I make this a little larger
it runs this successfully and then when
it gets to here this a isn't doesn't
exist anymore
it's gone so this produces an error
saying that a is not find the the reason
again why that happens is this a is
global it can work anywhere this a is
local it only works inside the function
so for a way around that we have
something called parameters as far as
how we're going to get in some variable
that we actually want to use inside the
function without relying on global
variables so as a quick aside here
global variables are generally a big
no-no in programming
sometimes you're going to end up doing
using them just because they're easiest
for the short thing you're doing but you
should if there's a way to avoid global
variables avoid global variables always
stick to six or local variables because
then you can't screw something up that
you don't think you're going to screw up
with your function but so on two
parameters so I'll just copy and paste
this quick a parameter is some value
that can be passed into a function so
here I made some same same name as a
function that I get i pass in parameter
1 and parameter 2 so when you actually
do that to call it those values can be
anything you want so it doesn't have to
like that they don't have to be called
parameter 1 or parameter 2 you don't
have to press in a variable that has
that same name all you have to do is put
them in order and they both have to
exist so if I were to run this I'm going
to get first I'm gonna run print number
1 which you can see is hello world here
and the second thing I'm going to get is
2 since that's what I passed in for a
parameter 2 now if I only give this
whole world what's going to happen is
that I'm going to get an error because
the function takes two parameters they
arguments another name for parameters
here and then I only gave it one so
that's always something you have to have
to watch out for here this can also be
done with variables so let's say instead
of passing in hello world I want to pass
in the variable that says hello world
and then B equals 2 so I'll get the same
thing here by passing in two variables
the same way I would have with just the
print function as a print statement
where that will once again pass in a the
value of a 2 parameter 1 and the value
of B 2 parameter to 1 one quick thing to
note here is what happens to parameter
doesn't affect a because these are
things that are called immutable objects
so if you've out depending how far
you've gotten into the course you'll
have found things like lists and
dictionaries to be mutable objects as
opposed to immutable objects which are
things like strings ants floats your
standard your standard variables that
you'll you probably use the most that
aren't containers so a good quick
starting point for mutability is a good
understanding of variables themselves so
here if I can just open up interpreter
here and do this more easily that way
I'll run it straight from straight from
the command line here are the terminal
so just running Python so with variables
a variable points to a value that it
holds in Python so say I have equals 500
now it's supposed to so it's already
running Python
equals five eight now is a variable that
points to the value 5 sorry the when you
change an immutable value in for an
immutable variable what you're doing is
you're changing what the thing points to
so you're not actually changing the the
constant 5 you're changing a to point to
some new value so I can see this with
the IB function this gives me what it's
pointing to if I were to change that to
6 but I get if I say I da is a
completely notice that this is different
than this that it's pointing to an
entirely different object so 5 he
being an object and six being an object
where they're explicitly not the same
thing that's being pointed to their
different values now if I try that same
thing with a mutable object so let's
just say a list of some sort so now I'm
going to say a is some list and I take
ID of a I can alter that list so just to
show it's altered it's not that and I
get the exact same value for ID of a it
points to the same object the list is
still the same list
it's just mutated it's changed in Luke
can you increase the font size a bit
gotcha so a quick overview of what I did
no legible font sizes the when I
switched a from equaling 5 to 6 in
switch are immutable values the ID
actually changed because 6 and 5 are
constants they didn't change to the
pointer that a referred to had to now
when I made it a list the ID did not
change when I changed the list because
the list itself changed instead of the
pointer so that's that's how variables
work as far in in Python and that's
going to have pretty dramatic effects
with what we're doing with with
functions here so moving back to sublime
if I pass in an immutable variable or a
mutable variable to a function what
happens to the variable inside the
function happens to it outside when I
pass in an immutable variable the you
can you can change but you can see with
the very word immutable that variable
what happens inside the function does
not affect what what value is passed in
so let's just write up a quick little
part to show this
let's have some function and give it
some lists as a parameter inside the
function we can just append on to the
list and then let's print out what a
local variable that is now if we define
some list over here and then pass it
into the function AAA our parameter here
it's given it's given to some list then
what happens when we print out a after
that notice that what happened inside
also happened outside that same exact
thing does not happen if I were to say
give this the value 5 and even though
we're calling it some list I just add 1
to it
it's previously demonstrated the local
changes to 6 the global does not it's
not altered the immutable object is not
mutated inside the list this instead the
sunless the parameter becomes a local
variable even though a was a global
variable the parameter some list which
was given the value of a is now a local
variable it's destroyed at the end of
the function a itself is not altered
because of that so what do we want to do
if we want to actually get out some
value from function for some immutable
value well that's where return
statements come from are coming so let's
just change this so it doesn't say list
because that looks bad for you know
readability purposes so if some value
some value here
let's say I wanted to actually change
the value there and get get something
out of it
let's return some lists return does
exactly what it looks like it gives the
variable back so how I would do that is
I would assign some variable here to X
and then X takes whatever this variable
was here and it just takes the value so
doing that yep I think you need change
some lists to some value Oh yep yeah and
one more I like yeah on line two yep
there we go so I didn't actually do
anything with X here well I did yes I
did I printed it out so this is the
value taken from the return value so one
one cool thing here is you can actually
return multiple values here so that's
technically returning a couple as you
can see if I do this again it gives it a
couple value to X but at the same time I
could do something like this and it will
actually understand what I want to do
there X we'll just take the first value
y&amp;amp;z are now equal to one and two because
that's what I returned so a return value
also stops the function wherever it's at
so if I added that at the end of it this
will never be read because it's
afterwards a return statement notice
nothing changed when I built that it the
hi right there simply doesn't get read
it exists as part of the function
definition but because it's at it comes
after a return in the sequence that the
program's run so the program will run
this line then this line and then this
line this line will end the program and
it will never see the prints hi
so you can do multiple things with the
return value for instance you can print
it out directly so let's just take out
these print statements so I could print
what's returned from some function here
and I'll get the couple that's returned
I'll get some value one two so I don't
even have to save it in about a variable
I can also just run it and hear nothing
what happens and settings printed out
and the sign basically not a sign what's
returned to anything if that's if I'm
looking for something that the function
did in here to say some mutable value
that I want to change but didn't
actually care what was returned I don't
have to deal with what's returned but
it's generally useful to deal with
what's returned that's actually a very
important thing and sometimes some as a
beginner a lot of people might get a
little confused with the difference
between print and returns so print
simply this console right here print
simply puts whatever value you're
printing on to that console it literally
prints to what you as a human can read
it doesn't alter the state of the
program it doesn't alter the flow of how
the program is running all it does is
show you something that you want from
the program return on the other hand
does absolutely nothing to the console
it ends a function and brings that that
value from that function to some
external variable if you assign it to an
external variable which actually brings
me to another thing let's say I don't
return anything I return nothing what do
you think will happen here Oh first I
had to print X notice that even without
returning anything what happens is that
I end up returning none I can even do
that without the return statement so
it still returns none because in Python
none is it's what would be considered
it's it's a null value it know in other
programming languages is often what's
used but in what Python is none it's
essentially a value that has no value it
has the value it has is none
it's literally its own value type so
it's not a string it's just the value
non the same is true and false would be
boolean but all functions or procedures
in Python return something by which I
mean if you don't assign a return value
they return none so if you ever get none
where you weren't expecting it when
you're trying to print something that's
probably a sign that you're you're
possibly printing or you meant to return
or something like that where you're
printing the value from a function that
doesn't return anything
sometimes you explicitly want to return
nothing that that tends to be the case
when you are testing explicitly to see
if you get to a state in the program
it's a it's a nice default holder since
it doesn't really take up any space as
far as if you're going to change some
value into say a list it's a nice
default value which we won't really get
into here but it has its uses but that's
that's sort of the main point of that
that's one of the reasons actually that
Python doesn't have a difference between
procedures and functions so in math a
function is something which maps some
unique input to some output for example
f of X equals MX plus B equation of a
line in programming languages the
functions tends to be something pretty
similar it takes input in the form of
parameters slash arguments and it gives
output from what it returns but it in
some programming languages a functions
don't actually affect anything other
like outside of that if there are no
mutate able values then the what happens
in the function stays in the function it
only has parameters and our input and
output on
other side of that and some other
programming languages procedures might
just be sort of subroutines things that
you run that don't return any values but
which just do something to other values
in the program by the way a quick aside
when a function does do things other
than take input and give output it
actually alters some mutable values we
call that alteration a side-effect of
the program so sometimes a side effect
to the function I should say sometimes
you literally set the side-effect of the
function at the whole point so it's sort
of a misnomer in that effect but the
that it's a piece of terminology you
might find useful at some point another
reason why Python procedures and
functions aren't actually different is
that you notice that since every
function returns something there isn't
like a true procedure that doesn't
return anything because you implicitly
return done
did you have anything to add mark mmm
other than the fact that like we've
noticed a lot of people get confused
between print statements and returning
statements acid and yeah we like to
likely emphasize that print is really
different from return they are two
different things
they the only common thing is they get
you some sort of value and then you you
have you've you manipulate this value
because a lot of people will create a
function and then they'll print the
function they run it and they print it
and they're like okay that's about it I
got to my function but in essence you're
just you're printing you're running a
print statement and then you're
returning none so it's a very subtle
difference but I think is it's worth
re-emphasizing and yeah one thing and
Luke before it looks like we don't have
any questions looks like our viewers are
you know they're getting it we hope
you're everyone's getting it can you
show us an example of multiple returns
things what will they look like okay
so let's screen share again yeah so I'm
assuming you're referring to in
if-statements yeah it seems like that's
a very common way to do it
okay so let's say then you uh increased
the text further yeah so the window is
like small loop like the window itself
can you increase the window there you go
yeah okay yeah better that's weird to me
because the the window is actually
bigger just now than it was for most of
the presentation but who knows weird
quirks so a lot of times you can have
returned different things depending on
what you're doing
so let's actually return the type like
let's return different things based on
the type of some value so with Python we
don't actually have to specify what type
our parameters in a car for a function
which is a lot different than a lot of
other languages say in C or C++ or Java
you're going to have to specify that say
if you want an integer here you're going
to actually have to specify that you
want an int in that spot
so that the program doesn't crash but
here we can return different things
depending on whether or not be having it
and then we can just maybe return a
value of that int versus if we have
something that's not an int we can just
return a straight string like that and
then we can run this function on a
variety of different things so let's say
a 25 that should get one actually let's
print all these out so that we can see
what we have
and then let's prints actually it should
be fun
25 point Oh since that should be a float
we run this we'll notice that the first
one is an int and so it returns one the
second one is not an int and so it
returns the string not a name we have
different return statements here because
well we have an if statement that goes
from one place to another depending on
what some value is actually one one big
trip up that is found quite a few times
here would be something like a while
statement or a for loop so let's say I
won't want to just print that if
statement or some value ten times so
let's make a counter I'll just do this
for loop for E in range 10 if you do
this you're going to end up only doing
it once because the function will end as
soon as you get here so it's only going
to run once whereas if you had wanted to
print it out more times I wanted to make
some lists actually have it
you have to move the return outside of
the for loop inside the for-loop anytime
you hit that return it's going to end
the function even in the middle of a
loop so that's that's one big thing to
remember about return statements the
return statement ends the function
immediately regardless of whether it's
in something that shouldn't necessarily
you wouldn't think of ending without any
I had someone like a for loop return
this return statement always ends the
function there's actually some fun
things you can do with return statements
that you wouldn't you won't really
encounter so much in this class although
cs101 has quite a bit of it which is
recursion so you technically don't need
loops
although pythons not particularly well
set up for recursion because you could
use a function to call itself so instead
of returning some value we could
actually turn it return some function
here which you'll notice is going to be
an infinite loop because it's just going
to keep calling itself over and over and
over again but if we say made an if
statement that just typed an if
statement if we make an if statement
that has some base value that so you can
think of a recursion sort of like in the
same way as a loop it has to have
stopping converge condition we would
call this a base case and that that
stopping condition is what sort of ends
the loop and then the recursion will
sort of end and keep each value will be
finally returned to the function that
called it and then at last year your
function will end one of the reasons
Python is actually not particularly
well-suited for it is that it well it's
actually kind of welding on the scope of
this class but it uh each function has a
certain amount of overhead and you run
just straight up run out of memory for
how many functions are simultaneously
called
instead of one function ending and then
calling the next one so a while loop
doesn't really take up much memory it
just keeps on going over and over
whereas the Persian takes up a lot of
memory and something like something like
Python should I demonstrate an actual
recursive case
oh yeah just something very simple okay
what supplies okay so let's say let's
make a counter here take this out so if
counts equals zero we're going to have
that V our base case just rich um
return some value else return some
function some value plus one half plus
one so this is kind of a pointless
function but you can call it anyway
minus one right yeah yes well unless I
start with the negative number that
would you the person has the same fun
with loops is only only it takes a
little bit getting used to in your head
about if I started out with a count
bigger than zero if I had plus one here
it would never end it would just get a
basically I get an infinite loop but an
infinite loop that ends more quickly
than normal because Python will tell me
that a hand completely out of memory but
then I can do that and get see what I
get out for my final value here oh it
looks like I needed that there you go
yay so it returns every value between 25
and 35 because I print some value every
time and then 10 is how many times I'm
going to call itself
um and then it simply adds one to
account every third subtracts one to
count until we get to zero when we get
to zero it actually prints some value to
show you how the the difference between
this and a normal infinite loop if I
were to actually give this let's just
give it a negative number so it destroys
itself nice and quick notice that it
actually hits a Mac person death and
actually hits a maximum recursion depth
pretty quickly you could be sitting at
an infinite loop wondering if your
programs just slow for minutes if you
have a particularly involved program
that has to go through a fantastically
large amount of data but with recursion
if you go too deeply the program will
basically cut itself off right there and
only half a second the main problem with
that is that if you actually have a lot
of stuff that you have to go through the
program will comes off itself off and
half a second and you'll never get
through all of it it will just make an
error even though theoretically that
shouldn't have to be one if you've had a
computer with infinite memory but that's
just a quick aside there it's a it's a
pretty recursion something that you use
in algorithms quite a bit for at least
like saying graph theory it's pretty
useful it's it's easier to think of in
certain cases obviously loops loops are
actually tend to be faster and almost
all languages so sometimes where you use
recursion and anything that's possible
with recursion is also possible with
loops but sometimes it's easier to set
up recursion than it is to set up a loop
and so it's useful to do something with
recursion because it's simply much
easier to but that was shall we do
another recursive thing that maybe has a
point or should I I think I think we're
good look yeah okay yeah we don't want
to overload our students oh yeah but I
think that was a good
to my broadcast over here at office I
think like it's a recursion it's just
another way to use functions and once
you get the hang up like of knowing how
to return things know how to process
parameters arguments and know how to
process them and then you know basically
take take these functions that use them
in your day-to-day programming
recursion will we'll start to get make a
little more sense especially if you're
if it involves programs or problems that
involve algorithms or any other type of
mathematical or calculation where you're
not sure about the the length of like
your total calculations like let's
assume that I want to be able to
calculate ten things right I could just
simply use a loop but if I want to be
able to calculate it maybe ten things to
me maybe fifteen things it may be 120
things I don't know until I actually
execute it that's when recursion is
actually really really useful so but
yeah thanks for showing us give us a
little sneak peek so again in summary
about functions functions are again very
important these are the building blocks
of programming there are very very basic
ways to increase your efficiency as a
coder and also to increase your power
but again these days these are the base
things that you need to know in
programming in order for you to be able
to do like any other fancy stuff that
you you may have seen that other people
have done in program you know functions
are made of you know inputs and outputs
so basically a function is a way to map
an input to an output you take it you
take some sort of input we called it a
parameter or an argument we do something
to it and we transform it in some way
and then we give it an output we
actually actually return it or an or
change the argument if it's a mutable
variables such as a list we actually
process
and that's why we procedures and
functions are used interchangeably
because again it's your you're changing
something and you're either returning
the variable or you change the variable
and then you're just returning that what
else any other things to that our
students should walk away so functions
again just there's very very
foundational make sure you have a good
grasp on functions it's always it's
always good to try some stuff out
yourself
so maybe try out some stuff with local
and global scope thinking about what
what those mutable valuable variables
will how they'll actually change
depending on what you do inside your
function for instance the difference
between defining a new mutable variable
inside your function which would be
local scope versus changing that mutable
variable that you had from a global
scope which will be from the global
scope it's it's good to play around with
this stuff so that's I suppose my only
real recommendation there awesome we're
all thanks look for done awesome
presentation yeah so hopefully you walk
away and watching this broadcast and you
could you're fired up you could just try
it yourself just create functions and
just practice with it again practice
makes it like that's it's very true in
programming so it's just the world's our
playground you just fire up your Python
interpreter and just play around with
what exactly what Luke did and hopefully
you you just you'll you'll start to get
a good intuitive sense of what what
these functions are in Python great so
yeah we hope everyone got something away
from these functions I think next week
let's see it look at what what do we be
talking about next week
loading here so what's next week 19
could be next week I think that looks
like it's it's its style the importance
of following coding style yeah it's like
I don't know it was slow here so yeah
basically coding style for HTML CSS and
Python style so this is another very
important thing concept to learn is how
do you program in a good style that
makes your code readable and shareable
and also makes it more organized because
I really think if how you style and how
you organize your code tells a lot about
how you you know how efficient your your
program can it can't run like that's I
I'm a big big proponent of making sure
that your style your your variables are
defined right your your organizing your
code clean and clearly it shows that
your you have a good sense of what
you're doing and where you're going
awesome well hopefully we'll see you
next week all right
and they get one bite</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
