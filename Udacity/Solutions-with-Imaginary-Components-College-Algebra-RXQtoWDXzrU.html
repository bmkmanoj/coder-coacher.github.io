some number of solutions with an
imaginary component that it has to have
two of those kinds of solutions so in
other words it has to have two complex
solutions neither of which has a
coefficient of be equal to zero let's
look at the quadratic formula to think
about why this is true now the quadratic
formula gives us solutions that are in
this form let's write out the two
solutions separately for the time being
ran out like this we can see what may
have seemed hidden to you a little bit
before the only difference between the
solution and this one is that there's a
plus here between the negative B in this
part and there's a minus here between
the negative B and this part under the
radical sign now since we know the
imaginary part of our solution has to
come from this part with the radical and
will happen of course only at the
discriminant under here is negative that
means of these signs that are opposite
one another are separating the real
component of either solution from its
imaginary component that means at any
time we find imaginary solutions or
complex solutions with nonzero imaginary
components for a quadratic equation
those two complex numbers are going to
be complex conjugates of one another
this is super powerful super potent
we're going to continue to think about
this concept through many of the coming
lessons</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
