tests can check for how well observed
values fit the expected values for
categorical data in this case we have
some variable that's categorical there
are different responses for that
variable in our first example when we
were helping professor rogers decide
whether or not he should hire that guide
mountaineering company the variable was
success our responses were successful
versus unsuccessful in that case there
were just two responses but there can be
as many as we need for a particular
categorical variable and in the case of
goodness of fit our expected values are
what we guess for our null hypothesis
however in the case of independence our
expected values are based on the results
of our marginal totals let's just assign
some random numbers here we have an M by
n contingency table and let's say the
total number of subjects in the sample
was 100 we would expect that 15 out of
100 of our subjects would have response
one a variable 2 therefore we would
expect that same proportion to have
response one a variable 1 if there were
30 total in response one a variable 1
then we would expect 15 out of 100 x 34
this cell and here's what we would
expect for the other cells if it's
easier for you to remember the expected
values are the column totals times the
row totals divided by the total total
and then for both goodness of fit and
independence chi-squared tests we
calculate the chi-squared statistic by
taking the sum of each squared
difference between the observed and
expected values divided by the expected
value then we can use the chi-squared
table to determine if our results are
statistically significant that's if
we're doing it by hand but usually will
use software and the important part is
that you know how to interpret our
results</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
