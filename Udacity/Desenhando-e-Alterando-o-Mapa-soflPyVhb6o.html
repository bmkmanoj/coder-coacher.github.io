statement we should have a map drawn on
our page as you can see here we have a
map of the world and while there's a few
quirks in this case Greenland and the
top of the northern hemisphere slightly
cut off and Antarctica is huge we've
drawn an SVG map of all the countries in
the world with just a few lines of d3
and JavaScript this is quite an
accomplishment to better position our
map we can use this scale and translate
functions on the projection these both
allow us to move and manipulate the
visual display of the map think of scale
as similar to the plus and minus zoom
buttons on something like Google Maps
and translate as dragging the center of
the map to a different location in our
case we're setting the scale to be 170
and we're translating the center of our
map to be half the width and half the
height of our SVG element are ready on
the page I encourage you to play around
with the values of scale and translate
to really understand how they affect the
visual map that a reader looks at if we
then reload the page we can see here
there a map has been centered and it's
been zoomed out slightly so that we can
see all of the Northern Hemisphere and
still all of Antarctica for the rest of
this lesson I'm going to translate the
map down so that Antarctica gets cut off
since it's not in any world cup games
and the important parts of the map for
us in this case they participate in
countries in the world cup will be a bit
larger and easy to see and the last
change to make the map slightly more
readable and a little bit more
aesthetically pleasing is to change the
fill of the countries from black to
Udacity blue in this case to change the
outline of each country border to a
darker black line and to make the stroke
with slightly thinner so you can see
more detail in the borders of countries
going back to the map we can see here
that all the countries are filled in
with blue and the black stroke that's
slightly thinner
so much easier to see the different
countries on the map</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
