not by itself yet because it's being
multiplied by 3 the thing that undoes
multiplication is division so we need to
divide by the number we're presently
multiplying so I'm going to say we need
to divide this entire side by 3 now
whatever we do over here we also need to
do on the right side will divide 12 by 3
as well we know that 3 x over 3 gives us
just X which is why we want to divide by
three in the first place so now we need
to carry that out on the right hand side
12 / 3 is 4 so we get x equals four
checking our answer we have three times
four equals 12 and three times for does
in fact equal 12 so we're in good shape
a number 2 X is being divided by three
in the last problem we undid
multiplication with division so here we
can undo division with multiplication to
undo division by three we need to
multiply by that same number three you
do this to both sides and 12 times 3 is
36 checking 36 over 3 is in fact equal
to 12 awesome another one done last but
not least X minus 3 equals 12 this
problem is telling us that we're looking
for a number so that if we took three
away from that number we would get 12
that means that number is 3 greater than
12 then so to undo the subtraction on
the left hand side we need to add 3 and
over here we get x equals 15 we will
also confirm that 15 minus 3 equals 12
