ranks that had been a constant that we
had in the program before but I'm gonna
have to refer to it a couple times so i
called it out and gave it a name then i
defined all the red cards and all the
black cards those are what we're going
to substitute for the various jokers and
then here's best wild hand so what I did
is I said let's apply this function
replacement to each of the cards in hand
here's what replacement does replacement
takes a card and replaces or comes up
with a list of possibilities for that
card so if the card is a black joker
then it can be replaced with all the
black cards if the card is a red joker
it can be replaced with all the red
cards and otherwise it can replace only
with itself and we'll make that a list
because the interface here is that you
give me one card and I give you a list
of all the cards that can be replaced
with now what am I doing here this looks
a little bit tricky what I'm saying is
I'm calling inner tools dot product let
me explain to you what product does so
the product function takes a list of or
takes any number of lists or in fact
they can be iterable and here we're just
going to try to so the product of 123
and 100 200 products stands for a cross
product so we'd have all ways of taking
one item from this list and one item
from this list so that would return a
list and the pairs of items are put into
tuples so it'd be 1 101 200 to 100 to
200 3 103 200 so however many lists it's
given it picks out one element from each
puts that into a tuple and does that for
every possible combination of elements
from a B and whatever else there is
there so what we've done here is we've
called replacement on each card in the
hand and that gives us a list of
possibilities for each of the cards if
the cards not a joker that list will be
one if the card is a joker the
then it will be all the red cards or all
the black cards so now we have the
product of that so for all the seven
cards in the hand we've got this big
product and we go through and we take
all the possibilities and then for each
one of those each one of those
possibilities H we pick out the best
hand using the process that we did
before and that gives us a set of
possible hands and then we go through
those hands using hand rank these these
hands up now the five-card hands
determined by best hand and we take the
maximum again according to hand rank and
that gives us the best out of those five
cards now for both of these solutions to
the homework problems I was able to come
up with a small amount of code because I
knew about existing routines in the
standard Python library and if you
didn't know about those routines and if
you wrote a lot of lines of code rather
than just one or two don't feel bad you
got the practice doing that and and I'm
sure your code was good and did the
right job so you should feel proud that
you got it working but you should also
learn this lesson that you should try to
familiarize yourself with the tools that
already exist and use them when
appropriate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
