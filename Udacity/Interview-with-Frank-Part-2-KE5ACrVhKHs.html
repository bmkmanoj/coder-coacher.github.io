just got to be thinking it would be so
much simpler if the off variable just
had the email embedded in it instead of
limiting us to just having the UID in
the provider I've heard about custom
tokens not really sure what they are you
know what can I use that to my advantage
somewhere ya know that would solve a lot
of this problem oh yeah and if only I
had told you that sooner but now what
you would do is you would need to mint a
custom token as it's called essentially
what it means is we have all kinds of
libraries that you can use on a trusted
environment so that you don't use on the
Android device of the user but you can
run them on pretty much any server
environments or any other trusted
environment and you would essentially
you get to encode whatever information
you want and you sign it with the secret
of your firebase and you then use that
as two off variable in your security
rules and that means that you can put
any information you want in there so if
you've already verified to users email
address for example you can just put it
in there and then in your security rules
you can say off got email and use it
directly instead of having to load it
from your mapping table that you have
that actually sounds pretty awesome are
there so this seems like something that
people probably do fairly commonly are
there any sort of prepackaged or
third-party options or options that you
would suggest that already could get me
up and running with creating custom
tokens quickly yeah definitely so for
custom tokens typically if you have your
own existing user table then you need to
start meeting your own tokens but if you
want to integrate with all all kinds of
existing like social providers like the
Google Facebook but also providers that
firebase doesn't support like LinkedIn
then you could use all 0 and they
essentially means the custom token for
you and provide a lot more information
or variable that you can use ok cool so
basically what I'm here is that I could
run a tiny bit of server code even my
own android phone but probably somewhere
better than that and then that would
verify that the users are actually on
the email addresses that they say that
they own and that I could use a service
like all 02 then attached
that email address to the auth token and
easily use it throughout my rules yeah
well puff that sounds like a plan so
thanks for taking the time to talk to us
today I'm sure you have important things
to get to at Google you know the funny
thing is that before we started talking
I really was not a security believer I
didn't think it was that big of a deal
but what I'm realizing is that security
is something that you need to be
thinking about even at the stage that
you're thinking about how your dad is
going to be organized and it's super
important to get right so thank you so
much for showing me that now thanks for
allowing me to explain this because
indeed security is very important with
firebase right when you start data
modeling as you say you must also figure
out how you want to secure the database
because if you don't you never know who
you can trust in this world through you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
