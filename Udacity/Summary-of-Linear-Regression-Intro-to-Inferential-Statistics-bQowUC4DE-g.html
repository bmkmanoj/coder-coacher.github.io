now so we're just going to recap some
key concepts that you learned in this
lesson simple linear regression is when
we look at the relationship between an
independent variable which we often
symbolize by X and a dependent variable
which we symbolize by why we have data
values for X&amp;amp;Y which we can plot in a
scatter plot for each point these x and
y values are our observed values when we
calculate the regression line we got our
expected Y values for this x value here
the expected Y value is here and we
denote this by y hat the distance
between the observed value and the
expected value is called the residual
and this is an error term we find the
equation for our line of best fit by
minimizing the sum of squared residuals
and we get that our regression line has
a slope equal to our Pearson's
correlation coefficient times the ratio
of the standard deviations of the y to
the x values plus our y-intercept since
we know that our line of best fit goes
through the mean of X and the mean of Y
then we know the y-intercept is equal to
the mean of Y minus the slope times the
mean of X we can then replace that here
our full equation for the regression
line might look scary but now you know
how to calculate all of these you know
how to calculate Pearson's R and the
standard deviation of the Y values and
the standard deviation of the X values
and you know how to calculate the means
you'll never have to do this by hand
anymore just through google spreadsheets
after we have the equation for the line
of best fit we can input values of x to
get the predicted value of y it's super
useful and super awesome great job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
