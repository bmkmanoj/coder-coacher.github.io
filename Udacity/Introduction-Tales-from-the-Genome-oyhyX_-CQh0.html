much just a little light reading I
suppose did you start the game of
thrones series uh well nothing quite
that dense but I'm reading my genome
actually really what does it say let's
some pretty cool stuff here actually
I've got blue eyes apparently my blood
type is o-positive I seem to be able to
digest lactose products pretty well I
can't taste bitter flavors a cup of
coffee late at night doesn't bother me
because I metabolize caffeine pretty
quickly and somewhere in here Oh
actually have an increased risk for
Alzheimer's it tells you all of that I'm
going to see it actually your genome has
a lot more information than just what
you see here your genome can reveal a
lot about you but you have to know how
to understand and read the information
for it to make any sense well I can
understand that because that just looks
like a bunch of random letters to me
well I guess so in a sense that's what
your genome is a unique sequence of
letters that has the information to make
up who you are so you're saying all of
my cells in my body there's just little
letters well I guess so in a sense your
genomes and unique sequence of letters
much like this book is a unique sequence
of letters but in our genome those
letters are actually symbols that
represent a very famous chemical
substance that you can find inside all
yourselves and makes up the foundation
of your genome DNA we just learned in
the last lesson the DNA holds the secret
to who we are it's a very special
molecule that has many important
functions not least of which is that it
comprises the entirety of our genome
here's a concept map for lesson 2 that
you can also download from the
instructors notes and fill in the blanks
print it out or just keep it handy and
see if you can fill in those empty
blanks as we go through the lesson at
the end there would be an opportunity
for you to fill in the missing words to
see a complete version remember if you
prefer to have a complete lesson map as
you go through the lesson you can always
skip to the end download it from the
instructors notes and then you'll have
it however I highly encourage you to use
this incomplete version now print it out
fill in the blanks and then in the end
you'll see how much you've learned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
