might also want to involve your players
in the game creation process yeah for
our ball game I'm kind of stuck on ways
to improve it I can only get so far by
adding more rings of fire what else do
you think I should do well you could add
multiple balls of different sizes and
I'm kind of getting tired of the rings
of fire what about including different
obstacles like maybe walls that you will
avoid those are great ideas thanks for
your feedback I'm happy to help none of
us knows how to build the perfect game
but by listening to our players and
getting their feedback you can improve
your game and your players will know
that the input is valued so what are
some ways that we can include feedback
in a game app there are a couple of
meaningful ways to get feedback most
apps just use reviews and ratings but
you could also add in-app messaging
systems surveys forms and whatever else
you want to get to increase player
participation recently game developers
are actually inviting fans to watch them
on twitch as they are building the game
this is really cool because developers
can get real time feedback from
potential players one great example of a
strong gaming and player community is
the one for league-of-legends
league-of-legends gets feedback from
players from direct messages and from
forums the game has great graphics and
has a number of strong social components
players can chat with one another teams
compete and there are even tournaments
watch throughout the world between the
strongest players and with such involved
players this game makes a lot of money
off of in-app purchases that let players
personalize their experience and enhance
their gameplay lots of players get so
involved that they even create fan art
based off of the game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
