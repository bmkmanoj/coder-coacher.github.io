different features or different
dimensions throw us off has a name and
it's called the curse of dimensionality
nice audio effect I did like that out
effective in post-production and it
refers to well a very particular thing
so let me just read out what it refers
to as the number of features or
equivalently dimensions gross that is as
we add more and more features we go X
sub 1 X sub 2 let me add X sub 3 and I
and more and more these features as
those features grow is the number of
dimensions grown the amount of data that
we need to generalize accurately also
grows exponentially now this is a
problem of course because exponentially
means bad in computer science land
because when things are exponential
they're effectively untenable you just
you just sort of can't win I think
everybody knows that in the sense that
if you look I've done this experiment
actually if you look in the popular
press like you know Time magazine or New
York Times USA Today people will use the
word exponentially sometimes to mean
exponentially and sometimes to mean a
lot yeah that's actually a pet peeve of
mine the whole notion of you oh it's
exponentially bigger no that's that's
not meaningful if you're saying I have
one point and then I have another point
and I want to say this point is
exponentially bigger than this one
that's meaningless it's also literally
bigger than that one extra thing proves
to me they're not they're not they're
not talking about the mathematical
relationship they just mean a lot ok so
they're wrong and it bothers me deeply
but I'm willing to accept it for the
purposes of this discussion ok
exponentially means bad it means that we
need more and more and more and more
data as we add features and dimensions
now as a machine learning person this is
a real problem right because what you
want to do or likes what your instinct
tells you to do is oh we've got this
problem we've got a bunch of data we're
not sure what's important so why don't
we just keep adding more and more and
more features so you know we've got all
these sensors and we'll just add this
little bit and this a little bit and
we'll keep track of GPS location and and
we'll see the time of the day and we'll
just keep adding stuff and then we'll
figure out which ones are important but
the curse of dimensionality says that
every time you add another one of these
features you add another dimension to
your input space you're going to need
exponentially more data as you add those
features in order to be able to
generalize accurately this is a very
serious problem and it sort of captures
a little bit of what the difficulties
are in kN if you have atom if you have a
distance function or a similarity
function that assumes that everything is
relevant or equally relevant or
important and some of them aren't you're
going to have to see a lot of data
before you can figure that out sort of
before washes itself away this integral
it makes a lot of sense yeah it seems a
little scary so you know I think you can
say these words and the words sort of
make sense but I think it helps to kind
of draw a picture and so I'm going to
draw a little picture okay yeah all
right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
