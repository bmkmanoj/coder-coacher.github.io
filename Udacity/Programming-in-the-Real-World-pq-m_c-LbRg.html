pretty intimidated by all the new jargon
that people were using when I met people
that introduced themselves as
programmers developers or coders or when
they said words like front-end back-end
and data analyst I'd always ask so what
do you do again on top of that I wasn't
even sure about how coding would impact
my daily life it was really hard for me
to see how learning programming would
affect me in my current role but then I
started realizing how the knowledge of
programming can enhance different
people's lives here are some examples a
restaurant owner is able to build his
own website in HTML CSS and JavaScript
to advertise his business online he
might even be able to use Python or Ruby
to take customer orders a program
manager that works with software
engineers is able to understand the
technical components of a project and
analyze data a teacher may be able to
create a mobile app to remind his
students about homework that's due the
next day or an artist is able to put up
a responsive portfolio online for
clients to see as a dancer I realized
that I needed a way to share my work
with local dance companies once I
learned how to code I create a website
for my dance portfolio I didn't consider
myself a programmer at the time but
coding really impacted my role
programming skills can impact anyone
let's hear from Liz about how her new
skills have impacted her</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
