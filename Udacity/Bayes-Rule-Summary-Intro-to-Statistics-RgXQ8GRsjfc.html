we care about where they have cancer or
not but we can't measure it directly and
instead we have a test we have a prior
of our frequent this variables true and
the test is generally characterized by
he often says positive when the right
was true and well often says negative
and available as false based on antics
or prior multiplies in the measurement
which in this case we assume to be the
positive measurement to give us a new
variable and that's the same for our
actual measurement given the opposite
assumption about our hidden variable
cancer and that multiplication gives us
this guy over here we add those two
things up and it gives us a new variable
and then we divide these guys to arrive
you know best estimate of the hidden
variable see give no a test result and
in this example I used the positive
example as a test result but it might do
the same with a negative example this
was exactly the same as an hour diagram
in the beginning there was a prior of
our case that have this specific
variable to be true we noticed inside
this prior they can cover the region for
which our test result applies if we
notice the test I might also apply when
the condition is not fulfilled so this
expression over here in this expression
over here corresponds exactly to the red
area over here and the green area over
here but then we notice that these two
areas don't add up to one the reasons
has lots of stuff outside so we
calculated the total area which was his
expression over here pee pause and then
we normalized these two things over here
by the total area to get the relative
area there is a sign so the red thing
was the green thing and it was done by
just dividing by the total area in this
region over here thereby getting rid of
any of the other cases</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
