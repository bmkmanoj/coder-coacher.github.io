Henri Malaya said one thing we didn't
discuss about HM was a task they had him
engage in in this task neural
psychologist Brenda Milner who was
working with HM had him perform a mirror
tracing tasks like this one HM was to
trace within two lines of the star while
viewing it only through a mirror which
was the reverse image so if his hand
moved one way the hand in the mirror
moved the other the asset hm to perform
this task up to ten times each day for
three days they counted the errors each
time he went outside of the lines what's
interesting is that HMS drawings
improved even though he couldn't recall
having done this task before now you're
looking at the times that I tried it and
I'll be honest this task was really hard
to do so what does this tell us about
the brain HM didn't remember engaging in
this task but he visibly improved well
it turns out that he couldn't form new
explicit long-term memories due to
damage to his hippocampus and
surrounding areas but he could learn new
skills as was demonstrated by his
performance on this task</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
