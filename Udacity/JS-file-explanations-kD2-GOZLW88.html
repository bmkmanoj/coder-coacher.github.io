surrounding some of the files we provide
students like the engine and the
resources so all the work that students
will be doing will be in the app js5
which is has tons of comments in it so
make sure you read through that file
first before you even start
Mike put in sort of comments that sort
of guide you through what you have to
build if you haven't had a chance to
look at it I mean it just kind of gives
you the basic structure for a few things
and then you just have to sort of flesh
out the rest of yep we'll start with the
engine I guess so as I mentioned a game
is really just a a flipbook it's the
process of drawing images on top of each
other over and over and over and it
provides the optical illusion of
animation so we created this engine dot
J's file because we haven't taught you
anything about the canvas tag yet really
at this point but we do have the html5
canvas course which is awesome so
actually I went through that one last
night that's a lot of it is a lot of fun
it's really cool Cameron and James that
are really good job so again if you
haven't had a chance to look at the
html5 canvas course and you're
interested in that kind of stuff it's a
really fun short course I think it's two
lessons yeah it took me like an hour to
have to get through yeah and it's a lot
of fun and it'll teach you a lot of
what's going on in this engine that j/s
file but that's the reason this file
exists isn't because for the purposes of
object learning in JavaScript we don't
really want you to worry about what's
going on on the canvas so this file
creates a canvas element for you and
puts it on the screen then sets up what
we call a game loop your typical game
loop has a render function which will
render everything on the screen based
off of various data points and then
it'll have an update function which
serves as updating those data points
it's like flipping the page exactly so
let's take your player character for
instance when you first start the game
up your player character should have
like an x and y position of where it's
at and a sprite that tells you what
image to load anytime you press the up
key we listen for that event and then in
your players update function you
you'd say okay if the up key is pressed
I need to decrease my x value on that
player from this to this the update
function only updates that property it's
the render function that later on says
okay now redraw everything and by the
process of that X property being
different now your character is drawn in
a different location in the main
function of you see we're con playing
around with dates and times a little bit
the reason we do that is to provide the
opportunity for smooth animation so
everyone's computer like I don't know
the kind of computer you have and you
know if you run this on a MacBook Pro or
MacBook Air your computer can process
animation faster than mine potentially
or slower and so what that means is on
your computer for every tick and a tick
is the the game loop each time it loops
we call that a tick so it updates and
renders and that's a tick if you're on a
really good computer your ticks will be
going really really fast and my ticks on
a slower computer might not be going
that quick and the way that plays itself
out is your bugs are screaming across
the screen really quick and mine are
cruising along a little slower so we
need a constant to smooth this out and
make sure that my ticks and your ticks
generate a same pace for these
animations thankfully time is a pretty
good constant so anytime you have smooth
animation you want to multiply that
animation against the difference of the
time that the last tick ran and the
green tick and that's what creates the
smooth animation for your bugs that way
your bugs run just as quickly as mine do
and the variable we have to find that at
the DT variable the engine function also
draws what we call the level and so
that's the base layer if you think of
kind of layering a cake you know the
level we draw first and then we draw all
our characters because they're
transparent PNG so we can draw them
without affecting things so we also take
care of drawing the level for you you
can go in and modify this if you want to
there's a plenty of people have made the
board wider or taller or added their own
sprite Givens like that it's pretty easy
if you want to modify it you pretty much
just add a new new item into the array
to the array and then either increase or
decrease the number of rows and columns
based on how big you want it yep and we
have all the code there to uh to handle
loading up your images so I guess we'll
look at resources J s this is just a an
easy image loader for you so loading an
image and JavaScript can kind of be an
intense process so you have to create a
new image and then you have the Ohio
source attribute to it and if you want
any events to happen when that image
loads and you have to do things in a
different order it can get messy so all
this does is it handles all of that for
you so you have a really nice helper
function called resources get any time
you call that with passing any URL it'll
go grab that URL for you and load it up
as an image you can use in your canvas
one of the other benefits of this is
that we have a caching layer like a
really simple cache built in so if you
call resources get an image a hundred
times it's only gonna go build that
image one time because it knows it
already has it so it just it just helps
in a memory and performance I'm going to
show you guys umm.yeah jeaious which is
very important which is what you will be
working with as you can see we have
already provided you with an enemy class
so in JavaScript a class object or an a
function is going to look the same and
is going to be defined the same way so
when you see a variable enemy equals
function this is actually an enemy class
and they have given this dot sprite so
sprite is actually a keyword for
representing images so it's going to
give you the image of the enemy and then
right here you have a the update
function for the enemies as well as the
render function for the enemy so these
are going to be the member functions of
the enemy class and as you can see the
update function takes in DT so the DT
parameter is to be multiplied with the
movement of the for smooth
transition that is why we are doing it
and
it's going to be the same on all
browsers on all sort of operating
systems so you don't need to worry about
it and that's why we use the Delta
parameter um render is again going to
render the bug and then what you're
going to do is add in the player class
very similar to the enemy class only
that um you should add in an additional
functionality in your player class which
is called check collisions because every
time a bug and a player collide you need
to reset the game so that is why you are
going to be using the check collisions
function I only at the end as you can
see we have a number of keys specified
left right up and down so then these
keys are going to be an event listener
so anytime you hold down any of these
keys the left right up or down arrows
you need to call an handle input method
that is going to increment or decrement
your X my values for your player
depending on his movements so left is
going to you know move the player left
and right are going to move the player
along the y axis whereas up and down
will move the player along the y axis so
you need to define another method called
handle input that is going to take in
that is going to listen to your keyboard
strokes and do the necessary movements
um so that's about it with the after J's
file and to look into the rubric Amanda
do you have any important pointers for
our students um I think the most
important thing I've seen in students is
not taking as much time as they might
need to to just really look through
what's already here I think it's really
important to get comfortable with the
starters code and then recall that most
of your code is going to go into the yes
yeah that's like where you were going to
do most of your work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
