sitting on a swing set here that's one
meter off the ground and the swing
itself is suspended four meters below
the top of the swing set here now it
turns out we can view the movement of
you on the swing moving back and forth
as being the same as the movement of a
pendulum back and forth so for this
problem imagine that the maximum angle
you ever reach away from the vertical
here is 45 degrees so when you swing
back all the way and you run out of
velocity you're at 45 degrees away from
the vertical line here one time when
you're swinging forward however you
decide to jump off the swing when the
swing makes an angle with the vertical
of exactly 30 degrees and of course you
end up going flying and making a
parabolic trajectory in the air before
you finally land on the ground now can
you tell me how far away from the swing
you'll land you should measure this
distance from the point on the ground to
right below the point where you jumped
off the swing also for this problem you
should assume that you have a mass of 60
kilograms put your answer here good luck
now just as a hint for solving this
problem you're probably going to have to
use conservation of energy so keep that
in mind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
