education I can think a few people more
interesting and qualified to talk about
it then dr. Sebastian Thrun so thank you
so much for talking to us for a few
minutes today it's a pleasure so the
first thing I wanted to ask is that me
decis mission is democratizing education
for those students that we have that
aren't too familiar with what that means
going to give a rundown of what that
means in practice what I would say today
we live in a world where good education
is extremely locked up and inaccessible
is expensive it's hard to get in and
it's not geographically distributed
which means the greatest institutions
aren't done on the naphtha car places
like these democratization means
everybody should have access we should
have access to clean drinking water to
security and to good education I think
education is fundamental in making
giving people a chance to play in this
world I think that's very very relevant
to what we do in the LMS program as you
know because it's you know so low cost
it's so flexible it so distributed that
we have people especially people in this
class who could never take a class like
this or do a program like this
traditionally because they can't take a
couple years off work or they can't you
know pay six figures just to get a
masters degree I'm what I wonder is
especially since this is an educational
technology class is technology a
necessary part of that does it enable us
to do something now that we couldn't do
before or are we just the only ones who
are finally coming around and saying hey
let's do this absolutely it's a
necessary but not a sufficient component
I don't think technology alone will be
the suit and education but I think we
live in a world with synology that we
now have mobile devices we have ability
to record video to do interactive things
like video games and those ought to play
a role if you'd asset we've done this
quite a bit and be exploring what's the
best way to deliver education and to
have interaction with students and
foster interactions but technology plays
a huge part in this is the LG mostly
about the getting the access to the
education or is there other things that
technology does for us that we couldn't
do in the past every time you move to a
different medium I think everything
changes so the way we do lectures today
a single professor speaking to many many
students is because the technology were
using is our natural human voice as we
change this into a more recorded
technology and digital technology we can
really change the entire idea of
lectures we don't need lectures anymore
we can do it much more attractive turns
out in technology you can actually make
a class as much fun as
video game and the video game is killing
not to select choice a few sunny make it
a bit a student can do something
exercise their own skills I would like
to thank the deck I technology is what
allows this class to happen it's allowed
us to have a kind of communication
between instructors and TAS and students
that we really can't have in person
where everything is very guarded in
terms of how much time you have to give
to it um so we have a lot of people in
the class and I bet that there is some
out there or wondering do I want to go
into research but I want to go into
business and the class project we have
this class is very much built around
either doing something that could become
a research project or doing something
that could become a start-up or a tool
to it using the program you're one of
the only people i know that succeeded in
both realms so you have any thoughts for
anyone who might be struggling with
whether they want to go to research
route or the business route I wouldn't
struggle about the research versus
business i think is kind of very much
the same to be honest i would struggle
about impact and about the willingness
to experiment and to learn i think so
much has not been discovered yet i think
we could look back a hundred years from
now and ask what did he does it with the
time you're probably concluded was
probably gutsy to do what we're doing
but it wasn't that good i think it's
gonna get much better and it's gonna get
much better by you students doing great
experiments and trying things out even
non-conventional things and if you're
able to make a dent in people's ability
to learn using digital only and do it in
a way that it's I don't know financially
viable doesn't require hand I thought a
thousand professor sit there and watch
your hand then you might turn into a
research paper or you might also to a
new startup company or you might join
Udacity and work with us to make the
world a better place it sounds fantastic
to me that's really the guiding
principle behind why we started this
class so I'm very final thoughts for
students taking a master's level
educational technology class I think the
key thing is really experimentation I
have this very deep believe in my heart
that we can make the world a better
place by democratizing education and
that requires technology otherwise you
couldn't afford doing it and what you
can do as students students in your
class can do is to really kind of do
crazy things do something that looks
like it's going to fail to think it's
audacious to something that's really out
of the world no one has tried before go
to Twitter go to Facebook make something
crazy heaven and make it happen in a
short amount of time so you don't waste
too much of your own time and look at
the data coming back I think there's a
lot of surprises in there you
have a lot of good stuff and when you
find something great come back to us and
send us the application we love to have
you sounds great well thank you again so
much for talking with us and yeah thank
you trigger</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
