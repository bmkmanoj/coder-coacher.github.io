olympics Andy can you give us an
overview and what's been going on yet so
we've had a four event so far and in
this first event we found that our
contestants can only detect a difference
in a way of about three percent in the
second our contestants identified the
five primary flavors and in these last
two events we discovered or push the
limits of the threshold of human hearing
and what we learned was that humans can
really hear between twenty and twenty
thousand Hertz and that the quietest
sound we can hear is about zero decibels
Oh any something's been bothering me how
exactly does hearing work what do you
mean by that that's pretty big question
well okay so I know sound vibrates air
but once those vibrations get into my
ear how do I perceive that sound that's
a really good question that and actually
the transduction of a sound wave to
apperceive sound is a pretty complicated
process</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
