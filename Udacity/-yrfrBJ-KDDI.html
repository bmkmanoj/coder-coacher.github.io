core customer data with a data set that
includes their first purchase date so
that I have that field appended to the
core customer data I bring in the joint
tool and attach the core customer data
to the left side marked with the L and
the first purchased data to the right
side whenever you bring in this tool the
first thing you need to do is configure
how the joint is going to happen in this
case we have a customer ID field in both
datasets one is called customer ID and
the other is just called ID so we can
use this field from both datasets as you
can see here the ID field can have
different names but as long as you are
manually defining which fields to join
together then they will join if the same
ID number exists in each of the data
sets let's run the workflow to see the
results if we look closely at the joint
tool we can see three outputs the J
represents the data that was joined
together between the two sides we can
see the core customer data on the left
and the first purchase data on the right
notice how the ID field we use to join
with is duplicated customer ID and ID we
can go back to the join tool and
deselect it from the right side so it
only comes through once so deselect the
ID field and then we'll run the workflow
again notice how the ID field is no
longer shown in the final result if we
take a look at the data coming out of
the L side this is the data from the
left input that did not join to the
right input because we were joining on
that customer ID field and the ID field
this one record with an ID of 456 does
not exist in the data coming in from the
right side we have six unique IDs coming
in from the left and five unique IDs
in from the right so the result is five
records joined with one record unjoined
on the left if we look at the right side
output we see no records they're all of
the input records from the right side
joined to the left it's important to be
able to see what does not join in your
data because this can help identify
missing records dirty data or other
issues</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
