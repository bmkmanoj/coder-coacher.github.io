gonna I'm gonna go into Python and we're
gonna play with the Python library for
actually making an HTTP request so you
can see how that works and then prepare
for some quizzes so in Python we have a
library called URL Lib - there's
actually there's also URL Lib 1 and this
is kind of the evolution of Python in
front of you here we're going to use -
for the most part URL of one has a few
handy handy functions of its own and
when we use those I'll include those in
documents but anyway so URL Lib 2 has a
function in it called URL open and we
can give a URL here to download so let's
say I'm downloading Google com
actually I need to make sure I save this
I usually save it in a variable called P
for page probably not even the right
concept but that's that's my habit I
always use P when I use the URL open so
if you run this we're going to get this
P object which is actually basically a
file object and in Python file objects
basically what a file object is is an
object that has a read method and you
can call read on there to get the
contents so I'm gonna store the contents
in C and call read on P okay so we
called URL open on this URL starting and
storing it in this variable P and then
we called read on the response started
in a variable called C and now if we
were to evaluate C a wall of text which
is what we expect so this is actually
google's front page now if you remember
early in this class we basically
accomplished the same thing using telnet
or curl you can also do the same thing
in Python and so now we have this
variable C that has this whole response
in it and you can manipulate it in our
programs which is what we're going to be
doing a lot of let's take a peek at what
we have on the on that P object and we
can use the der built-in function and
Python to examine an object okay so now
we can see the methods and attributes on
our p object and we can see a couple of
them that are probably interesting to us
headers for one and get URLs another get
code is probably the status code and
this is generally how I work you know
when you don't know a library super well
you can use der to kind of examine the
object so let's take a peek at a couple
of these we've also got a URL one let's
see what's in there that's the you are
the URL we requested not big surprise we
could look at the headers so this is an
HTTP message instance
I happen to know that this is a
dictionary and dictionaries have a
function on them called items and if we
were to run items on this in Python this
is what you can call in any dictionary
items to view the the keys and the
values and it'll actually print them
generally nicely for you we can see all
of the headers we got back from Google
now this is an actual dictionary so we
can say P dot headers for example
content type we can see the content type
that we got back from Google that's
actually kind of interesting we're using
getting an ISO car set which is you know
I was expecting utf-8 but hey you'll
learn things every day so in the future
especially for your Windows users who
had trouble using telnet you can just
use URL and do the same and get the same
answer and what I'd like you to do now
is play with this library a little bit
in the form of a quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
