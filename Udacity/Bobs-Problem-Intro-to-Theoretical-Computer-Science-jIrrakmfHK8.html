second computer scientists Bob Bob is
working in biotechnology or
bioinformatics and the problem that Bob
is working on is he's doing gene
analysis so he's looking at a bunch of
different genes such as these one here
so Bob is basically trying to figure out
how genes work together which groups of
genes get activated say when a cell
develops a disease or when it's infected
as opposed to the healthy cell so Bob
will receive data from a laboratory that
will tell him which genes work together
or which get activated under certain
conditions and which genes don't so for
example these two genes here will get
activated more or less under the same
conditions also these two here but these
two here they appear to be kind of
independent in laboratory research so of
course Bob does not only receive data on
two genes but on a number of genes and
of course there are many more
interactions so it's a group of genes
that tends to work together quite a lot
and so since bob is trying to figure out
which groups of genes work together what
he's basically looking for is a
collection of genes that are all
connected to each other so I'll just
give you one example this here these
three genes are all connected to each
other so this is kind of the type of
group that he's looking for what you
would not be looking for is for example
something like this these four genes
here most of them are connected to each
other but not every single one of them
is connected to every other so this gene
here is not connected to that one and
the reason why he's looking for these
clusters of genes is that when you find
a group of genes where each gene
displays a very similar behavior to
every other gene then you have a kind of
functional cluster so a large set of
genes that can be assumed to be involved
in the same processes and you can then
use this for drug targeting or figuring
more out about the disease so this
problem is a bit of a simplification of
what you might encounter in the real
biotechnology setting for example you'd
normally be content with these four
genes here that are not all fully
connected
but looking for genes where every gene
is connected to every other one is a bit
more convenient to work with and
actually it doesn't really make much of
a difference from an algorithmic
perspective so let's say it's realistic
enough</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
