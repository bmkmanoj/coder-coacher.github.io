on quantum computing so breelan what
does quantum physics have to do with
computing quantum physics actually has a
lot to do with computing if you think
about the algorithms that you've been
learning about in your course for
searching the web and doing things like
this everything that you program is
built on a fundamental model of
computing that that manipulates a
registry of zeros and ones everything is
transformed into machine instructions to
manipulate these bits but in quantum
computing I should get to replace these
bits or something called qubits which
give you a lot more power so what can
you do with a qubit that you can't do
with a regular business so with regular
bits they're either 0 or 1 and there's
no middle ground but with a quantum bit
you can actually exist in a
superposition of 0 and 1 so right now I
have this coffee cup which to the view
the viewer doesn't know whether or not
it has any coffee in it so right now it
exists in a superposition of being
filled and unfilled until I measure aka
take a sip and so you can see that there
is coffee in this cup now the cool thing
about quantum information is that it
takes a lot more classical information
to describe the same system so but at
the end of a quantum algorithm to get
the access to M for this information you
have to take a measurement which
actually destroys the system so if
you're really clever with how you devise
your algorithm you can sort of access
this exponential amount of information
in a way that allows you to solve a
problem faster by making a correct
measurement at the end and so this
allows you to do things like factor
integers faster or simulate quantum
systems which gives you a lot of
progress in physics that we haven't been
able to see recently well all this talk
about physics is making me thirsty I
think it's time to go get a coffee
