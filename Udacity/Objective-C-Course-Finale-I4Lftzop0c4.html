yeah I'm having some trouble deciding
what to do about the Udacity a pre right
who are you gonna rewrite the Udacity up
and Swift you know I do code more
quickly and Swift but rerunning the
entire app would be a lot of work on the
other hand I don't really want to write
new features of infective see did
someone say Objective C Objective C is
so dynamic doesn't it make you feel like
you have more power as a developer yeah
that's true but Swift is a more modern
concise language and I'd probably
improve performance yeah that's true too
you know the more I think about it I
think the best move might be to try to
use them both mmm but objective-c and
Swift are so different how are we going
to get them talking to each other
you say a new and I say enough you say
that I make a nice save static enum enum
dynamic static let's call the whole
thing off you see kit fee and I say
Jaffe you call a function and I send a
message giphy giphy function message
let's call the whole thing off but
oh if we call the whole thing off you
lose foundation and oh if we ever part
then that might break my up so if I like
typed arrays and you like them untyped
I'll take them untyped with optional
casting for we know we need each other
so we better call the calling off off
let's master interop you see care and
you say cover I like to swizzle and I do
not swizzle care cuz swizzle nose
whistling let's call the whole thing off
if we call the whole thing off you lose
core data if we ever port then that
might break my app so if I pass you Neil
values with you once the morning you can
use no ability annotations oh no we need
each other so we better call the calling
off off let's measure
yes master</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
