Store I know and most of them are
probably made by really awesome
developers but it's not enough anymore
just to be an awesome developer
unfortunately a lot of these apps get
really low ratings and low ratings are
almost always a sign of bad user
experience design with that in mind
welcome to UX design for mobile
developers this class will teach you
developers how to design amazing apps
that get 5 stars my name is naziball
i am a developer advocate at Google and
I specialize in Android and user
experience design hi and I'm Isabel I'm
an Android interaction designer and
prototyper
awesome does well why are we teaching
this class well currently today the
world of design and development are
largely siloed and this is crazy because
we all have the same goal which is to
make amazing applications that our users
love and the goal of this course is to
help bring these two worlds together and
help you become a design minded
developer so you know to make amazing
apps you really have to know a limit of
both as a developer you have to think a
little bit like a designer I actually
consider myself to be a design minded
developer so if I were to place myself
on a scale of design and development
skills I would say I'm a 10 on develop
and maybe like a 7 on design so as well
where do you see yourself on the scale
for designer I would put myself at at in
cool and for development since I'm a
prototyper I would put myself in about a
4 No nice so where do you see yourself
on the scale I want you to really think
about this because at the end of this
class we will ask you to take this quiz
again and hopefully you will have moved
way higher on the design scale</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
