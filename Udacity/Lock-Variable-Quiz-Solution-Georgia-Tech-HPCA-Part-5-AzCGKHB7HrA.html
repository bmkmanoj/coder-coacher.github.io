variable quiz in this code we are using
the log count lock and it's really an
array of lock that has elements so we
are indexing into the array and getting
that one element of the array and that's
our lock that we lock to access count of
L and then we unlock that lock so the
question was what is really this lock is
it just another location in shared
memory so count lock of L really is just
a memory word or is it a location in
some sort of special synchronization
memory so there is a sort of special
memory where this array of locks is
residing or is it that locks are special
variables that we can refer to like this
in code but really they don't have
memory addresses whatsoever the correct
answer here is that a lock is just
another location in shared memory so a
lock is a variable just like any other
variable it has a memory address we can
load to get its value we can store to
change its value and so on
so now we will see what that variable
looks like and what the lock and unlock
functions are supposed to look like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
