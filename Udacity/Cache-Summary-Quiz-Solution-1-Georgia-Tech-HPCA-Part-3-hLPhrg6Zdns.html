summary quiz part 1 we have a 256 byte
cache with 32 byte lines and 2-way
set-associative we have a 32-bit address
we need to know which bits are tagged
index and offset remember to always
start from the offset bits 0 through
something are they offset which bit well
32 bytes is 2 to the 5th bytes so we
need 5 bits to tell us which byte we
have in a line that means that we are
talking about bits 0 through 4 this is 5
bits because we begin at 0 the index
bits are the next bits in the order of
significance so they will begin at bit 5
the question is how many do we need to
determine that we need to determine how
many sets do we have in this cache the
cache has 256 bytes divided by 32 bytes
this is the number of lines and the
result is eight so we have eight lines
it is a 2-way set-associative cache so
we have eight over two sets this is four
we need two bits to tell us which set we
have so it's gonna be bits 5 &amp;amp; 6 and
that means that the tag bits are
starting from 7 all the way to 31</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
