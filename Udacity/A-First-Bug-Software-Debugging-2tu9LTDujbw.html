we're not taking care of the quotes in
the HTML markup actually anything that's
within these quotes in HTML markup
should not end HTML markup in particular
not the greater sign in here so we need
to extend a program appropriately there
dere's as follows
rather than having two states one for
regular text and one for HTML markup
we're going to have a third state which
would handle anything that's within
quotes just as before we start in a non
tag mode and when we see a less than
sign we go into tag mode this is what we
do when we process this very input and
we stay in this mode until we find a
quote that's when we go in quote mode
and we stay in quote mode until we find
another quote that's when we go back
into tag mode which happens right here
when we see the greatest sign we exit
tag mode and we process the individual
characters and we add them to the output
the sir output should now become foo as
expected the remaining tag is processed
just as before it's in order to
implement this we're going to use two
variables one variable tag and one
variable quote to indicate the three
different states a program can be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
