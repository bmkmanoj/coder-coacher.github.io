ways that iOS apps present multiple
pages of content we said that we'd
return for a deep dive into how side to
side navigation presentation works and
here we are using navigation controllers
is an absolutely fundamental skill we're
also going to take one more step with
you I table views and make an app that
responds when a user taps a table row an
essential interaction when navigating a
multi-page app let's look at a few
examples of side to side navigation here
in the Settings app you can see that
tapping on a cell drills down into the
next layer of the navigation hierarchy
the Settings app has multiple layers
let's say I want to change my serie
settings I tap general and then Siri
language and then I can give Syria an
Australian accent I can always return to
the previous view with this back button
ultimately bringing me back to the root
view controller notice how intuitive
this flow is users have come to expect
this type of movement through a layered
structure if you take advantage of iOS
UI conventions in your app design your
users won't need to be told how to find
what they're looking for let's check out
the iOS music app if I go into the more
tab it brings up a table of options then
if I drill down into genres and country
eventually I can bring up the songs from
my favorite show Nashville you can see
how ubiquitous table views are in iOS
apps this action button on the right
takes me to the song that's currently
playing once in the player this action
button brings up a modal with album info
have a close look at the navbar the back
button in the title are standard they're
always there the action button on the
right is optional but something you'll
see frequently how does the app know
where to go when the back button is
pressed when we drill past a page of
content where does it go in other words
what kind of state is being managed by
this navigation controller we have to
figure all of this out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
