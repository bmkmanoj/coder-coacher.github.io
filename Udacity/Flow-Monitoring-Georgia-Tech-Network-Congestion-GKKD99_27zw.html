actually be running on the router itself
record statistics per flow a flow
consists of packets that share a common
source and destination IP address source
and destination port protocol type toss
byte and interface on which the packets
arrived a flow monitor can then record
statistics for a flow that's defined by
the group of packets that share these
features the flow records may also
contain additional information such as
the next hop IP address and other
information related to routing such as
the source and destination AAS on which
those packets appear to be coming from
and going to
based on the routing tables as well as
the prefix that those packets matched in
the routing table flow monitoring is
much less overhead than packet
monitoring but it's also much more
coarse than packet monitoring because
the monitor does not see individual
packets or payloads therefore it's
impossible to get certain information
from flow monitoring such as packet
timing information in addition to
grouping packets into flows based on the
fact that they share common elements in
their headers typically packets are
grouped into flows if they occur close
together in time so for example if
packets that share common sets of header
fields do not appear for a particular
time interval such as 15 or 30 seconds
the router simply declares the flow to
be over and sends a flow record to the
monitor based on the group of packets
that it's seen up to that point
sometimes to reduce monitoring overhead
flow level monitoring may also be
accompanied with sampling sampling
builds flow statistics based only on
samples of the packets so for example
flows may be created based on one out of
every ten or a hundred packets or a
packet might be sampled with a
particular probability and flow
statistics might only be tabulated
Shawn the packets that end up being
sampled randomly from the total set of
packets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
