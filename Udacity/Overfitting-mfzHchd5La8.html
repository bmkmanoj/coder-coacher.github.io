haven't yet to find it before we could
define it and I could give you an
example we needed to have a definition
of error let me now show you what I mean
let's consider parameterised polynomial
models where we can one at a time add
additional factors like xx squared X
cubed x to the fourth and so on
let's create a graph where we have along
the horizontal axis degrees of freedom
or D the degree of our polynomial and
vertically here we'll have the error of
our model so let's measure error as we
increase D on our training set so when D
is smallest our error is greatest and as
we increase D our error drops and drops
and drops in other words we're fitting
the data in sample better and better
when finally we get to in where we have
as many parameters in our model as we do
have items in our data set our error
gets all the way down to zero this is in
sample error now let's add a similar
line for out-of-sample error remember
that we expect our out-of-sample error
to always be greater than or equal to in
sample error the curve will look
something like this it'll start out at
maximum error about the same as our in
sample line and as we go down they'll
begin to diverge like this now in this
region both our in sample and
out-of-sample errors are still
decreasing but eventually we'll reach a
point where our out-of-sample error
begins to increase in fact it may
increase strongly in this area as we
increase degrees of freedom our in
sample error is decreasing but our
out-of-sample error is increasing and
that's how we define overfitting this is
the region where overfitting is
occurring so let me state that again in
sample error is decreasing out-of-sample
error is increasing and we have those
two together it's overfitting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
