knowledge base air agents in CS 76 37 is
that the architecture of knowledge-based
AI agents enables reasoning learning and
memory to support and constrain each
other instead of building a theory of
reasoning or problem-solving by itself
or a theory of learning by itself or a
theory of memory by itself we are
tractable unified theories theories
where reasoning learning and memory
coexist memories toast and organizes
knowledge learning acquires knowledge
reasoning uses knowledge knowledge is
the glue between these three one place
we saw reasoning learning and memory
coming together very well was in
production systems when reasoning failed
and an impasse was reached then memory
provided some episodic knowledge and the
learning mechanism chunking extracted a
rule from that episodic knowledge and
that rule broke the impasse and
reasoning could proceed pace this was a
clear example where reasoning learning
and memory came together in a unified
architecture and logic memory or the
knowledge-based may begin with a set of
axioms and those set of axioms decide
what we can prove using that particular
najuk to look at the problem conversely
depending upon the reasoning we need to
put things in the knowledge base so that
the reasoning can be supported
explanation based learning was another
place where reasoning learning and
memory came together so well memory
supplied us with the earlier precedence
reasoning led to the composition of this
explanation which explained why an
instance was an example of a cup this
led to learning about the connections
between these various precedence into an
explanation learning by correcting
mistakes was yet another example of
learning reasoning a memory coming
together when a failure occurred then
the agent used his previous knowledge
memory to reason and identify default
responsible for the failure reasoning
and then
that particular fault learning
Organic correct knowledge does the
knowledge-based paradigm says that we
want to build theory that a unified the
connect reasoning learning and memory
and this also connects very well with
human cognition human cognition of
course has reasoning learning and memory
intertwined together it is not as if
memory and human cognition works by
itself or learning works by itself or
reasoning works by itself you cannot
divorce them from each other</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
