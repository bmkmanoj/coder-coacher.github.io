divided by negative 8 since the negative
sign can go either with the numerator or
the denominator just belongs to the
fraction as a whole it means to get X by
itself you just need to multiply both
sides by negative eat on the left side
that leaves us with x on the right side
we have negative 16 but just like before
we have to flip the sign direction we
get x is less than negative 16 as always
I'm going to check my solution with a
number line x is less than 16 is this
region over here let's pick one value
inside this region and see if it
satisfies this inequality negative 20 s
over there so negative 20 over negative
8 is just five over two or two and a
half two and a half is greater than two
so we're good on that now let's pick one
value to the right in the region where
values that we plug in should not
satisfy this inequality I'll pick 0
since it's always my favorite number two
pick 0 / anything including negative 8
is just equal to 0 and 0 is not greater
than 2 so this also confirms our
solution set so we can see that whether
we divide or we multiply both sides of
an inequality by a negative number we
have to switch the sign of the
inequality remember division
multiplication are very very intimately
