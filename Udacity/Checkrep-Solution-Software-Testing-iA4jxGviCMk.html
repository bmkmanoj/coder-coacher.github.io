added but let's look at those some of
the ones that I decided to add so one
condition we can do is if self dot tail
is greater than soft ahead then the
difference between them has to be the
size that is to say the distance between
the head and tail has to be the number
of elements currently in the queue on
the other hand if the tail is less than
the head then it means the tail has
already wrapped around and in this case
the difference between head and tail has
to be equal to max minus the size of the
queue the third case that we have here
is that if the head and tail are at the
same place then either the queue is
empty or the queue is full so let's go
ahead and run this on the buggy code and
see what happens
so we violated an assertion and better
yet we violated an assertion in the
checkrep function so that's good so what
this means is by violating an assertion
and a checkrep function we caught the
bug or terminate the program and we can
debug the code using sort of localized
debugging inside this data structure we
don't have to do some huge tracking down
of where the bad values came from okay
so we want to do one final check here to
make sure my assertions are right I want
to go to my buggy key code
fix it and run the code again and what
we want is all of these assertions
should succeed during the test cases
okay good so that was the case</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
