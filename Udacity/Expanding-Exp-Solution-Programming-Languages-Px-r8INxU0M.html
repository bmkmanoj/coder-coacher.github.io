complete the definition of expand with
just two lines if i use yielding
generators and list comprehensions later
on let's go take a look and see how this
goes well we're past in a set of tokens
like a XP and now we're going to
consider each possible position the 0th
position which is a and the first
position which is x and then for each
rule in the grammar we want to see if it
matches now remember none of the rules
in our grammar match a so we're going to
need our program to deal with that
correctly the token it pause might be a
the first time and X for the second time
we have to check and see if that matches
the left hand side of the grammar rule
remember let's go back up to our
encoding of the grammar we always had
the left hand side as the zeroth element
of this tuple and the right hand side
was the first so we're going to check
and see if these strings equal exp only
if they do do we want to apply the
transformation so if we're in the right
position like we're in position one and
we see an exp great now what I need to
do is for each of the rules in our
grammar yield or return one of those
results so conveniently we've got this
other for loop up here for each rule in
our grammar I'm going to use this
expression that I showed you before we
take token zero through the position for
us that's that a that's being unchanged
right we're just carrying that along I'm
going to yield that we're going to add
to it the right hand side of the rule
expression plus expression expression
minus expression and then also any
tokens that came afterward we could have
done a expression B and we would have
seen a be on the right hand side of all
of these and actually that's pretty much
it but here's the real power of this
let's expand the depth up to two and
start seeing what kind of answers will
get so now we're going to re-expand
expression expression expression there
are 1 2 3 4 5 6 places we could do this
expansion oh its immense it goes down
quite a ways but you can start seeing
much more complicated expressions like
for example here we have something that
might be one plus two plus three but one
line below it one plus two minus three
here we've got some uses of parentheses
to help remove ambiguity and you could
imagine that
could go up to DEP three in depth for
and start enumerated lots of strings in
this grammar in fact wow there's a huge
amount of output and that's why I was
suggesting that this is not a very
efficient way of doing things because I
could enumerate a lot of strings of
length three or four or five or a lot of
strings that in have involved three or
four or five rural rewrites so we just
saw a slow way to encode formal grammars
in Python and enumerate strings in them
we will definitely need this power but
in our next exciting episode I'm going
to teach you a more efficient way to
encode grammar rules like the rules for
HTML and JavaScript that we will need
for our web browser and check to see if
a string is valid without having to
enumerate all possible strings first
because that might take let's say one
more second than I have so we're going
to see very efficient ways to solve this
problem super cool stick around and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
