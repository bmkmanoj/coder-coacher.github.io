trying to upload our videos to YouTube
but we're having a hard time because
it's taking a really long time to upload
these multi gigabyte files what do we
need to do to fix this problem first
let's consider latency latency is the
time it takes something that go from
Udacity to YouTube
well if we consider the fact that the
video is being breaking up into smaller
chunks the amount of time it takes to
send one chunk over is probably going to
be on the order of something like a
hundred milliseconds even if we reduce
this to one millisecond sending only one
chunk at a time considering there are
three gigabytes worth of data is going
to go almost just as slow we might save
99 milliseconds in the grand scheme of
themes this isn't really going to fix
the problem next let's consider
bandwidth if instead we increase the
bandwidth of our connection which allows
us to send larger chunks over from our
source to our destination we really
solve the problem here the latency isn't
a big issue compared to the size of the
files we're sending and it's much more
important to send larger chunks over
than measuring the time it takes a
single chunk to go from Udacity YouTube
so the answer is we want to keep
increase the bandwidth the last two
options were based on the content of the
video well the number of colors we have
and how much bad hair we have in video
itself while these may affect the file
size a bit it doesn't make that much of
a difference and really the best way to
fix this problem is by increasing our
bandwidth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
