particular the data structure that you
need to set up is actually really quite
simple so we need to be able to compute
the distance between any pair of nodes
called say a which is labeled here on
the graph and B which is labeled here in
the graph and they have to have lists of
hubs such that the hub has to be on a
shortest path from A to B well all the
paths from A to B in fact all the past
between anything in the network have to
pass through X so as long as everybody
has their distance to X which is one if
it's an unweighted network but there
could be weights on these edges as long
as each node knows its distance to X
will be able to intersect the list for
any pair of nodes and know the total
distance from node a two node be one
little bit of trickiness there though is
that notice that X's list also has to
have X on it but that's okay it just can
have X with the distance of zero so it
can be its own hub and then we still
should be fine we'll get the distance
from a to X is going to be whatever the
distance from a to X is plus zero so one
is the answer I was looking for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
