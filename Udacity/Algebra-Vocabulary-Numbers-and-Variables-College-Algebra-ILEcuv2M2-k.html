a lot of concepts that are going to play
a really central role in the rest of the
course and really in all mouth going
forward from here
so I would like to do a review of the
algebra vocabulary that we've covered so
far I think it's actually going to amaze
you how much we've already gone over in
a pretty short amount of time so first
things first we have numbers as one
might expect in math so what are some
examples of numbers well we could have
any number of things so like we learned
at the very beginning of this course
there are all different kinds of numbers
some that are pretty simple let me use
all the time like 0 or 1 or 46 and some
that are a little bit more special like
the root of 2 or pi then in contrast to
numbers we also learned about variables
so here we have all different kinds of
symbols we have some letters we have
some silly or things like hearts and
smiley faces we have some Greek letters
but regardless of what we write
variables as they all have the same
purpose as we learned earlier variables
are symbols that we use in equations and
expressions that serve as slots into
which we can plug other numbers to make
our expressions take on different values
so comparing numbers and variables
numbers have fixed values they
inherently show certain quantities
variables however don't show outright
what they stand for
they're just placeholders into which we
can insert different numbers one thing
to take note of when we're looking at
what's inside each of these circles is
that we actually have a symbol on the
number side that's this pie right here
since pi is an irrational number it
extends for an infinite number of
decimal points now it took me an awfully
long time to write all of this out so if
I would write even more that would take
me even longer to make our lives much
more simple we give this infinitely long
number a special name which is pi a
similar thing happens when we write
square roots we have a number two right
here but we also have a square root sign
over it since the root of 2 is also an
irrational number the square root sign
is just another way of taking a shortcut
to not have to write out an infinite
number of decimals so bottom line when
you see symbols they're almost always
variables there'll be certain cases
which you'll become well acquainted with
when you see things like pi or like a
square root sign
are symbols of some sort but represent
numbers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
