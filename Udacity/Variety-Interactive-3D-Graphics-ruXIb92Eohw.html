thing that again with a computer game
you can do your final goal is whatever's
on the screen it's just some pretty
picture basically you can do anything
you want with materials or lighting and
so on how AutoCAD can you contrast and
compare as far as materials and lighting
and so on what how does that work in
that a lot of that varies on the
customer because there's still a lot of
work that's being done in 2d with lines
and not necessarily a realistic view of
what's going on but the precision is
still required we had one customer that
used to print out boat hull designs at
full scale and then you'd use that to
actually build his boat hulls so it
really varies when you're dealing with
somebody who's working more in 3d
environment then again they're different
levels sometimes you want to sort of a
conceptual look for your design that
you're going to present to a client to
show them what it is they want to build
but then at some point you want to get a
realistic fully render ray-traced image
so we need to be able to support that
level also so it's really a great
variety of visualizations that are
required in the cad product</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
