so far then you're ready to understand
np-completeness
an idea behind some of the most
fascinating structure in the P versus NP
question you may have heard optimists
say there were only one algorithm away
from proving that P is equal to NP what
they mean is that if we could solve just
one np-complete problem in polynomial
time then we could solve all of them in
polynomial time here's why formally we
say that a language L is np-complete if
L is in NP and if every other language
in NP can be reduced to it in polynomial
time we're calling our picture of P and
NP from the beginning of the lesson the
np-complete problems were the ones at
the very top and we called them the
hardest problems in NP we can't have
anything higher that's still in NP
because if it's an NP then it can be
reduced to an np-complete problem also
if any one of the np-complete problems
were shown to be in P then P would
extend up and swallow all of NP it's not
immediately obvious then an np-complete
problem even exists but it turns out
that there are lots of them and in fact
they seem to occur more often in
practice than the problems in this
intermediate zone which are not
np-complete and so far have not been
proved to be an NP either historically
the first natural to be proved to be
np-complete is boolean formulas
satisfiability or Sat for short this was
shown to be np-complete by Stephen cook
in 1971 and independently by Leonid
Levin in the Soviet Union around the
same time the fact that this problem is
np-complete is extremely powerful
because once you have one np-complete
problem you just need to reduce it to
other problems to show that they too are
np-complete thus much of the theory of
complexity can be said to rest on this
theorem this is the high point of our
study of complexity so what exactly is
this satisfiability problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
