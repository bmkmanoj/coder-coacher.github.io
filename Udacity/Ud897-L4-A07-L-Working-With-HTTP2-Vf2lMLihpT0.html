do we transition from HD be one to this
amazing HTTP two worlds what do we have
to do to cater to all the users out
there in the best possible manner with
head of line blocking gone and aged be
too and the new header compression
requests are now cheap so things like
concatenating your JavaScript or CSS are
not necessary anymore and it can
actually make things worse think about
updating a cached file if you fix the
typo in a javascript file like a missing
curly brace you would force your users
to redownload the entire concatenated
blob of JavaScript instead of just the
fragment that actually changed if each
javascript file was separate you would
only invalidate the cash for that single
file another advantage is the new header
compression becoming more effective than
more requests or sent the more requests
are sent the more headers can be reused
that means that having multiple
connections to different servers is
actually bad for your performance that
being said minifying and compressing
your javascript CSS and images is still
a good idea a bite safe is a bite saved
and especially in developing countries
that means saved money additionally all
the advice given for rendering
performance like deferring your
javascript or inlining styles is still
valid and so is investing time in
building proper offline support with
service worker most importantly HTTP two
is backwards compatible all servers that
speak HTTP two will be able to speak
HTTP one a client that can speak HB 2
will just fall back to ATT one and keep
working as before and those clients are
becoming exceedingly rare so don't be
scared of working with HTTP two at the
time of filming in early two thousand
sixteen seventy one percent of the web
traffic have support for HTTP two so it
is fair to say that you can optimize
your web for hb2 without paying much
attention to HB 1 anymore as this number
will only grow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
