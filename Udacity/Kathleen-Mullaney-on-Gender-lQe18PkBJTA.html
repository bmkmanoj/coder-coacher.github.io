vice president of careers here at
Udacity Kathleen thank you so much for
talking to us today thank you David
so I want talk to Kathleen about issues
of gender in educational technology
the first thing I'd ask is there's a
trend in educational technology too
because the technology industry is so
dominated by men that the things we
create in EdTech are often very oriented
towards men so what can we do to kind of
try and break that cycle yeah so you
know when we when I first started at
Udacity back when we were creating the
first courses we realized that this was
actually going to become quite prevalent
the first courses we launched were CS
101 which is intruding in Python and it
the focus was how to build a search
engine and the second course was a an an
AI course focused on how to program a
robotic car and you know those seem
pretty agnostic now you know a car and a
search engine are not gender based but
there is a tendency to view those
actually as more male oriented like cars
in general are more focused on men and
we realize that you know actually just
choosing topics for the courses and the
examples that we use in courses could
have a great effect on whether or not
men and/or women would be attracted to
take the course to begin with it's like
one of the things that you know we
really focused on was trying you know
after we saw those first courses and and
thought about how we want to market
future courses we actually took a more
broad perspective and we tried to
actually make things as agnostic as we
possibly could and had much more
attention to it so I mean the first
thing that I always tell people is that
you didn't need to be aware of the
stereotypes that exist for everybody
including you know I you know I have
many stereotypes about men and women
myself even though I'm very well
educated on this topic and so keeping
those in mind and keeping them at your
forefront when you're designing any kind
of materials is it is crucially
important you know making sure that
you're not playing into any standard
gender archetypes so you know one
example another example from from the
history of Udacity is that we we produce
this course on tales from the genome so
it was about genetics and we had a male
and a female instructor and
the male was the expert and the female
was the novice and they played this
really nice dynamic on film where the
novice would ask this for expert
questions
there were times though in in the
filming that we realized that we were
essentially portraying the female as
this dumb person who didn't know the
answers to things when really like you
know she's very intelligent has her own
background she's just not a geneticist
and that was that was what we were
trying to portray there we didn't want
to say that you know one person is
smarter than the other but this person
just doesn't have this expertise and it
was something that we know we didn't
actually realize until you know pretty
far into filming the course and we went
through and actually like looked at
every every you know video and actually
said like do we feel that this is
portraying women in a negative light or
you know playing into these easy
archetypes that you know films so often
use you know a woman in distress you
need helped it needs to be saved right
by her you know so this knight in
shining armor
and we ended up cutting a lot of content
and changing it because we really said
we just don't want to be portraying you
know women in that light another another
example just to again to give you you
know an idea of like how much this is
like very prevalent and how much you
don't even realize it is that there's a
video in one of our JavaScript courses
that had a complaint from a student that
said you know why are you playing into
you know these these these gender roles
haven't you heard of stereotype threat
and if you haven't heard of stereotype
threat that's where you know basically
reinforcing a stereotype in in the
context where a stereotype is typically
threatened demanding us as the name is
is more likely to cause those issues
than not so for example women are told
by a society that they're not as good at
math as men are and if you ask a woman
to state her gender before she takes a
math test she will do worse on that math
test and so that's what stereotype
threat is as an example and what we
realized is that you know we were naming
variables in this JavaScript course
completely what we thought was benign
but somebody who saw that you know like
we named one of the variables gal the
variable it was supposed to be a you
know a hero so it was definitely
portraying women in a
sort of light but you know pointing out
that there are women you know in in this
in a situation where they may already
feel that they're not confident may
actually cause people to you know think
of their abilities as as less which I I
don't necessarily agree in this scenario
but you know just to just to point out
like the the breadth of the issues that
may come up and how much you do need to
be aware of them so I would say like the
biggest thing that you can do is to
educate yourself on on the dynamics that
we know exists today so talking about
and you know stereotypes and bias in
particular and not only with gender so I
don't know if we're talking about
diversity at large but usually any
underrepresented group in in you know
computer science or in technology in
general yeah do you know I think you're
familiar with impostor syndrome and this
is a comment on that in the same kind of
yeah it's very it's very similar to
stereotype threat those are you know
they go hand in hand oftentimes so
impostor syndrome is that you know and I
feel this all the time and you know I'm
a high-level executive at this company I
still do this I have a PhD Nigel yeah
like oh I don't have any answer to this
at all yeah yeah it's basically you know
you're you again like are you feel that
you don't have the expertise that you
need to fulfill a position or if it's a
little job and this is actually one of
the things that I mentor girls
especially the girls who code groups
that nobody knows what they're doing
nobody I mean it like I don't know any
one person who actually knows what
they're doing all the time and it's it's
fun to actually at least be in the
startup environment because we try to
raise that fact like as much as we
possibly can
I don't know if Sebastian like to
mention his his failure award so if you
try to break the company and we
succeeded at various point that's okay
he rewards you with a bottle of wine a
nice bottle of wine and this the whole
point here is that like you know it's
said to highlight this fact I think it
likes to counter this impostor syndrome
that like you know you you're acting out
of fear because you think that you can't
do something because you're not smart
enough or you don't have the right
experience or the number of years of
experience or you know there's a
specific background you know I know a
number of people at Udacity work in
computer science
they don't have computer science degree
a number of our students in particular
do not have computer science series but
are looking to get into the technical
field and so you know one of the most
often questions that you know most
frequent questions that I receive is is
really focus on like how can I get a job
here when they say SES degree is
required and have to counsel people on
like no you know they say this but
that's really just this shortcut that
people use to say like they just want a
certain level of understanding of these
topics or a certain level of work
experience and time after time I talk to
employers and actually try to you know
assess this out they say no we don't
actually want a degree really we just
really want to know like do you know
this stuff and so that's what we focus
on Udacity is like no the stuff like you
know and do it in a way that is more
flexible and and and meets your needs
rather than having to you know go back
and get a second degree Mountain tips
yeah that was a very long answer to that
question that's got imposter syndrome
because we've done some interesting
research on impostor syndrome and the
OMS and it's interesting that the
research came out that suggested that
people who experienced impostor syndrome
more strongly are less likely to take a
chance on the other mental program like
this because if it doesn't end up
panning out it reflects poorly on me and
I'm already an impostor so now people
recognize that and so I think it can
batting that in this program is really
really important because it helps
increase our diversity because the
people who more often experience that
are the ones we really want in this
program anyway yeah have you talked
about growth or fixed mindsets in that
context we talked about it a little bit
in one of the other lessons on
motivation and metacognition so yeah but
that one of the best ways to counteract
an impostor syndrome is to have a growth
mindset intervention to to highlight
that you know making mistakes helps you
learn it doesn't actually show that
you're stupid or that you know you don't
have the ability to do something yeah in
fact no one ever learns really anything
except never by failures so Kathleen
will agree with me that mindset is the
one book that everyone should read
that's soon okay so we talked a lot
about doing this in EdTech and how to
design educational technology
initiatives it'll do this but many of
our students probably won't go into this
field but they'll go into fields that
suffer from these same issues so just
when they're on the job in the future
what can they do to try and improve
diversity in their workplace without
being kind of pandering or some of the
things that we have more often
sure yeah yeah I guess the first thing
is that if you are not an
underrepresented group that doesn't mean
you can't participate in in trying to
actually alleviate the issues that these
groups encounter so you know if you are
a white male so I do it's okay you know
the things you can do are educate
yourself and help promote these issues
to other people I noticed actually when
I first brought up the issue of bias and
a stereotype with the company here one
of the one of the things that came up
you're like I am a white man like I feel
like I can't participate because you
know I'm I'm the enemy like no you're
not the enemy and that's actually not
what we're trying to say here
you know stereotype a stereotype is a
shortcut in your cognitive process it's
something that you know you see
something over and over and over again
and your brain just makes a shortcut and
it's it helps you think about things and
actually helps you in your life quite a
bit and we're not saying that all
stereotypes are bad you just need to
understand the ones that are and the and
the ones that help like you know result
in in poor judgment or behavior and a
bias also is is you know it's like this
the shortcut and but it's also an error
so if you talk about like you know
research you know a bias like is
actually just an error in measurement
and so what we want to do is actually
just again like the awareness of these
things helps cut down the effects of
them you know pretty pretty I don't know
the exact statistic right now but a
pretty big amount and so you know again
like educate yourself on on the issues
that that face you know people in these
groups so we know for the technology
industry you know it's something about
like 20 to 30 percent female on on a
good day and you know if that's the case
then you know what are the things that
you can do to help actually get to be
more equal and actually probably
educating yourself on why that's even
important to this the point isn't just
to have equality the point is to have
diversity of thought and you're not
gonna have diversity of thought if
everybody looks the same has it had the
same education comes from the same type
of family and from you know that the
same I could you know like economic
background so the
business is it's actually shown you know
through through research again that
businesses that have diverse employees
are more successful than ones that are
not so understanding like why you
actually want this and and the more
logical reasons rather than the
emotional ones of just like you know you
know I don't want there to be inequality
and and actually try to move the needle
by based on again like logic rather than
I think just like you know emotional
responses to to the situation have you
read um Thinking Fast and Slow yeah yeah
if you all haven't heard of it it's a
great book I wouldn't even connected it
that's I'm glad you mentioned about
shortcuts that yeah it talks a lot about
how stereotypes are just kind of easy
ways to think that we really fall into
because we can't think deeply about
every single thing we encounter all day
long exactly but being aware of them is
really the quickest way to know when
you're doing it family and not feeling
like you're doing something wrong look
you know I noticed in another example
hopefully these are helpful for you guys
I one of one of the the stereotypes is
that and again the biases that comes
into play is that women are more often
judged by their character so by how
likable they are and men are more often
judged by their skills which is really
ridiculous especially when it comes in
to interviewing and so it's something
that I work on very very much with our
audacity students and and helping them
apply for jobs you for the most part
people are not interviewing you for how
likeable you are they're interviewing
you because they want you to perform a
specific function in a company and it's
important for if you're an interviewer
to remember that and also as an
interviewee because you want to make
sure that you're not giving any you know
easy paths for an interviewer to fall
fall into and basically say like oh I'm
gonna choose the shortcut and so the
things that you can actually do are to
you know in force that you have the
skills or a job and you in your rhetoric
in your answers to interview questions
highlight that you have the skills don't
just smile a lot and be likable I mean
those are that's also an important trait
I'm not saying that you know you it
that's not important at all but I you
know you can make it easier for yourself
and for the people who can easily be
trapped by stereotypes to to you know
come out on top I know that when I was
interviewing for
candidate I was writing all of my
feedback about this interview I thought
I had just completed and I was saying
how like how would she had a really
sunny disposition I was like what am I
talking about that has nothing to do
with this job and you know for me once
at once I realized that that's when I
decided actually to to start doing these
talks here at Udacity because you know
if I you know someone my favorite topics
if I am so susceptible to this you know
despite the amount that I read about it
that I do my research but I try to help
others and I'm still following these
traps like we need to make it as
prevalent so that I have support I think
you know so I get you know a team of
people to help me actually do better
myself it's kind of like you know if you
have a you're trying to lose weight
you're much more likely to see it
succeed if you have some social pressure
to help you with you know achieving your
goal yes absolutely so if your wife was
would say like David you know you're
trying to lose weight so let's make sure
we're not you know you know keeping
cookies in the house or whatever like
you have more support exactly you know
an ability exactly so this is
accountability is important and if we're
able to help each other learn about
these things and be active rather than
passive about the efforts to improve
them I think that's that's would give
personally I think that's what would
lead to more success yeah absolutely I
agree completely do me last thoughts you
want to share with our students as they
prepare to embark on their projects or
maybe wrap up their projects yeah um I
guess one of the things that I wish I
had understood a little sooner was
really think about if you're designing a
course or a product think about your
learner or your user and really
understand who that person is or who
that group of people are do your best to
limit it because making a product for
everybody will never win and and really
try to reach that person I mean I think
once once we were able to actually
figure out some of the individuals that
we were reaching with the Udacity
courses we got a lot better about
creating content that fit their needs so
yeah I think really just like focus
focus on your user and make sure that
you know you know who that person is so
that you are solving a problem for them
or you're helping them and you know
achieve whatever goal that they're
trying to achieve okay great thank you
so much for talking to us today Kathleen
thanks thanks for having me good luck
with your projects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
