chained some work off them you did so in
the last quiz by creating a get function
and then using dot then to do something
with the data that you retrieved you
also included caches to ensure that no
error goes on handled with the promise
API that thenns also returned promises
so if you can dot then off an initial
promise you can dot then off of dot ends
because they are also promises
developers commonly use the term venable
to describe promises and dot dense any
method or object that returns a dot then
is venable anything venable can become a
part of a chain of asynchronous work
promises are then able as r dot ends and
caches in fact other libraries include
Denebola x see the instructor notes for
more information when creating a chain
of asynchronous work each subsequent
link in the chain receives either the
fulfilled value of the previous promise
or the return value of the previous dot
vens function in this way you can pass
information collected from one
asynchronous method to the next being
able to chain then ables is an
incredibly powerful technique for
simplifying complex sequences of
asynchronous work you'll be practicing a
few chaining strategies in the next
lesson so this is the end of the first
lesson you have already added a powerful
new tool to your toolbox and you are
just getting started at the beginning of
the next lesson you'll be creating a
chain of dot vens to put thumbnails on
the exoplanet explorer see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
