important service that is part of memory
management it's important once again to
make sure that memory allocation scales
with the size of the system and in order
to do that one possibility is to take
the heap space of the process and break
it up so this is a logical address space
of a multi-threaded application and in
the logical address space everything is
shared but what we're going to do is
we're going to take this heap portion of
the address space and break it up into
the portion of physical memories that
are associated with the nodes on which
these threads are executing suppose the
mapping of the threads of this
particular application is such that t1
and t2 are executing on n1 and t3 and t4
are executing n2 and it's a Numa machine
so there's a physical memory that is
local to this node n1 and therefore what
I'm going to do is dynamic memory
allocation requests if it is centralized
it'll be a huge bottleneck instead we're
going to break up the heap and say that
this portion of the heap fits in the
physical memory that is close to n1 this
portion of the heap fits in the physical
memory that is close to n2 so dynamic
memory allocation requests from these
threads satisfied from here from these
threads satisfied from here that allows
for scalable implementation of dynamic
memory allocation the other side benefit
that you get by breaking up the heap
space into these distinct physical
memories is that it can avoid false
sharing across nodes of the parallel
machine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
