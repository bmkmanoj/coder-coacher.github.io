hello everyone and welcome to this
episode of coffee and croissants where I
am joined by marketing experts in the
field my name is uncle Denard and I lead
the digital marketing nanodegree today
I'm joined by Ling Ling Chen and Jordan
Schenk both Jordan and Ling Ling work in
the food industry and both actually had
very innovative food companies so
welcome Ling Ling and Jordan okay so
we're very glad to have any Commission
so Ling Ling maybe I'll start with you
can you should introduced yourself and
tell us a little bit about your role
yeah definitely hi everyone my name is
Ling Ling and I work at Nativa which is
a leading organic super foods
plant-based food company with selves on
e-commerce offline and as well as
international markets so as a brand
manager at nutiva my role really has
three different components the number
one thing is really doing consumer
research and then working with our R&amp;amp;D
team the food scientists very closely in
terms of developing new products you
know determine what size or packaging at
what price point at which channels that
we want to sell and the number two is
really about the product marketing side
which is the positioning and the master
chain in the competitive analysis of the
product and then finally which is the
more of the marketing communication
where digital marketing is really really
important off that part it's really
about how do you balance you know
different tactics she'll really educate
your consumers about how to use the
product and in really breathing generate
that brand awareness yes sounds like a
great role yes so in Jordan how about
you so my name is Jordan Schenk and I'm
the director of marketing at impossible
foods impossible Foods was founded five
years ago with the mission to change the
way the world eats by creating the best
meats and dairy products entirely from
plants I've been at impossible foods now
officially for about a year and a half
and before that was was working with
them on a consulting basis for about a
year
and so in my time at impossible foods
you know we launched the first product
to market which was the impossible
burger this product launched last year
with a celebrity chef named David Chang
in New York City and since then you know
my role on top of doing as many of the
amazing consumer insights works but I
know ling-ling has been doing has been
also growing and building a brand mm-hmm
a local brand that many of you will will
see I'm sure in the in the coming in the
coming years as we rolled up new places
so you know my role spans from
everything from your kind of traditional
consumer of segmentation work that we'll
do to develop our go-to-market
strategies as well as channel marketing
strategies in addition to the broader
brand marketing strategy which is
creating everything from the naming to
the identity to the campaigns that a lot
of you will start seeing so there's
there's a lot of that and then on the
digital front you know my role and my
team you know digital is an interesting
word because we actually don't see any
division between how humans engage
normally versus digital so everything we
do is digital and I think that's where
I'm sure many of you have seen
everything from our social media
channels to our live streams and and all
of that we we engage with our consumers
in just a very normal and organic way
with how people communicate now very
cool and can you tell us a little bit
Jordan about how you got started in
marketing specifically yeah so my my
background actually I was in advertising
prior I used to work at a company called
Wieden and Kennedy which is a fairly
well-known global advertising company
kind of their hallmark is Nike and Old
Spice and a lot of innovative and
disruptive marketing communications in
advertising so I was at widening Kennedy
for a bit I was working in planning
actually which in many ways is probably
a more transferable role when you start
getting into a direct mark director of
marketing type of role where you are
doing a lot of the upfront strategic
work determining who your audience
segments are determining how you'll
communicate and target those individuals
and then eventually I transition I
transitioned over to be in marketing and
I think you know my my background in
advertising is
unique in that I have the the hybrid of
strategic insight with the execution and
so when you come into a especially a
start-up role where and as you know the
thing there is nothing in it in place
you've got a lot of work to do on one
moment being incredibly strategic and
thoughtful in the next moment you're
you're running and you're executing and
you may be writing copy and you may be
taping a wire down to the floor at a
sampling event there's there's
everything yeah yeah yeah just said you
were just at a pop-up last night's right
yeah yeah yeah we've been we've been
doing that we just we've last night we
did one of our first in more disruptive
consumer experience as we created a
speakeasy by the name of me easy where
Chicagoans were invited to go out and
try the burger behind a secret pseudo
butcher shop and come in and try a
burger made from plants lands yeah very
cool very cool so how about you leaning
when you can if you've started in
impacting a while back yeah so um even
when I was in college I was very into I
have a business major and I've been
really into communications so actually
my first internship was at IBM their
consulting services where I was more of
a kind of customer relationship
management consultant where I helped
some of the companies implement their
CRM solutions their CRM systems for
marketing and themselves teams and
that's how I started to get to learn
about ok how marketing themselves work
together what does a marketing person to
you every single day and then later on I
decided that you know I wanted to focus
more on cooperate or marketing where I
really love that combination of art and
in science where you you you have you do
the communication but also you have to
really dig into the data and that's why
so I actually grew up in China and
that's why after college I came to the
u.s. directly to get my MBA degree
focusing on marketing and strategy so
that's how I got started
I see and did you did you specifically
feel attracted to the food industry and
chose to kind of be there
your marketing role was an enormous
choice so initially not when I was in
graduate school actually the few
internship at some you know technology
company is doing b2b marketing you know
I was at university of rochester's so
there I interned with a company called
Xerox which is kind of a printer and an
IT services company I still really love
to work there but then at a time it's
really interesting time because I was
very I was here by myself and I just
really missed my family and the food is
really kind of that emotional connection
for me and I also got a DSLR camera that
I will write a food blog and I will
upload pictures every day about what I
eat every day and I share with my
families to make sure like they they
know I'm doing well and also it's that
time that you know food network is
particularly kind of booming right you
see so many celebrity chefs and I was
like okay I I don't cook really well so
but how can I really leverage my
marketing skills that's in this field
that I feel very passionate about him
that I feel emotionally connected to so
that's why when I was looking for jobs I
sucked at food companies so that's how I
started it was really a passion for you
yes yeah you know I I think anyone who
works in food likely loves food I think
most human beings love food you love
food we love to eat which I'm sure you
know research tells you mm-hmm
people love to eat taste is king no
matter what no you know what for me I
think what was so interesting about
coming into impossible foods was yes the
food and yes the product was incredible
I mean the product is incredible it
makes jobs as marketers much easier
working with a product that truly is
revolutionary but you know my role
especially coming in on the brand
marketing front was to think about how
do we create something that is bigger
than the product bigger than itself so
how do we start to think about a food
movement and what we do and what our
responsibility is
impossible foods in that so I think for
me the the transition was as much I love
food every day and getting the
opportunity to work with so many
incredible chefs and you know
influencers and thought leaders in this
industry has been tremendous but at the
same time the the work that we're doing
and the reason that they're all here and
I'm here is that we're we're looking to
create something that moves the world
forward and does it in a way that's non
compromising that's delicious that's fun
that's it like it's all of those things
that you would want with food without
the you know the weight of kind of where
we are and where we need to go yeah yeah
that's actually all you hit on the point
then kind of struck us when we were
looking at the companies that you're
working for like food is gets at times
controversial right people are more and
more interested in where their food
source they're interested in the
influence it has on the environment so
as a marketer in your role like and
specifically then with the impossible
burger being plans based so how do you
focus on getting that message out like
what are the ways that yeah really could
appease accusers well we knew I mean
obviously the impossible foods is it's
an amazingly innovative product that
took a lot of work there's a lot of
science behind it there's a lot of R&amp;amp;D
behind it and we know that even now it
you know people are people are more
curious about what's in their food you
know there's the questions around is it
organic is a sustainable is it does it
have GMOs all of those questions swirl
around it and and frankly we knew the
best way to tell the story of our
product was to think about who in the
industry was leading the industry so
this is where we chose chefs and the
story of our product and the the science
of it and the innovation of it was
actually best told not necessarily
through through us at first but through
others who understood where we were
coming from so as a marketer it was a
really interesting flip and why we chose
to go to restaurants first over retail
we chose to create a moment where
consumers could not only see their
favorite chef or their favorite server
but sit with their friends and have a
dialogue about what they were eating
because we knew the product was amazing
but we also knew that people people had
to come on a journey
with us to get there now we couldn't
come out there and kind of lay it in
front of them on the retail shelves and
say kind of do what you want with it we
knew that it would take more time and we
would build more advocacy around what we
were doing yeah yeah and for you leaning
I know that products that that nutiva
sells also they're organic and natural
plant-based yeah exactly and they also
have like extra nutritious elements in
them but how do you so is that is that
something that that features in your
communication as well you have worked
with the consumer sensitivities in that
sense yeah definitely very much so
motivo was actually funded in 1999 and
then since day one our funder decided
that it's not only a company I'm just
talking about food we were healthy for
but you know we want our food to grow in
a way that's also beneficial to the
planet and also to the environment and
when you think about like brand
personality or brand image we want to
make sure that again we are not just
about you know nourishing people we want
to make sure it's also about nourishing
home vitality of the planning and also
environment so but I would go to market
is different then you know impossible
food where you try to educate consumers
the restaurant through the shafts but
because we're consumer Patrick kids we
are really relying on number one a lot
of influencers who are vegan who are
plant-based who really care about
environment or like some of them are
even environmental like activists and so
we really rely on them should be our
brand ambassadors and we really engage
with them and we rely on consumers to
play around with food keep us there did
the recipes and we will feature them in
our blog through our social media
channels the other way that we are doing
it is brand partnerships with a lot of
mission-driven where like-minded brands
in organic food in the street or plant
food plant-based food in this sector
such as immunity which I thought that in
university's office and
so a chocolate brand caught you know out
eco and just a lot of and then we're
lucky that we have so many interesting
brands mission-driven brands in the Bay
Area which makes the brand partnerships
very very easy so many times we will do
like a recipe co-development and when we
will feature the same recipe in both of
the our social media channels and to
really unite um you know other brands to
educate our consumers together because I
think you know since we have very
limited resources we are really trying
to think very creatively about how can
we leverage our limited resources but
you know you know unite other other
brands in the community together yeah so
I think one of the other things that you
touched on he said any both the hey my
passionate about food and for many
people food is really important so hence
there's also a lot of content out there
around food it could be recipes there's
a lot of content so how do you pick
stories that can still stand out in that
environment like what's the story you're
gonna go for so if you think about that
Jordan for you is that a like are there
particular stories that you felt like
haters will still stand out in the big
noise around food I mean not to not to
humble brag about impossible but
impossible it's been a pretty big story
in food right yeah yeah it's been you
know our instead of us you know finding
what narrative to gravitate on to we
knew that we were coming out and looking
at targeting the meat eater and
understanding the meat eater so and you
know unlike I'm gonna know where you
guys are coming out for for kind of the
vegan and vegetarian crowd we knew that
we had to build a tremendous amount of
credibility with a group that inherently
doesn't buy it when it comes down to its
to products that are made entirely from
plants so you know the story that we've
told is the story of us but at the same
time like I said before the narrative
via chefs like Michael Symon was a chef
that we recently partnered with it be
spot but then thinking about how does
that food or that meat as impossible
burger then translate to places in
Cleveland and Detroit and letting the
familiarity
the Americana heritage come through and
all of that emotion and letting people
be emotional about the product you know
we've also been fairly pragmatic pretty
pragmatic and understanding that people
are gonna have a lot of questions to
begin with so we doubled down on
customer service is a huge tool for us
early on yeah and I would even say as a
very young company we have a very robust
customer service department we have a
phone number you can call at anytime we
have an email we have a response rate
that's within minutes of people people
asking us questions and we knew that
that would be critical because we wanted
people to we wanted people to have
dialogue we wanted people to debate we
wanted to go to the front page of Reddit
and let people have it out so we we
encourage that kind of behavior we
picked the right moments to do it and
then we just arm the staff to make sure
that we were always on their side and
answering questions so and and is that
so what you say is that somewhat
comparable to some of the approach that
you're taking at the triva mm-hm I think
you're terrorizing a different stage as
impossible foods cuz you guys have like
that science or technology coming into
you know the doctor burger but Furnham
Teva i think we do study you know what
our consumers care about to develop our
content and I will give you a story that
I think back when nutiva was funded our
image or our message tend to be you know
break away from industrial food system
you know like you know they're bad we're
good you know and now we're trying to be
more kind of positively like an oil of a
food positive positivist instead of a
food activist you know like we're really
trying to honing our message in terms of
we're narrowing we are you know
courageous we are passionate instead of
asking our consumers to break away from
something like asking them to you know
be away from industrial food system and
the other thing is that you know even
though a lot of our consumers really
care about you know sustainability or
environments this animal Fermi
ultimately it's the old food is still
about the taste the quality of the
product so we still try to really focus
on the recipe development and then also
the taste of the inequality of the
products however in certain time periods
so for example like April Earth Day we
really talk about our sustainability
effort and right now it's October it's
the Fairtrade month and also non GMO
month where we are collaborating with
our partners like Fairtrade you know you
know organization to talk about why why
we need to support like Fairtrade nam
farmers I see I see so well both I think
well for both of your brands you've
created quite a community around your
brand right so you're therefore also
have the social media or social media
channels that you're talking in and that
you're active in is it like how do you
keep that kind of social element going
and are there particular tools that you
use in the company that you say hey
these tools work about for us to keep
going with that community and keep it
active and actually also keep it under
control yeah are you working on that in
your role so we have a very good you
know communications team as well as
trading marketing teams so since we sell
both online as well as offline we are
really trying to engage our consumers in
both ways so online definitely social
media and engaging with you know micro
influencers we're a big celebrity
influencers that's really our key
strategy yeah in terms of offline we are
always doing kind of sampling we are
always demoing more products on in you
know at Whole Foods or you know Safeway
or sprouts market and really trying to
get that buzz going
and also we go to a lot of different
kind of food festivals to try to again
engage with our consumers offline and
then really trying to talk to our target
consumers where they are shopping where
they are kind of you know where they're
going during the weekend you
and what you say when you work with
influencers are there particular
channels that you look for in social
media State does it work better on
Instagram or Twitter or Facebook or I
think definitely Instagram I think that
I'm not sure about impossible food for
Instagram has been tremendously
important I think not only for food
brands but also like consumer packaged
occurs including beauty as well as I
guess for fashion as well yeah yeah you
will see a lot of the influencers
nowadays they didn't even have a blog
they just start with Instagram and they
get enough followers they start their
third blog and I still remember like
five years ago it's still like people
will start their blog and when they grow
into more different channels then they
will have an Instagram account so you
like that shifted yeah totally sure did
do you use quite a bit of these channels
as well as impossible foods oh yeah we
do I mean we're um we're not quite two
CPG level yet but you know the the
mission of impossible is you know we've
got we've got the movement going we're
trying to create ubiquity we we
structure ourselves in a way where we
have a we have a social content team
then has its space has it has its own
world and place to create amazing things
but also engage consistently with people
and leveraging UGC or whether it's you
know working with an amazing artist to
design something yeah on the side and
then we're also you know we also
structure ourselves in a way where we
have an experienced marketing team so we
we believe tasting is believing which is
a huge part of our strategy and that's
why we're doing pop-ups like in the
media Z&amp;amp;Y we have currently a tailgate
tour running with impossible and each
one of these moments the way that we
think about as a team we call it a
Content bomb they're designed and made
to be not only an opportunity to try the
product at a moment to take a selfie in
front of an amazing wall or to dive into
a foam pit for seemingly no apparent
reason but it's there and that's you
know because consumers are loving
Instagram they're loving the ice cream
factories of the world their experiences
that are are there from them that's
right
said you'd asked me earlier the division
between digital and not there's no
division anymore you know the role of
the brand now is to create moments where
people feel inclined to selfie or take a
picture as a badge of honor within their
within their kind of ecosystem that
they've created on their own so we've
we've always slotted into to that
behavior and structured ourselves in a
way to allow teams to focus on on those
particular elements because they're
they're critical but they're they're no
different than digital branding to
marketing at this point it's just it is
what it is yeah it's every channel it's
always on and I would say ones that we
love we obviously we love Instagram but
from a community in a dialog standpoint
we love channels like Facebook Facebook
isn't amazing is still a really great
tool to have conversation and it's also
a when you're talking about creating
ubiquity and mass market attraction the
mass is on Facebook Instagram is big but
it's still it's still fairly niche in
regards to where you can go so Facebook
has been another great place for us to
not only work with partners like
attention or you know get moments out
there with BuzzFeed where we have we
have a lot of community looking at us so
we we do that and then big content
partnerships have been another tool for
us very cool so yeah so you've both felt
work for really cool brands and you've
gone through kind of several steps in
your marketing career when you look back
are there particular challenges you feel
like you've faced in the past or
challenges if you're still facing right
now and maybe ways that you would are
you've overcome those things that our
students could learn from so maybe I'll
start with you on that well I think it's
still a challenge you know right now for
me it's really about how do i balance
online as well as offline marketing
tactics because I think as a marketer
sometimes you know you have to prove
that there's a certain returning buzz
ments on certain marketing programs and
especially when we sell both online and
offline I may do a digital marketing
campaign but then consumers saw it right
but then they go offline or you know go
to Whole Foods to buy it so it's really
hard for me to prove that or even to
measure that you know you know that
particular cell sleep is because of you
know a B C and D yeah yeah so I
definitely think that attribution and
improving the return on investment is
incredibly challenging and the other
thing is that sometimes you know people
sometimes people don't understand you
know a certain marketing components can
be beautiful just generating brand
awareness so not every single campaign
can bring in revenue or like immediately
right like sometimes brand building is
really for that long term play yeah so
as a marketer that I try to explain the
marketing campaigns objectives very very
clearly that this is for demand
generation and then this is for brand
beauty generate awareness and generate
conversation I see yeah and is that and
for you Jordan do you have like your
marketing ROI is me
it's the crux of any market right yeah
for for everything that we do but I
would say you know for us the I mean
obviously we launched about a year and a
half ago and the kind of interesting
moment that I'm at I know the team is at
is how are we capturing information and
data and keeping our consumers in our
funnel so unlike a CPG where you can see
you get pretty much from point A to
point B and there's some level of data
especially if you've EECOM running right
right for us we don't have that because
we're a b2b b2c so for for us getting
our marketing you know getting our
marketing tech together knowing when
we're understanding who's coming in what
are they thinking what are they feeling
and then at the same time how are we
keeping them in our funnel how are we
have assuring email how are we getting
them into our Instagram has been
something that I
it's been challenging for us and I think
it's challenging but there's not a lot
of people in the industry to look to to
see who's done it so but you'll be
seeing coming from impossible well we
will be a push to do some innovative
stuff around keeping individuals in our
community but also knowing full well
that were not in retail yet but we're in
food service and we've got a really
unique scenario so that's that's one so
for for young marketers coming into it I
would say you know if you getting your
insights team and getting your marketing
tech the first thing you do is is is
critical because you get to a point
where you've had all this great
groundswell and all of this and it's not
that it's missed opportunities but you
as a market or look at it and be like I
wish I knew who they were who are on
these five hundred thousand people so
there's there's kind of that that moment
that will happen but at the same time
you're you're gonna start up you're
running a million miles a minute you're
you're grabbing what you can to make
sure that you're you're you know you're
keeping the plane up but then also
getting moments out there that people
care about but the that piece of it I
would say for new marketers and you know
people coming into roles tighten that
funnel as quickly as you can and then
run then do the beautiful brand work
then do the consideration or what have
you through your funnel yeah I want to
echo what Jordans sad is that even for
us like understanding of offline
consumers can be a challenge you know
you have a lot of data online where you
can look at Google Analytics and then
see who are coming to your website how
long are they staying with certain
content how are they engaging with the
content versus offline if I see you know
a thousands of people going to Whole
Foods to buy my product how am I going
to capture that data like who are they
why they are buying it what capture
their eyes when they are walking through
that aisle and then how are they doing
that decision making when there are you
know 20 other brands and why did
specifically pick a new team I pick our
brand is that that is that because you
know art or taste or are they first-time
consumers so there are just so much
knowledge
we are not able to capture a fly yeah I
can imagine and you said that part of
your role is also some consumer research
right I bet that you do stumble for that
but it probably still doesn't give you
any different I mean it's different for
marketers now because the the funnel is
so much more intelligent and there's so
much more information so if you think
kind of a traditional you know brand
marketing early on their way you know
you do your segmentation work you do
your intercept you do you know you talk
people doing intercepts fire shop and
marketing you would do all of us
wonderful modeling and now the amount of
information that's available it's smart
it can be it can be translated in ways
that are algorithmic and we have an
opportunity as marketers to capture all
of that whether it's right here Google
Analytics or are you running
programmatic intercepts within your
stores are you doing secret shopping hey
yeah and then what also are you
capturing on the end of who's your email
base are you surveying them are you
understanding them how are you
leveraging your Instagram community and
they're all different
mm-hm so being able to create dashboards
and ways to understand those individuals
sooner just helps streamline it and it
helps proof points when you're like I'm
gonna do a big brand moment mm-hm and
it's gonna have we project the ROI on
this is probably gonna be six to eight
to twelve months out but we need to do
it now because that's that's the moment
that we need to be ready for so yeah
being able to get that sooner is as good
very cool yeah so well but we're at
Udacity obviously we focus on my floor
learning and we're very big fans of that
but I was wondering so for people like
yourselves who are in careers who are
obviously already experts in marketing
how do you blend that in in your day to
day kind of jobs do you have a view on
that
yeah so for me you know even you know
every single day's different day I'm
constantly learning you know just you
know on the job but I also try to really
spend some time taking all my courses
you know what I really really like or
even go to a lot of different meetups or
whether it's on food whether it's on
marketing just to meet people face to
face and really trying to talk to
people who are maybe we're even working
different industries because I try to
see you know how fashion brands do
marketing or how you know beauty brands
to do marketing yeah so I really try to
you know really utilize you know my
classes as well as the meet ups or the
conferences I see yeah well if were you
Jordan do you do some of that yeah I
mean I my you know the the role of
marketers is as much bringing the world
on the outside in to where you are yeah
so you know with our teams we do do a
lot of reading yes I mean a lot of
reading and it's not just reading
industry books is actually reading
nonfiction fictions from other cultures
starting to understand where people are
I you know I'm a big affection on o of
art I used to work on fashion brands so
understanding a lot of those different
industries which I just like I'm I love
coffees I love a good glass of
excitement there's a you know a friend
of mine just founded a group called
she's sweet and we have this collective
of women that get together every month
and one individual talks about their
career and these really intimate spaces
so it's it's a mix of those and also
it's you know it's kind of a
non-traditional education that you need
to give to your self especially as a
marketer so traveling is important
volunteering is important putting
ourselves in as many moments as possible
where you're with new people and
bringing that in to enrich what you're
doing is is critical on top of the
classwork I wish I had more time for
class work because when you're yeah
you're at max capacity the what actually
the only thing you want to do is get a
glass of wine with someone and hear
about their life yeah
versus yours no say I mean it's a lot of
that it's it's allowing that's a that's
a great part of our job just allowing
yourself to be free and yeah when you
think back off your can early self in
like the beginning of your career would
use is a particularly advice you would
give students who are now actually
really starting their careers in digital
marketing is there
any advice you would have for them
Jordan I'm my I actually started earlier
and early on in digital marketing and
well before that I was doing planning's
a lot of research and go to market work
but you know the I would say the biggest
thing is don't box yourself in too soon
that and that's where I I get a little
bit the rub around like being a digital
marketer don't think of yourself that
way think of yourself as a generalist
allow yourself to engage with with
different types of people because
technology and the way people engage it
is there is no black and white at this
point and the second that you you put
yourself in the box you'll you will stay
in that box so even for me when I was
you know working on developing new
products with Chipotle or JetBlue you
always thought of yourself even was a
human and what the human would want
first and that will free that will free
yourself of that mm-hmm
any other advice you would have no but I
really wanted to echo with Jordan just
sad is yeah like the technology is
always changing reading of course as a
marketer you wanted to catch up you know
that trend however I think the essence
of marketing is always like to bring in
that empathy and to be able to have that
empathy you have to live a life and you
have to go out like you don't have you
you can you cannot just sit there every
day and then doing like analytics where
like a data crunching like you have to
go to grocery stores like you observe
how people short you go to farmers
market and ask people why they shop
there you go to you travel and you
really observe different cultures and
hope to get more inspiration so I'm a
big fan of like you need to have your
daily inspiration like open your eyes
eyes more yeah now I would actually like
to switch to some questions that we got
from our students who knew that you were
going for coffee and croissants so I'm
gonna read a question first from new and
Neil asks he says well with recent
advances in artificial intelligence
especially machine learning where do you
think digital marketing is
and what advice would you have for
students given that this trend is coming
so there'd be some advice you would have
on that Jordan I mean I mean it's it's
not that it's coming it's here yeah I
mean there's the the reality is the the
platforms you engage with every day are
reflecting the notion of machine
learning and artificial intelligence
everything we have is getting smarter so
I wouldn't say it's not as much wait for
it it's how can you start to learn
what's out there are you learning a
different coding language at least if
you're not learning it can you speak
different languages that aren't
necessarily your traditional ways that
humans talk but how can you start to
understand how machines talk and getting
getting into that space is really
important to spending time with
engineers are getting a coffee with an
engineer is really important and I would
say you know for us as marketers I think
we look forward to the day that you know
machine learning is is within our native
set because as you said the fact that
we're crunching these number is often
times and probably you're probably
sitting there kicking yourself like
there has to be some time some type of
algorithm that could do this and
forecast and model it better I think we
are mean and we're hungry and waiting
for that so now for the next kind of
realm of marketers it's how do you
understand that at it's at its root to
help even marketers like us getting
right get better and I would say that
again technology is important and the
students that you know it's here but
again I think it's still human beings
who are developing those content you
know and that's why I always believe
that consumer it's always great it's
always important difficult for the
consumer marketers to always learning
about like paying attention to consumer
behavior paying attention to how
consumers are kind of diagnosed or
absorb your content because I think some
of the some of the great advertising
campaigns that has done I don't know
maybe 50 years ago I still catches me
like no matter no matter what social
media have changed our lives that great
print advertising great of the fighting
competitive catches me nowadays as a
foreigner French I know I just believe
that you know you know again don't
develop a campaign for the sake of VR
they are always think about who you're
trying to speak to anything about your
your tools your tactics yeah that's true
we also tell our students that kind of
that content storytelling those are
elements that are very core to what a
marketer does and it's doodies will help
us along quite a bit will be great when
that day is there the weather algorithms
are taking over
but the storytelling and the actual
relating to your customer and getting to
know there is still important yeah we
always say you there's there's more data
than everyone knows what to do with but
it's just a matter of knowing how who's
reading it on the other end and then
where they taken it it does change it I
mean you as a marketer anyone still has
the power to shape that story right with
the information and how you get smart
about that I would say it goes back to
how how are you living how are you
understanding other people are living
where's the empathy I mean empathy is I
think a word that's come up so much in
marketing now right and it is it's
critical or you know regardless of yeah
yeah and machine learning and all of
those words that we I agree yeah yeah so
I have another question from a student
actually Neil Forrest asks whether it's
difficult to align offline marketing
with online marketing in the kind of got
to get your marketing message across so
you've both touched on that quite a bit
already but is there anything else that
you would like to add to this kind of
the offline online marketing part and
how a student should think about
balancing that mmm-hmm oh I mean all
marketing should have intention so I
think the regardless of its offline or
online you should be always making work
or campaign
with the intention of it being bigger
than itself yeah you know if you're
running a for example if you're running
a digital promo campaign how do you how
do you make that something that someone
wants to take a picture of and put on
their Instagram like how do you think of
the kind of expanse beyond the
particular placement in the same way
when we do you know experience marketing
I want that to be online I wanted
anyone's her to take a picture of that I
want them to take that to their to their
network so don't you know don't think of
it as this versus that think about it
how do I make something that someone's
going to want to love and believe in no
matter like no matter what it is I mean
I've I've seen banner I've seen banner
campaigns via phezzan
I've seen I've seen advertising
campaigns around pre-roll be smart and
funny and using search targeting so
don't yeah don't don't let it feel like
just because you're doing digital it has
to be yeah yeah holistically about you
Pro yeah just make it make it something
someone wants to feel laughs cry
whatever and it's okay if it's a promo
when someone's doing that like frankly
but the promo and you've done that
you've killed it I hate a pat on the
back right I totally agree with that and
I think and I nowadays even its digital
marketing maddest you think about
integrated you know in marketing where
how do you integrate offline marketing
and make that holistically in a cohesive
and I want to give you an example of
kind bar they recently did a very
interesting campaign where they put like
mountains of sugar at Times Square
kind of suggesting this is how much
children are eating every single day in
the US this is how much sugar they are
consuming and I think the mess they are
trying to get across is that you know we
really need to you know pay attention to
kind of the label and you really make
sure like you know you children doesn't
don't eat too much sugar but then that
particular can bend which is offline got
so much abuzz you know on Twitter you
know BuzzFeed where they were like you
know online publications right yes and I
think that kind of goes back to you now
and it inspires people right it's gonna
if you really can get that connect
going then the channels will basically
be almost irrelevant where the message
right very cool so and then I have one
last question question from Constantina
and she asks what social media channels
are good for food marketing touched a
little bit of that as well but if you
think about social media channels yeah
anything else we would like to add there
or we can think about that would be
interesting for construct you not to
think about as well I mean food is
experienced like at the end of the day
create something that people want to put
on every channel the thing is you can
never predict the next channel right
yeah consumers are gonna find it for you
Jen's e is gonna find it for you and
they're gonna do it completely
differently than everyone else so how do
you create moments IRL that are
interesting and engaging and frankly go
everywhere and that's I mean that is
food marketing at the end of the day
you can show someone a beautiful picture
of a pie or a burger but that person
needs to smell it they need to feel it
they need to think about it in that way
so and obviously I mean Instagram kills
it okay hard we know that like we're not
like you don't need us to tell you you
could actually write best social media
platform for food marketing and Google I
think everyone would just say Instagram
right now but it's always thinking about
what's what's coming next and yeah also
knowing that human beings are gonna sit
down at the table they're also gonna
want to be surprised by a pile of sugar
mm-hm and they're gonna take it where
they want and and being being smart
about that as a marketer is important
mmm-hmm definitely I think that again
social media landscape it's always
changing but I think definitely bring
that mindset of you know try something
experiment something and if you go fast
and if this doesn't work just move on
you know like for example Instagram they
are also constantly changing their
offerings for marketers like and you
know I think one year ago they have this
Instagram story now it's like everybody
is using only story in this story yeah
yeah yeah it's using it I think
they are also experimenting with some
fashion brands where you can tack
certain kind of you know clothes garment
pieces where you can just click through
that and you can which leads to you to
the online stores you can only purchase
there so I don't we think just paid
attention to how the media flow how the
merchants feel how the transaction flow
goes yeah be very experimental and as
you said like new channels emerge all
the time I have to watch for that right
like I think a few years ago people say
email marketing is like dying knowledge
is everybody's and they're like
Reformation it's sold like a bring it
back right and maybe it doesn't work as
an industry standard but maybe you can
make it work if you're innovative in
exactly yeah for some for some marketing
it works very very well right yeah good
well I think that is all really great
advice and I think on this note I would
like to end our chat I would like to
thank you very much for coming
it's a treat to our students oh yeah
thank you very much for taking the time
getting off a plane right system so
thank you and we will see you again at
our next coffee and croissants okay
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
