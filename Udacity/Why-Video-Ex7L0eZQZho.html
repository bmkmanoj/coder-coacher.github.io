post-production interns is a fantastic
idea okay I got it all right let's go
your lunch man would you give for each
Club yeah you know now you may be asking
yourself why video let's explore this a
little bit further now the video team's
main goal is to guide you and the course
team towards the creation of an engaging
and frankly awesome course to do that we
help define the best way to visually
convey the content usually through video
but also sometimes using graphics
animations live-action skits and even
props
hey you've done like 12 takes and I'm
trying to edit over here so could you
could you stop alright another way to
think about this concept is content is
king and we have plenty of ways to
translate your skip the material into
digestible content but here's the real
deal our primary method is video for a
number of reasons conveys a human
presence stimulates the visual and
auditory senses and can feel less
intimidating than a massive block of
text and what's more our courses are
designed to allow our students to work
at their own pace so they can rewind
fast forward and pause videos and
remember you can access our content just
about anywhere from a variety of devices
whether that be your phone or your
tablet or even your laptop you're not
constrained any sort of classroom where
your living room wherever you have
internet you can view our content with
that said let me uh let me show you a
video production real life figure out a
way out of here we're in a browser yeah
we're in a browser great degree ah okay
Lauren no no there's current location
get a place by ID let's take a step back
I remember really enjoying presenting
new ideas to my students that would make
them questions what they already know
something where there's a seemingly
simple task right there's just a trap
coming down hi I'm Magnus and I'm gust
wind
includes working with repugnance images
and labels
welcome
the journey of 100 miles begins with a
single step
