cannot obtain in finite time and that is
why the halting problem is called semi
decidable because we can kind of decide
half of the answers and it's also called
undecidable because we cannot output a
clear yes or no after a finite amount of
time why this nitpicking what's the
difference you may ask the interest of
this is of course rather theoretic but
semi decidable problems have a very
interesting property called recursive
enumerable 'ti now that sounds a bit
strange what does that mean recursive
enumerable 'ti means that you can write
a program that outputs all combinations
of inputs and programs and I really
seriously mean all combinations of
inputs and programs that halt so this
program you cannot say for any input and
program that this combination will not
halt but it can output a complete list
of combinations of inputs and programs
that will halt so let's have a look at
this program and of course this program
runs on infinitely so it starts out by
defining a length called max length to
be 0 and then it goes into an infinite
loop which is this one here and what it
does then is it increases max length by
1 each time it goes into this loop here
enumerates all programs of length at
most max length now if you fix this max
length here there is a huge number of
programs that have a length at most max
length but it's finite it's huge but
finite and the same goes for the inputs
so for all combinations of programs and
inputs that are shorter than this value
max length here we run a simulation for
exactly max length steps and if the
program halts on the input after exactly
max length steps then we print the
program and we print the input if it
hasn't halted yet don't care throw it
away wait until the next loop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
