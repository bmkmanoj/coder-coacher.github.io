the sample application let's make sure
we understand why it was designed the
way it was it's always best to consult
with an expert so let's ask Adrian
khakhra about the evolution of
applications hi Adrian hi Cara thanks
for being here
Adrian is the former cloud architect of
Netflix and the guy who Kelsey says made
micro-services mainstream what have you
been doing since you left Netflix so I
work for a venture capital company
battery ventures about last two years
what I mostly do is I help our portfolio
companies help with their technology
consult with them and spend time looking
for interesting new companies to invest
in very cool very cool well let's get
right into it over the last decade or so
there's been a ton happening in
application space can we talk about some
of those changes well if you think about
the way things were put together years
ago we had huge applications you know
think her if you know 5 million lines of
java or something like that
and it would take hours to just do a
build and then you'd have to go and find
somewhere to run it and it would take a
long time to work do all these things so
typically you would release software
relatively infrequently because it was a
lot of work to do it right what's
happened more recently is that we've
broken the software into smaller smaller
chunks so part of microservices is
making the chunks smaller so if your
build time has now gone from hours to
seconds and then you wrap it in a
container and you deploy the container
it takes seconds to do a deployment if
you're doing it yourself
and you're doing it you know you write
some piece of code and you think that
should work you put it through and test
it and it takes seconds to do then you
want to do that as often as make sense
you don't want to wait a month or three
months to release your code is that why
people have been using oh so the main
reason for micro services is speeding up
development if you think of you god
let's say you've got a hundred people
building a monolithic application and
somebody checks in something that's
broken and then in testing they find
it's broken that delays the release for
a week ninety nine people's work didn't
get out right or you put it in
production it blows up you have to roll
it back another week or so so what
happens when you have too many people
contributing to a single large piece of
code
is that any small thing that blocks it
is blocking huge amounts of work from
getting out and you vote you've created
a point a choke point that overly
coordinates everything so breaking it
into micro-services is really about
freeing up everybody to run at their own
speed you can have somebody with a brand
new thing they've just started building
they might do ten releases a day as
they're just trying to get it into shape
something else that's very mature might
be updating once a month other pieces in
between right right so then how do you
coordinate all those pieces that are out
there
you don't coordinate right so if you
coordinate them you're going back to the
monolith right and that's what slows
things down so the point really is to
let everybody release on their own cycle
which means you need to make sure that
the interfaces are relatively stable and
you can deploy any piece of it
independently of any other piece
typically without sort of asking
permission but you typically let people
know okay that makes a lot of sense so
then what about all the infrastructure
that goes into being able to rollback
deploy monitor or test these you need a
lot of automation to do it effectively
so think of what used to be meetings
with operations teams as being turned
into api's and automation and scripts
right so the the exact way you configure
something complicated might be like a
chef script or something like that that
does all of the setup on something or it
might be baked into a container if it's
a you know a chunk of code that you want
to deploy so those sorts of things will
all tie in together and then if you want
to coordinate a lot of things and
release them at once then you need some
sort of container scheduler with some
way to compose them together and link
everything together it's like a docker
compose file or a kubernetes can your
configuration files
thank you I've learned a lot thank you
so much Adria okay thanks very much just
after talking with Adrian it seems like
we need to explore this microservices
pattern more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
