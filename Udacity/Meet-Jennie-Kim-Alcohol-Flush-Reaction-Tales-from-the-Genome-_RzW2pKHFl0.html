I experience alcohol flush reaction well
for those of us like me who have not
experienced the alcohol flush reaction
can you describe it for us basically I
get really warm and I turned bright red
whenever I drink alcohol I seen dad do
you is it associated with any feelings
of being sick um I did a little bit
queasy I don't tolerate alcohol very
well and I really can't drink more than
a couple of drinks at a time I see so
your tolerance then is maybe a little
bit lower than other people of your same
height and size exactly now is this
something that's common in your family
it is my dad also experienced alcohol
flush reaction and he really doesn't
drink as a result now when did you first
realize that you have this kind of
alcohol flush it's kind of a funny story
my mom was looking through my facebook
party pictures back when I was in
college and one day she just sort of a
she's looking through them look up at me
and said why is so sunburned and all
your pictures and that's when I realized
something was that yeah my mom didn't
didn't understand because she herself
does not have alcohol flush reaction I
see now does this mean that you have any
personal genetic information about
yourself or your family for this
particular trade yes we've all we've all
used 23andme you have and what was your
report for the aldh2 the aldehyde
dehydrogenase enzyme if i can remember
correctly um my father and i only have
one working copy of that gene i see so
you're heterozygous yes so wow so that
means you well we don't know who you
inherited it from unless we know is your
mom you said your mom does not have this
I see so you know that you inherited
this from your dad for my dad Wow how
does that make you feel I don't know
just empathetic guy yes yeah um do you
consider this I guess a good or a bad
trade at all or a positive or a negative
thing well it's funny that you ask that
you know I think if you'd ask me this in
cough back in college I would have said
it's definitely negative thing I wish we
didn't have it then I could you know I'm
champagne all the time and it would be
awesome but now I'm actually pretty
grateful for it first of all it's good i
think that it helps me be more
where the impact alcohol has on my body
which is generally a good thing for my
health and well-being and second I
actually kind of like or at least
appreciate strangely enough how that
this reaction is somewhat socially
embarrassing and awkward I actually
appreciate feeling bad about myself
sometimes because that's why I'm funny
you're is an interesting point there you
know someone who experiences alcohol
flush reaction and let's say someone
watching this class maybe is only just
discovering this for themselves is it it
an embarrassing feeling or like do
people ever like make fun of you for it
or well you know I think um back when I
started noticing it I was much more
self-conscious I like to think though
that really that people are too
self-involved to really notice other
people at least I am so I you know I
have become a lot more comfortable with
that and I also just don't care as much
yeah so obviously the disadvantages of
alcohol flush reaction of it you can
feel kind of bad you don't have that
high of a tolerance and there may be
some kind of awkward social stuff
occasionally are there any advantages
besides the ones you mentioned about
being more self-aware about yourself is
there any kind of other advantage to I
actually like the fact that it moderates
it forces me to moderate my drinking and
be pretty judicious about drinking I
always have to ask myself like is this
cocktail really worth it I have a saying
that I can either be drinking or I can
be cute but I can't be both the same
time so I'll often just choose to be
cute and you know just choose not to
partake in in alcohol at all and as I'm
getting older I can appreciate that more
to have that to have that choice and I
feel better you know in the morning so
maybe some of my other friends would
what about um any kind of medication you
know for lactose intolerance and people
who actually whose bodies don't
metabolize lactose very easily they can
actually take a bioactive form of
lactase which allows them to digest
dairy products is there anything like
that for alcohol flush reaction that you
know of there's kind of this over the
counter remedy that a lot of like my
asian peers and i discovered it's just
an over-the-counter antacid or acid
reducing pill which i used to call the
anti-asian
he'll and I used to take that when I
drink but later I found out that
research show that actually isn't good
for you to suppress your body's symptoms
as it processes is toxin I'm so I
stopped taking it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
