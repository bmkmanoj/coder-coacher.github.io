n-bit history predictor quiz we said
that we want to have an n-bit history
predictor with two bit counters possible
history and we need a thousand twenty
four entries like that and now we want
to compute the cost for these predictors
how well they do on the N and T pattern
and also how many of the two bit
counters do they actually use for the NT
repeating pattern the cost can be
computed as simply the size of the
history plus we need to to the end two
bit counters for each entry and if you
compute what this is it amounts to five
hundred thirty two thousand four hundred
eighty bits so this is around half a
megabit of predictor stuff for just a
thousand twenty four entries with n
equals sixteen we are talking about 134
million two hundred thirty four thousand
one hundred and twelve bits so this is
many many mega bits worth of predictor
stuff again for the same number of
entries as you can see this is probably
not a realistic predictor at all and
even this one probably you don't want to
spend that much harder on just branch
bullish let's now see how well they do
on the N and T pattern this is a pattern
of length four so anything that has n
equal three or more will handle it well
so from that perspective all three of
these will do well these two will do
well on even longer patterns and finally
how many of those two bit counters that
we have are we actually using for the
not taken taken not taken taken think
about it this way for the N equals one
when we need to predict the taken branch
we have a history of just zero because
it's a single bit history when we need
to predict the not taken branch we have
a history of just one so we're using
both of these when we have N equals four
and trying to predict this not taking
branch our history is zero one zero one
when we're trying to predict the taken
branch
the history will be one zero one zero
when we're trying to predict the next
not taken branch the history again will
be zero one zero one so as you can see
really we will be only using entries 0 1
0 1 and 1 0 1 0 so we're still using
only two of the 16 two bit counters if
you look at the 8-bit history the
history will just be 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 and
1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 here so we will still be
using only 2 of now 256 2 bit counters
so we are now using less than 1% of the
counters we have in each entry and
finally for this history you can see the
trend here we will be using only 2 2 bit
counters of more than 65,000 that we
have in each entry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
