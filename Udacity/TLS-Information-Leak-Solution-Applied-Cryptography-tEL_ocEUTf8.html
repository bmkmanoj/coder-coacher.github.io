should be worried about the attacker
might not learn the exact size because
of padding on the requests up to the
block size the same thing for the
responses the attacker also learns the
pattern and this reveals a lot about a
web page because of optimizations and
HTTP they're often multiple responses to
one request this could be because a
large page is broken into many responses
it could because there are many images
on the page and they get responded and
although they would normally require
separate requests because of caching
they could be sent before those requests
so these patterns are very
distinguishing different web pages will
have different sizes of responses as
well as a different pattern an example
of where this is particularly dangerous
in modern web applications so we're
using HTTPS connected to Google and now
when i type a letter i get a response
it's filling up the guesses of what i'm
going to type next the size of this
response depends on the letter that i
typed if i type another letter well i
get a different response you can see
that Udacity is the most popular word
starting with you d at least according
to when i'm using google i don't know if
that's true for everyone but that size
differs and if i type another letter
will i get a different response and so
the size of these responses depend on
the letters i'm typing the length of
these words will affect the size the
response and you can build a model that
would identify what someone is typing
based on the sizes of these responses
and there's a paper by a group from
microsoft research that shows some of
these vulnerabilities and how much
information at attacker can learn from
that there's another paper by Peter
Chapman and myself and you may remember
Peter if you took cs101 he was the TA
for that that looked at ways of
measuring this and understanding how
much information is really leaking so
this is a serious attack it's something
that even though the encryption is there
that an attacker can learn a lot about
what's going on on a web page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
