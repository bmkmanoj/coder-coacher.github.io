be thinking all right I'm ready to go
let's do this but there might be a small
voice in the back of your head or
perhaps very loud one that's saying wait
I'm not a graphic designer I'm not an
artist how am I going to make this app
actually look good so people want to use
it to which I say don't worry there's a
lot of great services out there that
provide high-quality images and graphics
that you can use in your own app first
you have your basic google image search
now anything that you search here will
bring up a lot of results so you'll need
to be wary of any copyright restrictions
but given the right search terms you can
find some real and free gems istockphoto
and 99 designs are also great options if
you're looking for more professional
high quality graphics however these
services do cost a bit of money but
they're usually pretty reasonable maybe
there are other services out there that
you found that you are going to use in
your app if you find those I encourage
you to share them with your fellow
classmates on the forum I'll actually be
interested to see them too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
