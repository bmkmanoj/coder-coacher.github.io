repository hosted on github com well you
don't really need to know anything about
either get or github for this course I
wanted to explain a bit so that it
doesn't seem like some scary black box a
git repository or repo is just a folder
full of stuff usually code as well as a
history of snapshots of that code these
snapshots are known as commits if this
repository is sitting on a server
somewhere it becomes super easy for a
bunch of people to all talk to the
repository potentially all making
changes at the same time in such a way
that no one steps on each other's toes
with their changes the very very short
version is that you clone repository you
make some changes to your local files
you commit those files to your local
repository merge in any changes that
anyone else is made in the meantime and
then push your version back up to the
main repository get is what's called a
version control system and it makes
creating software projects like the code
for this course super super easy if
you're interested in learning more
Udacity actually has a whole course on
git which you can find at Udacity calm /
UD 775 or by following the link down in
the instructor notes book market and
check it out later get is a crazy useful
tool anyway at Udacity we use a service
called github to host our gate
repositories the code we're going to
share with you has actually been on
github the entire time we've been
working on this course it's just that we
flipped a switch to make the repository
public when the course went live that
also means that all the messy history
from when this course was in development
is still in there feel free to poke
around and find all the embarrassing
commit messages also to you github
masters out there if you find errors in
the course code pull requests are
gratefully accepted</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
