the home being adorable is not the only
way to be accepted but as certainly a
popular way to be accepted a lot of
people respond to cute things and a lot
of people look at him and say oh my God
he's so cute I have to have one and
that's one great way to make people want
to to own curry to bring him into your
home and certainly your pets a lot of
people find their pets to be very
adorable and that's when the main
reasons why they have them and so the
fact that Korea is adorable and as he's
driving around your house doing his
adorable animations and greeting you and
just tumbling around it helps a lot in
you being happy that he's around you
every day
so Perry is not a security robot Kerry
is a companion robot but curry does have
some features that allow you to do some
amount of we'd like to say peace of mind
and checking in on your home rather than
security but it's very important that in
order to even do those things that the
curry curry should not be creepy Kerry
should not appear like a creepy Big
Brother surveillance robot and it helps
a lot that curry is adorable and
personable and acts like a pet and so
it's like oh my pet is here and mice I
can see that's okay as opposed to this
creepy Big Brother robot is driving
around watching me at every moment and
you know curry can take pictures of
video and that's okay and versus like
you know creepy Cyclops robot and you
know driving around might need people
look self-conscious feel self-conscious
around a camera in their home so another
big part of making curry a durable
personable is failing cute so curry when
he for instance bumps into something
with his bump sensor a normal robot that
is just you know a tank like whatever he
bumps into things you're like stupid
robot oh why did you do that Oh your
algorithm suck but curry when he bought
some the things he can't see he bumps
and he makes his startled sound and he
looks down to see like oh what was that
and it's super adorable and when you see
Kure do that you instinctively think oh
poor robot and let me help you and that
goes a long way towards acceptance of
the robot even when he is imperfect
because he's going to be imperfect and
that goes for other things too so if
he's confused then he makes a cute
confused noise and look so that you pity
him rather than and you want to help him
other than being
why did him angry at him so him being
adorable when he fails it makes you
empathize with him they want to help him</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
