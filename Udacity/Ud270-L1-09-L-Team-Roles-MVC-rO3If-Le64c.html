started and I really think it would be a
good idea to get a designer on board
I'll work on getting us one and what the
three of us working together we'll be
able to divide up our tasks get the site
organized and we'll finish up in no time
cheers of that hello everyone today we
begin our mission to clean up messy code
using the MPC design pattern and we will
help as Sakaya make this application
more organized modular maintainable and
dry if we succeed you'll be able to make
changes more quickly and effectively
before we begin let's take a moment to
introduce ourselves I'm your engineer I
will help you write code that uses the
API to interact with the data source
this is ori your designer she will help
you create beautiful templates and a
design for your site good to meet you or
eat I'm Hezekiah nice pink shirt by the
way it's not pink its teaberry sounds
great so what am I gonna do you Hezekiah
as the founder will manage all the
moving pieces of the application and
learn how to put the pieces together
currently the guts of your application
are all in one file and you find
yourself in a situation where you need
to make changes quickly but each change
requires a painful amount of time to
complete why is it so difficult because
the Ruby code that interacts with the
data source is so tightly coupled with
the code that's responsible for how the
data will be displayed we are going to
solve this problem by using separation
of concerns to divide up your
application into three layers the model
the view and the controller the model
layer will be responsible for
interacting with the data source all the
code used to access filter or modify the
data will be part of the model layer for
example if I want to collect information
on products that fall within a
particular price range that code that
extracts that data will live in the
model layer
the view layer will be responsible for
how the page looks to the user all the
page templates will be part of the view
layer and finally there will be a
controller layer which will be
responsible for connecting all the
pieces and relaying information between
the users the model and the view now
that we have a plan let's begin by
creating the model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
