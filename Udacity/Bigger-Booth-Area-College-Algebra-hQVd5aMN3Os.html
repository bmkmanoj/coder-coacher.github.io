gotten the opportunity to expand the
area of his booth at the expo now it's
15 feet long and 20 feet wide as excited
as he is about this we know grant he
always wants more he wants to make this
booth even bigger the person in charge
of the expo is going to continue the
regulation he had before which is that
if grant is going to increase this booth
sighs he has to do it by the same length
in each direction let's call that length
x just like we did earlier however
there's one catch the expo authorities
are adding another restriction to booth
sighs the area of a given booth is not
allowed to exceed 750 square feet
considering this new rule that's been
put in place about area how should we
express the booth area are we going to
need an equation are we going to need an
inequality or do we need something else</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
