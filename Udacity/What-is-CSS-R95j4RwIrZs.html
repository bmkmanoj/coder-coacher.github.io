simple unstyled web page looks pretty
plain doesn't it wouldn't it be better
if we could add some style to it
maybe we could lay out the content
differently use a different font or
emphasize different elements CSS can
help us do just that CSS are cascading
style sheets is the markup language that
we use to describe how elements on
websites should look CSS is all about
style look at youtubes homepage with CSS
it can control things like color spacing
fonts and layouts for their website
what makes CSS so powerful is it gives
you the web developer the ability to
change the look of elements on the page
CSS is also nice because it lets us
separate the description of the content
we want on the page the HTML from the
description of how we want the content
to look on the page the CSS let's look
at an example
this is Yahoo's homepage but what if I
looked at Yahoo's homepage without CSS
what would it look like whoa looks
pretty weird doesn't it the content is
still here but it looks terrible what
happened to the navigation at the top
the menu on the side the search bar and
the news stories well this is the beauty
of CSS literally all the code that makes
the page look the way it does is
separate from the text images and
content that is on the page if I add the
CSS back then we're back to the same
Yahoo home page from before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
