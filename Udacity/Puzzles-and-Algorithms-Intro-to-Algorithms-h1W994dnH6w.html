tricky puzzles that that just intrigues
people so much have you have you spent
time thinking about that well I have a
little bit um and I don't take it for
granted that it intrigues everyone some
people does not actually intrigued
everyone they treat a lot of people at
petitions even mathematicians and
computer scientists uh many of them run
when they hear plus oh no i'll say i'm
no good at puzzles i'm leaving the room
and it is certainly true that that you
can do good in fact you can do great
mathematics without being a puzzle
solver kind of a person in great
computer sciences a great computer
science as well there's some kinds of
math and computer science where you you
create structures of things you you
don't try to solve puzzles you try to
create structures you try to define
things you can do all kinds of great
stuff this way so not all mathematicians
or computer scientists like this kind of
puzzle and are like puzzles of any kind
on the other hand lots of people who are
not mathematicians and I love
mathematical puzzles their loads and
loads of amateurs out there who adore
this kind of puzzle there are lots of
people with with mathematical talent
logical talent people just with good
creative minds who are not doing
mathematics or computer science or
anything like that who are really good
at this sort of thing if you like
puzzles obviously they're good for you
know mental exercise keeping the mind
shark but mathematical puzzles really do
and introduce you to techniques that you
can actually use in solving problems
like you rent a car and I gave examples
of this as you just saw these problems
arose and the techniques used to solve
them can be used to solve other problems
so they give you new ideas I help you
think creatively on the negative side
solving puzzles could distract you from
doing something more important right
but I like to think that you can't do
important stuff 24 hours a day you need
to spend some time doing stuff that's
just and then and if there's if
there's a blurry line between what's fun
and what's hard work so much better yes
so and but there's also something very
satisfying at the end when the when all
the pieces fall into place and you
didn't know why it had to be 15
prisoners or whatever it had to be but
like everything kind of makes sense at
the end and it can be I think some of us
find that extremely gratifying I think I
agree and it's a it's just a little bit
like many puzzles are like riddles right
you once you see the loose from once you
can really grok the solution right use a
hot is that is that kind of thing I have
to say that there are also other kinds
of puzzles not sort of the riddle side
puzzle but puzzles which challenge your
intuition and I like those a lot too and
those have a different function which is
to keep your mathematical intuition from
running off the rails to to get you to
distrust certain notions of for example
probabilities a lot of their probability
which you know we humans invented to try
to deal with all the uncertainty that's
in the world from our perspective is
something that we don't always know how
to deal with and and puzzles involving
profit only especially ones with very
counterintuitive result side you try to
prove or disprove can really help you
keep sharp</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
