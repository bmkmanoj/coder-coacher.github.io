general than other models that we've
talked about and so just to make that
case here's a way of making the
stochastic game settings more
constrained and by making them more
constrained actually turning them into
other models that we've talked about or
could talk about so I wrote down three
different ways of constraining the
stochastic game model one says that
we're gonna make the reward function for
one player the opposite of the reward
function for the other the next one says
that the transition function has the
property that for any state and joint
action and next state it's that's going
to be equal to the transition
probability for state joint action next
date where we've changed potentially the
choice of action for player two mm-hmm
so basically player two doesn't matter
to the transitions or the rewards for
player one and the rewards for player
two are always zero so then that's again
you can specify this as a stochastic
game and then the third case we are
saying that the number of states in the
environment is exactly 1 hmm so I claim
that by doing these can these
restrictions we get out the Markov
decision process model a 0 some
stochastic game model and the repeated
game model that we've been talking about
in the context of like the folk theorem
so what I'd like you to do is write the
letters a B and C in the correct boxes
okay go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
