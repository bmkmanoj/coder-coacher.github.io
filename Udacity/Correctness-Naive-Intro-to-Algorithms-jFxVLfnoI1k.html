of the correctness of the naive
algorithm we just spoke about so I'm
going to proceed by taking advantage of
a particular observation so what we're
trying to prove here is the correctness
of the claim that naive a B outputs the
product of a and B so the observation
that I'm going to make is that before or
after the while loop in the
implementation of naive this statement
is always true at the variables x and y
multiplied together and added to z is
exactly equal to a times B so how are we
going to show that this is the case so
the first time we're going through the
while loop in the very beginning at the
top of the function X is assigned to a Y
is assigned to B and Z is assigned to 0
so let's check the expression with those
variables plugged in we're saying that's
a B equals a B plus 0 well that's kind
of obvious the next thing we're going to
show is that if it's the case then at
the beginning of the while loop
this condition holds that a times B is
exactly equal to x times y plus Z then
it's going to be the case that with the
new values so x y and z may change the
new values X prime Y Prime and Z prime
are going to satisfy this as well so if
it was true before then it has to be
true after so why would this be true
let's remind ourselves what the code
looks like again so what happens in each
iteration of the loop is that a new
value of Z is computed which is the old
value plus the value of y and a new
value of x is computed which is the old
value minus 1 we basically have the new
value of x is the old value minus 1 the
new value of Y well it didn't change and
the new value of Z is the old value of Z
plus y all right so now what can we say
about X prime times y prime plus Z prime
we know what X prime Y Prime and Z prime
are so let's substitute those in that's
X minus 1 times y plus Z plus y and now
we'll just do a little bit of algebra
multiplying this out we get X Y minus y
plus Z plus y and these y's plus y and
minus y cancel and so we get is X y plus
Z but notice what we assumed we said if
it was the case that X Y plus C is equal
to a B
then what we're showing is that X prime
y prime plus Z prime is equal to a B
well guess what we showed that X prime
times y prime plus Z prime does indeed
equal a B if it was true at the top of
the loop so this condition that we're
testing here this a B equals XY plus C
is maintained through each step of the
while loop it starts out true and it
remains true each time it goes through
the while loop so what we know is that
while this code is running each time we
go through the while loop this condition
is always true and eventually the while
loop terminates the while loop
terminates when x equals 0 so what does
that mean XY plus Z has to equal a B but
X is 0 so that 0 times y plus Z equals a
B this has to be true well 0 times y is
0 so this is actually saying that Z has
to be equal to a B at the end of the
loop once X reaches 0 Z has to equal a B
keep in mind that's exactly what we
return the value of Z so the thing that
is returned is going to be a times B so
let's just take a look at the code again
and see that that's what it's doing each
time it goes through its decrementing
acts accumulating the values in Z and
eventually when X is exhausted it
returns Z and it is exactly a times B</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
