these things in particular we've got
state and state dynamics and we've got a
sensor model so in the math it's easy we
just write X and we say X is the state
but state of what Montana with Missouri
you know what no is state of the object
timber mrs. oh it's state of the object
well what does that mean obviously some
representation of the object its
position its velocity maybe something
about whether it's happy or sad and that
sounds like a joke but actually if you
think about tracking the state of the
object there's no requirement that the
state be a purely physical thing it's
anything that can have an influence on a
sensor measurement that you want to know
speaking of sensor measurements or
speaking of Z that's the measurement but
the measurement of what what measurement
are you going to use and how does the
measurement relate to the state so if we
do real tracking we have to know these
things and finally where do you get your
dynamics from you'll go to the the
dynamics shelf and home depot and say I
need some dynamics please you know where
you're going to get these for computer
vision the discussion we're going to use
today comes a bit from this paper and
the idea of using particles and sample
based representations of densities that
wasn't knew that was known a variety of
mathematics and in other engineering
fields but this is the paper that really
brought it to computer vision</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
