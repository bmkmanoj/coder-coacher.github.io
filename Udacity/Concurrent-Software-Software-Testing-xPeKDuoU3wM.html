different issue which is what we should
do about test coverage for concurrent
software now in general in this class we
haven't been dealing at all with testing
of concurrent code and that's mainly
because it's a difficult and specialized
skill let's talk briefly about what
coverage of concurrent software would
actually mean first of all hopefully
it's clear the while applying sequential
code coverage metrics to concurrent
software is a fine idea
probably these aren't going to give us
any confidence that the code lacks
concurrency or such as race conditions
and deadlocks let's talk about how we
would figure out if we've done a good
job testing concurrent software so let's
take for example this function X fur
which transfers some amount of money
between bank account 1 and bank account
to this particular function is designed
to be called from different threads so
what I've done here is marked a 1 and a
2 in red and these variables are
representing the different bank accounts
and they're in red in order to indicate
that these are shared between different
calls to experts and so the transfer
function is going to be called from one
thread so some thread is going to
transfer money between accounts and then
also several other threads are going to
do the same thing so we have is multiple
threads calling this transfer function
and as long as the threads are moving
money between different accounts
probably everything's alright on the
other hand since the transfer function
does not synchronize that it hasn't
taken any sort of a lock while it
manipulates the accounts if these
threads are operating on the same
accounts concurrently then there's going
to be a problem we're going to mess up
the balances of the accounts that are
involved so now we ask the question what
sort of coverage would we be looking for
while testing this function in order to
detect this kind of bug an answer is
some sort of a coverage metric to make
sure that threads t1 and t2 both call
this function at the same time while
transferring our money between the same
accounts so the coverage would
essentially be t1 gets partway into the
function and then let's say it stops
running the processor then starts to run
t2 which operates on the accounts and
then completes and then this
interleaving of actions between the
different threads would be what would
constitute a unit of test coverage so
that is to say we want to make sure we
tested the case where the transfer
account is concurrently call so that's
one kind of coverage that we might look
for when testing and current software</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
