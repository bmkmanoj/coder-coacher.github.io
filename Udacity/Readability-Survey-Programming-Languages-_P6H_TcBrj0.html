Jonathan an assistant instructor for an
upcoming course Peter side of town this
week so I'll be handling the unit 5
office hours this week so first question
how's that readability survey coming
it's a great question and relatively
timely turns out that readability survey
the research project that we gave
everyone a chance to be involved in is
going really really well over 6,000
people have started taking the survey
and over 2,000 people completed it all
the way through and results are still
coming in again this is officially
unrelated to Udacity or your grade it's
totally optional although it would make
me so happy if you would take the survey
still totally optional we have a number
of students with no experience taking
the survey which is great we have a
number of students with quite a bit of
experience and we even have interesting
students who appear to possess the power
of time travel or have made slight typos
when filling in at the end how much
experience they have there are people
who have more years of experience in
Python than Python has actually been
around presumably Guido's father or
something like that we are pleased as
punch with the current results of the
survey and I think it speaks to the
charity the kindness of students at
Udacity and elsewhere who are interested
in helping out with this sort of thing
my graduate student Jonathan Dorn and I
will definitely be giving the song
reward later on however since this is a
family show since anyone could be
shining signing up for you dasty classes
a number of the more interesting
suggestions for things that we will sing
even though they're more humorous than
outlandish may have to be pushed aside
because we in essence want it to be
rated G at the end still cast your votes
for how you would like us to sing or
otherwise reward you and let me just
once again thank everyone who took the
time to participate I know it did take
time and I know this sort of survey or
research might seem hard to understand
when you first get involved in it why is
he asking me these questions why is he
not showing me the entire context of a
function why doesn't he define what
readability is
all of those things that appear to be
tricky about the survey or about this
study we're set up that way in order to
help us scientifically isolator control
for various variables so it's tricky and
I'm glad you took the time to do it and
I think it will help us out a lot we've
had more than an order of magnitude more
people participate in this survey then
previous similar surveys and software
engineering it's a really exciting time
and it seems that classes like the
classes here at Udacity have the
opportunity not just to transform
education but to have an impact on
research near and dear to my heart on
both fronts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
