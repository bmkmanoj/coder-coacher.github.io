three takeaway messages the first one is
that having an effective architecture is
fundamental in a software project or as
I say here a great architecture is a
ticket to a successful project to put in
a different way although a great
architecture does not guarantee that
your project will be successful having a
poor architecture will make it much more
difficult for your project to be
successful the second message is that an
architecture cannot come about in a
vacuum you need to understand the domain
of the problem that you're trying to
solve in order to define an
architectural solution that fits the
characteristics of the problem so a
great architecture reflects a deep
understanding of the problem domain and
finally a great architecture is likely
to combine aspects of several simpler
architectures it is typical for
engineers to see problems that are new
but such that parts of the problems have
already been solved by someone else an
effective engineer should therefore
first of all know what is out there know
the solution space second an engineer
should understand what has worked well
and what has failed miserably in similar
occasions in the past and finally an
effective engineer should be able to
suitably combine existing solutions
appropriately to come up with an
effective overall solution for the
specific problem at hand and this is
just as true in the context of software
architectures when defining a software
architecture you should innovate only as
much as you need to and reuse as much as
you can as we said earlier in the lesson
by doing so that is by innovating only
as much as you need to and reusing as
much as you can you will be able to
avoid reinventing the wheel you will be
able to choose the right solution to
known problems and identify suitable
solutions for new problems so ultimately
you will be able to realize an effective
software architecture that will help the
success of your project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
