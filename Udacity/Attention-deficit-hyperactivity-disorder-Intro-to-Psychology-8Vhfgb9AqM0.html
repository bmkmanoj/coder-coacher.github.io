is one of the most common childhood
disorders in the United States and it
can continue into adolescence in
adulthood according to the national
institute of mental health symptoms
include difficulty staying focused and
paying attention difficulty in
controlling behavior and hyperactivity
let's look at three types of symptoms
first we have inattention someone who
has symptoms of an attention can be
easily distracted they may miss details
or forget things and they frequently
switch from one behavior or activity to
another they can become bored with a
task after only a few minutes unless
they are doing something that they
really enjoy this means they can have
trouble completing or turning in
homework assignments they often lose
things needed to complete a task and
they seem to not listen when spoken to
furthermore they make daydream become
easily confused and even struggle to
follow directions or instructions a
child who has symptoms of hyperactivity
may squirm or fidget in their seat
someone with symptoms of hyperactivity
may talk non-stop they may run around
touching and playing with everything in
sight they've trouble sitting still at
dinner at school and thus they may get
in trouble from teachers as well as
parents for their hyperactivity now
let's look at impulsivity symptoms of
impulsivity means a person may be very
impatient they may blurt out
inappropriate comments or show their
emotions without restraint and they may
often act out without regard for
consequences they may have difficulty
waiting for things that they want and
they may interrupt people's
conversations or activities now as you
can imagine children experiencing a
combination of these symptoms can
experience great difficulty in managing
their day-to-day behaviors that are
necessary and needed for doing well in
school or interacting with others and
completing a daily routine and not all
attention deficit disorders will be
exactly the same you'll see some who are
more inattentive rather than hyperactive
and some who are more impulsive rather
than inattentive in order to be
diagnosed with ADHD one must be the set
of diagnostic criteria that is comprised
of a number of symptoms of this disorder
and now the causes of ADHD or attention
deficit hyperactivity
order include a combination of genes and
environmental factors now for a long
time people suspected that the
consumption of sugar caused ADHD however
there's no research that's provided
support for that idea</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
