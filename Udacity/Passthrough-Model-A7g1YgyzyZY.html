through model the way the pastor model
works is that the VMM level driver is
responsible for configuring the access
permissions for a device for instance it
will allow a guest VM to have access to
the memory where the control registers
for the device our map they're clearly
benefits to this approach one is for
instance that the guest VM has exclusive
access to a particular device it's the
only one that can manipulate state that
can control it and it's the only one
that will use it also the VMS accesses
to the device completely bypass the
hypervisor so their direct access to the
device this model is also called the vm
em bypass model now clearly once we
start providing VMs with exclusive
access figuring out a way to share
devices will become difficult will
basically have to continuously
reassigned which particular vm it can
access a particular device over time but
the sharing will not happen
simultaneously concurrently that in some
cases is really not doable because of
limitations of the device in other cases
it can be done but it will be very a
high overhead operations so in practice
oh really device sharing with this model
is not feasible now because the
hypervisor is completely out of the way
it means that the guest VM and the
device driver that's in the gaslamp
directly operates and controls the
particular physical device so that means
that when we're launching this guest VM
there better be a device of the exact
same type as expected by the guest OS on
the physical machine in some cases maybe
in the server space that's not as
critical for requirement just because
there are fewer types of devices that
are commonly present there but in other
environments this is really not a
practical constraint remember we're not
talking about the fact that there needs
to be a network interface or a disk
device or hard disk device we're talking
about the exact same particular type of
network card or hard disk drive that the
guest VM expect
on the device drivers that it has also
we mentioned that one of the benefits of
virtualization is that the guess VMS are
decoupled from the physical hardware and
therefore we can migrate them easily to
other notes in the system well this
pass-through really breaks that
decoupling because it directly binds a
device to a vm this makes migration
difficult in particular because there
may be some a device specific state and
potential even device residence state
that would also need to be copied and
migrated and then properly configured at
the destination node and then basically
that turns vm migration not any
hypervisor and vm specific operation but
it needs to be implemented in a way that
knows how to deal with the device
specifics of all of the particular
devices that are of interest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
