been implemented on top of the do file
cache and let's see how that works the
semantics of our VM that is implemented
in Vista is exactly the same as what we
saw in the previous lesson namely LR vm
it is just that implementation takes
advantage of the fact that it is sitting
on top of a REO file cache so what we're
going to do in implementing our VM using
the Rio file cache is to map the data
segments to the virtual memory exactly
similar to what was done in the lr vm
primitive so when we map the external
data segments to virtual memory but
definition now this portion of the
memory becomes persistent because it is
containing the file cache and this file
cache survives power failure because of
the battery backup and therefore now we
made this portion of the virtual memory
that is mapped to this data segment
persistent so when we hit the begin
transaction call in the application what
we're going to do is make a before image
of the portion of the virtual memory
that we're going to modify during this
transaction remember that in the RVM
library the set of operations that you
do the virtual memory between begin
transaction and end transaction the
users intent is that those changes are
for persistent data structures and the
persistent data structures that they
want to modify they would execute a set
range call to say what portion of that
address range needs to be persisted so
what we do in this Vista which is an
implementation of our VM is at the point
of begin transaction we're going to make
a before image a copy in memory copy of
the portion of the address space that we
intend to modify during this transaction
that will serve as the undo log now note
that this is also mapped to the file
cache so the undo log is mapped to the
file cache and therefore this undo log
is by definition persistent now so the
undo record
if you create in memory we back it up on
the file cache and therefore this undo
log that we've created is actually
persistent it will survive failures so
when the program is executing the body
of the transaction is doing normal
program rights to a portion of the
virtual address space where it has
persistent data structures as well so
when it does this normal program rights
to this virtual memory the portion of
the virtual memory that is mapped to
this external data segments is by
definition persistent and so these
normal program rights actually get into
the data segment they're being
persistent automatically because this
portion of the virtual address space is
mapped to this data segment which is in
the file cache and therefore persistent
because of the battery backing so all
the changes that we're making during the
execution of the body of the transaction
code is actually getting persisted in
the original data segment for which this
was an in-memory copy but the in-memory
copy is actually sitting in file cache
which is battery backed then we reach
the end transaction in the application
code and remember in the end transaction
is when the changes have to be committed
well you know what the changes are
already committed because that is the
semantics of mapping the data segment in
virtual memory and because the file
cache is persistent all the changes that
we made to the virtual memory during
these normal program rights are actually
reflected in the data segment so at the
end transaction at commit point you
don't have to do anything other than
getting rid of this undo log because the
transaction is committed and therefore
you can throw away the sundew log and
all the changes are already in there by
design the construction just as an aside
if you think about lr vm implementation
commit point is the point where there is
heavy lifting to be done because in lr
vm at the commit point the redo log
which are being created by lr vm to
reflect the changes to the persistent
data structures in memory have
to be forced to the disk but in Vista
which is implementation of our vm on a
persistent file cache no work needs to
be done at the point of entrance action
for commit because all the changes that
the application developer intended to be
committed to the data segments are
already in there and therefore at commit
point all that needs to be done by vista
is to get rid of this under log on the
other hand if the transaction awards in
that case what needs to be done is the
undo record that we created at the
beginning of the transaction the before
image we are to take that and copy it
back into the portion of the virtual
memory that we modified because that is
a semantic of our VM that if the
transaction aborts we restore the
virtual memory back to its original
state before the beginning of the
transaction so the before image that we
saved at the beginning of the
transaction we copy it back into this
portion of the virtual memory that has
been modified during this transaction
and once we do that we can throw away
the undo log and when we restore the
before image into the virtual memory
that we are also correcting whatever
changes we made to the data segment
automatically because remember that this
picture is just showing the virtual
address space of the process and this is
really the physical memory which is
being used as a file cache
battery-backed and a portion of the
virtual address space is in this battery
back file cache rest of the address
space of the application does not need
persistence that can be a normal
physical memory only the portion of the
application memory that has persistence
guarantees through this data segment
needs to be mapped to this portion of
the physical memory that is battery
backed so just to recap what happens a
10 transaction if it's a commit no work
to be done except get rid of the undo
record all the changes to persistent
data structures are already in there in
the data segment on the other hand if it
avoids restore the old
image back into the virtual memory I
have back in business as though this
transaction never happened the
implication of this Vista implementation
which is our vm on top of your file
cache is that there is no disk i/o at
all and there's no redo log because
we're directly writing into the data
segments all the external data segments
that we define in the initialization of
the RVM library on the disk they become
memory resident when you map them into
the virtual address space of the
application so the external data
segments become persistent because of
being brought into the file cache and
mapped into the virtual memory space of
the server application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
