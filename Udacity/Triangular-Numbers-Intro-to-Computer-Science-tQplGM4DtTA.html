numbers and they're formed by taking the
position and summing all the numbers
from one up to the position so for the
first number we have one for the second
number we have to note that unlike
Python we're indexing from one N equals
three the third number is formed by
summing 1 plus 2 Plus 3 which is 6 and
the fourth number is 1 plus 2 Plus 3
plus 4 which is 10 now how are we going
to get these numbers 1 to 4 here to sum
well Python has a nice way of doing that
and that's using range now we want the
numbers to start at 1 and we want them
to finish at 4 now the way range works
is it takes the first input and starts
there and it finishes at 1 less than the
last input so in order to get 4 we're
going to have to take the range from 1
to 5 when we come to write our procedure
we're going to use n instead of 4 so
that means that our range will have to
be from 1 up to n plus 1 now we're ready
to write the procedure so procedure name
is triangular and it takes an input
which is an integer positive integer and
and we want to output or return a number
the enth triangular number I'm just
going to call it number so we want to
loop through all the numbers 1 up to N
in the range don't forget the plus 1
there to make sure we go up to N and
we're just going to add each of the
values I as we come to it in the loop
and then when we're done we're going to
return the number</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
