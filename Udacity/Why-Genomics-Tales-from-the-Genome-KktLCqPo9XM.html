hereditary material or DNA that makes up
who you are now until about a decade ago
it wasn't even possible to look at your
whole genome at one time we were only
looking at bits and pieces of your
genome regions we call genes
individually in a field called genetics
and eventually over time the field of
genetics looking at these individual
genes one at a time blossomed into this
field of genomics now the global picture
of genomics is to get a global picture
of you looking at many genes at one time
to see how they shape who you are
obviously this is a pretty big task we
could use a little bit of help we've
teamed up with 23andme a personal
genetics company based in California
that aims to connect people with their
own genomes I'd like to introduce to all
of you the senior director of research
at 23andme Joanna mountain thank you
Matt I'm really excited to be part of
tales from the genome well we're pretty
excited to have you here I'm curious is
there any trade about yourself that
you've always wondered more about what
the genetic causes I have to say I was
always curious about why I had red hair
and freckles and no one else in my
family did and where did that come from
you know how did I get so lucky yeah and
so that's something that I was curious
about for much of my life and when I was
able to look into my DNA I could start
to learn more about who might have
inherited that from and and what the
genetic basis was for that red hair and
freckles I'm sure some of you out there
have wondered about some of your own
trade so tell us what's one trade about
yourself that you've always wanted to
know a bit more about the genetic basis
