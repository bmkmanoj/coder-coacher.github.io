algorithm to solve this problem so
here's some of the characteristics that
we want out of our algorithm we want
lots of parallelism coalesced memory
access minimal execution divergence and
something that's easy to implement and
I'm going to show you an algorithm that
gives you all of those characteristics
and then I'm going to tell you why it's
a crummy algorithm so as we're going
along I want you to think about why this
algorithm isn't going to be good enough
so here's where we're going to do first
I'm going to describe the algorithm at a
high level then we're going to do an
example then we're going to look at code
so at a high level we're going to
operate over our list of edges and we're
going to iterate n times where n is the
maximum depth of the graph so on each
iteration in parallel we can look at
each edge independently and in parallel
and if one end of that edge has a depth
D but we haven't visited the other end
of the edge yet the vertex on the other
side then we set that vertex to depth D
plus 1 so the first iteration will set
all the vertices that have depth 1 the
next iteration will set all the vertices
with depth 2 and so on so let's do an
example</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
