first x cubed plus 6y squared we want to
start by finding the degree of each term
so the degree this first one is 3 and
the second term is too since we have
exponents of 3 and 2 respectively 3 is
greater than 2 so this is a third degree
polynomial next 7 minus 3x plus 8x cubed
Y we have degrees of 0 1 and 4 since we
have 3 plus the invisible one on this y
equals 4 4 is definitely the largest of
these three numbers this polynomial is
of degree 4 so we can do the same thing
for the last two polynomials as well one
interesting thing to note is that the
degree of a polynomial is usually
information that comes from just one
term in the expression the term with the
highest degree but in some cases like in
this last example might have more than
one term that's of the same degree so
for example here we have x squared which
is a second degree term and Z squared
which is also a second degree term
having two terms of the same degree
doesn't change what the highest degree
we see here is we just happen to see
that highest degree twice we still
follow the typical rule and say that
this is a polynomial of degree 2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
