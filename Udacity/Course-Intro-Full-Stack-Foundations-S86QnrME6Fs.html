instructor as we explore the foundations
of full stack web development in this
course you'll learn to build your own
data-driven web applications but what
does that actually mean well when I say
web application I'm referring to a web
page or collection of pages that allows
your browser to respond to user input
similar to an offline software
application and by data-driven I mean an
application that can store and retrieve
information from a database to deliver
customized content to the user almost
all of the popular websites you interact
with on a daily basis are data-driven
web applications soon you will create a
similar website of your own in addition
to creating web pages you will also
learn to send data from your server in
other forms like JSON requests so that
the data from your application can be
shared with other machines that process
JSON like a data aggregator or mobile
device your mission in this course is to
help me create a menu app you'll be
building an interactive web application
that presents a user a variety of menu
items they can view create modify and
delete in the first lesson of this
course you will extract data from a
database using Python we will also be
using a tool called an object relational
mapping or ORM to manipulate queries as
objects in Python if you've never heard
of an ORM don't worry you'll be very
familiar with it in just a few minutes
in the second lesson you will build your
first data-driven web application using
only the libraries that come installed
with Python in the third lesson we will
talk about frameworks and create an
application using the lightweight web
framework flask you will understand how
frameworks help developers write code
more efficiently once you complete this
course you will easily be able to
compare and contrast frameworks and
choose one of your own for future
projects finally you'll use what you
learn from lessons one two and three to
iteratively write code until you have a
polished menu application complete with
API endpoints for JSON requests let's
get started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
