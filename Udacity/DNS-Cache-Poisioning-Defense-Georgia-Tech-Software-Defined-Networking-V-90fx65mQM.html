the client sends a syn packet to the
server the server responds with the syn
ACK and the client then returns with an
act the syn ack at which point the
connection is established the problem in
a typical TCP three-way handshake is
that the client can send a sin and cos
the server to allocate a socket buffer
for that TCP connection but then if the
client never returns the client can
force the server to allocate many many
socket buffers simply by sending a lot
of sins and never returning in fact
these could even be from spoofed IP
addresses so in other words the client
has absolutely no accountability and no
obligation to return to send the final
act and yet can cause the server to
allocate resources this is a problem and
the solution to this is called sin
cookies in the TCP syn cookie approach
when the server receives a sin from the
client the server instead of allocating
a socket buffer for the tuple associated
with the connection the server keeps no
state and instead picks an initial
sequence number for the connection
that's a function of the clients IP
address and port and the server's IP
address and port as well as a random
knots to prevent replay attacks an
honest client that returns can then
reply with an acknowledgement with that
sequence number in the packet the server
can check that sequence number simply by
rehashing all of the information that it
already has thereby determining that the
acknowledgement here correspondent to
the previous syn ack that it had sent
the client without requiring the server
to store any state only if this sequence
number of matches the one picked by the
server in the syn ack does the server
actually establish the connection</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
