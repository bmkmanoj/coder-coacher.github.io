switching from a full screen activity to
a dialogue at 600 DP dialogues are often
a good way to maintain some context for
simpler detail screens keeping part of
the previous screen visible and
relieving some of the pressure to fill
up the screen with more information
since an activities theme controls
whether or not it's shown as a dialogue
we can switch between themes using
resource qualifiers here's a quick
example of some code for that we have my
theme which inherits from base theme and
base theme inherits from the standard
theme that app compat or themed up
material or whatever theme you want but
for larger screens we replace the
definition of base theme such that our
inherits from theme that app compat the
dialogue the reason we don't just
replace my theme here is so that we can
put our theme attributes in one place
this kind of clever two-step theme
inheritance really helps minimize code
overlap and another quick note here we
use the smallest width or SW qualifier
instead of just the width or W qualifier
this ensures that the value won't change
when you rotate the screen after all
it'd be a little weird if turning your
phone from portrait to landscape popped
your screen into a dialogue that was an
introduction to some of the standard
things you can vary in your UI to make
better use of space this is by no means
an exhaustive list the key is to work
out when your UI no longer works at a
certain size or on a breaks and to make
changes to adapt it to the available
space let's go to Nick to see some
examples of this in action</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
