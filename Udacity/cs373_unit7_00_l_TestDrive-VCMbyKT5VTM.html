I've been waiting for this moment for
quite a while those of you are still
with us is quite amazing you've done
really really well I've gotten to this
point I want to take you on a tour to
Google but we're building our self
driving car i'm out here behind me is
the google building this is main campus
in mountain view this is where all your
search results come from and this is
where the self-driving car is being
built so here's finally our Google
self-driving car I think you've seen in
the introduction but I just wanted to
remind you how it looks like it has a
spinning laser on the roof that measures
ranges to obstacles obviously more
sophisticated and a little grid kind of
green door example hitting class but the
principle is the same this takes about a
million data points per second and uses
it for map building slam like Andy told
you about slam slam slam and also use it
for localization to understand where the
car is in detail relative to the
previous map there's other stuff here
there's a GPS antenna over here down
here on the wheel it's a simple
sensitise measures how father wheel is
turning we have our entire computer
system and as you see there's mostly
nothing there's a very small interface
to the car itself fuse box a regular PC
and down here is a navigation unit that
contains electronics for the GPS so
let's go on a drive on my display you
can see what the car sees it uses its
range finders to track other vehicles
using probabilistic filters like the
ones we talked about I also see static
obstacles and classifies them and the
map has been built using the slam
techniques that we talked about in the
last class when we will call minute
particle
well common photos are part of the gps
based localization technique we also use
them in part for tracking other vehicles
and following sensor fusion between the
camera data and the radar data and
particle filters the used for quite a
while for localization cross walk ahead
aha but then we moved back to read based
techniques again using very fast
convolution methods for aligning words
to each other the AI is the brains it's
the core so all the methods that we
talked about every single one has a
purpose in this car I know there are
some differences for one the sensor data
is much more involved in the little toy
examples we made up ahead the data is
much richer so it knows about crosswalks
and also were different functions of
Road segments okay we are still in mango
driving and this is the moment watch the
thumb David to it
yoo-hoo
that's it again there's a car just
jumping in front of us you can feel the
braking action we've started stay away
from them now the lane is here again our
car accelerates all by itself and then
we also have in the trunk something
called an inertial measurement system
they composed of things like an
accelerometer that can tell us where
gravity is tell us something about like
accelerations of the car let's only call
gyros that measure how fast we rotate
and all those are integrated using one
big common filter into one big estimate
that tends to be not good enough it
tends to be that the gps based solution
alone is often off by something like
five six feet and five six feet on a
highway means you are halfway over into
the next Lane therefore we do slam for
mapping and you can see maps and they
undergone over here these are actual
real slam apps and then we use grid
based localization to match the
momentary sensor data to those maps and
then we get about 10 centimeter accuracy
and tens in America season is sufficient
to hold a car in a lane which is very
cool even a busy highway like this one
is in most 5% empty when it performs
well and ninety-five percent free if
we're using our highways video
efficiently if you had bumper-to-bumper
fast traffic we could easily get two or
three four times many cars through the
highway as video today in this benefits
to the people around them which is the
car drive safer it drives a bigger
distances it stays in the lane better
than human drivers and that makes it
