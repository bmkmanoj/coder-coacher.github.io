expression we really want to add the
opposite we want to distribute our
subtraction sign to each term in the
numerator which gives us a negative one
now we factor each denominator and try
and find the lowest common denominator
between the two fractions the lowest
common denominator is X minus 1 times X
minus 1 times X plus 1 we know this
since these two denominators share a
common factor of X minus 1 the other
factor for this denominator is X minus
one and the other factor for this
denominator is X plus 1 we multiply each
fraction by the missing factors of the
lowest common denominator for the first
fraction we distribute 6x to the
quantity X plus 1 will get 6x squared
plus 6x for the second fraction will
have negative 1 times the quantity X
minus 1 we really just change these two
signs so we'll have negative x plus 1
now that we have two fractions with
common denominators we can add the
numerators together we just add the like
terms when we add the like terms of 6 X
and negative x together we'll get 6x
squared plus 5x plus 1 now remember we
have a new numerator here and let's see
if we can factor it we won't factors of
positive 6 that's some 25 well yes that
would be 3 and 2 this would be the
factored form if we use factoring by
grouping but notice that this doesn't
help us out none of these factors appear
in our denominator so we can't simplify
anymore our final answer would be 6x
squared plus 5x plus 1 divided by the
factors of this denominator</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
