eager release consistent memory model
and the new memory model is called LRC
or lazy release consistent memory model
let's see the pros and cons of lrc with
respect to vanilla RC or lazy RC with
respect to eager RC so what I'm showing
you here are timelines of processor
actions on three different processes p1
p2 and p3 and this picture is showing
you what happens in the eager version of
the RC model in terms of communication
among the processes so when processor p1
has completed its critical section does
the release operation at the release
point what we're going to do is all the
changes that we made in this example i'm
showing you to make it simple i'm
showing you that in this critical
section i wrote to this variable X so
the changes to X is going to be
communicated to all the processes p2 and
p3 it could be depending on whether it
is an invalidation based protocol or an
update based protocol what we are saying
is we are communicating the coherence
action to all the other processors
that's what these arrows are indicating
now then p 2 acquires the lock and after
it acquires the lock it does its own
critical section again let's say we're
writing to the same variable X and it
releases the lock and at the point of
release once again we broadcast the
changes that we made notice what is
going on p 1 makes modifications
broadcast it to everybody but who really
needs it well only p 2 needs it but
unfortunately the RC memory model is
eager and it says i'm going to tell
everybody that has a copy of x that i
have modified x and so it's going to
sell it to p2 it's going to tell it to
p3 as well p 3 doesn't care because it's
not using that variable yet and p2 cares
and it of course is using that but when
it releases its critical section it's
once again going to do exactly the same
thing that happened over here and that
is it's going to broadcast the chain
it made two shared memory locations to
all the other processes in this case p1
and p2 and then finally p3 does its
acquire and then reads the variable so
all these arrows are showing you the
coherence actions that are inherent in
the completion of shared memory accesses
that are happening in the critical
section of programs now let's move over
to the lazy version in the lazy version
what we are doing is when we release a
lock we are not doing any global
communication we simply release a lock
later on the next process that happens
to acquire that same lock the RC memory
model the first thing it's going to say
is oh you want to get this lock I have
to go and make sure that I complete all
the coherence actions that are
associated with that particular lock in
this case the previous lock holder had
made changes to the variable X so I'm
going to pull it from this guy and then
I can execute my critical section and
then when p3 execute its critical
section is going to pull it from p2 and
complete what it needs to do so the
important thing that you see is that
there is no broadcast anymore it's only
point-to-point communication that's
happening between the processors that
are passing the lock between one to the
other so in other words the number of
arrows that you see our communication
events you can see that there's a lot
more arrows here and forget about the
headers that I introduced but the black
arrows that you see are the errors that
are indicating communications
commensurate with the coherence actions
needed for this set of critical section
actions and correspondingly the black
arrows here are showing the
communication actions for the same set
of critical section actions shown in
both the top and the bottom half of this
particular figure you can see there's a
lot less communication happening with
the lazy model it's also called a pole
model because what we're doing is at the
point of acquisition we are pulling the
coherence actions that need to be
completed over here whereas is this is a
push model in the sense that we are
pushing out the coherence actions to
everybody
at the point of release having
introduced the eager and the lazy RC
models it's time for a quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
