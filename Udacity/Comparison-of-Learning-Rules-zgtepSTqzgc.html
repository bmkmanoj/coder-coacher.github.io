end up being the gradient descent rule
that we just derived says that what we
want to do is move the weights in the
negative direction of the gradient so if
we negate that expression that we had
before and take a little step in that
direction we get exactly this expression
multiplied the input on that weight
times the target - the activation
whereas in the perceptron case what we
were doing is taking that same
activation threshold in it like
determining whether it's positive or
negative putting in a zero or one and
putting that in here that's what Y hat
is so really it's the same thing except
in one case we have done the threshold
and the other case we have not done the
threshold and it with two different
algorithms with two different behaviors
that perceptron has this nice guarantee
of finite convergence which is a really
good thing but that's only in the case
where we have linear separability
whereas the gradient descent rule is
good because you know calculus I guess
that's not really an answer is it it's
the gradient descent rule is good
because it's it's more robust to two
data sets that are not linearly
separable but it's only going to
converge in the limit to a local optimum
all right is that is that the story
there charles far as i'm concerned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
