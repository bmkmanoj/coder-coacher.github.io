we've added a for loop whose index
ranges from zero to the number of steps
we put the number of steps plus 1 as the
argument for range because I will go up
to the number inside minus 1 inside the
loop we've created a variable called
angle which is equal to 2 pi times the
index divided by the number of steps
that are taken in the trajectory now if
we look over this picture you can sort
of see what's happening the moon starts
in this position then after one time
step is moved to this position and so on
and so forth the number of segments will
equal the number of steps and the number
of lines will equal the number of steps
plus one after this we use the array X
to define the horizontal and vertical
positions of the moon at any given time
step it's at this point that we have to
remember our trigonometric functions
sine and cosine in this first line right
here we're defining the horizontal
position of X for the ice time step and
the second line which uses sign is
what's going to show us the vertical
position this is one of those cases
we're being able to see a right triangle
in this picture is very helpful looking
at our picture this horizontal line
right here that extends from the earth
out to the moon's orbit is the zero
radian or zero degree line we're
measuring all of the angles that the
moon is going to be marked at up from
this line that means that it at any
given moment we can draw a line from the
moon down to this horizontal line to
create a right triangle which will then
allow us to use sine and cosine in
conjunction with this angle to determine
the moon's vertical and horizontal
distance from the earth coming back to
our code after all this is filled in if
we run the program we end up with a
perfect circle just like we were hoping
to get for the trajectory of the moon
around the earth in this ideal
simulation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
