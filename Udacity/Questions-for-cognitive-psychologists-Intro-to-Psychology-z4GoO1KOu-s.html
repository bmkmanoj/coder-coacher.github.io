psychologists would ask is can we really
multitask because that has to do with
focus and attention and that's a
cognitive or mental activity another
question that a cognitive psychologist
might ask among these is about the dog
learning to salivate when the door opens
because what's going on here is the dog
is learning to associate the door
opening with the food and that's a
learning process and that's also the
domain for cognitive psychologists
what's not the domain for cognitive
psychologists is how attachment changes
over our lives that's more the question
for a developmental psychologist because
it has to do with change over time
another question that would not be one
for cognitive psychology would be mood
and dopamine that's the brain and how
neurotransmitters affect our behavior
that would be the question for
behavioral neuroscience the shooter and
whether he's having a psychotic episode
and how company is to stand trial is
more for a forensic psychologist because
that has to do with his mental state and
the legal question of competence</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
