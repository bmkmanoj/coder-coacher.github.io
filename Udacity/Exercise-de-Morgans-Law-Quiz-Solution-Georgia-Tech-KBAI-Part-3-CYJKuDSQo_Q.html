and B we just take the value of a and B
and flip it a and B is only true when
both are true so when both are true this
becomes false and any other time this
becomes true not a or not be becomes
true whenever either of them are false
because the false value of you flipped
by that negation and that's all it'll
matter because this is an or so we see a
is false here in here B is felt here so
those are all true when they're both
true this becomes false because both
those truth values are flipped that's
good David so the demons law is saying
that when we try to distribute the
negation over the predicates inside the
parenthesis that are connected with a
conjunction that the conjunction becomes
a disjunction between the negations of
the predicates the same would have been
true if we had a disjunction here when
we distribute the negation it would have
become a conjunction here David before
we go ahead further let's remember why
we are trying to do all of this so
recall we said in the beginning of the
lesson that a logical agent will have a
knowledge base and then formal rules of
inference that will apply on these
sentences of knowledge base the
knowledge base itself may be coming from
many places some sentences the knowledge
base maybe bootstrapped into the logical
agent other sentences may be coming from
perception now when we are trying to
apply these rules of inferences to the
sentences the knowledge base it is
sometimes very useful to rewrite these
sentences in different forms and that's
what we are trying to do these
properties will allow us to rewrite the
sentences in such a way that we can in
fact apply the rules of inferences that
we will see in a minute</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
