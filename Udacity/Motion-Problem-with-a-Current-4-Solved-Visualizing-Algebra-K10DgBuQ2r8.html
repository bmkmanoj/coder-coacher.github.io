hour excellent problem solving if you
found that answer to solve this equation
we'll start by multiplying through by
the lowest common denominator the LCD in
this case is 12 minus x x 12 plus X
times 15 the product of all three of the
denominators so we'll multiply each of
these terms by the LCD will know the
factors of 12 minus X simplify in the
first fraction 12 plus X simplifies in
the second fraction and 15 simplifies in
our last fraction each of these reduces
to 1 this leaves us with this equation
we know six times 15 equals 90 so we'll
change these and then we know this is a
difference of square pattern a minus B
times a plus B so this will equal a
squared minus B squared 12 squared is
144 well however minus sign in between
the terms and x squared is x squared
next we'll distribute 92 each of these
terms will distribute 90 here and we'll
distribute positive 16 here we get this
equation and then we want to combine the
like terms on the left we know positive
90 x and negative 90 x some 20 and 10 80
plus 1080 sums to 2160 and the right
hand side of our equation remains the
same now that we have this equation we
want to try and solve for x since i only
have an x squared term and no other x
terms I want to move this constant to
the left hand side and then divide
through by negative 16 so we can take
the square root of both sides we
subtract 2304 from both sides to get
negative 144 equals negative 16x squared
then we divide both sides by negative 16
to get 9 is equal to x squared we take
the square root of both sides so X can
equal positive 3 or negative 3 since X
is the speed of the current we know that
we need the positive value X must equal
3 miles per hour</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
