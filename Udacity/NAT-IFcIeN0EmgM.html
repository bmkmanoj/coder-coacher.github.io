there aren't enough addresses to go
around there are actually fewer ipv4
addresses than there are people in the
world and some of us use way more than
one address I mean every sensible person
carries five computers with them at all
times right the major work around has
been for isps to assign only one address
to each household office or other
customer if you had a one computer house
whole to be obvious how this would work
one host one IP address but as people
have lots of different computers and
devices in their house today they all
have to hide behind this one IP address
and from the outside world have to look
just like a single machine with a single
address well how does this work let's
take the example of a home network maybe
they've got a desktop computer and a
laptop and a smart TV and some phones
and all of these talk to the internet
through a router which acts as their
default gateway the router connects to
their ISP and gets a single real public
IP address and then it assigns private
addresses to all of these devices
private IP addresses come off of one of
three reserved IP address net blocks the
most common private IP address is found
on home routers are in the network 192
at 168 / 24 with a default gateway of
192 168 01 this is only one of very many
private IP address possibilities if you
ever need to look these up their
specified in an Internet standard called
RFC 1918 private IP addresses are used
with a system called NAT or network
address translation the way that it
works is that whenever traffic goes
between the private network behind the
router and the public internet the
router has to rewrite or translate to
the network addresses on it the router
maintains a map of which inside
addresses and ports are connected to
what public internet addresses and ports
now most likely your own home or office
network is using that but Matt is really
a workaround not a solution to address
shortage it creates some pretty serious
problems it makes it much harder
sometimes impossible for end-users to
run servers that other people can access
that makes it hard to write and debug
network applications that are going to
run on end-user machines the router has
to keep track of all the connections
going through it and because your
computer doesn't know it's a real public
address applications on it can't easily
say things like forward all my internet
phone calls to this address without
hacky extra protocol arrangements and
more moving parts makes them more
error-prone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
