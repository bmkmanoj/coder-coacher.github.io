engineering has three goals one is
predictability in other words it should
be possible to predict how traffic flows
will change in response to changes in
the network configuration another goal
is to limit the influence of neighboring
domains in particular we'd like to use
BGP policies and changes to those
policies that limit how neighboring a
esas might change their behavior in
response to changes to the BGP
configuration that we make in our own
network and finally we'd like to reduce
the overhead of routing changes by
achieving our traffic engineering goals
with changes to as few IP prefixes as
possible to understand the factors that
can confound predictability let's look
at how the inter domain routing choices
of a particular autonomous system can
wreak havoc on predictability but
suppose that a downstream neighbor is
trying to reach the autonomous system at
the top of this figure the a s here
might wish to relieve congestion on a
particular peering link to do so this a
s might now send traffic to their
destination out a different set of
autonomous systems but once this a s
makes that change note that it's
choosing a longer a s path now taking a
path of three hops rather than two in
response the downstream neighbor might
decide not to send its traffic for that
destination through this autonomous
system at all thus affecting the traffic
matrix that this ASCS so all the work
that went in to optimizing traffic load
balance for the say s is for naught
because the change that it made
effectively changed the offer traffic
loads and hence the traffic matrix one
way to avoid this type of problem and
achieve predictable traffic flow changes
is to avoid making changes like this
that are globally visible in particular
note that this change caused a change in
the a s path length of the advertisement
to this particular destination from two
to three thus other neighbors such as
the downstream neighbor here
might decide to use an alternate path as
a result of that globally visible
routing change by avoiding these types
of globally visible changes we can
achieve predictability another way to
achieve effective interdomain traffic
engineering is to limit the influence of
neighbors for example an autonomous
system might try to make a path look
longer with a s path prepending if we
consider treating paths that have almost
the same a s path length as a common
group we can achieve additional
flexibility additionally if we enforce a
constraint that our neighbors should
advertise consistent BGP route
advertisements over multiple peering
links should multiple peering links
exist that gives us additional
flexibility to send traffic over
different egress points to the same
autonomous system enforcing consistent
advertisements turns out to be difficult
in practice but it is doable to reduce
the overhead of routing changes we can
group related prefixes rather than
exploring all combinations of prefixes
to move a particular volume of traffic
we can identify routing choices that
group routes that have the same a s
paths and we can move groups of prefixes
according to these groups of prefixes
that share an AS path this allows us to
move groups of prefixes by making tweaks
to local preference on regular
expressions on a s path we can also
focus on the small fraction of prefixes
that carry the majority of traffic 10%
of origin a esas are responsible for
about eighty-two percent of outbound
traffic therefore we can achieve
significant gains in rebalancing traffic
in the network by focusing on the heavy
hitters in summary to achieve
predictability we affect changes that
are not globally visible to limit the
influence of neighbors we enforce
consistent advertisements and limit the
influence of a s path length and to
reduce the overhead of routing changes
we group prefixes according to those
that have common a s paths and move
traffic in terms of groups of prefixes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
