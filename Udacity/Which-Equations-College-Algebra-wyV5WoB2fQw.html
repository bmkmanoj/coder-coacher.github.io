cleaning solution issue we learned about
the use and the importance of points of
intersection on graphs when two lines
cross one another the coordinates of the
point where that happens give us values
of variables that satisfy the equations
of all the lines that pass through that
point so we are able to use this
knowledge to solve for different
variables we could just take the
equations corresponding to either line
figure out how to set one side of one
equation equal to one side of the other
equation and then solve for the unknown
variable that would give us a new
coordinate of that point of intersection
but what if instead we didn't have a
graph what if we just had an equation
and not just any equation but an
equation with one variable something
like 3x plus 4 equals 19 now that we
know we can find values for variables
through finding points of intersection
of lines can you think of two lines we
could graph whose point of intersection
would help us solve this equation please
write a two variable equation in each of
these boxes that we could graph on the
same coordinate plane to help us work
with this equation this definitely
requires a little bit of outside-the-box
thinking so just give it a try</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
