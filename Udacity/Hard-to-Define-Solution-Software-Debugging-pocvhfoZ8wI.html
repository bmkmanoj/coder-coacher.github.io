generally anything you can measure can
also be turned into post condition and
if it's some physical condition then
typically very easy the audio level must
not exceed 80 decibels well assuming you
have a way to measure the audio level
which any decent audio software should
have yep this is easy to turn into a
post condition turn this into a post
condition and you will save millions and
millions of ears from damage next thing
the animated cat should walk like a real
cat ahh real cat if there ever is a
specification of what makes a cat a real
cat I would very very be delighted to
see that i'm pretty sure cats know
precisely what to do and what not to do
for everybody else they remain a mystery
under specific atmospheric conditions
the sunset simulation shall produce a
green flash lo and behold that's what a
page D student at my department did he
was specializing in computer graphics
and his PhD thesis was perfect sunset
simulations and indeed in reality under
specific conditions you can have a grief
flash during a sunset for just a second
I think this has been witnessed by only
a few hundred people and only banned on
film twice so far and well having green
or some amount of green in an image it's
actually pretty easy to check so I'm
pretty sure he also had a post condition
that would then show that he was
successful and finally response time
shall be below 10 milliseconds that
straightforward time is something that's
easy to measure this can also become a
simple post condition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
