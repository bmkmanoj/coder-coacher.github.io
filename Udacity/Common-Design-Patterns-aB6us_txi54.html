managers and looked at how you'd use
various layouts together to create some
example screens as you probably notice
we started using these circles and
buttons and toolbars let's start diving
a little deeper into what some of those
elements were and why they keep
appearing all over the place now each
application is an individual snowflake
with different content and goals just
because they're unique though doesn't
mean that we should force users to learn
new conventions to operate them by
following some established patterns of
the platform you can accelerate your
users understanding of the app making it
feel intuitive imagine if every model of
car had a different layout of the pedals
the steering wheel and the levers while
you might be able to learn one model
you'd have a hard time moving to another
your UI is exactly the same by following
some conventions users can quickly get
in and drive your app here are some of
the most prevalent patterns used on
Android to organize your interface and
navigate around it a toolbar is a
horizontal bar which provides a standard
way to present titles and actions in
your layout it's made up of a navigation
area on the left a title area and a menu
of actions it's a very flexible widget
and each of these functions is optional
a nice feature is that the toolbar can
show actions either directly within the
toolbar or they can be collapsed under a
submenu known as an overflow if there
isn't enough room and it will base its
decision on whether there's enough room
to show everything tapping the overflow
item itself yields this overflow menu of
additional object actions you can take
the toolbar itself is a view group so
you can add children to it for example I
could add a spinner control as a child
view to provide some kind of
navigational control now toolbars are
used extensively in Android so they're
very recognizable to your users and a
common place to look for actions or
present them they generally use a
standard height which varies by a screen
size and can be queried using the action
bar size fie match be they're also a
great place to embed your brand's color
next the app bar the app bar is just a
special case of the toolbar where it's
placed at the very top of the screen as
such the title field often provides a
screen type
and the navigation icon provides access
to screen level navigation options the
app power often uses a extended height
to provide more space for branding or to
contain a hero image in this case it's
usually multiples of the standard height
next up tabs tabs let you organize and
navigate to different sections within
your screen or app on Android tabs
always appear at the top of the screen
and you can switch between them using a
horizontal swipe gesture generally they
sit on the same surface as your app bar
if you're using one now tabs can be a
great way to provide the main way of
navigating about your app or providing
sub navigation if you're using a
different top-level navigation construct
such as a navigation drawer now a
navigation drawer is a panel that slides
in from the left of the screen and it
contains the top-level navigation
options to different parts of your
application the drawer itself can be
divided into sections and frequently
provides access to account information
here in this top area now the drawer is
closely associated with the so called
hamburger icon this free line icon in
the toolbar either pressing this or
dragging from the left edge of your
device
will open the drawer the drawer can work
well if you have a number of different
sections that you want to provide quick
navigation to without taking up
persistent space on every screen however
if you don't need this say if you only
have a few sections to navigate between
then a different pattern like tabs might
be more relevant as they're going to be
more obvious to your users it's also
important to use restraint and
thoughtfully select items to put in the
navigation drawer it shouldn't become a
dumping ground for all the things
Android also has pretty common patterns
around scrolling and paging users are
typically comfortable with scrolling
vertically to see more information on
the screen horizontal scrolling is less
common especially with text content as
it can be frustrating to read more
common is to use a horizontal gesture to
page through content so each gesture
takes you to one discrete page back or
forward so for example if you're reading
emails or news stories then it's a very
useful pattern horizontal paging is
especially common for detailsview
launched from a list where you have a
mental model of what the next page of
items might be
oh that as we just covered in the tab
section horizontal swipes should change
pages between tabs so therefore it's
kind of incompatible to use both tabs
and horizontally page content another
extremely common pattern on Android is
lists to detail where you would show a
list of individual items and clicking on
one would take you to a subsequent
detail screen you've probably use this a
hundred times such as viewing your
context or reading new stories for
example a variation on this pattern is
to show both the list and detail
sections on the same screen on larger
devices so here these two screens would
be separate on a small device and
brought together on a larger device
showing just a list on a large screen
can look awkward and leave a lot of
empty space
additionally showing both items at once
can allow you to retain more context
about the activity you're performing and
prevents what we call pogo-sticking
where the user is forced to go into a
details and back up and into a details
and backup well go into much more detail
on other patterns for larger screens in
the lesson 5 now it's absolutely ok to
deviate from these patterns if and when
it makes sense for your specific use
case these are patterns after all not
strict rules but make sure you're doing
so for good reasons as you'll be asking
your users to learn a bespoke
interaction the phrase I like to use
here is deviate with purpose picking an
application structure and navigation
scheme depends on the content in your
application a good exercise is to sketch
out an entity relationship diagram this
shows the objects in your application
and how they relate to each other once
you understand this you can pick an
application structure to match</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
