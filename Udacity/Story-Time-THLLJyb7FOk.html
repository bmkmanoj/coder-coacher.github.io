creative endeavor it takes a lot of
effort and it's hard to know exactly
when you're finished you may have heard
of the 8020 rule for software
development that eighty percent of the
effort goes to completing the last
twenty percent of the features that's
true for games too to an extent but
there's another factor good games have
more than just lots of features they
also need good gameplay while feature
creep blows a lot of development
schedules with games it's less a matter
of adding features and more about making
sure the features are tuned so the game
is actually fun in a way it's like
painting or writing you're always
tempted to tweak some character stat or
rearrange those two sentences does this
change make things clear do I need to
rethink how I present this piece games
aren't like other software they're not
necessarily function driven right
they're meant to entertain and engage
and these are fundamentally subjective
goals so you may find yourself near the
end of a game project making less and
less progress toward the finish line
don't be surprised and don't let it
discourage you you're doing what every
creative person on the planet does which
is second-guess yourself and tweak and
edit and revisit and change and just
like those creative people you're going
to eventually decide you're satisfied
with the final product and after all
that work there's nothing quite like the
feeling of actually releasing your game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
