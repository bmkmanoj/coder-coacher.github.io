important parallel primitives scan let
me give you a very short example of a
scan operation the input to scan is a
list of numbers such as 1 2 3 4 and an
operation such as ad and the output is
the running sum of those numbers so each
output is the sum of all the numbers in
the input up to that given point 6 is
the sum of 1 2 and 3 now scan is
important because it allows us to
address a set of problems that seem
difficult to paralyse at first glance it
might seem difficult to compute this
output from this input in parallel
because each element in the output
depends on the previous element so first
we compute this add 2 and get 3 at 3 and
get 6 add 4 and get 10 that doesn't seem
like a very parallel operation but this
style of operation turns out to be
incredibly useful it's also interesting
because scan is just not a very useful
operation in the serial world it's
really only useful when you're doing
parallel computation but once you know
it and use it you'll wonder what you
ever did without it now there's lots of
uses for scan with compaction and
allocation being two of the most popular
later in this lecture we'll discuss
histogram which uses scan and our
research group is used scan for
quicksort for sparse matrix computation
and for data compression among others
it's a very useful parallel primitive
but for this part of the lecture I'm
only going to concentrate on what scan
does and how it works rather than how
it's useful we'll learn about some more
general scan applications in the next
unit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
