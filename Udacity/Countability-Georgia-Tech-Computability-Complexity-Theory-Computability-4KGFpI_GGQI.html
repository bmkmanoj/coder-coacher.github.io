alphabet strings and languages the major
goal of this lesson is to convince you
that some functions are not computable
central to our argument will be the
difference between countably infinite
sets and uncountable infinite sets if
you aren't familiar with this
distinction already you may be thinking
to yourself ah infinities are strange
enough idea by itself now I have to deal
with two of them
well it isn't as bad as all of that
accountably infinite set is one that you
can enumerate that is you can say this
is the first element this is the second
element and so forth and this is the
really important part eventually give a
number to every element in the set for
some sets an enumeration is
straightforward take the even numbers we
can say that 2 is the first one 4 is the
second 6 the third and so forth for some
sets like the rationals you have to be a
little bit clever to find an enumeration
we'll see the trick for enumerate them
in a little bit and for some sets like
the real numbers it doesn't matter how
clever you are there simply is no
enumeration these are the uncountable
sets and what follows will argue that
the set of all strings over an alphabet
is countable and give a few other
results that will be useful for thinking
about count ability in general then
we'll show that the set of languages is
uncountable let's make this notion of
countable and uncountable sets precise
with a formal definition we say that a
set is countable if it is finite or if
there's a one-to-one correspondence with
the natural numbers a one-to-one
correspondence by the way is a function
that is one-to-one meaning that no two
elements of the domain get mapped to the
same element of the range and also onto
meaning that every element of the range
is mapped to by an element of the domain
for example here is a one-to-one
correspondence between the integers 1
through 6 and the set of permutations of
3 elements now in general the existence
of a one-to-one correspondence implies
that the two sets have the same size
that is the same number of elements and
this actually holds even for infinite
sets that is why we say that there are
many even natural numbers as there are
natural numbers because it's easy to
establish a one-to-one correspondence
between the two sets F of n is equal to
2n for example for our purposes we are
most interested in showing that for any
finite alphabet the set of strings over
that alphabet is countable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
