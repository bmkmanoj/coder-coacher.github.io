for structuring operating system
services above the colonel using the
client-server paradigm then it is
important to reduce this overhead now
let's see how we can reduce the
overheads and make our PC cheap enough
that you want to use it in building
client server systems how do we remove
these overheads the trick is to optimize
the common case now what is the common
case well the common case is the actual
calls that are being made by the client
of the server we expect that those calls
are going to be made several times
during the lifetime of the server and
the client and so that's the key thing
that you want to make sure that during
the actual calls the copying overhead
that I talked about and the locality of
the arguments and the results in terms
of stuff being in the caches that are
accessible to the client in the server
that's the key that's the common case
that's what we want to make as efficient
as possible now setting up the
relationship between the client and the
server itself on the very first call by
the client that needs to be done exactly
once and that process is what is called
binding binding the client to the server
that is done once the first call is when
that binding happens and that's done
once now since the setup or the binding
is done only once it's a one-time cost
it's okay if it is more expensive than
the actual calls so the binding we can
afford to make it more time consuming
it's okay to do that and these ideas are
very fit sound very familiar to you from
exokernel that we've discussed before
that we want to make the one-time costs
not focus on the cost of setting up
which is a one-time cost but focus on
that is the recurring cost which is the
actual calls that are being made so now
let's discuss in more detail halt this
binding works the server has an entry
point procedure called foo that it wants
to make it available for clients to call
and in order to make it available for
everybody it publishes this entry point
procedure in a name server and lets the
colonel know
that there is an entry point procedure
called food that's available for it and
the name server is a vehicle by which
anyone in the system can find out it's
sort of like the yellow pages right so
you want to look up somebody's name or
phone number you look it up in the
yellow pages so similarly the name
services the same purpose that if I want
to know what services are offered as a
client if I want to know what services
are offered by a particular server I can
find out from the name server what are
the entry point services available from
itself or is there an entry point
service that's available in the server
registers the name server and lets the
colonel know that it has this particular
entry point and at this point the server
is basically waiting for buying requests
to come from the colonel now the client
looks up the name server and finds that
s as an entry point called foo so this
is an entry point that's available for
this client to make a call on the server
so the client issues this call s dot foo
meaning that it wants to execute this
procedure foo on the server s and so
that's the RPC call the first time c is
making and this of course results in a
trap into the kernel the colonel doesn't
know whether the server is willing to
accept calls from the client or not and
therefore what it has to do is it has to
check with the server whether there's a
legitimate bona fide e client that can
make calls on this entry point procedure
foo and so it the colonel basically
makes an up call in to the server saying
that hey you know what there is this
client that wants to make set with this
identity wants to make a call on your
entry point procedure foo and that's the
up call that goes into the server the
server if it recognizes that this client
is a bona fide e client that can make
this call it grants permission via the
kernel that this client can make this
call on its entry point procedure foo so
once this validation has been done what
the colonel does is to set up a
descriptor called the procedure
descriptor and this procedure
descriptors a data structure that is in
the kernel and it is for this petite
killer entry point procedure foo and as
part of granting access to the client to
make this call into its entry point
procedure foo what the server is going
to do is tell the colonel that these are
the characteristics of this particular
entry point procedure in particular it's
going to say this is the entry point
address where you have to call me if
there is a call this is the address of
the entry point procedure in my address
space where code exists for this
particular procedure foo and this is
indicating the size of an argument stack
now I'm going to talk to you a little
bit more about this in a minute and this
argument stack is going to be the
communication area between the client
and the server and this entry in the
procedure descriptor is just saying what
is the size of this argument stack so
this communication vehicle that is going
to be established between the client of
the server is going to be dependent on
at the formal parameters that are being
passed between the client of the server
and the results that are being passed
from the server back to the client based
on that the server is going to indicate
to the kernel that you know what the
communication area that I want is this
size so that's the size of this a stack
I'm going to talk to you more about that
in a minute and it is also going to say
how many simultaneous calls s is willing
to accept for this particular procedure
foo and the purpose of this is if this
is a multiprocessor and there are
multiple cores or multiple processes
available then it may be possible for s
to form out multiple threats to execute
simultaneous calls that are coming in
from multiple clients distributed in the
system and so they're saying how many
concurrent calls the server is willing
to accept on behalf of this particular
procedure fool so this procedure
descriptor is specific to this procedure
foo and it is saying where is the entry
point in the server's domain for this
particular procedure what is the size of
the communication buffer that is needed
to be established by the kernel for
communication between the client and the
server
and the third thing is how many
simultaneous calls the server is willing
to accept for this particular procedure
