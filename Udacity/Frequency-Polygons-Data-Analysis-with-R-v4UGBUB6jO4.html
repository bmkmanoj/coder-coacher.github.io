variables distribution using histograms
and how to check our hunches with
visualizations and numerical summaries
but there's another type of plot that
lets us compare distributions and it's
called the frequency polygon frequency
polygons are similar to histograms but
they draw a curve connecting the counts
in a histogram so this allows us to see
the shape and the peaks of our
distribution in more detail you might
remember from before that we were
looking at Frank out using this code
this code gave us a histogram of our
users friend counts and then we added a
facet wrap and broke it out by gender
remember we were trying to answer the
question who on average has more friends
men are women we said we couldn't tell
based on this histogram so we ran some
numerical summaries instead and instead
of having these two histograms
side-by-side we can actually use a
frequency polygon and overlay these
histograms together here's how we can
create that frequency polygon I'll copy
and paste the same code except I need to
make an addition by default couplets
gonna create a histogram when I pass it
just one single variable so I need to
tell it to create a frequency polygon
instead I can use the Geo Maranda to do
that here I'll pass it frequency polygon
so that way we create a different type
of plot and I won't need this facet wrap
by gender anymore to get the
distributions of each gender on the plot
I'm gonna pass the parameter color to
cue plot and set it equal to gender so
here's my color parameter and now I'm
gonna pass it gender when I run this
code I get one plot with two frequency
polygons one for males and one for
females and notice how gender is being
assigned a color so color is indicating
which frequency polygon I'm on and this
is what the frequency polygon is really
good for we can compare two or more
distributions at once but again this
plot doesn't really answer our question
who has more friends on average men or
women let's change the y-axis to show
proportions instead of raw counts this
is going to involve some funky syntax so
I want to explain it to change this
count variable we're going to pass in Y
to our Q plot function I'm gonna assign
the parameter Y this expression this
allows me to get proportions instead of
the actual raw counts on the y axis and
I'm just going to move this around
that way my code looks a little bit
cleaner and finally let me change the
labels to more accurately explain the
plot all right it looks like I have
everything let's run this code and see
the differences zooming in on the plot
we can see that we've changed the y-axis
scale and we have our labels appearing
here in here and while it may appear
that males have higher friend counts on
average than women we can see that many
males are a high percentage of them have
low friend counts it's probably in this
tail region of the graph where females
overtake males I encourage you to play
around with this yourself in our studio
to see where women overtake men in this
side of the x-axis try using limits or
try using breaks to explore more we've
learned some new syntax here so let's
see if you can put it into practice your
task is to determine which gender
creates more likes on the world wide web
to answer that question I want you to
create a frequency polygon and explore
it in many different ways
remember that the first plot you make
doesn't need to be final I want you to
create a couple of plots and make
adjustments to the limits and the breaks
on the x-axis until you're satisfied</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
