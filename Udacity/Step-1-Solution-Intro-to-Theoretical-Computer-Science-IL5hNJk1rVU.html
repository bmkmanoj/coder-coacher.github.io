one is that we can use non determinism
to guess a shortest tour it's not
totally obvious how to do that because
the if-better function always can only
do two distinctions so you have to find
a clever way to use that function to
guess how to construct a shortest tour
but it's possible in the way that I
showed you here then once the shortest
tour has been guests checking if the
length is shorter than D and as you'll
remember D was the maximum length that
we allow for it because we're having
shortest tour as a decision problem once
the shortest tour has been guests it's
easy to check if the length of that tour
is smaller than D so by easy I mean it's
possible in polynomial time so this one
here is also correct non determinism can
be used to guess which vertices to put
in the tour is obviously doesn't make
sense because all vertices are part of
the tour it's the order of the vertices
that matters for solving shortest tour
and then the final one of course that
was easy to see that it's not really a
viable answer but I wanted to point out
to you that even though it might
sometimes be obvious you should always
make sure to explicitly show that the
problem is in NP and we'll actually
later in this course come across some
problems where you might initially think
that they are an LP but actually they're
much harder than problems that are n NP
so now we have completed the first step
we know that shortest tour is in NP and
now can some part of finding a
polynomial time reduction from an
np-complete problem to show that
shortest tour is np-complete</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
