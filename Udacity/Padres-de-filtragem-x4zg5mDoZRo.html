in common they don't change the actual
records of our data so by that I mean if
we have some long list of data with lots
and lots of records 1 2 3 so on a
filtering pattern we'll go through the
entire data set and just decide which
data to keep and which to throw away and
so if this giant list is the input this
smaller list this subset of the original
data would be the output and there's a
lot of ways filtering can happen we can
have a simple filter which is basically
just a function that returns keep or
throw away for each of these records and
for the records that get kept well they
wind up in the output there's a bloom
filter which we're actually not going to
talk much about but it's worth knowing
about because this is a much more
efficient probabilistic filter that
comes with some trade-offs and you
should check out the instructor notes if
you want to read more we also have
things like sampling which is just a way
to make a smaller data set from a large
data set by pulling out some sample
maybe the highest values of a particular
field if we want to pull out a
representative sample one that we think
matches the characteristics of the
original data we can use random sampling
and finally we can use this idea of
filtering to find the I don't know top
10 of something and that's an exercise
we're actually going to do later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
