lectures a good way is to kind of watch
them and use the Udacity discussion
forums to interact with other people
watching these lectures something that's
better is these lectures are free and
they don't really require any books or
text but there are books or text and
then I would feel a little guilty not
telling you that Alexander osterwalder
business model generation book is kind
of the standard for understanding the
business model canvas and the startup
owner's manual written by yours truly
and my co-author Bob Dorf is kind of the
standard for customer development but
let me emphasize again these are not
required and you can understand the
lectures just fine without them but they
certainly help explain a lot of the
detail in the 617 pages because it's
almost an encyclopedia for startups
enough of the ad that's the last time
i'll mention buying the dexter books so
the best way to watch these lectures is
instead of just watching them to do
everything above and also form a
start-up team and get outside of the
building in between watching the
lectures and so you're actually watching
the lectures as a guide for what you're
supposed to be doing week to week and
one of the reasons we kind of suggests
that you instead of just watching the
lectures actually get out of the
building and do it either by yourself or
with your team is startups are not about
lectures an entrepreneurship is not
about your grades and this class is
about the work you do outside the
building after you watch the lectures
not how much the lectures you watch
entrepreneurship is experiential it's
hands-on and its immediate and intense
feedback let me show you several
examples of what it looks like when you
come back from your customer discovery
efforts and have instructors critiquing
your work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
