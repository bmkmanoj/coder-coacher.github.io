program using the network but it's a lot
simpler than the way that a standard web
browser and server use the network
browsers and servers don't just handle a
single request or a few requests one
after the other they also work on
several requests at the same time when
your browser loads a web page from a
server it usually has to load a lot of
different files the HTML itself plus
images scripts CSS and other data the
more that it can do this in parallel the
faster it can render that page onto your
screen or imagine that you're in charge
of the server that's sending this video
to your browser you're probably not the
only person watching it right now you
might be near the end of the video while
someone else is just starting to watch
it so the data that the server is
sending to you isn't in sync with what
it's sending to that other person's
browser and there are a lot of different
ways that programs can handle multiple
connections at once one of the most
basic ones is what early web servers did
and what many programs such as sshd
still do whenever a new connection comes
in the server process Forks it asks the
operating system to split it in two like
a cell dividing a different model that
many more recent servers use is to
create a pool of processes or threads
each of which can handle one connection
at a time and this is faster than
starting new processes but it does have
the downside that there's a limit to how
many requests can be handled at once
before things start to slow down and
finally a third model is to have a
single process that quickly switches
between handling requests as they become
available there are a few different
facilities and operating systems for
doing this efficiently such as the e
poll function in Linux but before your
server can handle a request the client
has to know how to get in touch with
your server up ahead we'll take a look
at DNS the directory system for internet
hosts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
