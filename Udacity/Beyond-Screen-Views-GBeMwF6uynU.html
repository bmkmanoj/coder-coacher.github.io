of data not just screen views I'll
quickly show you the kinds of data you
can get and then you'll try it out for
yourself you can add code to your app to
find out what your users are doing by
sending data to analytics to track
events like when a button is clicked or
if you're building a game say you could
send an event when a user unlocks a new
level here's an example of the event
screen in the analytics dashboard to see
the category of the event and you see
the actions you can find out if your
users are doing what you hope they'll do
by setting goals for example you might
set a goal for the users to click the
Buy Now button or click on an ad or each
a certain page so here you see that one
of the goals is for the users to rate
the app so you can track how users
browse and buy if your app lets users
view products and buy them you can track
how the customers progress through the
shopping flow
you can see which products get purchased
in the product performance page and you
can track the steps throughout the
purchase and checkout process to track
the way users view and buy things your
app needs to have the structure and code
in place for users to browse products
add them to the cart checkout and then
to get the analytics data you need to
add code to send hit to analytics at
each stage of the process you can also
track how long it takes for things to
happen in your app you need to write the
code to time the task that needs to be
timed and then you add the code to send
a hit to analytics to report the timing
data and you see the timing info in the
app speed page in the behavior section
in the dashboard you can track when
things go wrong you can send data to
analytics when your app throws an
exception or in the hopefully unlikely
event has a crashed so hearing see I've
got a couple different exceptions you
can also track how users download your
app in this course we're not going to
put our app on the Play Store so I'll
leave you to explore how to track down
those sources in your own time with an
app that you've published to the Play
Store so that was around up the kinds of
things you can track with analytics now
let's go do some tracking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
