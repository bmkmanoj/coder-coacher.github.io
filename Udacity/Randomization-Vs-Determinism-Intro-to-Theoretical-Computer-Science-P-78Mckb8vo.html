whether randomization is actually
helpful because with considerable
analysis many randomized algorithms can
actually be turned into deterministic
algorithms by using a process called D
randomization and D randomization
usually keeps fundamental properties
such as polynomial running time or the
base of the exponent randomized
algorithms therefore might be a bit
faster but it's unclear whether this is
due to luck if you will or lack of
thinking so if you were to pit these two
against each other randomization versus
determinism it's not really clear who
would win or if it's a draw so to
conclude our exploration of
randomization what might be some reasons
that randomization is actually at least
a bit more powerful than determinism is
it that randomized algorithms are in
some way harder to trick into a
worst-case behavior as compared to
determinism and after all we're
analyzing all of our algorithms using
worst-case analysis is it that
randomized algorithm can usually be
easier to analyze than deterministic
algorithms or is it that randomized
algorithms actually explore solutions
that they're deterministic counterparts
