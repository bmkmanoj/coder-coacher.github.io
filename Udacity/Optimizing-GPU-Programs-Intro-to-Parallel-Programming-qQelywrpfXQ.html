optimizing GPU programs now the whole
reason we want to use a parallel
platform like the GPU is to solve
problems faster and in turn the reason
we might want to solve problems faster
could be simply because we want to solve
a problem faster or more often it's
because we want to solve bigger problems
or solve more problems so the good news
is that it's often the case that the
first initial port of a problem gets a
speed-up assuming that you've got a
parallel problem to begin with and in my
experience this is this is actually when
a lot of GPU programmers get hooked you
know over the weekend they go home and
out of curiosity they try porting some
piece of their existing CPU code to the
GPU and they get a nice speed-up of 5
x-ray techs speed-up and that's that's
what sort of gets them hooked and makes
them realize that they could put some
more effort into this and get a bigger
speed-up so if you have a naturally
parallel problem it's often the case
that that first initial CUDA port will
will get you a good speed-up and that's
cool but you know by definition GPU
programmers care about performance
that's why they're using the GPU that
means they often want to spend
additional inferred to maximize the
speed-up beyond that first initial try
so in this unit we're going to talk
about how to optimize GPU programs so
cast your mind back to unit 2 when we
talked for a little bit about has some
basic principles of efficient GPU
programming so check which of these
principles accurately correspond to
things we talked about in unit 2 about
efficient GPU programming do we want to
decrease arithmetic intensity do we want
to decrease the time spent on memory
operations per thread do we want to
coalesce global memory accesses do we
want to do fewer memory operations per
thread we want to avoid thread
divergence do we want to move all data
to shared memory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
