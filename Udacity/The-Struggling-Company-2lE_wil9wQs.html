threads twisted threads ships cotton
t-shirts on demand the founders started
the company ten years ago from her
basement but it has since expanded to
over 200 employees there is a warehouse
several physical stores and an
e-commerce site customers love the
high-quality materials and custom
designs that's the good news now for the
bad news
twisted threads has a homegrown
inventory system suffered for each
physical shop and the warehouse the
demand varies per season in both the
quantity of t-shirts ordered and the
type of items that customers want
because of this the company has supply
and inventory issues sometimes the
company runs out of stock and customer
order fulfillment is delayed by a week
or more
at other times twisted threads has
ordered way too many t-shirts from its
supplier they have had to throw out
merchandise to make room for newer more
popular styles twisted threads hosted
servers for their internet shop in-house
but there was massive flooding in the
city and their servers were damaged
beyond repair they decided to move to
the cloud since making this decision
there have been major issues with
performance and cost on the cloud
customers complain about the website
being buggy the site has gone down
several times during periods of high
traffic like the holiday season the
product team wants more features but the
rollout of new features is painfully
slow the competition just launched
personalization on their site which was
a huge hit with customers twisted
threads is falling behind because their
website is outdated developers are
unhappy because deployment of new
features takes ages and operations does
not give them new servers operations is
too overwhelmed with running the cloud
in general and worried about what will
happen if the cloud data center burns
down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
