common way for getting a getting your
head wrapped around a situation where
there are various different states that
can affect ultimate behavior of the
system if you if you think about
decision tables in terms of input
conditions and and and and responses to
those inputs that is combinations of
inputs yielding results that's where the
term combinatorial comes from the table
will have columns some of which
correspond to the inputs and the
remainder will correspond to the outputs
and then each of the rows is going to
correspond to a different combination of
input values let's imagine that we have
a workshop and there are three switches
okay each of the switches can have on
and off as possible values okay so we're
going to have three columns and eight
rows where did the egg come from well if
we have three switches two possible
values for each switch that's two to the
third or eight let's assume that the
three switches control two output
devices maybe an overhead light and
maybe a power drill the third switch is
a master switch which controls all the
electricity in the workshop well here's
that here's a decision table for this
situation partitioned the columns into
three input columns for the three
different switches and two output
columns for the lights and the motor on
the power drill each of the rows
corresponds to one of the possible
combinations of values for the input
switches due to the third eight
different rows there for each of the
combinations of the inputs there'll be a
resulting situation as far as the
outputs are concerned so for example if
the
control switch is off then it doesn't
matter the positions of the other
switches the both the lights and the
motor will be off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
