function that's gonna actually make that
optimization part easier and the
learning part easier so but it's really
closely related to this stuff you talked
about charles so let's let's start with
what you told us which is here's a
definition of of you this is we're gonna
define you mmm but you in a box it's
been tried before it can't be done
alright so well you know if you're if
you're good though I'll give you some
pie next so you you is defined for each
state the utility of being the state
this is the long term value of being in
a state is the reward for arriving in
that state plus the discounted reward of
the future and the few what's going to
happen in the future well in the future
to leave the state we're gonna choose
some action then we're gonna take an
expectation over all possible next
States and we're gonna arrive in some
next state s prime and then U is
representing the utility of that as well
so this is recursive and nonlinear but
we know how to solve this we can use
things like value duration to do that
agreed agreed
all right and you also said here's how
you can use this quantity to decide what
to do that the policy in a state s is
well let's consider all the actions we
can take to leave that state we'll look
to what their expected values are so
we'll iterate over all the possible next
States weighted by their probability of
the utility of landing in the state that
we'd end up in mmm-hmm and that that
tells us how to behave yes
all right so these are these are the
value functions at well value function
of the policy that we talked about
before here's our new kind of value
function it is sometimes called the Q
function though you know some people in
the know don't like that it's me it's
called the hue function because it's
letter Q but it's some people have said
that it stands for quality but it's just
it's just a letter in the latter half of
the alphabet V was taken you was taken
you know W is used for weights like Q
was available so it was brought to bear
so so this is this is a new definition
and you can see it's got elements of the
other two let me maybe write down what
it interpret this okay so again here's
the the Q function and what we're gonna
think of this as is this is the value
for arriving in some state s and this is
you know this is the reward we get for
that arrival then what we're going to do
is we're going to leave s via
action a so we're gonna add to that the
discounted expected value that we get
for taking action a that's gonna now
drop us to some next state s prime
according to this probability and once
we land in s prime we're gonna take
whichever action has the highest Q value
from there okay so and that turns out to
be the value for riving and s leaving
via a and proceeding optimally
thereafter like once once we get to a
new state we're gonna be choosing the
best actions each time that work for you
that makes sense right because you could
different U is basically defined the
same way it's the value for arriving in
S and then proceeding optimally
thereafter that's right and all the the
only thing that we're doing here is
we're basically tying the the algorithms
hands briefly we're saying we're gonna
force you to leave via at via action a
after that do the normal thing but just
for a moment I'd like you to just take
action a mmm-hmm okay that makes sense
so you just you you insert it basically
a kind of I don't know utility step in
there that I assume you're about to use
in some clever way indeed yes this is
going to turn out to be really helpful
because it's gonna allow us to compare
the values of different actions without
having to actually stare at the model to
do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
