popular disease from virtual worlds and
virtual reality the application level
virtual machines like dalvik or Java
Virtual Machine what we are concerned
with here of virtual platforms and by
platform we mean an operating system
running on top of some hardware let's
say Alice has her own company as ink and
she has some cool applications to run
for productivity and let's say that
they're running on a Windows machine on
some server that the company maintains
now if cost were not an issue then this
will be the ideal situation for Alice
Inc the hope of virtualization is that
we will be able to give a company
perhaps not as well endowed as Alice Inc
let's say Bala Inc almost the same
experience that Alice Inc gets at a
fraction of the cost so instead of a
real platform that Alice Inc has bother
Inc gets a virtual platform now in this
diagram what I've shown you is a black
box to represent the virtual platform
because so far as Bala Inc is concerned
they don't really care what goes on
inside this black box all they want is
to make sure that the apps that they
want to run can run on top of this
virtual platform in other words as long
as the platform affords the same
capabilities and the same abstractions
for running the applications that Bala
Inc want he is happy
no we however as aspiring operating
system designers are very much
interested in what goes on inside this
black box we want to know how we can
give Bona Inc the illusion of having his
own platform without actually giving him
one and incurring
all of the cost the implementation and
maintenance associated with implement
in such a virtual platform</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
