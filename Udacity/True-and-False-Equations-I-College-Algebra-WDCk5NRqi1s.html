these equations simplifies to to figure
out which equations are true how about
we start with this equation up here and
let's go with the left hand side first
inside the parentheses here we have 100
times 1000 which is 100,000 or 10 to the
5th power that means that this side of
the equation is equal to log base 10 of
10 to the 5th and we know that that is
just equal to 5 great now on the other
side we have log base 10 of 100 plus log
base 10 of 1000 so this is the same as
log base 10 of 10 squared plus log base
10 of 10 cubed that's just two plus
three or five so this equation does
check out this side is equal to this
side which means is a true statement
awesome let's go for our second one we
know that log base 10 of 100 is too and
we know that log base 10 of 1000 is 3 so
that means this side is equal to 2 times
3 or 6 now over here we're adding those
two numbers we just multiply log base 10
of 100 plus log base 10 of 1000 as we
saw on this side is just equal to 2 plus
3 or 5 6 is not equal to 5 so this is
not a true statement and our third
equation finally on the left-hand side
we have log base 10 of 1100 let's see
using your calculator what that equals
log of 1100 equals 3 point 0 for 139 and
so on let's write that down I'll just
write some of the numbers we know that
it's rounded on the calculator anyway on
to the right-hand side now notice that
this expression is exactly the same as
the one we already evaluated on the
left-hand side of the previous equation
so we know that this log base 10 of 100
times log base 10 of 1000 equals 6 now
3.0 for anything is not equal to 6 so
this equation is not true either the
first equation we had is the only
example of the product property being
used properly the two numbers that we
multiplied and then plugged in as the
input of our first log expression each
act as the inputs for these separate
logs over here that are then added
together we have to be super careful
about what
numbers are multiplying in which
quantities were adding when we use the
product property great job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
