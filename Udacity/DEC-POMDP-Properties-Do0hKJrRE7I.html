com dps are probably worth knowing about
as you pointed out there's elements of
game theory and pom dps mixed together
deliciously and as a result remember
palm DPS well I told you the palm DPS
were not computable so deck palm DPS are
also not computable but in the finite
horizon palm dp's are pspace complete
which is probably definitely kind of
hard deck palm dps are actually known to
be next complete which is
non-deterministic Slyke NP except with
an X in the middle non-deterministic
exponential time complete that sounds
difficult yeah I mean so so the best
that we know how to solve
non-deterministic exponential time
problems is double exponential time the
shortest that it could possibly be
solvable is single exponential time so
it's somewhere between single and double
exponential know like 1.2 exponential
well could be could be one could be too
could be 1.8 alright well as long as we
have choices one of the beauties of this
model one of the reasons that that
people in spite of this computational
challenge like to think about it is
because it just like palm DPS are useful
because they they let you think about
you know actions to gain information
deck palm dp's let you think about
actions to communicate an optimal
solution to a deck palm DP has to
balance the cost of communicating with
the cost of not communicating so is you
know is it worth saying this at this
time hmm ok that makes sense that sounds
like some of the other discussions about
palm teepees and exploration versus
exploitation trade-offs right but it
gets to some of these interesting
questions about communication so this is
a model that's fun to think about if
you're a you know multi-agent person or
even a maybe a natural language person
or metric language dialogue person where
you actually have to reason about what's
worth saying ok and there are some
algorithms and heuristics that are known
there's some applications that are known
and that's just the last thing I want to
do is is is run us through a just a
quick example so you can have a concrete
example what it feels like to be in a
deck palm DP ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
