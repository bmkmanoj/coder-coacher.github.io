eyes in a minute well don't close your
eyes but imagine imagine you have a
cloud of data all right got it I do
let's say some of its labeled - in fact
the vast majorities label - just a few
label plus well if we do it done before
and employ our learning algorithms to
them we were basically just gonna say
all of them are negative
okay we're pretty good as you said so
here's what we're gonna do instead we're
gonna build a learner that's going to
label about half of them negative and
half of them positive oh I can make one
that one of those but it's gonna have
another property Oh so you think that
cloud that I had okay and half of them
are negative let's say the negative ones
come down here and the positive ones go
this way
now here's the thing all the negative
ones are actually true negatives mmm
okay I see I see I see
well include all the positives but also
some of the negatives so I will have no
false negatives and all that many false
positives so in the causing trouble in
the airport example you would like half
the people you would say these people
are not a threat and just be right on
those yeah but the other half you might
say these could be a threat or even say
they are a threat and you'll be wrong
for most of them but all the ones are
threads will survive that film I see
okay so now that I've got the cloud it's
over here and I've still got mostly
negatives and a few positives I keep
doing the same thing so I shove the
negatives off and I'm never wrong and
shove the positives and it goes on and
on and up sort of vaguely reminds me of
boosting it does and in fact the way
that they did this in the original
papers they did they get boosting over
very simple I'm a very simple very
simple learners but what's interesting
here there's a couple of points one is I
started out with this big cloud mostly
negatives a few positives I kept cutting
in half by the time I got over here I
have a much smaller set and now it's
balanced because we keep separating the
chaff from the wheat yeah let's go with
that and so this sort of small set and
now I can apply my lure here and with
the sort of 50/50 split let's say and I
actually do a pretty good job now
there's two things that are worth
pointing out here okay well there's a
zero thing which is like you haven't
pointed out anything so far I've been
pointing everywhere yeah
now here's the other thing here's the
cool thing notice that as I go from this
date over here to the smaller smaller
and smaller and smaller if I'm right and
I get about half the date of surviving
the filter mm-hmm then I could actually
put
twice as much learning energy in each
level I'm pretty sure we didn't study
learning energy computational all right
right oh I see to make it faster right
so if I because the expected amount of
computation is going to be quite small
because most people come in and they get
filtered in the first level right it's
like a log thing yes so the size of the
data that I'm looking at is going down
you know the tube but that means that if
I or by a factor of two which means that
if I and I can put in a factor two more
of computational effort I see and you
know Big O it's gonna be the same need
all right so I can basically do
something stupid less stupid less to be
listed by the time we get some action
whether sophisticate which I couldn't
apply over here because it would take
too much computation I see again the
expected cost would be tremendous but
here the expected cost the change in
expected cost is very small because very
little of the data actually makes it all
the way through that pipe right so
that's point one point two is I now have
this series of learners and over here
we've got a nice Lord that is a really
good job of separating everything out
hmm
but you'll notice that if I took that
one you might say well well let's just
take this learner yeah and I could just
apply from the very beginning I mean
after all now that I've learned the
learner it's not computationally painful
I can usually oh I see cuz the
classifier is fast even learning
processes okay and that's really good
except it will do terribly because well
has a different distributors indicate
Adam you should learn on this
distribution this distribution got it so
you still have to do this cascade of
learners that's why it's called cascade
learn ah I thought it was because it was
like detergent it is like a turkey it it
runs up I don't know enough about the
Cascade commercials to to make a
terrible pun here but alright let's
substitute terrible pun here I leave
drops the spot right that's the hole oh
yeah yeah so all the spotting stuff
comes over here you get sparkling clean
anyway so this sort of casting learning
thing works really well and it gets you
to this nice little place where you've
got this kind of balanced good and
there's all kinds of things out there
like that in the supervised learning
can you name something that's had an
impact on I don't know things that
people have experience with what do you
mean my understanding is that they use
some version of this in handheld cameras
when they actually fly it put a little
box around your face well that makes
sense because
the original work effect was was exactly
that spaces finding your fate finding a
face yeah well these very simple kind of
pictures but most regions of an image
don't have a face in them right well it
depends on the okay so anyway there are
tons of things like that that you should
explore and hopefully you are now
prepared to not just explore them but
they even understand cool so that's a
supervisor nice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
