done but we're not quite sure our
computers can do about a billion
instructions per second or so on a good
second that is one where they're not
wasting part of the the second with a
page fault or cash mins if the answer
had turned out to be in the millions we
could say oh great we're done if it
turned out to be in the trillions we
could say it's totally infeasible we
need a better solution but if it's
somewhere in the middle with with the
billions then we're not quite sure we
better try to refine the result a little
bit to tell if this brute force approach
is going to work and think of the space
of solutions in terms of execution time
as like a contour map and here deep down
in the valley where there's only
millions of computations needed millions
of instructions needed to complete the
answer then we're really happy because
we know that's going to go really fast
and outside of the Happy Valley there
are these high peaks where we have
trillions of computations needed and
there we're going to be sad if we're
stuck out in these domains we're going
to have to somehow find a path back in
because we can't just go ahead and
calculate when we're out at the
trillions and in the middle here where
we need billions of instructions to
complete our computation then we're not
quite sure so maybe we're happy here and
we can stay in this domain maybe we want
to find our path through the wilderness
back into the happy valley depends on
the problem and we're going to try to
look at problems in terms of this space
trying to find our way back in but know
when to stop when we've got close enough
now let's keep thinking about what it
means to do an assignment try to get
just a little bit more concrete about it
if we want to assign red to house number
one let's think about the ways in which
we could implement that here's one
possibility where we say we're going to
have a ray of houses we take number one
and we add red to its set of properties
that means that each house is
represented as a set here's another
possibility where we take house number
one we set its color property equal
to read here each house would have to be
represented as a user-defined custom
class which had properties for color and
nationality and so on here's a third
possibility we have a variable called
red and we just assign that the number
one so here we were assigning properties
to houses and in this one we're signing
houses to properties now I want you to
tell me check all the approaches that
you think would be reasonable designs
for implementing assignment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
