looks something like this but for now I
want to ignore the rehearsal and the
encoding pieces and focus on how
information gets in to working memory
with this focus let me recap the article
the article mentioned three types of
memory first there was sensory memory
and this is everything that your eyes
and ears are taking in its that fleeting
instant of now and right now your
sensory memory contains everything I'm
saying everything on your computer
screen as well as the background noise
and anything in your peripheral vision
it's a lot of stuff then there's also
long-term memory that's everything
that's stored in your brain for example
the name of the street you currently
live on then there's this thing called
working memory and that's everything
you're actively thinking about or
processing now a requirement for
effective learning is that you have the
right stuff in working memory but this
working memory is really small which
means that as educators we could be very
purposeful about how our students
allocate this finite and precious
resource so thinking in terms of this
model of the brain working memory can
only come from one of two sources you
can either retrieve something from your
long-term memory or you can focus your
attention on something in your sensory
memory in reality you're working memory
generally contains a bit of both and for
me this model of information processing
has been really useful I found that when
lessons become overwhelming or confusing
it's often because not enough thought
was put into this flow of sensory
information all the stuff that we're
going to show and say to our students
into this sensory memory and then from
this sensory memory all that stuff
they're seeing and hearing into working
memory so in the next section I want you
to quickly skim through the videos I
showed you earlier but this time focus
in particular on what may be making it
into working memory by paying attention
to how a novice may be directing their
attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
