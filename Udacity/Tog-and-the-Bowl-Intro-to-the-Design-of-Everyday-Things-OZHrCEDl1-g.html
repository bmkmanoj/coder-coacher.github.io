have talked about for a long time is the
importance of a conceptual bottle and
the fact that you know the designer has
some model of what this thing is and the
person using it is trying to figure out
what the model is and the only thing to
go on is the device itself
and you said you had trouble with this
it looks to me like it's a pretty
straightforward bowl so what's the story
well I came across this at a hotel in
Stockholm Sweden they had a whole big
stack of jumbled up for us to put our
breakfast cereal in and so I made the
mistake of putting my breakfast cereal
in it happen to have some cereal here I
poured the cereal into the bowl and then
I added some milk and I do like my milk
so all the way after they're in yeah cuz
that's just the way I like it and then I
put it down on the table yeah because
the base of the bowl is at an angle to
where the bowl is now that does not
require an a warning notice that
requires a redesign so the conceptual
model of a pose that is flat
yeah horizontal Andy that's what men as
long as you're holding it this way it
looks like it is right yes and
particularly the way it was jumbled One
Bowl on top of the other actually
nothing that you were holding in your
hand when you filled it if you had
filled it while it was on the table
right then it would have been okay yes
chef you've maybe couldn't have put as
much milk in it yeah but this is a
breakfast buffet so you're standing
there with the bowl in your hand now
what was it it was intended for was to
make a nice presentation for having the
chef fill this bowl and then a waiter
bring it out to your table
so they'd pressed it into a different
service</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
