created a set of moments and what was
really cool about the moments that he
created is that they were rotation
translation and scale invariant and you
see I put scale and green here because
for what we're about to do the
translation part is taking account by
just using central moments we don't
really need rotation invariant that much
because people don't tend to do their
aerobics at a 45 degree angle but we do
get scale differences right if things
are closer to the image or closer to the
camera or farther from the camera things
get bigger or smaller so we want to
create some descriptors that are
invariant &amp;amp; hué moments are are of that
type and we're going to use seven of
them and that's what these seven hue
moments are and I'm going to show you
the equations for them you would never
write these down you would go get an
implementation of them because otherwise
you'll make a mistake setter but but
here they are okay and in fact they're
so ugly that they don't even all fit on
one page so you see it says this is H 1
and that's mu to 0 remember mu are the
central moments okay plus mu 0 2 and
then they continue h 6 and then h 7 is
even more ugly there they are they're
just that sort of complicated ugly thing
all you need to know is we now have a
translation and rotation and scale
invariant system so the details of what
the the features do are not that
important except that they behave the
way we want them to behave under
particular types of transformations what
matters is I'm going to compute these
features on both the MEI and MH eyes so
the binary version and the grayscale
version and that's going to give me a
feature vector and given a feature
vector I can build classifiers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
