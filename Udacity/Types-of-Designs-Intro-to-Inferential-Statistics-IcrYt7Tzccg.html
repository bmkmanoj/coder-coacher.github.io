samples t-test where we test out and
measure samples from two different
populations in the case of the last
example the populations for the number
of errors made typing the 20-word text
message within 30 seconds on each
keyboard configuration this is called a
repeated measures design and the null
hypothesis is that these two population
means will be the same before we finish
this lesson I'll tell you about two
other types of dependent samples t-tests
one is a longitudinal design where we
measure a variable at one point in time
and then we measure the same variable
for the same sample at a later point in
time and we want to know if there's a
significant difference between the
variable at time one and time two so the
null hypothesis will be exactly the same
symbolically as for a repeated measures
design only with this design we're
putting a lot of time in between
measuring the variables and then a third
type of dependent samples design is a
pretest post-test where we measure a
variable implement some kind of
treatment and then measure the same
variable for the same sample after the
treatment to see if there was a
significant effect due to the treatment
again the null hypothesis is the same
that the variable won't significantly
change before the treatment and after
the treatment you'll see examples of
these two types of designs in problem
set 10 great job T tests are pretty
complicated so now dive deeper with dr.
Laraway he's gonna go into more detail
on these concepts and then go through a
full one sample t-test so you can get a
lot of practice and really understand
how to use these</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
