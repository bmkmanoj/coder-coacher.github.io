method and concatenate its result with
the rest of the URL for the Flickr API
and I'll go ahead and turn the string
into an nsurl object but unlike before
we're not going to make a request using
an nsurl
instead we're going to use an nsurl
request object which is a class that we
can wrap around an nsurl and we can do
it like so by wrap I mean that we can
create an nsurl request from an nsurl
and then it allows us to have access to
more of the request options for instance
we have access to the request HTTP
method now we haven't mentioned HTTP
methods in a while but remember this is
a term for the type of request that's
being made and for this request we're
going to use the HTTP GET method but
since git is the default method we don't
actually have to do anything with this
particular property we don't need to
change it and I should also mention that
when we're using an nsurl request we
actually can't change it there is a
different class called NS mutable URL
request that gives us more
configurability for their quest itself
it allow us to change the HTTP method
for instance but we're not going to use
that until later in this course now with
our request object we can use the shared
nsurl session and the data task with
request method to make our data task and
it takes that same trailing closure with
the data response and air parameters and
I'll say if there's no error then let's
just print the data and also we'll need
to remember to resume the tasks for the
tasks to actually start now let's run
the project grab an image huh
what's up with this output it doesn't
look like the JSON we've seen before in
the API Explorer well there's a reason
for this and let's tackle it next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
