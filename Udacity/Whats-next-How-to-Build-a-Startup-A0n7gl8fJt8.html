lectures it's not the end one of the
things you might consider doing is
putting together a lessons learned
presentation and this summarizes
everything you learned week to week
either by watching the lectures or
hopefully getting out of the building
and talking to customers what to do with
that presentation well number one is you
could post it to the forums and will
select the best presentations and put
them on Steve's blog the second is you
might use this as a prototype for
actually thinking about how to talk to
investors and how to talk to other
customers but what do you do next after
this class really depends on you one is
it could have been a good exercise for
you to decide whether entrepreneurship
is for you or not next good event is
you've decided whether your idea is
worth pursuing or not and third is if
you have and you still like your team
members after getting on the building
and working hard you could decide that
the next step might actually be to
pursue this idea either in an incubator
and accelerator trying to raise some
funds or trying to take the company to
the next step so what I hope is this
class gave you a small taste of what
entrepreneurship feels like and one of
the things you need to do there's a ton
more to learn take a look at the rest of
the Udacity courses that take a look at
Steve Blank comm and Alexander
Osterwalder website business model
generation comm and I also recommend
checking out Startup Weekend org for
other events and other courses and we'll
see you when you're a public company</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
