on it honestly to me it is one of the
easiest projects through the nanodegree
program and I say that just because the
associated class helps students get
started with writing JSON objects and
for those of you working on project do
the JSON objects kind of relate to how
they'll be defining objects for project
three there we go so the first section
is pretty clear make sure you have some
information real or fake about yourself
or someone else you have your bio your
contact info and the project gets you
started along a really good path if you
just go and read the readme its
associated it's going to help you done
just with this part tells you exactly
what you need for each of those parts
second part of it has to do with
functions and it say it says all the
resume functions should be built with
modular functions now what is the big
deal with modularity basically the word
modular itself means something that the
new broken down into parts so it
separates your code into independent
parts which can be put together very
easily and a way to think about this is
modular sofas you can buy any individual
pieces and just piece them together you
can have just a single sofa and then add
on a double one to it depending on how
long your living room I guess in your
style and that's very important right it
can also help when there are multiple
people working on the same project and
each person can work on parts of it and
you can put them together afterwards so
each member would flush out a module and
when they work perfectly by that it
would also be checking on small snippets
of code to work the right way and once
that happens you can just assemble them
together in in one project now it can
also help extend things so say right now
I have a function or code that all
does things a B and C i can add modules
to it so that it can do CD any and in
case of the interactive resume maybe you
just want to start with one thing say
your bio and make sure that works
perfectly fine and then come back and
add a little bit of module for your work
and then their projects so you can keep
extending it in a really easy way and
that really helps debugging as well
because you don't want to write all your
code just to see a blank page on your
Chrome browser window um you open it up
and you don't know what is going on um
where you made the error so it's very
convenient if you want to build up um
part by part module by module so you
want to build up your bio section for
see if it renders and then go ahead with
the rest of the sections just go piece
by piece and I guess but that although
we cover this in the class I wouldn't
likely to show our students how to go
and define functions and talk about the
difference between function expression
and function declaration and let's just
make sure that we actually go into
sublime and dull sublime this is
JavaScript oil yay now something that I
am missing here is a semicolon um this
is called a function expression and it
must come with a semicolon at the end of
the curly braces it's really important
with styling and styling your code in a
certain way is really important to work
with the industry and just work at
industry standards there is another way
to define a function and we can just
call it this way and the code associated
with go over there however in this case
since it is a function declaration it
should not have a semicolon at the end
of it that is an extra semicolon you
don't need it so as quickly to remember
if there is a bar associated with your
function it must have a semicolon
if you don't have a bar in the
Declaration of your when you're
beginning to write your function you do
not need to have a semicolon in the end
and then the way we would call each of
these functions is just by writing this
function and this function do we go
again my semicolons are missing um so
much Gary yeah so that's that's the way
you would be fine a function so make
sure you understand the difference
between what a function declaration
versus a function expression is the
expression comes with VAR VAR associated
with it the declaration doesn't and when
you have VAR associated with a function
have a semicolon otherwise don't it's an
extra semicolon and in your code reviews
you will get pointed out on that a
little first show semicolon insertion
just the way what does encapsulate
things and things to covering it up into
separate objects so hold inside or keep
data pertaining to a particular object
with it so and it also helps with
modularity so you don't have a function
defined there and then its associated if
you are adding on to it function that
you're adding on in some other place so
it helps with unspoken fine your code
that word even exist but can yeah we can
maybe show them like a quick example of
how to write a basic structure of
encapsulation so basically what you're
doing is you're just wrapping your data
and your functions together within an
object right so this object is going to
be able to access all the data as well
as access the member functions um so I
can type up something real quick in
sublime good let uncle share your screen
purnima great so I'm screen sharing and
um right now I'm just going to say I'm
going to give a JSON object name person
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create a name attribute oops I guess I
forgot my parentheses um so I have a
name property and then I assign purnima
to it on and then when I come upon them
um yeah but I'm just controlling autism
okay yeah and then what I do is I have a
person dot display function defined here
oops oops mm-hmm okay um and then what
I'm going to do here is just say console
dot um log off Kristen dot name so cool
and now how I can access so as you can
see this person object has a name
attribute and that has my name assigned
to it and it has a display function so
to call this function all i have to do
is say first and not depending on okay
um so I just showed you how to
encapsulate um a function and its
attribute within an object and how to
call the object and access these
functions and the attributes so that's
what I did here and you can extend this
like how he said I can add a role to
this and say your code church um yeah
and i can add I guess let's show
organization okay man yeah your dad
Udacity so defining your procedure your
function outside of the object using dot
notation the dot kind of is like an
apostrophe in the English language so
it's basically saying person's display
function is going to console
one person that name now there is
another way by defining the display
function let's call it something else
inside the object itself and to do that
uh okay I guess you all are seeing the
screen thank you i'm just going to go
ahead and keep believing your watch of
your responses as questions i guess we
can go ahead and pour Nehemiah can you
be fine the function inside the person
object so the way we would do that is
just have a function and let's call it
okay function do or something you are
mama mama ok and then announce your name
function to men and colon and it would
be the fun you're not you're telling is
that it this property is actually a
function and you have curly braces and
your code and this time it might be
console dot log for persons roles or
something and then the way to actually
call this function is very similar to
the display one and you would still go
first and odd function and it will pull
it up for me this is convenient function
too that's the way you would be calling
that function so that basically is
encapsulation to meet specifications you
definitely want to have your google
ma'am that renders and the goat for it
is given to you in your helper GS so you
need to go and uncommon that code and it
should take the place or location
associated with her liver where you have
work or or you got your education from
and help you display it on the map that
is the basic interactivity we do expect
to see to meet specifications beyond
that you can add many bars or navigation
Mars some sort of us skills charge
that is the 1i have seen and enjoyed a
lot I think that is called the
navigation bars are apart part of
polymer on so you can check that out
indefinitely for exceeding
specifications in that area I've seen
like some of them just like provide
links to their contacts so wherever you
provide contacts and where you have your
LinkedIn handle or your Twitter handle
mentioned there what you can do is you
can add a hyperlink that will actually
take you to your take anyone who's
looking at your resume to the place on
to your Twitter account or your LinkedIn
page or however so you can do that that
is also definitely something that I have
seen and enjoyed a lot and it had to do
with going and modifying the sky Ling as
well was when i hovered over hmm a
certain skill or contact it would change
the color or there was one where it
would jump and that I thought was
particularly helpful with the nanodegree
because you do have to do something of
that sort in your project files and
while you all are quite far away from
that right now it is something to
consider so we love seeing projects that
exceed specifications and so we
encourage you to work on that and the
next part um also the artistic creating
creative that if you exceeds in that you
get an overall expand our project so
make sure that you know sometimes
students overlook that they have to you
know go above and beyond in both the
sections to actually its seed
specifications in the project um so yeah
do you want to talk about the artistic
creativity sure so the artistry artistic
creativity is basically got to do with
your layout in your CSS and we want you
to have fun with the project it doesn't
necessarily mean that you have to
completely change the project we do love
to
those projects but the basic expectation
is that you change your font you change
the layout and we'll show you font and
color soil and coloring right now a
shade of gray and orange the you use um
so yeah go ahead you can alter colors
and change the layout of the page
