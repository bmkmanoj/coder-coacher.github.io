take the following steps using a UML
class model diagram as notation first of
all indicate external actors but only
one activity that is there's only going
to be one class in here and that's the
class of the text browser itself
indicate any external stimuli or events
that can affect the text browser and
indicate how the text browser
communicates its results back to the
external actors its percept so you want
to take a crack at producing such a
diagram that lays out the text browser's
relationship to the external actors okay
so I have I think kind of what are the
things that you can do to the system and
ok let's start with what are the actors
the external actors so for the external
actors I've shown or drawn the user it's
using the text browser but also I
believe we mentioned previously that the
operating system is also an actor even
though you may not think of it visually
like see that happening okay so there's
two external actors in here the end user
and the operating system which is going
to supply the actual file contents
there's the the class itself which
represents the system ok and you also
have some events ok what events do you
have so an event that the user will sort
the user what the user can do with the
text browser view the text browser can
move the handle that's in the tray and
then also resize the text browser so
which one which ones of those are events
events the movement of the handles and
event the resizing of the window is all
son of that viewings kind of like a
continuous process there's no kind of
instantaneous event that's happening
well but the system is not doing the
views are viewing the user is doing the
viewing so correct that's actually a
percept of the system right now
something that the system provides for
the user in addition to the actual lines
of file what else is the system
communicating back
to the user we're also communicating
back the size of the handle something
that says something about the proportion
of the file that's visible correct
and we're also communing communicating
back to the user the height of the
viewport okay obviously the the user has
control over that height and the system
is going to give feedback by showing a
viewport with different heights on it
and you mentioned also that the contents
and that's clearly a percept as well so
we have the height of the viewport its
contents the size of the handle and the
position of the handle on the tray is
another percept correct okay we have the
two events the resizing event in the
scrolling event we have the two external
actors and we have the class itself okay
so we can take the informal sketch that
you've done and we can lay it out using
some kind of UML tool into a precise UML
diagram it's got the single rectangle
indicating the class label text browser
it's got some attributes which include
the height the contents that are visible
the handle size the handle position it's
got some external actors for the user
and the file system it's got some events
indicating the user or the what the user
can do to affect the text browser and
I've also put into the image into the
diagram some UML comments which are the
rectangles with the dog-eared corner on
them note that there are some certain
subtleties that I haven't included in
here such as how we're going to deal
with 0 line 0 length files and so on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
