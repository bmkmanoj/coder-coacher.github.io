related to planning we can consider a
planner that actually generates the plan
in this pan abstraction hierarchy but
then for any plan in this plan
obstruction hierarchy then it converts a
plan in the span obstruction hierarchy
into a skeletal plan it drops the values
of the variables in their plants and
constructs it into a plan they'd simply
specify the variables without specifying
the values the process of configuration
planning then takes these plans
organizes them into obstruction
hierarchy and goes about instantiating
and refining and expanding them we
already discussed how configuration is
connected to a number of other lessons
like case based reasoning planning and
classification you may also consider
this plan to be kind of script for
physical objects in addition these plans
may be learned through learning methods
similar to the method of incremental
concept learning in addition this plan
hierarchy might be learned through
learning methods similar to the method
for incremental concept learning one of
the things that we are doing in
knowledge-based AI is to describe the
kinds of knowledge that we need to learn
before we decide on what is a good
learning method we need to decide on
what is it we need to learn the
configuration process tells us of the
different kinds of knowledge then then
become targets of learning to connect
this lesson back to our cognitive
architecture consider this figure once
again so knowledge of the prototypical
clear as well as knowledge about the
various clients in the abstraction
hierarchy of student memory as the input
gives specification with the design
problem the reasoning component instant
sheets those plant refines them and
expands them the knowledge itself is
learned two examples of configuration of
chairs that presumably the agent is
already encountered previously</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
