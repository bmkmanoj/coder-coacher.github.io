your game and by encouraging them to
create content you can help promote your
game and make your players feel invested
as a bonus you also get to see their
creativity at work and invested players
will help your game make money fan art
is a great example of this and here's an
example from League of Legends another
example of player created content are
extended in game experiences which are
generally ways for players to
personalize the game and create
scenarios that are the most interesting
to them a great example of this is
minecraft it gives users a simple set of
tools and resources that they can build
off of to create their own challenges
and worlds they can create dungeons
filled with zombies or lava games that
take place in the air or places made
entirely of gold players can even
recreate scenarios from their favorite
movies like with this superhero
character and stormtrooper in all these
scenarios players are taking the core of
the game and customizing it based on
their own interests the more your game
supports content creators and is able to
celebrate their creations the more
invested your players will be and the
more depth and variety you'll have in
your gaming experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
