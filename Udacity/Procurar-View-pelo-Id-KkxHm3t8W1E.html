our just Java app specifically we were
looking at the displaymessage method and
trying to figure out everything that was
going on in here even though the fine
view by ID method is not declared within
this class we know now that it's
actually defined in the superclass in
the app compat activity same for set
content view this is defined within the
app compat activity class but what
exactly is happening in this method and
why do we need to pass in a resource ID
and why do we have extra parentheses
here to answer that question I'm going
to summarize everything we've learned so
far and lead you to why this code exists
here do you remember this diagram when
you click on the app icon on the device
it opens up the main activity within our
code the oncreate method of the main
activity gets called by the system
within this method we have a method call
to set content view with the resource
layout ID in an earlier exercise we
passed in a single textview for set
content view but we want more than one
view for our app so we pass in a layout
resource ID this maps to an XML file
once we set the content view the
activity goes and finds the XML layout
file and then reads through each line
for each view it inflates or creates a
Java object for it it goes through the
XML file and then builds up this whole
hierarchy of Java objects when it's
inflating each of these views it's
actually calling the constructor new
textview or new linear layout and then
it's passing in all these attributes
into the Java object so that can be set
up properly notice that we didn't have
to write code for new textview or new
linear layout and to set the font size
all of it was handled by the inflation
process of the activity to interact with
these views while the app is running and
to change them for example to change the
text or to change the buttons then we
need to find these Java objects once we
find them we can store them as variables
in the main activity remember we're not
creating new text views from scratch
we're just finding the existing ones in
this view hierarchy these are the
variables we've used so far in the main
activity we have a variable for quantity
price and price message
this is a mix of local and global
variables to interact with views in the
view hierarchy we should create
variables that reference these specific
views for example we can create a
variable called quantity textview that
would refer to this textview here if you
click on the plus or minus buttons in
the UI then you can change the text view
text to show a different number we can
also have a variable called order
summary textview that points to this
textview
when you click on the order button then
the order summary textview will change
its text to show the new order summary
so you can see how having variables that
point to some of these views would be
useful for changing the UI when the app
is running but how do we make the
connection between this variable here to
this textview and how do we make the
connection between order summary
textview here and this text you back in
the layout XML file remember that we
assigned view IDs to certain views for
this textview we gave it a view ID of
quantity textview for this view we gave
it an ID order summary textview it's
optional to assign IDs to views and you
only should assign a view ID if you need
to refer to that view later for example
you can assign view IDs to everything
but that's unnecessary we only really
need to refer to these two views later
in our Java code so let's just assign
IDs to these two views ok we've
established that views have view IDs
that we can refer to them later in the
Java code we also establish that we want
variables that point to these views so
that we can manipulate these views but
we still don't exactly know how to make
the connection between this variable and
this specific Java object and same for
this variable in this Java object in the
app compat activity class I want to show
you a specific method it's called fine
view by ID and it takes as input a
resource ID the fine view by ID method
finds the view that corresponds with the
ID that is passed as an input and the
activity searches for this view in the
view hierarchy from the XML that was
processed in the oncreate method so like
I was mentioning earlier the activity on
create method sets up a view hierarchy
and then the find view by ID method goes
and finds a view within that view
hierarchy the return value of this
method is an object of type view this
left-hand column shows a return value
for all of these methods this means that
within our activity code we can call
fine view by ID pass in the resource ID
of the view that we want and then it
will return a view object and then we
can store that as a variable within the
activity the mainactivity.java code
would look like this we can call find
view by ID and then pass in as an input
the resource ID of the view that we want
we gave this textview an idea of order
summary textview so here we reference it
as our de ID dot order summary text view
this method will go and traverse the
whole view hierarchy and then look for
the view with this ID then it will
return this Java object as a return
value of this method we can store the
return value into this variable on the
left-hand side called order summary
textview and this is a variable of type
view so this returns a view and we store
it inside a view variable later in the
main activity we can also call find view
by ID and then pass in this resource ID
our ID doc quantity textview which
refers to this textview here this is a
textview in the quantity picker when
this is called activity we'll search
through the view hierarchy and then try
to find the view with this ID and then
it will return this view and then we can
store that in a variable called quantity
textview this variable also has a data
type of view this explains how you can
have a quantity textview and order
summary textview variables within the
main activity and that these variables
can connect to these Java objects in the
view hierarchy by the way I listed the
data types here of each of these
variables in the left-hand column so
these two variables have a type view as
declared here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
