because post can't return HTML we've
seen that post can return HTML they can
return our error page for example but
reloading the reloading our success page
doesn't resubmit the form that's a nice
benefit to remove the form parameters
from the URL technically if you had a
get request that submitted your form and
then you redirected when the form was
valid yeah you can remove the form
parameters from the URL however if you
are submitting you know if you're
sending data to the server with a get
request you have not been paying
attention to this lesson so I'm not
going to count this as correct and
finally so we can have distinct pages
for forms and success pages this is also
true what I've been getting at is this
this nice behavior you can have where
you have your forms and you you submit
that form over and over you post to it
and you keep getting that form over and
over until it's valid and then once it's
valid we bounced the user we redirect
the user to another page which whether
it's a permalink to the blog post they
just entered or to a thank you for being
so good at entering dates page you know
to thanks for registering on our website
page there's lots of things you want to
do there but having separate pages for
those is nice it's a nice way to
structure our app so let's go ahead and
make this change to our the app we've
been working on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
