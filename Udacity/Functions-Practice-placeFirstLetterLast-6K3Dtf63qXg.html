with me this time we're going to write a
function that takes in a string and
returns a string with the first letter
removed from the beginning of the string
and instead placed at the end we've got
the funk let's give it a name let's call
it place first letter last it's going to
take in a string as a parameter let's
call that parameter my string and it
will return a string as well and now
comes the meat of the function just
going to put a placeholder string here
to quiet the compiler let's start out by
adding the first letter to the end of my
string we can do that using the pend
function append is a method a function
that's part of the string class so we
call the method append on an instance of
the string class using dot syntax we
just type the name of the string a dot
and the name of the method followed by
parentheses we place any input
parameters between the parenthesis in
this case the parameter is a character
to append to my string so how will we
get the first character of my string
well we just wrote a function that
returns the first character of a string
let's use that and put it here as the
argument to append hmm okay the
compilers upset about something let's
see what this error says immutable value
of type string only has mutating members
named append see because my string is a
parameter it defaults to being a
constant as if it were declared with let
if we declare it with VAR the error
should go away sweet so far we've
appended the first letter to the end of
the string now we need to also remove it
from the beginning of the string for
that we can use the function remove that
index remove it index takes an index as
a parameter the index we want to remove
is the start index and of course instead
of returning placeholder we want to
return my strength in that ought to do
it so let's test it out by calling the
function and we'll call it on the string
mom over here in the sidebar you can see
that mom becomes ohm and we're ready for
yoga but before we move on I'd like you
to notice the difference between how we
call global functions and how we call
methods for example
and is called on an instance of the
string class using dot syntax it's a
method global functions on the other
hand like place first letter last are
not called by any object in particular</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
