time and there was not a killer app to
justify this particular line of thought
further active networks focused more on
safety and less some performance so in
the 90s it seemed more like a solution
looking for a problem
but difficulties with network management
rise of virtualization the right
hardware support and data center and
cloud computing have all given active
networks a new lease of life in the form
of Software Defined Networking or Sdn
for short
specifically cloud computing promotes a
model of utility computing were multiple
tenants by that I mean businesses can
host the respective corporate networks
simultaneously on the same computational
resources of a data center not that this
is going to ever happen but imagine Coke
and Pepsi corporate networks running on
the same data center resources what this
means is there is a need for perfect
isolation of the network traffic of one
business from another even though each
of the network traffic is flowing on the
same physical infrastructure
this calls for virtualization of the
physical network itself and hence the
term software-defined networking you
will learn more about Sdn if you take a
companion course on networking that is
offered in the same program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
