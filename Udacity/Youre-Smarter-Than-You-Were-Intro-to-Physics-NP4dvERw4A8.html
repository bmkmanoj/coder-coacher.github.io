the you from 10 minutes ago to the you
of now the you who now knows about
conservation of energy and gravitational
potential energy well even 10 mins ago
you could have solved problem with let's
say a ball dropping down in free fall 10
mins ago could have solved that and now
could have solve that you know
everything that you need to know to
describe this motion what about an
inclined plane well ten minutes ago I
think you could have solved this you
know how to break forces down and solve
for acceleration and so now I assume you
could solve that as well but an inclined
plane isn't a very realistic shape how
often in nature do you see a hill that's
perfectly flat at one single angle not
very often more often what you see in
nature is weird strange shapes like this
one and if you have a block of mass M on
a hill like this could you calculate the
speed of the block when it gets to the
bottom I think ten minutes ago you may
not have been able to do that but now
you can and how are you going to do that
well as long as you know the height of
the hill you know that as the block
slides down here well its potential
energy will be described by this
equation M times G times H so as H goes
down potential energy will go down but
energy is conserved it can't be created
it can't be destroyed so if potential
energy is going down kinetic energy must
be going up and in fact at the very
bottom of this hill once the block has
gotten all the way down here H is zero
so all of the potential energy is gone
and converted into kinetic energy we can
say that mathematically by saying that
the potential energy the block had up
here is equal to the connecticut has
down here or mg h equals one-half MV
squared and what do you know the math
tells us the mass of the block doesn't
matter we can solve this equation for V
to get this wonderful answer the
velocity of this block at the bottom
will be the square root of two times G
times H this answer is remarkable it
doesn't depend on the mass and Galileo
new motion shouldn't really depend on
mass it depends on this acceleration due
to gravity as we expect if it's higher
while the speed is higher and it also
depends on the height of the hill slide
it down a higher hill and the velocities
greater this makes a lot of sense now
that you're so much smarter than you
were ten minutes ago time to put these
skills to use and solve some problems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
