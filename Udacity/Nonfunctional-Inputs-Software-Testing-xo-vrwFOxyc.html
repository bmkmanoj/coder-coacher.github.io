continuing to dig into some of the
nuances of testing software and we're
going to keep looking at things that can
make testing hard so the final issue
that I want to talk about in this
general vein of things that can
complicate testing is what i like to
call non-functional inputs and these are
inputs that affect the operation of the
software under test that have nothing to
do with the AP is provided by the
software that we're testing and nothing
to do with the AP is that are used by
the software that we're testing and so
what are these non-functional inputs
well they include things like context
switches so what context switches are
our switches between different threads
of execution in a multi-threaded
software under test now of course you
shouldn't have to worry about context
switches at all if your software under
test only has a single thread and the
assignments are going to be working on
it in this course our single threaded
but in general it's very common for
complex software systems to contain
multiple threads of execution and so the
issue is is that these multiple threads
of execution are scheduled on different
processors on the on the physical
machine oh we're running on at different
times and it's the operating system that
makes the decisions about what thread
goes on what processor at what time and
depending on the scheduling of these
threads bugs in the software under test
can either be concealed or revealed and
the problem is is that the timing of
these contexts which is is completely
not under the control of our application
it's under the control of the operating
system which provides these
non-functional inputs and this makes
testing multi-threaded software actually
really really quite difficult so let me
give another example of non-functional
inputs so some years ago in the late
1990s I spent a summer working at a
company that made very very fast
networking hardware and a start over for
example with that two pcs talk a multi
gigabit speeds using a switch and so
sort of the interesting thing about the
software through developing the ran not
only on the pc but also on a network
card was that it was completely
independent of the tcp/ip stack but
normally provides reliable delivery for
machines connected by networks but also
to supposed to provide a reliable
delivery of data even when we had errors
in a network and so a problem that we
faced was this network in fact was
extremely reliable it would introduce
bit errors into the data being
transmitted maybe only once every
several hours or maybe it maybe even
only every several
and so we faced was a real difficulty in
testing the end-to-end reliability
software running on the PCs because the
network was so reliable and so what we
often that it up doing is we would open
up a switch exposing all of the
electrical contacts inside then we would
take a key a metal key and run it across
the contacts that were exposed from some
of the chips on the inside of the switch
and what this would do is introduce a
massive number of very short-lived short
circuits inside the switch causing a
huge number of bit errors causing the
software running on the PCs to have to
cope with all these bit areas and of
course either the network would glitch
for a moment and then when it started up
the data transfer would resume or else
it would fail to resume properly in
which case possibly the software crashed
or possibly delivered erroneous data in
which case we had some debugging to do
and so what I like about this example is
we're able to access using this very
crude mechanism of running a key across
contacts let's sort of a deep level of
the system and introduce errors that we
weren't able to introduce at any other
release conveniently at any other level
of the software stack and so this again
was another kind of non-functional input
to the system under test that by getting
control over we were able to perform
better testing of the software</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
