level interaction between the ListView
and the array adapter and then we'll
dive into the code in the next video so
you can think of a list view as being
powered by the array adapter so without
the adapter the ListView is just an
empty container and when I say powered
by I mean that the array adapter holds
onto the set of data that should be
shown onto screen so for example it can
hold onto an array or even a list of
data so the array adapter knows how to
translate this data or adapt it into a
list item view that will be displayed in
the ListView
so let's take a look at the details of
how all this works so when you first
associate an adapter to a ListView the
ListView will ask how many items it
should expect to display and the array
adapter knows this information so the
ListView calls a method on the array
adapter and in this method it will pass
in an input which is the current
position in the list that the user is
currently viewing in this case it passes
in the position 0 but the user might be
on the first position or maybe even the
hundredth position in the list so
knowing this information the array
adapter checks the internal source of
data so give this case it checks the
array it might also check a list if
that's is the source of data and it gets
the information out and it has
instructions that tell it how to create
a list item view that it will return to
the ListView
now when the screen is full the ListView
will stop asking for more list items
from the array adapter so the list item
views are only created on demand when
needed
so when the views are scrolled off
screen remember that they're added to
the scrap pile so in this specific
example
remember that Janne and Carl the first
to list items are no longer visible and
still end up in the scrap pile and then
we can actually reuse those views by
passing them back to the array adapter
when we request a new list item so the
ListView will request the list item view
for a certain position in the list and
also pass along a view that was
previously used before so in this
example the ListView is requesting for
the item at position
six and passing in the reusable view
from before to the Ray adapter now the
array adapter can use the recycled view
by just replacing the data inside of it
for example by calling the text view set
text method to change the name here and
now it looks like a brand new list item
then we can return to the list view to
be added to the new hierarchy and
displayed on screen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
