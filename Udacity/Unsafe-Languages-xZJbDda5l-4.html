languages you could not use languages
like Java or or others that do this
checking to to prevent or memory
overflow kind of attacks what can we do
in that case if you are stuck with let's
say languages for whatever reason we
talked about a few where this is not
done automatically what should we be
doing so when we are using these so
called unsafe languages that
automatically don't prevent buffer
overflows then it becomes the
responsibility of the programmer if
you're writing code it is your
responsibility that you deal with this
problem of potential buffer overflows
one way you can do that is by checking
all input ok so secure coding mantra is
that trust no input all input is evil
and you should be checking that it
conforms to whatever your expectation
was don't rely on the underlying system
to do those because we are talking about
using languages that do not do
automatically so secure coding is an
extremely as you write programs you
write them to implement certain
functionality you may even write them
with some performance goals in mind but
at the same time you need to keep in
mind that you have to write them so they
cannot be exploited you have to code
securely or use secure coding practices
so your program doesn't have the
vulnerabilities like the ones we've been
talking about and one way you do that is
by checking all input the other thing
that you can do is you can use functions
that are safer there do bounds checking
so remember in the code you could have a
string compare or a string copy you
could also have certain size string so
you shouldn't be dealing with a string
that is longer than that so they're
functions that put place a limit on the
length of the string this function would
manipulate so you can use their number
of safer ways to use certain functions
that are unsafe and there are patterns
of a ways of using those that are safer
where the likelihood of a vulnerable is
lured lower so these functions although
the language
and do it the functions that you do
we'll do the checking or the bounds
checking that we're talking about and as
a result using those leads to code that
is safer more secure and the last thing
you can do after written some code
that's not in a type safe language is to
use tools that exist that would actually
analyze code that you have written and
flag the potential vulnerability the
reason the way they're able to do that
is they can look for certain chord
patterns they can look for certain
unsafe functions and can warn you that
the code that you code fragment that you
have where these things appear and
unsafe function appears could be
potentially vulnerable to some sort of
exploit buffer overflow or something
like that so these tools you just run
your code through these tools and
there's a lot of them that out there
some commercial some you can get for
free and these tools they rely on sort
of database of certain kind of patterns
that are known to be unsafe and if they
run into your code that matches those
kind of patterns they can flag those and
they can do more sophisticated analysis
to potentially discover the kind of
vulnerabilities that you were talking
about so is no excuse for writing code
that is not secure you should be
checking your input you should be using
safer functions that do that
checking automatically and then you
should run through your code through
these tools that can flag potential
problem spots and you should go back and
look at that and see how you can
actually make those potential
vulnerabilities go away one problem with
automatic tools is that they may have a
lot of false positives or if they miss
out and they have false negatives so you
can't have tools that will have zero
false positives or false negatives but
the tools can certainly help us get rid
of many possible vulnerabilities in the
process producing code that is a lot
more secure so even when you are stuck
with programming in a language that's
not going to help you much with the kind
of attacks vulnerabilities that we've
been talking about certainly things you
can do as a programmer who likes to do
secure programming by checking input
using safer functions and then running
checking your code through
tools that are we talking about and
we'll have a long list of these tools
actually you can go and learn about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
