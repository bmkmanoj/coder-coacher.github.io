you just give me yes or no if the next
20 years living twice as long I think
that's got a better than twenty percent
chance but I'm worried that we're going
to solve the physical problem in
extending the life of our bodies without
extending the life of our minds they
think it's finding a sea of branding
plants specific brain implants that you
read your brain and program new stuff
into your brain without having to talk
to people and read books and so on yeah
I think it'll be more limited than
people imagine in a variety of ways it
will be at first a prosthetic for people
who have specific problems it will help
blind people to see again and that sort
of thing I think synthetic biology
happens not to be something that X is
working on right now but I predict that
20-30 years from now people are
programming cells and life more
generally in a way that looks a lot more
like engineering than it does like
science chemistry or biology Vivek you
of cancer no but we will have taken over
the last 30 or 40 years cancer has been
taken down several notches and I think
what we'll see over time is that more
and more cancers will move from the
death sentence category to the chronic
condition category with cars flying yeah
that's the case sukhiya is yes I heard
so far whatever great things would have
been 20 is no surprises so here's one of
the ones that isn't a specific
technology but it's just a different way
of thinking about things that excites me
a lot that you could think of generally
as robotics but I would think of as
intelligent technology historically
people have thought about making things
strong or safe or useful in very
mechanical ways you make a car safe by
making it strong enough and crumbly in
the right way that even if it slams into
a brick wall the people inside will be
safe looking at the car for example it's
starting to make sense to people to
think about weight instead of
having it survive the smash into the
brick wall what if we made it smart
enough that it just never hit the brick
wall and I predict that a huge number of
things in our world will go through this
transformation where we will stop
thinking in industrial terms about how
to make them cheap how to make them safe
how to make them efficient and we'll
start thinking about how embedding
intelligence into the thing and having
them be able to sense think compute and
actuate robots in the very general sense
of the word robots will actually change
whatever that thing is whether it's a
car or an airplane or a building or wind
turbine or you just articulated
beautifully the vision of artificial
intelligence of making met our smart</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
