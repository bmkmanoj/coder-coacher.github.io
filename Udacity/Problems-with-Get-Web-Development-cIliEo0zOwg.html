differences now let's talk about what
happens if you if you don't obey those
rules I remember about this is probably
six or seven years ago now when we were
first starting reddit there is a there's
a program online called base camp and
it's it's made by a company called
37signals and it's used for you know
organizing to-do lists and stuff and so
the page kind of looked like this you
had like these you know to-do items and
next to each of these to-do items was a
little link that said delete and this
was just a link and if you recall normal
links with the anchor tag that you would
see and click on those make get requests
to make a form to make a post request
you need a form and these were just
links and so if you're logged in you
could create these to-do items and if
you wanted to delete it you could just
click on delete well there was another
program out at the time called Google
Google web accelerator and what that was
is it was a browser plugin that would
sit in your browser and while you're
browsing you know let's say let's say
this is your you know the browser your
you're looking at let's add a picture
here you know while you're browsing a
bunch of text you know there might be
some links you know throughout the
document the Google web accelerator
would make those requests behind the
scene you know so that when you click
the links the pages were ready to go the
problem is the google web accelerator
was hitting these links so users would
go to their you know Basecamp page look
at their to-do list and find that their
items were were deleting on their own
and that's a that's kind of a big
problem and that's that's what happened
or that's what happens when you use get
request to alter the server state those
guys at the time just assumed that since
we were logged in you know no BOTS would
ever hit the hit the page you know what
only the users clicking but you know if
your browser is behaving funny or if
you've got a plug-in running that's
that's you know clicking on all the
links for you you better be certain that
those links don't actually change the
server so what you should design instead
is instead of making you know links that
alter the server you can
make little forms and the form can just
have a little button in it that says to
lead or it can have a special link that
causes it to submit the form but it
should be making a post request</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
