definitions of game theory that we could
use one that I like in particular is
that game theory is the mathematics of
conflict and interesting I think it's
kind of interesting or or more generally
it's the mathematics of conflicts of
interest when trying to make optimal
choices because I feel like a lot of
people have their own conflicts with
mathematics
I think everyone the mathematicians have
their conflict with mathematics I think
that's very same but do you see if you
can you see how worrying about the
mathematics of conflict might be a sort
of natural next thing to think about
after you've learned a lot about
reinforcement learning
I guess that well the next bullet kind
of kind of suggests a trend so so we've
been talking about decision making and
it's almost always in the context of a
single agent that lives in a world and
it's trying to maximize reward but
that's kind of a lonely way to think
about things so what if there's other
agents in the world with you right and
of course evidence suggests that there
are in fact other agents in the world
with you and what we've been doing with
reinforcement learning which you know
has worked out very well for us is we've
been mostly pretending that those other
agents are just a part of the
environment somehow all the stuff that
the other agents do is hidden inside of
the transition model but truthfully it
probably makes sense if you want to make
optimal decisions to try to take into
account explicitly the desires and the
goals of all the other agents in the
world with you does that seem fair yeah
right so that's what game theory helps
us to do and then at the very end I
think we'll be able to tie what we're
going to learn directly back into the
reinforcement learning that we've done
and even into the bellman equation oh
okay nice yeah so that's gonna work out
pretty well but but we have to get there
first and there's a lot of stuff we have
to do to get there but right now what I
want you to think about is this notion
that we're going to move from
reinforcement learning world of single
agents to a game theory world of
multiple agents and tie it all back back
together it is a sort of general note
that I think that that's worthwhile is
that game theory sort of comes out of
economics and then in fact if you think
about multiple agents they're being
millions and millions of multiple agents
in some sense that's economics economics
is kind of the math and the science and
the art of thinking about what happens
when there are lots and lots and lots
and lots of people with their own goals
possibly conflicting trying to work
together
to accomplish something and so what game
theory does is it gives us mathematical
tools to think about that I feel like um
I feel like other fields would care
about some of these things too like
sociology right and what about I could
kind of imagine biology caring about
these things too even biology I like the
idea of biology biology
why would biology care about this well I
guess the way you described it in terms
of lots of individual agents that are
interacting like you know creatures that
live and reproduce I feel like they they
have some of those same issues sure so
it's certainly biology at the level of
entities at the level of mammals or
level of insects you might be able to
think about it that way but perhaps even
at the level of genes and at the level
of cells little viral I and and bacteria
you could possibly think about it that
way
because they're in conflict to I guess
yeah now there's probably this notion of
intention it's not entirely clear what
that means here and I think implicit in
the notion of what we're doing here is
this notion of intention and explicit
goals as opposed to ones that are kind
of built into your genes but I think
that's perfectly reasonable way of
thinking about it I think the lesson
from this discussion though is that what
game theory sort of captures for us or
what we would like for it to capture for
us is ways of thinking about what
happens when you're not the only thing
with intention in the world and how do
you incorporate other goals from other
people who might not have your best
interests in heart or might have your
best interests at heart how do you make
that work
and so if you think about that problem
that I think it makes sense that it's
been increasingly a part of AI over the
years and in some ways machine learning
has started to think of it as being a
mainstream part of what we do cool hence
why it's worth talking about today okay
sound good got you okay so let's let's
try to make this concrete with a very
simple sort of example</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
