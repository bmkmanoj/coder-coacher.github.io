is a subset of bqp it wouldn't mean that
RSA is secure in fact we know because of
Shor's algorithm if someone can build a
sufficiently large quantum computer they
would be able to break RSA
but it would increase our confidence
because it would put factoring in the
class of problems that are believed to
be hard to solve in polynomial time
as long as P is not equal to NP and if
it's also showing that P is not equal to
NP well then this would mean that there
is not any polynomial time solution for
factoring with a classical computer so
that would greatly increase their
confidence at RSA is secure to see why
this is the case we can think about our
complexity classes as sets of problems
that makes a green circle the class NP
and we have the class b QP which is not
known whether it's a subset of NP and we
have the problem factoring and we know
factoring is somewhere in the circle and
the reason we know factoring is NP is we
have solutions that solve it in
non-deterministic polynomial time even
the brute force solution if we could
execute all those paths at once would
solve it in polynomial time the other
way to see that it's in NP is there's an
easy way to check if the answer it's
correct
that's just multiplication so that's
enough to know that factoring is
definitely within the NP circle and we
also know that it's within dqp if it's
known to be np-hard well that would mean
it's as hard as the hardest problem in
NP it's also known to be in bqp so that
would mean that we'd have to squish
everything in the circle would now be
inside bqp because there's no problem
that would be harder than factoring in
NP so I hope those of you who haven't
yet studied the theory of computation
will forgive this little excursion but
there's a really important point to
understand what the security of RSA
relies on these assumptions about
problems being hard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
