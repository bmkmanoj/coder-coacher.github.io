of B of T equals 1000 e to the negative
point five T which we know is going to
be the reflection of that graph in the
line y equals x so that means that we're
looking for the equation of this graph
right here this is B of T and this is B
inverse of tea well let's think about
how we might do this well we could
divide both sides by a thousand and then
maybe we could take the t root of both
sides that will get rid of the T on the
right hand side in the exponent but we
would still have an exponent of T over
here since we know that the T root is
the same as taking this to the one over
T power so that's not going to help us
out at all we actually need a totally
new idea to solve this problem and that
ideas and they met a Scottish
mathematician named John Napier
discovered in 1614 his discovery was
something called a logarithm or just a
lock we'll look at some simpler examples
first of logs and then come back to this
example about bacteria once we have all
the tools we need to deal with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
