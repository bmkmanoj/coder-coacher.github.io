interviews that I've done here at
Udacity you'll notice that i'm now
sitting in the other chair and that's
because today we're talking about a
topic that was part of my dissertation
research which is explored our learning
environments so jason has agreed to give
me my questions and interview me on the
topic so thank you absolutely anything
for you dude I think I've said that
before in another video so what makes
exploratory and learning environments so
powerful in education so the reason I
really like exploratory learning
environments in education is that they
let us build circumstances or build
situations or build opportunities for
students that are pretty hard to have in
a real classroom also in my dissertation
research we did in the context of middle
school ecology and doing scientific
inquiry inside to be modeling in that
domain and when you're really doing
inquiry in ecology you're usually doing
things that take months or years to
gather the data on and you build models
that you know cover decades of time or
you know our current climate change
models are covering centuries or
millennia in time they kids the
projections out that far and our
students in a classroom they have you
know 45 minutes or maybe two weeks for
unit they don't have time to sit around
gathering 12 months of data or 24 months
of data or anything like that the real
power explore Torah learning
environments is it lets us take those
very real very authentic opportunities
from the real world take away some of
the constraints of the obstacles to
using in the classroom and strip them
down to only those things that are
really useful for the learning so in our
research we had students simulate what
would happen to a particularly
ecological system over a very large time
scale under different initial
circumstances so if the system started
like this what would it look like 10
years from now they start like this what
would look like 10 years from now in
person we can't monitor a system for 10
years for a middle school class project
course but we want them to get that
experience of what it's like to
authentically investigate that problem
and so the real power and exploratory
learning environments is to open up
those opportunities but more than just
opening up those opportunities as well
the real the meat of them is also how
they give students ownership over that
process and so they're called
exploratory because the student is
exploring the student is driving what
they're doing the student is going in
and saying I think I want to research
this today or I want to explore this
area depending on the nature of the
environment right and so it's not
something that we're telling them you
know you have to do this and then this
this and here's your assignment and
here's your reading for the day they get
to take charge and that builds a lot of
ownership a lot of engagement in it
because it's you know the experience
they're constructing is personalized
different for everybody right and so
that's why i love using them in that
because it it teaches students the
skills they need to actually survive in
their eventual real world that you know
when you're on a job hopefully you don't
have someone holding your hand and give
you your to-do list for the day you
might but hopefully you know you're
giving some free rein and your trusted
to go forward with it and so exploratory
learning environments are a way of
opening up those opportunities those
experiences to students earlier in their
education sounds like it's going to
build a lot of confidence for those to
do I hope so yeah actually and our
experience is that class it did we had a
couple students who didn't consider
themselves very good in science but it
was when they were told you have the
power to questions certain accepted
truths based on the evidence that you
gather that it kind of gave them this
idea that you know I don't have to
necessarily be a scientist to do
research I mean you need to become one
eventually do in the real world but the
idea that beliefs and theories are
constructed based on evidence and you
have the power to Gavin gather evidence
it's a really powerful idea for students
to have that early in their science
education absolutely yeah when designing
a learning environment what is important
to keep in mind so for me the main thing
to keep in mind designing these
environments is to preserve the
authenticity of whatever problem you're
mimicking I say that because there's a
very strong tendency among some who
would design some environments like this
to really gamify it and I have a strong
opposition to game of fine just because
it creates great some nice motivation
but its motivation isn't rooted in the
material and so we could have an
explorer to our learning environment
where for example you're gathering
evidence to explain why certain species
went extinct and every time you find a
piece of evidence you'd get 10 points
and it that's not very authentic about
it it's right you know you're basically
just looking around finding clues what
we really want to do we a ting these
exploratory learning environments is
preserve the authenticity of whatever
activity were mimicking out the real
world if scientists use simulations for
example we want to eat them TR there are
students to use the same kinda
simulations that scientists use right we
want them to derive value from it based
on what predictions they can make not
whether or not they achieved an
objective or got an achievement or got a
trophy or something like that
right so I think it's really important
to preserve what it is you want to teach
in that environment and make sure it's
what you want to teach that's actually
the motivating part of engaging with
that environment so you're talking about
the focusing on the learning goals as
opposed to the gamification of the right
exactly all right very good we talked a
lot about learning environments in the
middle school I'm wondering what sort of
application for high school or the
collegiate level exists so you're right
i think most often we see explored to
our learning environments used in lower
in middle school and part of the reason
is that they the many things very
engaging they're very visually attracted
they're very interactive they're very
you know interesting to look at right
and so that's I think one of the reasons
why we see them a lot of the earlier
ages but I think they have a very strong
place later in life that the constraints
that we deal with at the lower middle
school levels don't go away when we're
in college we're dealing with the same
kind of things of we're learning about
ecology we're learning about systems and
we're learning about systems to take
place of a very long period of time I
think the difference is that the
authenticity actually comes out even
more strongly when we're doing it later
in our college career so we don't need
to dress up as much we don't need to
make it as colourful we can actually
just sometimes give students the tools
that real people use and this is a
especially I think the case in computer
science education the ides in many ways
our exploratory learning environments
you're exploring the API you're
exploring the different you know results
of different programs and things like
that so I think it definitely has a
place later in the educational career
but I think Jason's right that I think
that exploratory learning environments
are most often used at lower middle
school levels and if you're interested
in working with lower middle school
students or even maybe some high school
students I think they're really really
nice domain to explore it leads itself
to some really fun projects and some
really interesting projects that can
really motivate students but I also
encourage you to think about some of the
ways we could use the same kind of
principles in later education so thank
you for chatting with me about this of
course David</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
