that represents saving more than a
hundred dollars per month for example
after one month I could have also saved
four hundred dollars or after one month
I could have saved four hundred fifty
dollars or even five hundred dollars
similar reasoning could be used at two
months I could have saved maybe six
hundred dollars or 700 so there's tons
of points farther above this region
because all these Y values are the
amount of money saved falls above this
line we can change our equation into an
inequality we want our savings amount to
be greater than the exact amount of two
hundred dollars plus the hundred dollars
per month so this is the end equality we
can write notice that linear
inequalities contain two variables just
like linear equations this allows us to
find a point x and y that satisfies this
condition for example I can use this
point and plug in 2 for X and 504 why
and I should get a true statement and
when I do I get 500 is greater than 400
so yes this is true also remember from
before we said that one 300 couldn't be
a point for our inequality we didn't
save more than a hundred dollars per
month so I need some way to represent
that on the line I can't actually
include the points on the line so I'm
going to use a dashed line to exclude
them we know any of the points above
this line satisfy our inequality this
shaded region up above would represent
every instance when we saved more than a
hundred dollars in a month let's say you
allowed yourself to save exactly one
hundred dollars or more per month so now
we could be greater than or equal to
well this point can now be a point on
our line if you allow yourself to save
exactly one hundred dollars or more in a
month then now we can include this point
in our inequality we can see that by
plugging it in we get a true statement
300 is greater than or equal to 300 I
need to change my graph to reflect that
so instead of using a dashed line I'll
use a solid one that will represent the
equal to part when graphing linear
inequalities we use a solid line for
greater than or equal to and less than
or equal to if we see the greater than
or the less than sign then we use a
dashed line
