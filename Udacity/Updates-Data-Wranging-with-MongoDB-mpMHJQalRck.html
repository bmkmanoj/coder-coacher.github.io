different ways of interacting with
MongoDB collections we've looked at how
we go about inserting documents into a
collection and a number of different
ways of querying a collection to find
documents of interest we're now going to
turn our attention to updating and by
that I mean making modifications to
existing documents in the collection
there are several ways to do this in
MongoDB the one we're going to look at
here is the use of the save command now
in PI Mongo this is actually a method on
collections objects save does one or two
things if the object we pass to it
already has an underscore ID and a
document with that underscore ID is
already in the collection then it simply
replaces the document with that ID with
this one if there is no document with
that underscore ID or the object we're
passing does not have another square d
field then MongoDB will create a new
document for us ok so what we're doing
here is querying the city's collection
for the city Munich or muchin and in
this case we'll get back a single
document now the reason why we're
guaranteed to get back a single document
is because instead of using find we're
using the find one command instead of
returning a cursor as fine does find one
simply returns to us the first document
it finds that matches our query so what
we're doing in this code is modifying
this city document so that it has a
field for iso country code and value for
the appropriate three character iso
country code for Germany which is de you
ok when we call save here this document
will be updated to include this field
let's go ahead and run this ok and now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
check that the document was updated
appropriately here we can see the
document before we did the update i did
a find on it earlier and now we see this
iso country code field showing up in the
document so what I'm going to do here is
look at a few different examples run
them and then test the results of having
run them in the MongoDB shell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
