automatically sprinkled throughout your
code base is suboptimal at best Apple
realized this and has addressed this
problem by providing no ability
annotations null ability annotations
clarify which variables have the
potential to carry nil values these
annotations are pretty straightforward
and they include nullable and non null
as you might expect nullable pointers
can have no values and non null pointers
cannot so let's go ahead and annotate
our user class in this case name and
email will be non-null because every
user must have a name and email but
avatar should be nullable now see how
this warning pops up down here as soon
as you add null ability annotations in
one place the compiler will start
encouraging you to add them everywhere
it's all or nothing no problem we just
need to add annotations to the two
parameters email and name are still both
not null hmm the compiler is still
complaining and it's pointing to this
return type to know how to annotate the
return type we'll need to look at the
initializer in the dot M file notice
that this custom initializer can return
nil if email verification fails so we'll
go back to the header file and will mark
this return type as nullable since
sometimes it can be nil there now the
compiler is happy let's see what our
generated header looks like now again we
go up to this icon in the upper left
click generated interface okay now this
is what we like to see no exclamation
points the properties that we mark does
not null name and email are interpreted
as regular variables the avatar property
which we marked nullable is a
respectable explicitly unwrapped
optional and so is the return type for
the initializer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
