down let's see where do I want to drag
them to down to band detail I guess yeah
but not both the name Nomad above me
right and I'll do that for all of them
yep
and so you have two columns so you can
drag those fields to the other side also
okay all right cool so I'll put my
contact information on the right column
I'll put this other stuff over here and
if you wanted to at the top here it says
you can drag sections so you can even
create new headers for more information
like if we had a finite set of stuff
that was only about this stage we could
possibly drag down a section and name it
like stage information or something like
that okay so that wasn't so bad I just
had to drag all these fields on I think
I still prefer using the wizard though
say like that it does everything for me
screaming Builders cool though I mean
there are trade-offs to both definitely
with the wizard it allows you to you
know do everything you might want to do
from security to field creation in one
clean sweep but if we would say new our
entire data model right from the
beginning it would probably be pretty
tedious to have to go through those
seven steps for let's say 100 fields
right but dragging them all on the you
know schema builder it allows you to do
a lot at once really quickly okay make
sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
