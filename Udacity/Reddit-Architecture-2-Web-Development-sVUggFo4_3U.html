speed of the site was we added another
database and this was using a piece of
tool piece of software called Sloane II
I believe to replicate our database we
still only had one app server at this
time and we made lots of database
requests our caching wasn't nearly as
advanced we had some basic caching it
was just at the application level this
machine was hitting both of these
postgrads machines this is the first
time we ran into the notion of
replication lag because we had these two
separate machines and Salone would
normally keep them in sync but sometimes
the slave machine could lag by about
five seconds or so and if you had just
submitted a link and then we redirect
you to the permalink and then we'd hit
the slave machine that didn't have the
permalink we'd send the user a 404 which
is really annoying
right after you submitted a piece of
content that's when we started thinking
about keeping our cache writing to our
cache at the same time he's writing to
our database and we also had the issue
with these two processes of keeping
these caches in sync we weren't using
memcache yet the way we kept our caches
in sync was we used a library called
spread and spread is this kind of
network library that basically you say
if you send a message to one host it'll
send it to all these other hosts and so
around this time is when we added our
second app server that was running
Python on it as well and we used spread
to keep the two hash tables that we were
using as our cache kind of in sync this
worked sort of okay in terms of keeping
these two caches in sync but it wasn't
going to scale very well because
eventually we would add a couple more
app servers to deal with more load and
spread like every time one of these app
servers would update its cache you would
have to tell all of the other app
servers about it and so turned into this
huge mess a lot of network traffic
keeping all these caches in sync it was
a total mess and so eventually we would
switch the memcache but that was not
before we rewrote our database shortly
after we switched to a couple machines
in a couple databases we added comments
and the first version of comments it was
just another database table there's
nothing complicated about it it had a
link ID of what link it was on and it
had you know some contents author ID
some kind of guest the columns that
would have and we still did lots of
joins it was relational database we
changed around this time to a more
flexible database architecture or at
least a more flexible table design
because the challenge we had was every
time we added a new feature you might
have to add a new table or we might add
a new column to one of these tables
adding the column would take time and
two we might have to do with data
migration or update an index and then
add all this load it was just a total
pain we felt like the rate at which we
could add features was limited by our
ability to update our database and to do
these big migrations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
