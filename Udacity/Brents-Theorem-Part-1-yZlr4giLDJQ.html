something about the minimum possible
time but I want you to ask yourself a
more interesting question is there an
upper bound on the time to execute the
dag the answer is yes according to a
theorem by Richard Brent now I love
Brent's result I think it's really cool
and really elegant personally I think
you can get a lot of insight into
parallel algorithms by read arriving it
and you can do so without a lot of work
now having said that or a bunch of steps
involved so I'm going to break this
derivation into two parts and we'll have
a small quiz in between so we have a dag
with a certain amount of work and a
particular span just as a reminder our
goal is to estimate an upper bound on
its execution time now suppose I give
you a peer am with P processors and
let's say you run the dag now let's
imagine we're doing some forensic
analysis and we go back and we look at
the execution of the dag on the P Ram
let's break up that execution into
phases where each phase satisfies three
conditions the first condition is that
each phase has exactly one critical path
vertex
note that this condition immediately
implies that there have to be d of n
phases so let's say I've numbered the
critical path vertices from 1 to D of n
then this condition implies that there
will be d of n phases so here's a
cartoon of what the phases might look
like
now since the critical path vertices are
numbered and there's one critical path
vertex per phase then I can number the
phases by the critical path vertex
number so for example here's critical
path vertex 2 so I'll call this phase
phase 2 ok that's the first condition
what about the second the second
condition is that all non-critical path
vertices within a phase are independent
let me show you what I mean let's take
any phase with its single critical path
vertex like this one now consider any
non-critical path vertices that have
been assigned to this phase these
vertices can only have edges that enter
the phase or exit the phase but they can
never depend on
another so for example this is okay but
a dependence like this would not be
allowed now this condition is always
possible to satisfy and a good exercise
is to see if you can figure out why as a
hint
just think about pads and the fact that
the critical path vertex lies on the
longest path now there's a third
condition which is that every vertex has
to be in some phase and furthermore it
should only be in one phase so suppose
this is our dag and let's say we've
divided it in two phases now every phase
K will have some number of vertices
associated with it let's say that number
is W K and this value W K will include
the critical path vertex so by this
third condition which says that every
vertex has to appear in exactly one
phase what does that imply it basically
tells us if I add up the w KS across all
the phases then I should get the total
number of vertices that is the sum of W
K for K goes from 1 to D should be W
okay here's a question for you how long
will it take to execute phase k let's
call that time TK now if I have wk units
of independent work which I get from
condition 2 then that tells me that the
total time to execute phase K should be
ceiling of W K divided by P and that in
turn implies that if I sum over all
phases then the total time is just the
sum of these TK's so plugging in TK we
get this summation okay I know you're
thinking this seems really unhelpful are
we any closer to achieving our goal
mathematically these ceilings are really
ugly and can we make them go away</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
