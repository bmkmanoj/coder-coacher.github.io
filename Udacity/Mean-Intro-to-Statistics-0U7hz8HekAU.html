to program what you just learned in the
previous units and to me this is an
enormous amount of fun it's challenging
especially if you don't have programming
experience but it's also the moment
where you can really exercise and deeply
understand some of the very basic
concepts we talked about before and of
course these concepts run particularly
hard really important this is optional
this is not required for completing the
class is V just a fun exercise so feel
free to go to the next unit if you don't
want a program so in the first exercise
we will calculate the mean of data so we
define what the mean means dispensed
define mean and mean is compute of
something so it's computed of data and
there's this funny notion of a return
where you put the mathematical
expression for the mean so when you want
to print say the mean of this specific
data set here let's call this data 1 you
would say print mean of data 1 now this
is a little bit more complicated than
the kind of structures visit before I'm
actually defining what's called a
function and the reason why I do this is
that allows us to test your function
with different data examples to make
sure it's really correct but the key
thing is you have to return the correct
thing over here and then give you a hint
in Python there are special commands but
it's called some some apply to a list
like this one over here gives you the
sum of all the elements so this case sum
of data should give you the sum of those
numbers over here which will be 2 if you
add them all up get a convenient
function that there is part of the
program system of Python that you should
just know it exists is called Len short
for length how long is this thing this
thing here is 5 elements 1 2 3 4 5 so
that'll give you 5 so let's dive in
here's our programming environment with
a data sequence and I'm setting up the
mean function right over here you are to
return something this is where you put
your code and then for testing I will
say let's run this function and print
out what it returns that
the syntax so let me give an example
suppose you put a fixed value over here
like 12 in this case and now you hit the
Run button then the output would be 12
which is not the correct answer but you
can play with that if you say return
some of data which is the command I've
just given you and hit the Run button
then for this specific data sequence you
get 816 point 0 as the answer now the
job is yours to plug in the right answer
over here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
