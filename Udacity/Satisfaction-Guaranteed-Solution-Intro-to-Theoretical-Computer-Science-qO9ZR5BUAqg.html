series of snapshots from a
non-deterministic Ram solving sadness
formula well a non-deterministic Ram can
solve sat in polynomial time so we can
check those in polynomial time as well
since we just have a list of these so
once we have those we can definitely
verify that his formula is satisfiable
now if we have a list of satisfiable
clauses this actually isn't enough to
verify that Bob's formula is also
satisfiable to see this let's take a
look at the formula in somewhat pythonic
form X and not X now clearly X is a
satisfiable clause and so is not X but
the entire boolean formula is definitely
not satisfiable so a list of satisfiable
clauses actually isn't enough for us to
believe Bob now if we had a satisfying
assignment for all of the variables in
the formula then sure we can just plug
them into the formula and check on a
deterministic Ram and that occurs in
polynomial time similarly if we had all
calls to if better on the boolean
formula well if better is the only
difference between a non-deterministic
and a deterministic Ram so if we had all
the calls diff better we wouldn't
actually have to simulate if better we
would know what the algorithm did at
each step of the process so we could
also check Bob's formula using just this
not even a complete series of snapshots
is necessary just the calls diff better
now let's say we had a satisfying
assignment for ninety percent of the
variables well nine percent of the
variables still leaves ten percent and
ten percent of exponential is well
exponential so we would still have
exponentially many variables to check so
this actually doesn't work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
