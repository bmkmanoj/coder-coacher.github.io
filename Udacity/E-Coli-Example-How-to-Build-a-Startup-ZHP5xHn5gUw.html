multi-sided market just two sides there
were users and there were payers but can
the canvas actually work with something
more complicated like in a life sciences
so here's an example of a business model
canvas from a life sciences company that
was going to provide eco i cell lines
first simplified downstream processing
and they said oh our customer segment is
segmented in niche marketing now in
hindsight after the end of the class
they were the ones who actually went in
and said well yeah that was kind of a
definition of what a customer segment
was but they didn't really describe who
and their value proposition as even they
realized later was pretty unclear and
their channels when they said web sales
and trade shows and direct sales you
know in hindsight looked pretty
unrealistic and for partners they just
said well you know when we look at it
now it really kind of looks like a
random list of hopefuls so let's see how
they got from something that started
over here which you shouldn't laugh
because your first canvass might look
like this and what happened after they
got out of the building and so now you
could see instead of segmented a niche
market only they started to understand
oh maybe the market is somebody in
something specific by a farmer
biotechnology or food it's still kind of
vague but they're getting a little
better and then they're still little
vague on their feature set and gains and
pains and value proposition they're
getting a little more refined about
partners and then as they went down they
kind of understood oh we understand what
a value proposition is it's not like
what our technology is its what gain and
pain we providing so simplify protein
purification increase yield increase
throughput decrease cost now we're
making a lot more sense and now if you
look at customer segments oh now they're
actually getting down to very specific
groups not yet the people in them but
they're now actually going oh these are
the people we should be talking to and
our partners are now also getting
specific and they're getting some very
interesting traction on what potential
revenue streams were and if we
look at their next Rev the things in red
are the changes so now they're looking
at industrial enzyme manufacturers and
their key activities are Rd and
production support is their next change
and then finally they now kind of verify
it yep
these look like our customer segments
here's our customer relationships more
than what likely will make money from
royalties and commercial licensing etc
and so you can see multiple customer
segments multiple value props multiple
revenue streams this is a somewhat
complex multi-sided market just by the
way as a note some of the most complex
are actually in the medical device
business where you have users and payers
and hospitals and insurance companies
and regulators etc and each one needs a
value proposition each one needs to you
need to understand the revenue model and
so some business model canvases can be
quite complex now what's interesting by
the way about this life sciences company
is here's something that you would think
who could I call I'm just a scientist I
mean you might be an entrepreneur
building an iOS app and at least you
could ask your friends who do you ask
about you know e coli based purification
platforms well basically they decided to
go through the rolodex of all the trade
shows and all the conferences and all
the people they've met in their careers
and instead of physically driving out to
them they use Skype and they used phone
calls and they started a cold calling
strategy which set a stage for a
conversation and they had two or three
of their team on the call so they would
send the message to contact they'd set
an appointment they send out a short
summary electronically they've have a
conversation and follow-up and they also
use survey tools they use LinkedIn and
Survey Monkey but when we were counting
how many contacts they made we didn't
actually count them in their progress</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
