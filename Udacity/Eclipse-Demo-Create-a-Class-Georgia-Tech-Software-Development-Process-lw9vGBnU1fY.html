under the hood and as I said don't worry
about it if you don't care about that
part now we can go back to a clip set
and we can start creating a package a
package is basically a way of organizing
your classes into a hierarchy in this
case I'm gonna specify the package name
as edu dog attack which means that I'm
creating really two packages a package
Gattaca inside package edu and I can
start creating classes inside my
packages so here I can use the
contextual menu select new class and
I'll get another wizard that will allow
me to specify the name of the class and
not very creative here so I'm just gonna
call it hello world there's many other
parameters you can set and in particular
you can define whether you want a main
method in your class where having a main
method means that your class can be the
main class in your project can be the
one that is run when you run your
project after we click the button the
finish button we have we get the class
so we also get a template code for the
class as you can see here so we go to
the editor function you can see that
there's a to-do where you have to put
your code and here we are simply
basically printing you know the typical
first program we're just gonna print the
HelloWorld in Java and something you can
notice that as we are taping a Eclipse
gives us autocomplete suggestions which
is very helpful for example in case you
don't remember the exact syntax of a
method or you don't remember the
parameters of the method which is you
know often the case especially where you
work at with large libraries so having
that feature can really really help you
so now if we want to run our code we can
either click on the button up here or we
can right-click in the code window and
select run as java application and if we
do that Eclipse will run our tool and it
will create as you can see here a
console view that basically contains the
textual output of my program and as
expected the output is HelloWorld</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
