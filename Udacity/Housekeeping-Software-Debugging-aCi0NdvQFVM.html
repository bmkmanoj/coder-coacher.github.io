more and more problem reports over time
you want to do some housekeeping because
as these databases Philip there's a
number of issues that pile up just as
well the first one is duplicate if you
have one user who is reporting a problem
chances are that other users will be
reporting just the same problem that is
you have multiple problem reports that
all relate to the same class of failures
these problem reports are called
duplicates as a manager your task is to
identify such duplicates and you want to
do so in order to avoid them cluttering
the statistics but you also want the
duplicates to refer to each other this
way when you come across a problem
report you will find a this is a
duplicate of this original bug report
and all of these others are also
duplicates you like to keep the
duplicates though in your problem
database because all of these may report
on different angles of the problem and
these angles may all be helpful for
resolving the problem note that
automatic diagnosis mechanisms such as
the testicle debugging or Delta
debugging are great tools for
identifying duplicates because they find
commonalities between all the individual
bug reports with respect to similar
features in the input or in the
execution next up is obsolete problems
over time your database will fill up
with unresolved problem reports problems
that could not be reproduced or problems
that may have been fixing some later
version and low priority problems having
thousands of unresolved problems with
drag developers down the clutter up
searches in the database and they're bad
for the morale a problem database that
has plenty of obsolete problem is like
an overflowing drawer of socks you don't
find the socks you need and the drawer
makes you feel guilty for not throwing
away your old socks what you should do
is over time simply declare problem
reports obsolete and thus get rid
sucks you don't want anymore when is a
problem of solid a problem is obsolete
if it will never be fixed for instance
because the program is no longer
supported or the problem is old and
occurred only once or the problem is old
and occurred only internally you don't
want to actually delete these problems
but you can tag them with an appropriate
resolution in bugzilla for instance
there's a special won't fix resolution
for such obsolete problems family
problems are not only stored in the
problem database but that may also be
test cases which reproduce the exact
problem as a rule of thumb as soon as
you do have a test case that reproduces
the problem the test case makes the
problem report obsolete that is as soon
as you have a test case you can actually
put a special flag on the problem
database that the problem is now being
addressed by the test</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
