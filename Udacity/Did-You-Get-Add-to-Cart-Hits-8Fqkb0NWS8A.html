conversions ecommerce overview so far
nobody's actually bought anything in my
app so i have no revenue let's look at
shopping behavior shopping analysis
shopping behavior okay that looks a bit
more colorful i had some sessions where
some users who actually all me at this
stage viewed some products and then
there was another session where a user
added the product to the cart but i
still haven't implemented the checkout
code so no checkouts which is confirmed
if i look at the checkout behavior page
nobody's started check out let's look at
product performance i see the product
dinner listed but it hasn't brought any
money in yet this report includes
products that got as far as at least
being added to the cart if I drill down
into the product I see a list of the SK
use which is the same as a product IDs
for the products that were involved in
the shopping process if i set the
secondary dimension to ecommerce product
variant I can see the names of the
dinners as well as a dinner ID and feel
free to explore what other secondary
dimensions you can view</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
