companies and in the world I'm with Tim
Braun the CEO of IDEO
and Tim is written in this very
interesting book change by design which
cludes among other things a big section
on the importance of design thinking so
tim design thinking one of the points
you argue is that it doesn't just make
you a better designer it makes you
better at anything tell us about that
I've always thought is the one of the
wonderful things about being is being a
designer is not just that I get to lots
to work on lots of exciting projects but
it helps me in my life right so I and
when I when it's something as simple as
I'm going to throw a bit a dinner party
for some friends so I start instead of
just turning up at you know seven
o'clock and thinking about what I'm
going to make hayashi design that I try
and design that experience I think well
Who am I going to bring together and
what's the space going to be like and
how does the food and the space work
together all of these things that I
naturally think about as a designer and
and I think that's what design thinking
does for you it's a set of tools that
allows you to approach life particularly
the parts of life where it might be
advantageous to solve a problem
differently and allows you to approach
that with some level of kind of
confidence because you've got some ways
of going about it
and we have many we're taught at school
many ways of analyzing problems of put
picking them apart and studying little
pieces of them that's very valuable but
but Design Thinking gives you a
different way of tackling a problem
often often ones that centred around the
needs of the people you're trying to
solve for that might be yourself it
might be a customer in if you're in a
professional environment it might be
your colleagues in a in a work work
environment but it's centered around
that and so it starts with thinking hard
looking hard listening hard and trying
to study people and understand in this
instance what their issues might be what
the problems might be how they're
thinking how they how they're how
they're navigating the world or dealing
with the world at hand and then using
that as the starting point for having
ideas I actually I often describe it
don't solve the problem in fact as the
consultant never solved the problem
you're given but
what the real problem is if figure out
what the question is I mean it many of
us think we talk about when people talk
about creativity or design they think
it's all about solving the problem and
being creative about that but I find
generally the most interesting solutions
come out of the most interesting
questions and and so that insight about
what the problem might really be is
often the most important than the
biggest creative step and so if you just
assume you know the question then
especially if it's a good same question
everybody else's are asking then you'll
probably get to the same answer that
everybody is getting to but if you study
a little bit and think a little bit and
maybe look at it look at the look at
things from a slightly different
perspective really get under the skin of
the people you're trying to serve it's
surprising how often you end up
completely reframing the question and so
as you point out this could be used by
anybody a business person and artist
journalists yeah I mean you can think
about how you use it I mean one of these
I talked about it in my book is is ways
of applying design thinking to your own
life I mean think about your career how
can I apply a design thinking approach
to my career to the choices I make or or
absolutely how you applied in your in
your work place no matter what you do
you might you might work in the finance
department of a company and be thinking
well how could I be find more creative
solutions to the way that we the
processes that work within our
organization or the way that we come
together as as people and so I think
whatever your background if you have the
the tools two hands for thinking tools
two hand and the confidence to use them
that the design can be a great help
