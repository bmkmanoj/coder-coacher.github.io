actually yes remember we only have three
types of HTML elements the word element
which we just saw how to handle we call
graphics word the tag element which we
also saw how to handle we check to make
sure the tags match we call graphics
begin tag and graphics end tag and the
javascript element now this is super
tough but it's not really HTML proper
here's what we're going to do step 1
will interpret the JavaScript until we
get a string step two which is call
graphics dot word on that string
whatever they want us to print out we
will so now we just need to know how to
interpret JavaScript and then we'll be
done with our web browser however
javascript is semantically richer than
HTML which means it will be harder to
interpret for example javascript has
arithmetic and HTML rarely has
arithmetic JavaScript also has variables
HTML rarely has variables we're going to
have to deal with all of these things
but we have to start somewhere so let's
just start with arithmetic suppose our
input is 1 x 2 + 3 x 4 will be given a
parse tree that looks mostly like this
but with some extra decorations remember
that our parse trees actually more look
more like this for the leaves they're
all tuples but I'm abstracting away the
tuple stuff just to show you the shape
of it what we're going to do is just
write a procedure again called interpret
or JavaScript interpret that walks down
the tree and computes values returns
them back up how do I figure out what
this plus means while i'm going to call
myself recursively how do i figure out
what this x means well it's a binary
operator so i'm going to figure out my
left child that's one figure out my
right child that's too so one times two
is two so i'll just bring that up pass
that up to my parent now i'll call
myself recursively over here how do i
figure out this x well this is a three
and that's a four so together they make
12 so this whole thing is 14 so our
order was down this way down that way
back up down this way all the way back
up that's how we're going to figure out
javascript arithmetic interpreting
complicated languages in computer
science is often called if
valuation which is abbreviated to eval
in many instances so we're going to
write in a vowel procedure for
arithmetic expressions like this it will
therefore be called evaluate expression</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
