up in situations where we've had to
pivot and it's mostly based on the
assumption that we had or the theory
that we return a test just didn't work
out for whatever reason or or partner
had a different opinion so in one of my
tech startups we did a technical demo
that failed and so we pivoted into a new
technical direction based on the
technology we had which also didn't work
out the way we had anticipated so we
pivoted again and ended up acquiring a
small company in business and trying to
work that into our core business which
turned out not to be lucrative so that
change the conditions upon which we were
operating our business so we pivoted
again into a completely different
category of technology business while
still trying to leverage that initial
seed of technology that we had this was
just you know the perception for me was
we were running amok we were just like
wildly thrashing around and it wasn't
acceptable so at that point I step back
personally and just serve it took stock
of what we had and what I believed in at
that point went back to my core values
and went back to our first idea and
decided on a real implementation of that
and that actually gave the company the
engineering direction it needed to
launch a product it only took six years</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
