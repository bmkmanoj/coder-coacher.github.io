standard deviation by lowercase s when
we have a sample this is what we use to
approximate the true population standard
deviation Sigma we call this the sample
standard deviation but don't get
confused with the actual standard
deviation of a small data set for
example let's say we have this data set
where N equals 5 to find the standard
deviation of this we would find the mean
which is 3 take each squared deviation
from the mean add up the squared
deviations which is also called the sum
of squares and divide by 5 or n that's
the standard deviation of these five
values but if we're using this to
approximate a larger population that
this sample came from then we would
divide by n minus 1 so then this would
be 4 in the denominator if we're trying
to estimate the standard deviation of
the population so don't get confused
between these two but it is kind of
confusing because this when we use this
formula with n minus 1 in the
denominator is called the sample
standard deviation and it's denoted by
lowercase s so just remember if you're
given a sample and you need to estimate
the population standard deviation you
use this formula with n minus 1 in the
denominator
making the whole standard deviation
slightly bigger that's a better estimate
then of the true population standard
deviation Sigma but if you have a data
set and you need to find the standard
deviation of that data set not
approximate a population standard
deviation then you divide by n</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
