a billing account there are a number of
steps that you need to go through the
first is to name the account and then
later on when you're creating your
project you'll pick the billing account
based on its name then you have to
specify the country for the account and
where the account resides payor details
are going to be linked to this country
so be sure to pick the right one then
you just pick the account type you might
be paying as a business or you might be
paying as an individual you just pick
which one next comes to payer details
and that's just the name and address of
the payer and then finally there's the
payment type and this is going to be a
credit card or bank details and
depending on which one you pick you have
to configure it it's as simple as that
once you've filled out this form with
all of these details and submit it it'll
take a few moments but then billing will
be available and you'll be able to
create a project and select the billing
profile that you've just set up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
