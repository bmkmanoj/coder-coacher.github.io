cover then apply pre-processing using
the rule that we just discovered which
means we then already know that this
vertex here must be put into the vertex
cover as well as this one here and this
one here and these all do not have to be
in the vertex cover and this of course
is dramatically effective in this case
here it's unfortunately not always the
case in practice but as you can see it
only leaves a very small part of the
network actually where we have to find
an assignment but the main point is that
we now put this into a search tree to
find the best possible vertex cover for
those vertices where we have not yet
found an assignment and on my point is
this the search tree that we had so far
was as follows we started out by looking
at an uncovered edge and then we
branched into three possibilities so we
either put exactly one of the vertices
into the vertex cover or both and now
comes the cool part if we have applied
pre-processing then we can redesign our
search tree because what this
pre-processing step means basically is
that we have eliminated or we have
already assigned all vertices that have
just a single neighbor so now that we
have applied pre-processing we know a
little bit more about these vertices
here because we know that this vertex
here will have at least one more
neighbor because otherwise we would have
already found it in the pre-processing
and this one here will also have another
neighbor so there can be more same thing
here so what we can now do is we can do
a more sophisticated search tree and
that sophisticated search tree is going
to be based on this part here these
three vertices you can do more
sophisticated search trees but I just
want to show you the basic principle
