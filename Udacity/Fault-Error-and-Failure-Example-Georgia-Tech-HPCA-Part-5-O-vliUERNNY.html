with folds errors and failures let's
look at an example things always start
with a fault and our fault example is a
programming mistake and let's say that
programming mistake is an ad function
that we wrote for our program it works
just fine in all cases except when we
give it to add five and three in which
case it returns seven instead of eight
this type of fault we also call a latent
error it's not really an error until we
do something like this but this type of
a fault we call latent error because
it's only a matter of time when it's
going to be activated so when we
actually execute five plus three and get
seven in some register we now have an
error if the error is a result of some
sort of a latent error like this
basically programming error we say that
the fault has been activated or that we
now have an effective error as opposed
to a latent one in our case we get the
effective error once we call the add
function with five and three and get
seven instead of eight and then we put
that value in some variable we get the
failure when the system deviates from
specified behavior for example in this
case it might be that the time we were
computing is the time to schedule a
meeting for and now we schedule a
meeting for seven instead of eight as
expected and this is basically the
failure of the system because it didn't
effectively schedule the meeting for
when it was supposed to it is important
to note here that you need a fault of
some sort in order to get an error but
not every fault becomes an error for the
fault of this type for example to become
an error it needs to be activated
we need to actually use the function in
a way that makes it produce incorrect
results even though it always had a
fault it always was Fault in this way
similarly we can have an error and never
get a failure for example here if this
value seven was never used and programs
often do this then we have an error a
variable has the wrong value but we
don't get a failure
as a result another example here would
be something like if we check for
example whether this function returns
something larger than zero then when it
returns seven instead of eight and we
store that in a register compare it to
zero see that it's still larger than
zero now we got an affective error
because a register held the wrong value
but the only thing we did with this
value still cause the program to
function normally
so in this case we have an error but we
don't have a failure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
