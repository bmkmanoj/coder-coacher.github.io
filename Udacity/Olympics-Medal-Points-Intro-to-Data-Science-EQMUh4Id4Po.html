solution here we're going to start with
our Olympic medal counts DF data frame
as we have in the previous exercises
first we're going to create a new
smaller data frame called medal counts
which is the Olympic medal counts DF
data frame but only the gold silver and
bronze columns then we're going to use
the numpad function to matrix multiply
this medal counts matrix with the four
to one array which represents the number
of points that each country would score
for a gold silver or bronze medal so
what we're going to get here is an array
where the value is four times the number
of gold medals plus two times the number
of silver medals plus one times the
number of bronze medals down here I'm
going to define this Python dictionary
called Olympic points where again I
provide us the keys the column names and
as the value is panda series where I
provide as the argument first the list
of country names and here this array
points which again has the total number
of points that each country earned
finally I'm just going to say Olympic
points DF is data frame of Olympic
points this is just the tip of the
iceberg when it comes to pandas and num
PI's functionality if you're interested
to read more about what these libraries
can do I encourage you to check out the
full documentation which are found in
the URLs in the instructor comments
