inches squared this is our correct
answer fantastic thinking if you got
there now I know we haven't seen a
problem like this one yet or that
involves the square of a quantity so
don't worry if you struggled let's see
how we can do it because the area varies
directly we want to make sure that we
list the first quantities across from
one another and notice too that the area
doesn't just very directly with the
radius it varies directly with the
square of the radius so we have to
square the first radius and then for our
second area it will also vary directly
with the square of its radius now that
we have a proportion set up let's fill
in each of the numbers into the
appropriate place this would be our
first area and this would be the radius
that goes with it so we want to put 28
and 278 thousands here and three here
next we have the second radius which we
know is four and one tenth so that will
go here and then we use X for the area
of two that's the area we're looking for
in our question first I'm going to
square each of these numbers to get this
fraction next we cross multiply to get
this equation and finally we divide both
sides by 9 to get our final answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
