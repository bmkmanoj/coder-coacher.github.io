validate by applying the model to the
validation set and observing the
accuracy in all tracks we'll use the
model comparison tool as we did for all
the other models up to this point so we
already have this model built out so we
should do is bring in that model
comparison tool the model object from
the busa model goes into this model
comparison tool and the input and the
validation data set goes into the d
input for the model comparison tool i'm
now going to bring on a browse tool
after this our output and run this
comparison so let's open up these
results now the first thing like we saw
with all the other models I'm going to
look at the accuracy and it looks like
this boosted model predicting the mode
of transportation for employees was
eighty-three percent accurate in
predicting the validation or that
independent data set what I also see is
that it was very good at predicting the
car individuals but not very good at
predicting the people who rode their
bikes or took public transportation to
work we can see the breakdown and not
the percentages but the actual values of
where things were misclassified over in
the confusion matrix it seems to me that
people who are in correctly predicted
fell typically in the car bucket this is
typically happens when we have one
category that is much more dominant than
other categories but overall looking at
this model comparison reports it seems
like we have again a pretty strong model
it has an overall accuracy of 83 15 with
very strong actressy measures in
predicting the car while on the other
side predicting if employees take public
transportation or write their bike to
work was actually a real challenge so
very similar results that we've seen
before in the previous two models this
is overall definitely a strong model but
I'd like to do some comparison side by
side against the other models to
determine which one we should use in
production</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
