equals five but this is not actually an
equation so I'm going to check it off
the reason this is not an equation is
that the quantity is on either side of
the equal sign are not actually equal to
one another you know that two plus two
equals four and we know that four is not
equal to five so this is not a true
equation we can do the same check on
this equation right here once again
since two plus two equals four that
means we have 4 equals four which is an
equation so we won't check this answer
choice n plus two equals n plus three is
a little bit trickier now what is the
problem here I'll go ahead and tell you
that this is an answer that you should
have selected the issue is that no
matter what value you substitute in for
n the two sides this equation will never
be equal to one another the right-hand
side that says n plus 3 will always be
one larger than the left-hand side so
for example if we let n equal 0 we have
0 plus 2 equals 0 plus 3 which leaves us
with two equals three and that is not
true a similar thing will happen no
matter what number you plug infrared the
same thing is not true of this equation
1 plus n plus 1 equals n plus 2 in fact
the opposite is true no matter what
value we substitute in for n here this
equation will always be true this is a
special kind of equation that we'll talk
about in just a second</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
