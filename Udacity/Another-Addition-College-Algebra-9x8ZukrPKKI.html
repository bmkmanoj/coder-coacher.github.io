we're trying to add together now this
may sound silly but if we're adding one
quantity to another we're actually
adding positive 1 times this quantity
anything let's say some number a times 1
is just equal to itself so a times 1 is
a and 5 times 1 is 5 and 4 x squared
times 1 is just 4x squared and negative
2x times 1 is just negative 2x so having
the parentheses here with a plus sign in
front of them doesn't change the value
or the sign of any of the terms inside
the second set of parentheses so we can
just write it but without the
parentheses there's also nothing
happening to the first set of
parentheses at least not yet so we can
just rewrite it without the parentheses
as well and now we have a thing that we
have a ton of practice with dealing with
we just need to rearrange our terms and
simplify once we've rearranged we
combine our now adjacent like terms so
4x squared term we have 11 x squared and
now in dealing with the X to the first
terms positive 2 minus 2 is just 0 so
these cancel each other out and we don't
have any term in the final answer with
an X to the first in it then we just
have 1 plus 4 so our final answer is 11
x squared plus 5 I just love doing these
problems so much because you start out
with something that's so complicated and
messy looking and you end up with a
really really beautiful simple answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
