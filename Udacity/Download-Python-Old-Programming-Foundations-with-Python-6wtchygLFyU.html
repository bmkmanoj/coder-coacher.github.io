glanced at the duration of this video
and are thinking this is way too long
don't worry you don't have to watch the
entire thing what we are going to do in
this video is work together to download
Python now downloading a computer
language can sometimes be a frustrating
process so what I'm going to do is go
slow and identify all of the steps in
detail by the way if you already have
Python feel free to skip this video and
move on to the next lesson also if you
prefer to read the instructions on how
to download Python there are a few
helpful documents in the instructor
notes section those documents will walk
you through the exact same process that
we are following in this video okay now
I'm going to start the download process
on a Windows machine if you're on a Mac
click here to jump ahead in the video
okay so here I am on a Windows machine
where I will Google download Python the
first result looks good to me you will
notice that python has two main versions
we will use version 2.7 in this course
by the way the link to this page is also
available in the instructor notes now
this page may look slightly different
than the one you have open on your
computer that's okay I want you to find
the features that are similar between
this page and the one that you may have
open on your computer if you scroll down
on this page you will notice that there
are a bunch of links
now the first link here will help us
download Python on windows notice that
depending on your internet speed this
download may take a while once the file
has downloaded I can click to run it
this will launch a wizard which I will
go through I will choose the default
Python directory under the C Drive and
then I will continue to hit next a few
times and boom very quickly the
installation will be done now to test if
Python installed correctly I can go to
the Start menu hit all programs find
Python 2.7 which is what we just
installed and launch idle idle is the
place where we can write Python programs
so let's write a few programs an idle
like 2+2 that seemed to work
and print a Python all right
congratulations you can skip the rest of
this video and move on to the next
lesson now okay so here I'm on a Mac now
the first thing I will do is figure out
the version of my Mac it seems mine is
10.7 yours may be different next I will
Google download Python the first result
here seems good to me you will notice
that python has two main versions we
will use version 2.7 in this course by
the way the link to this page is also
available in the instructor notes now
this page may look slightly different
than the one you have open on your
computer that's okay I want you to find
features that are similar between this
page and the one you may have open on
your computer now if you scroll down on
this page you will notice a bunch of
links the first few download links are
for Windows so we can safely ignore them
the next two links are for Mac the first
of those links is for Mac 10.6 or later
now since my Mac was 10.7 this is the
right link for me if you have a version
of Mac that came before 10.6 you should
use the other link so I will click to
download Python note that depending on
your internet speed this download may
take a while once python has downloaded
I will run the downloaded file I will
click on this Python file while holding
down the control key and then click open
this will start the wizard here I can
hit continue a few times to install
Python and boom the installation is done
now to test if Python was installed
correctly
I will go to spotlight and then type
idle idle is the place where we can
write Python programs here I will hit
enter to get the Python prompt and then
write a few really quick programs like
2+2 that seemed to work and print gay
Python alright congratulations you are
now ready to move on to the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
