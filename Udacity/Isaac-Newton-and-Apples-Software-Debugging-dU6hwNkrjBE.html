let's look into how to systematically
find their causes what we need is a way
to organize the debugging process and
for this we use a process called the
scientific method that's a cool name
isn't it it's actually a big name for a
little thing but this little thing again
has big consequences what the scientific
method does is it provides a systematic
process by turning some aspect of
reality into a theory that explains how
this aspect of reality works and that
makes X Act predictions on this reality
let me come up with a simple example of
how the scientific method works suppose
you're a human say I second you laying
in your orchard and all of a sudden
you're watching an Apple fall down so
now you wonder well I've just seen this
Apple falling this is an aspect of
reality why do apples fall down what the
scientific method does is it provides
your way to come up with the most
general prediction method available so
you could think that if an Apple falls
and you can repeat this experiment over
and over by letting an Apple fall you
may also think about well do bricks fall
here's a brick and lo and behold it
falls do plates fall oh yes they do do
cups fall down too oh yes they do put
yourself in the mind of a three-year-old
and you will find that everything falls
down and everything really means
everything so it can easily generalize
that sooo everything falls down unless
you happen to see say a balloon here's
the balloon and lo and behold the
balloon goes up so not everything falls
down but you can easily extend your
theory to say well a balloon is lighter
than air if the Air falls down then the
balloon must go up so still everything
falls down what is down actually mean
down means towards the center of the
earth everything is attracted towards
the center of the earth well the sun is
not attracted to the center of the earth
it's rather the other way around so you
see that from these observations and
even experiments that you can conduct
you will eventually be able to come up
with a full-fledged theory that explains
where things will be moving
that explains a twitch velocity they
will be moving which explains what the
acceleration will be and this in the
case of Isaac Newton then became the
theory of gravitation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
