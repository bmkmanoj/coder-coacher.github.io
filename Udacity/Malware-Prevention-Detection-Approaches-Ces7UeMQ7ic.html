the first is prevention for example we
can limit the content of a computer to
the untrusted outside world meaning that
it would not accept documents or
programs or any active contents from
other computers and of course this will
impose major inconvenience to the
computer user the second approach is
detection this means that we use a
monitor to watch out for telltale signs
of malware infection the third approach
is removal meaning that once we detect
that there's malware infection we will
remove the malware and perhaps we should
also patch the system given that
prevention severely hampers productivity
detection is really the main
countermeasure that we can use and there
are four generations of antivirus
software or malware detection software
the first is malware scanners these
scanners used signatures or patterns of
non viruses to scan Program Files to
find matches and if there's a match that
means that this program file has been
infected by a known virus what are the
examples of Simek choice of viruses a
signature of a virus is typically the
unique sequence of instructions of the
virus code or the unique infection
marker that the virus would use these
simple scanners are not effective
against polymorphic viruses and the
reason is that for polymorphic virus
each instance is encrypted where
randomly generated key such that there's
no unique signature across all instances
of the same virus the second is the
heuristic scanners they're based on
possible effects of infection for
example if a program file has been
infected with the virus code the
checksum of the original file would have
changed because new content has been
added to the file however this approach
can be defeated if the malware
deliberately makes sure that the
checksum after infection remains the
same
for example the malware can include some
additional bytes at the end of the file
to make sure that the checksum remains
the same as the foul before its
infection
the third is activity traps these
detectors look for
or particular kind of activities that
malware would typically perform on a
system such as modifying the Windows
registry file or reading the password
file and sending it to the Internet and
so on these detectors are based on our
knowledge of malware activities
therefore these detectors are not
effective against malware that performs
new kinds of malicious activities the
fourth is the so called full feature
analysis which is the state-of-the-art
he typically involves multiple
approaches for example it typically
includes host based monitoring that in
turn includes activity traps and
scanners he also includes network based
monitors that analyze traffic to the
Internet for example if there's a
traffic that contains password file to
internet server that can be a telltale
sign that a malware has infected an host
and is attempting to steal the password
file similarly if there's a connection
to a website that's well known for
malware download that's also telltale
sign that the end host has been infected
and the malware on the host is
attempting to download an update and he
can also include a sandboxing based
analysis approach a sandbox is typically
used to run a piece of excludable for
example an attachment from an email to
see whether this executable would
exhibit any malicious activities by
executing this is curable in a sandbox
we can make sure that there's no
permanent damage to our system and
network and we can observe the behaviors
of the excludable from outside the
sandbox so that we can be certain
whether this executable is a malware or
not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
