developer here at Udacity and these are
my thoughts on crappy interviews so this
is kind of funny because interviews are
like a little bit the bane of my
existence I'm sort of like I've thought
about this story a little bit I'm
shaking right now just because I'm being
asked a question in my senior year you
know a lot of people were applying to go
work in big tech companies and I was
sort of thinking about it but I wasn't
quite sure what I wanted to do with the
rest of my life and sort of one of the
things in my mind was like well I have
this very clear path for what I can do
I'm gonna have this degree it could
probably get me into like a really nice
tech company and I could just keep doing
what I'm doing but at the time I was a
little bit you know just questioning if
that's what I wanted anyways I had T aid
for this professor who's actually a
leader in graphics
the field of graphics and had been a TA
from one of his larger classes and he
think this is what got me on sort of the
shortlist for a list of students that a
large tech company was particularly
trying to recruit so I you know got this
invite and I kind of like did it respond
for a while and I'm like oh whatever
free trip out to the west coast so I did
it I went there and I got put in it was
either my first or my second technical
interview and technical interviews are
super stressful if you don't like
partially just because they're so
exhausting they're like 10 hour ordeals
or at least this one was and you're
being bussed around and meeting all the
different teams and I remember early in
the morning of that interview talking to
a guy who's super friendly and I was
like having a good conversation with him
but we were talking about printer
drivers and in the back of my head while
I'm trying to answer questions who this
guy and thinking oh printer drivers like
the most boring thing I could ever think
of and I talked to some other people
during that interview experience there's
a part that I don't remember quite how I
flubbed it but
I was talking to the guy about like how
a webpage was put together with like how
it's actually parsed on a server and I
had act I had no idea how that was
actually done and you know he was
getting kind of frustrated with me or
whatever you know but I got fairly long
or far along in the process so you know
I just feel like you know pretty good at
myself I'm like I just leave you know
breezed through this interview yeah sure
I messed up some things with like a seed
graph and a web server or something but
it you know I'll be fine
and about a week later I got a phone
call you know saying which is probably
fairly obvious to you that I didn't get
the job and I was kidding it's kind of
sitting there and feeling really sorry
for myself but you know I I think the
thing that I got out of it and kind of
what I want to convey I guess to Udacity
students is that like I wasn't really
supposed to be at that interview I
wasn't actually like particularly like
that job wasn't something that I was
particularly interested in I didn't
really take ownership for the job
application process and later it's
actually what ended what I did end up
doing it was instead of going off and
working a big tech company I went into
the Peace Corps and I taught for two
years and after coming back on the Peace
Corps and a similar thicker it's like I
should apply to like these large tech
companies to do the whole interview
process but one of the things that I did
differently the second time around was
in a dusty Kenyan market I bought this
book called what color is your parachute
which is like a quintessential career
guidance book and one of the sort of
silly things that it made me do was walk
through a series of exercises to learn
about you know what actually is
important to you what you're interested
in more than just you know what your
skill set is or what you happen to get
your degree in and through doing that I
was like be a lot better able to
verbalize what I wanted and you know as
I was going through the job search I
didn't apply to a lot of jobs which you
know on paper looked kind of good you
know like if I got hired there it would
be a good thing to brag
my family and friends about or whatever
but you know these they weren't jobs I
was actually interested in and the first
job that I applied for was Udacity and I
read the Job Description I went this is
perfect this is awesome and this is
where I want to be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
