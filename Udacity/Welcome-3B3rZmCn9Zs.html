decisions but before we get started with
the class Sean Katie and I want to talk
to you a little bit about what our
expectations are for you and what you
should expect to learn in the class as
you know this is an online course and
online courses differ greatly from
in-class courses first you will not be
coming to a classroom two to three times
a week instead you'll be working from
home or wherever whether it's on a
mobile device a tablet or PC one thing
that you should notice is that this is a
self-paced course that means you are
responsible for deciding when and where
you complete the material because this
is online and this is self-paced a lot
of the responsibility falls on you you
need to find the motivation to come to
class and by class I mean going to the
online course every day it's important
that you distribute your learning over
time online courses it's it's easy to
fall away and forget about them because
you're not driving to a campus every day
so you have to remember to check in and
time manage in a way so that you're
learning a little bit about statistics
every day that'll make the learning
better and that'll make the course a lot
more enjoyable yes it is important for
you guys to take responsibility but the
main objective is for you guys to learn
and yes you're going to struggle
sometimes but that's the whole point at
Udacity we want to give you a quiz to
make you struggle first so that you form
your own ideas about this concept before
we start teaching you the formalized
statistical way of learning it I would
also encourage you to take advantage of
your classmates there's a lot of
knowledge out there and there's a lot of
knowledge about statistics already so
use each other</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
