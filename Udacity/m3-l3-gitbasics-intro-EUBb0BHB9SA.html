I'm finally done hey Walter salami
Beckett's for lunch oh is that your game
that you've been working on yeah let's
grab some lunch and I'll show you the
game afterwards
yeah I mean it doesn't pretend to be
anything but it's not it's salami on
baguette it's awesome that's amazing so
let me show you this game that I've been
working on I think you're going to like
it awesome wait hold on a second it's
crashing I promise you this was working
about 30 minutes ago doesn't even look
like any lines of co2 changed what well
that was a frustrating situation and
this was just a personal project but
imagine if this had happened while
working on important code at work
luckily these types of situations can be
easily avoided using something known as
version control in this lesson you'll
learn to use get a popular distributed
version control tool to track changes
and switch between different versions of
code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
