lid off you can see the inside of the
teapot what's odd here is that the
outside and inside surfaces have the
same lighting this is because the same
normals are used to calculate both the
inside and outside surfaces that is all
the normals point outwards regardless of
whether we're looking at the inside or
outside this is certainly not how the
real world works I call this the paper
lantern effect where the surface is
started like a paper lantern looking the
same on both sides however if you think
about it the shading here is really not
like anything in the real world for
example if we put a light inside this
Lantern all of the surfaces would be
dark this is because their normals all
point away from the light say we want to
fix this problem and have the surface be
double-sided which of the following
fixes will work first if the normal is
facing away from the light don't render
diffuse and specular render the model
twice once with back face going on once
with front face going on in flipping
each shade normal direction may can also
render a second set of triangles in the
same locations but with their normals
reversed
do not call put a second light opposite
the first light pointing in the opposite
direction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
