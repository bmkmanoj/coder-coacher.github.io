subtraction does exactly what you might
think all right now we're gonna assume
that the background will be modeled by
the last end frames but I'm not gonna
take the average I'm gonna take the
median value what's kind of nice about
that is now n can be kind of nice and
long let's suppose the average let's
suppose when I look at the the road
let's suppose it's value is 57 plus or
minus a little 5758 these two sakes 52
57 etcetera then comes along a white car
mmm and it's like got 100 1200 1984 fine
then comes along a black Porsche slowly
because he's being cool you know it's
three unit but if you take a look at all
those values the one that's gonna
dominate is gonna be the 57 to 56 etc so
when I do a median filter that's the one
that's going to get pulled out so now
your foreground mask is we just take the
current image and we subtract out the
median of the last end frames okay and
again threshold your in by the way now
is a little less sensitive I mean that's
to be big enough to captured there is as
you know those of you know about your
computing a running average is easy to
compute you just have to know how many
frames you've you've added into the
average so far in the previous average
and then it's 1 over n of the new one
plus and minus 1 over N of the old one a
median you actually have to keep them
and then resort them and that can be
expensive so unless you play some
interesting tricks median filtering can
be expensive but but it's it's not too
much of a problem alright when you apply
the median well turns out of use uses
short in it might not be quite so great
so for example here we have the
estimated background and you can see a
lot of stuff has gotten cleaned up but
because of the small end I still get
this problem in terms of where the van
is
and you're doing a better job getting
the van but you still get a little bit
of this stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
