originally from Germany as you can hear
and I'm emeritus professor here at
Stanford and also senior medical
director at 23andme so when people talk
about variation in the human genome we
oftentimes talk about single nucleotide
variants which will come to an latter
lessons for our course is that the main
kind of variation that exists in the
human genome are these single letter
differences or there are other kinds of
variation that are important too we have
identified about 15 million single
letter differences but so by sheer
number they are the most common but then
there are other variants they are called
copy number variations well who chunks
of the genome can be repeated and they
can be present in is a two or three or
many copies and there are differences
between human beings so some people have
two copies number five some may have 12
and if you look at the total number of
nucleotides involved in those then this
is more common so the individual copy
number variants or CNVs are fewer than
the ones we have identified for snv's
but if you look at the amount of genomic
sequence involved in this type of what's
called structural variation it involves
a larger part of the genome I see so
between single nucleotide variants and
copy number variation those are the two
main kinds or the two main forms of
variation in humans yeah then there are
others like inversions for certain
pieces of the genome can be turned
around in some people and not in others
and even translocations how viable or
translocations and do they get
propagated at all in a population over
time or most translocations enviable I
will find some in families you know
there are balanced translocation where a
piece of a chromosome is taken off and
hooked somewhere else or two pieces have
been exchanged and as long as they are
balanced meaning that the right number
of genes is there people are fine they
would know about it unless the break is
in a gene but that's pretty unusual
the break is most often in a repetitive
sequence but then when these people may
have children because of what happens in
meiosis that the chromosomes align and
cross over it's possible that a child
inherits a chromosome that only has an
extra copy and is then get the other one
that's missing something and you have an
unbalanced translocation and that can
cause very bad developmental defects
intellectuality fit deficits these are
the children who we see in the clinic
and we look at their chromosomes and
look at their parents and we see the
translocation has been passed on so
several generations already but
otherwise they don't blast in in
populations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
