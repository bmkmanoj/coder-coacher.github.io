call the display contact function and
append it to the footer although the
header already displays the same contact
say yeah the same contact information
yes you'll you'll probably need a
slightly different function just because
you're well or it could be this it
depends on how you define it but if you
if you write something that adds the
information in the same way just to a
different div then sure to give that a
shot reuse your code that's great it is
true that it's just repeating the same
information but that's just to sort of
remind you at the end you know oh by the
way here i am now that you finished
looking at my resume here's my contact
information again thanks a lot so
comment really from someone who says
believe it or not I actually really like
the colors on the resume as it is would
you recommend that I change it anyway um
know if you love it you don't have to
thank you for thank you for saying that
you like it I have to pass that on to
the designers so don't feel like you
have to have to change it but maybe for
practice you might you might do it with
data other function function declaration
we will switch over um do you still need
the bar other function statement or is
it okay is the data period other
function equal function statement
sufficient do you need VAR so when
you're adding a function to an existing
object so in this case we have data
which is our object and then we added
this function called other function to
data down here and we went through that
um you actually don't need bar in this
case because all we're doing is adding
something to something that exists and
because data had already existed we're
just adding to it and not creating a new
function um or a new variable or
anything like that and because of that
you actually don't need to use far um so
she's asking in project to do we have to
put all the info that is named role
education image in to resume builder J's
file does that mean that we do not do
any in line text in the HTML file
um so the HTML file is yeah I don't
think you have to inline anything in the
HTML file everything that you work on is
on the javascript file um so um I think
it's best practice to sort of just um do
all your processing and rendering the
data within JavaScript functions and
then calling those functions within your
history ml file yeah yeah everything all
the information about your resume or on
the bottom heavy food goes into your as
nibbled on GS plan Michelle process how
do you make a red light interactive when
they usually contains data game okay
yeah that's a great question so in our
instance we're actually adding the sort
of interactive component with map yeah
so it's going to be either a map of
where you either work you're gone to
school and it will be very similar to
like a Google map rete any sort of map
you see online now that will sort of be
the interactive element that we're
requiring but just sort of in general I
mean you can take a look at breath like
you know search for resumes online what
developers are going to any sort of web
developer website and resume is usually
on there and there's some interactive
elements sometimes it's just as simple
as like the menu the navigation menu bar
like moving in a certain way yeah or
disappearing as you scroll down the page
or it could be as like as crazy as
something like you know parts of the
resume come flying into the page or
there's a background photo and
background photo changes as you like
scroll through the resume it's not that
I've seen a lot of really interesting
and creative ones out there um there's
really no limit what you can do it's
kind of like you know being a heart
student you you're limited by how much
you're willing to put into the project a
lot of line of JavaScript code online
that I want to use can I copy it and use
it as long as I'm is that and can fully
explain it absolutely yeah i mean that's
ninety percent of what a lot of web
developers
do ideas they they go online they read
code they reuse code um gosh I don't
know where I would be if I didn't have
the internet I I will still be stuck
trying to learn CSS right now I how do I
you know flesh out a box like I live up
the book I'm like no it's like a lot of
people's this one good thing about love
development everything is open yeah like
you can look at you find cosine or you
trying something really cool look cool
function you just open up your coat and
see what did you do yeah now it's like
as long as you attribute that code make
making sure that ok i thought you know
just commented or i think i found this
little code here just a little snippet
you know this is what is like people
will be fine with that yeah that's
that's what i usually do too is when I
find you know a piece of code on line
and I'm like oh this pretty much knows
what I want to do and I don't want to
fight too much I always leave a little
comment and I you put the put the URL in
the comments I us site the person just
like you would if you were writing an
essay right yeah market you put it in
the footer and that way if I'm like
looking going back and looking through
my coat and I'm looking at like how did
I figure this out but if I get this from
you know it gives me a chance to go back
and look at oh yeah that's right this
person did this and on top of that it
also kind of gets me to kind of look at
the other things that maybe that person
was done to and it sort of opens my eyes
to some other ways of solving some
different problems I may not have
thought about so it's a great way I mean
looking for ways that people have done
certain things online is a great way to
learn an easy way to do this I mean it's
just to go to any website and if you see
something that is really fascinating
like like I said maybe there's like some
moving part and you're like oh how did
they do that you can usually you know go
look at the devtools the source code for
the page and kind of figure out with
what they did there and try to mimic
that on your site and it's a really fun
learning experience doing that the one
thing I will say though is if you do use
something make sure it it's
stylistically good like
it's under the style guide that we're
providing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
