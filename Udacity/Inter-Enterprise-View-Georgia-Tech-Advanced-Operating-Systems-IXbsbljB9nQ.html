services on the internet such as email
through google yahoo and perhaps
purchase things using ebay or make
orders for airline reservations and so
on and when we do that we think of an
enterprise that we are accessing from
our workstation or laptop or personal
mobile device we think of an enterprise
as a monolithic entity but in fact if we
look inside the enterprise the
enterprise the intra enterprise view is
pretty complicated there's a whole bunch
of services and servers that are
interconnected they may be marketing
division the sales division the
production division inventory division
the research division and so on all of
these constitute what and enterprises so
internally the view of the enterprise is
much more complex than what you see from
the outside coming in and using services
provided by a particular Enterprise
things get a lot more complicated in
this day and age because when we access
an enterprise in fact the enterprise's
may talk to one another and this is what
is usually called a supply chain model
and so on where the service that you are
a questing may not be serviced by a
single entity but may actually involve
the entity that you're contacting
contacting other entities in order to
put together a solution for your
particular request and what is even more
challenging is when enterprises merge
for instance if three companies merge
together and this happened a while back
there is a company called digital
equipment corporation that got borrowed
by compaq and those two merged and later
on HP borrowed compaq and so you can see
that when things like this happen the
inter enterprise view is much more
complex and now when companies merge
like this the idea of an enterprise the
idea of an enterprise becomes an amalgam
of three different entities coming
together in this example for instance so
the enterprise transformation challenges
are many interoperability
of the systems that constitute different
enterprises interface compatibility when
such merging happens system evolution
you know things are not stagnant now
this transformed enterprise has to
continuously evolve as well scalability
reliability and the cost of maintaining
a complex system like that all of these
things are the challenges that have to
be faced both internally and across
enterprises</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
