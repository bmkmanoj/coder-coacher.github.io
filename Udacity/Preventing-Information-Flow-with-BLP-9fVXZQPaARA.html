information flow and remember recall
that information flow is a problem that
cannot be addressed by discretionary
access control okay so we want to see
how mandatory access control Mac or
multi-level security in particular the
VLP model that we are focusing on and so
how does the VLP model help us solve
that information flow problem that we
had so we say we have an object this is
a top-secret object so we have a
top-secret object - is TS this is more
sensitive information we never want this
information to go and end up in an
object that has you know level is only
secret okay so this is more sensitive
object - is more sensitive than object 1
because we said TS is greater than s so
this is highly top-secret information we
never want it to end up in an object
that is only classified at the secret
level ok so how can this information
flow from here to there ok so there are
two paths path one is that a top-secret
user reads it we know that the read up
read down rule means what for this to
read for someone to be able to read this
the user has to be TS otherwise they
can't read it
the secret user can only read secret or
below so a top-secret user can read this
object okay so this read will be allowed
and then they can disinformation that
they have fooled remember the Alice Bob
Charlie example in discretionary access
control we had where Alice gave read
access to Bob who copied the data into a
file that he created and then passed it
on to Charlie and can use everyone do
something like that can it create object
to in which it may be able to write this
information that it just read from
object one for someone who is not half
secret to be able to read this
information the object we create has to
be secret or lower busy 40s then is just
like here they won't be able to read
object two they wouldn't be able to read
object one if the object is at a lower
level then the right rule says what you
can only write up you can't write down
so all the top-secret user can take this
information read it but they're not able
to write it in an object that can be
read by somebody who is not cleared at
top secret so this path doesn't allow
information to flow to get to a lower
level what about a secret user we know
the secret user can once it's here can
read that I guess we know that a secret
user can't read so this path we said is
not possible this path actually ends
right here because the secret user is
not able to read a top-secret document
because this label would not dominate
the level of the object okay so this
this path you know is broken here this
path is broken right here so this
information actually never flows in here
can information from object 1 flow into
object 2 secret can read this object and
can write up yes but that doesn't
violate any confidentially requirement
isn't it so secret information can now
be read by a top secret person because
this information made its way from here
through user 2 into this object and top
secret user could already read this
isn't it read down so in this direction
information flow doesn't make more
sensitive information available to a
user who is cleared at a lower level the
system would not allow information that
is read from this object to be written
into an object that is at a lower level
that's a guarantee that comes with BLP
and the Mac model that we didn't have
with AK before so this is how we able to
control information flow and and that's
how we fix one of the shortcomings that
that we had with discretionary access
control</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
