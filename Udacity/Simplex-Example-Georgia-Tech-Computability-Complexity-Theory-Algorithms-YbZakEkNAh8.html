action on an example from the first part
of the lesson I've changed the variable
names here a little bit so we'll let x1
correspond to the number of minutes
spent doing step aerobics and we'll let
X 2 correspond to the number of minutes
spent stretching I've also introduced a
slack variable x3 on this constraint for
the length of the workout and a surplus
variable x4 for how many minutes of
extra stretching that our actor decides
to do and together these allow me to
trade the inequality constraints we had
before for equality constraints let's
suppose that our current solution is
down here in this corner
meaning that x1 is 0 X 2 is 5 and our
slack variable here will be 35 and our
surplus variable here will be 0 the
basic variables here are clearly x2 and
x3 and the sub matrix B of the
constraint matrix a consists of these
two columns here
recall that we want to solve for these
basic variables and essentially
eliminate them and here we see that we
have X 2 is equal to X 4 plus 5 from
this equation here and X 3 then must be
35 minus x1 minus x4 and of course these
need to remain non-negative substituting
these into the objective function I now
get this in terms of the non-basic
variables the ones that I'm thinking
about moving into the basis x1 and x4
and actually both of these have positive
entries in our D matrix our D here just
has 12 and 4 as its coefficients
well arbitrarily we'll go ahead and
choose x4 as the variable to bring into
the basis so essentially the x1 gets
automatically sent to 0 and these here
then become the constraints the negative
sign here means that I could send X
force because I wanted to and that
wouldn't affect this constraint at all
here however the coefficient on X 4 is
positive so we do need to worry about
this constraint and that limits how much
bigger I can make X for only up to 35
the fact that this constraint goes tight
implies that X 3 became 0 so X 3 should
go out of the basis and X 4 should come
in graphically this corresponds to
moving from this point down here to this
one up here with these being the new
values for my X variables and then I
would repeat this process for the new
basis and eventually come down this edge
here to the optimal solution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
