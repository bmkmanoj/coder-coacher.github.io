that we understand quoted strings they
come up in almost every anchor tag and
anchor tags are the essence of hypertext
they're the inter links between
documents so we really need those they
rely on quoted strings that means we're
going to need to understand quoted
strings it is convenient then that we
are amazing it quoted strings you have
plenty of practice with them from the
previous unit so once again it's time
for a quiz suppose that the strings we
care about start with a double quote end
with a double quote and in the middle
they can contain any number of
characters except double quotes I'd like
you to write a definition for the Python
function T underscore string and submit
it via the interpreter just to make this
a bit clearer we should definitely
accept quoted strings like cuneiform or
Sumerian space writing but we should not
accept 30th century BCE because it
doesn't start and end with quotes and we
should not accept this string which has
an escaped double quote we may want to
get to that later but for now don't
worry about escape double quotes go to
it submit via the interpreter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
