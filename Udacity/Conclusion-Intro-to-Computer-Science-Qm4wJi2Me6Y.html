crawler you've learned to crawl we're
not quite at flying yet but this is a
lot that you've learned in just three
units and by learning about lists we can
build any other structure where you want
starting from lists and we'll see lots
of other things that we do in the next
unit as well as the units that follow
that that use lists we haven't quite
finished building a search engine we
have a way of getting a great start
towards our corpus finding all of these
pages to crawl what we need in Unit four
is the way to get the content from those
pages by starting from your seed page
and following the crawl web procedure
that you wrote and then we'll use that
to build an index so we can respond to
queries when someone's doing a search
for a particular term the other thing
we'll do in Unit four is we'll learn a
little more about how the Internet and
the web work I'm here with Anna
Patterson who's built a bunch of search
engines including building the world's
largest index to the web and now works
for Google and we've just finished
building a very simple web crawler I
want Anna to tell us something about how
things are different if you want to
build a web crawler that works with a
scale that Google has to deal with so
there's three main issues with scaling
up a web crawler one is the normal
politeness that you need on the web the
second one is how you get a bunch of
machines involved in crawling not just
one and the last issue is how to consume
a lot of bandwidth so that you keep the
expensive resource busy while still
being polite so on politeness there's a
line in the robots.txt that each domain
tells you how often you can crawl that
domain there's a number of problems with
that which is that multiple domains can
be hosted with a hosted service and they
could be hosted even on one machine
so even though you're being polite to
one domain you're actually really
hurting a hosting service or you're
hurting a machine so you have to make
plans in order to not hit one machine or
one domain too hard the next thing is
that if you crawl on just one machine if
the state is very good and it's really
easy to keep the state of the crawl on
the one machine but then it's hard to
make a very big search engine because
you get as much as one machine will cry
so of course in practice you crawl on
thousands of machines now if you're
going to obey politeness that means that
each of your thousand machines needs to
tell the other ones what it has crawled
and what it's about to crawl and what it
gonna crawl in 20 minutes right all of
this communication overhead can actually
slow down the crawler which actually
hurts your aim of having a big search
engine the last part is that you want to
max out your bandwidth so one thing that
people do instead of trying to lessen
the communication is they pre-process
the corpus that they already have so
when you've crawled a set of pages you
can process them and extract out all the
links that they point to
you can then normalize those links so
that yahoo.com and dub dub dub Yahoo
calm wind up being the same string and
now you can farm those strings out to
your thousand machines and now they
don't have to communicate because they
know they're not going to hit the same
domain however they could accidentally
hit the same hosting service and the
same machine but you can take care of
that ahead of time as well
thanks a lot Anna I hope those of you
who think about unleashing your web
crawler on the world pay careful
attention to what she said about
politeness thank you for having me and
students good luck on your search
engines so I hope we'll see you back
soon you'll have a homework for unit 3
that's going to be quite challenging and
I look forward to seeing all your
answers to it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
