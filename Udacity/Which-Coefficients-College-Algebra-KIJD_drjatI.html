linear factor that has a negative
coefficient in front of the x then I can
actually pull that negative out and
instead write the factor in an
equivalent form with a positive
coefficient for X the negative can be
reflected in the other factor that we're
multiplying by this basically means that
I can choose which coefficients go in
front of our X term and if I want I can
decide that I want this to be positive
that's definitely what I prefer just for
ease of looking at our factorization so
let's just go ahead and remove the
negative number pairs that multiply to
equal 6 this makes our lives much easier
now I only have two pairs of
coefficients to check to put in these
thoughts instead of four so let's do
just that let's check them I've written
out for you two possible ways of
factoring our original expression of 6x
squared minus 7x minus 5 actually only
one of these two ways as possible this
is you know that only one of these
combinations of coefficients for X
actually works so for the one that works
you're going to figure that out by
figuring out which number belongs here
and here or here and here depending on
which one is right and then in the
equation that's not going to work at all
based on these first two coefficients
you're going to simply bubble in wrong
for the two constant term slots so
basically try out each of the four
numbers that are written down here what
you'll notice are the four different
factors of negative 5 that you found
earlier and once you find out which one
works fill in the proper numbers and
then rule out the other entire equation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
