before with the anonymous function
assigned to greeter nested inside make
greater I'm going to draw out the
environment much more formally in our
global environment in greeting points to
hola make greeter is a function with
three other components that I'm not
showing right now and say hello well to
figure out its value I'm going to have
to call make greeter on hello whenever I
call a function I make a new frame with
just enough room for all of the formal
parameters and then inside this frame
I'm adding a new local variable greeter
which is a function with one parameter
and even with our environment bug even
with the bug that we've been considering
this is still going to point back to the
global frame so this value of greeter
this function defined here will be
copied back and these things I've marked
in green have the same value this was
the return value of make greeter so it's
what say hello currently has and now
we're going to call say hello on Gracie
so we're going to make a new frame where
person points to Gracie pointing back to
the global frame and here's the question
for you one of these arrows or possibly
both is incorrect if we have the bug
we've currently been talking about we
have the bug check the arrow check the
parent pointer edge that would be
different if we didn't have the bug if
we fix the bug how does the world change
