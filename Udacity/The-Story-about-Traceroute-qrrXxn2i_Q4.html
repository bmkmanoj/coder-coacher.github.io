you think traceroute works I'm not going
to make this a quiz because it really is
pretty tricky the ability to trace out
packet paths wasn't intentionally built
into the internet protocols rather a
clever engineer named van jacobson
discovered that a safety feature that
was made to prevent infinite loops made
it possible to do trace route as well
here's the safety feature traceroute
makes use of every packet has a time to
live or TTL field which starts at some
large number and is reduced by one each
time that packet hits a router as it
moves through the network each router
reduces the TTL on the packet by one as
it passes it on all the way until it
finally gets to its destination this
means that if routers are misconfigured
so that packets flow around in an
infinite loop eventually the time to
live on each packet will drop to zero
and it will expire this helps keep
momentary loops from crashing large
parts of the network with an overload of
traffic when a packets TTL expires the
router that last received it sends a
tiny error message back to the packets
original sender that message says that
the packets TTL expired and it gives the
address of the router that saw that
packet die so given that idea now can
you think of how traceroute might work
the TTL mechanism means that if a
program sends a packet with TTL 0 it
will be immediately killed and an error
message will come back if it sends a
packet with TTL one it'll go one hop
land on the first router get decremented
20 killed and an error will come back
then with TTL two it'll go two hops to
the destination before it gets killed so
sending packets to a destination with
progressively increasing ttls starting
at one the traceroute program gets an
error message back from each router on
the way to that destination and it can
use those error messages to reconstruct
the path which is just the list of those
routers in order that a packet takes to
get to that destination</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
