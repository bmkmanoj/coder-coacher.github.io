answer to the number of candies in the
jar so I could do the number of candies
in the jar minus the number of candies
guest so for Katie there were 734
candies in the jar minus 743 her guess I
have positive 734 and negative 743 I
know that this number is more negative
it's nine more negative so I have a
negative nine for Craig or a I had 734
candies in the jar minus 728 her guess
and I got six for Andy he was off by 20
and Kathleen negative 12 there's one
problem with these results we want to
know who was the closest to the number
of candies in the jar Katie's guess was
off by nine she guessed 743 and she was
actually over by nine she went too high
so in this case a negative sign means we
were over our guests kakori was six
candies off she was under she guessed
728 728 is less than 734 so in this case
a positive six would mean that she was
under andy guest 714 and that was 20
candies away from the answer Kathleen
was also over she guessed 746 so she was
12 units above the positive and
negatives mean something in this context
the negatives mean that we were above
the guests like katie and kathleen fork
aghori and andy however Vegas below the
number of candies in the jar so they
wound up with a positive answer based on
our model remember I shouldn't really
care about the negative and positives
here I just want to know who was the
closest to the number of candies in the
jar I'm only concerned with how far away
everyone's guess was from 734 I don't
care if the result was negative or
positive if I want to know the absolute
difference I should use absolute value
this was a symbol that we saw at the
start of this lesson absolute value is
the distance from 0 it just says how far
away we are from zero so Katie's guess
was really 9 candies off kagura's guess
was six candies off Annie's guess was 20
units off and Kathleen's guess was 12
units off notice that the absolute value
took the positive result of
all the numbers let's look at this in
another example</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
