int one of our grammar rules is a goes
to n plus string into + string and I've
put the dot right here so we've already
seen an int and we're expecting to see
two more things this is consistent with
the world that we've been presented we
know that eventually this won't work
because the full input is in + int but
we haven't seen that much yet so we
can't rule it out right now we think
this state is okay in the future will
give up on it similarly one of the rules
in our grammar is a goes to int we've
only seen an int so we could be in this
state the int is behind us there's
nothing in our future we're really
hoping the input ends now the input
doesn't end now you and I know that
there are two more tokens coming but our
parser doesn't know that yet it's only
seen one token in the next step the next
iteration the next recursive call it
will know and throw away this
information but for now we're keeping it
all right how about this a goes to int +
this requires us to have two tokens in
the past and we've only seen one token
to the input that can't be true
similarly over here there's nothing in
the past and there's one token to the
right looking at our grammar there's
really no way this could play out we've
seen one token and this assumes we've
seen zero over here similarly in +
string this parsing state only works if
we've seen zero tokens and we've already
seen one so that doesn't match and in
fact similarly here s goes to a s goes
to a is a rule in our grammar that's a
good sign but this version requires us
to have seen nothing and we've seen one
token s goes to a and here we are
actually this could totally work if I've
only seen just int from the input then I
could be finishing off I could be
accepting the string based on s goes to
a and a goes to int so I've already seen
a full a a goes to int and now i'm done
with s yeah that's where I could be now
again we're going to rule this out as
soon as we see the next token in the
input that it's not the end of the
string but for now it looks very
promising and this is the big trick with
parsing i said earlier we'd have to keep
our fingers in many spots because until
we see the whole input we're not sure
what the picture is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
