upon your rather impressive way of
thinking about it
all the possible strategies for a and
all the possible strategies for B a can
go left left left right right left right
right four states 1 &amp;amp; 4 respectively and
B can go left right middle right or
right right right right
in particular 3 and stay 3 B can only go
R which makes B a conservative a pirate
oh that makes more sense
it does make more sense okay so now why
did I write it this way Michael well I
wrote it this way because if I write it
this way with all the choices all the
strategies that B has up here and all
the strategies that they have here I
actually form a matrix and I can put in
each of the cells of the matrix the
value of taking a particular strategy
from a in a particular strategy from B
does that make sense yeah that's very
clever yes it is very clever I'm very
happy that I came up with it entirely on
my own okay so let's start filling in
these numbers or instead of filling in
the numbers ourselves we could ask the
students to do it by making it a quiz
shall we do that sure okay so let's make
certain that everyone here understands
and what exactly we're asking to do
we're saying that if for example a takes
this first strategy go left in state 1
and left in state 4 and B takes its
first strategy which is go left in state
2 and right in state 3 what is the value
for a that will result so let's actually
do the first one as an example and ask
everyone to do the rest of them that
seem fair yeah that's what I was gonna
suggest too okay good so let's see if a
goes chooses to go left in state one
since a it goes first we'll end up in
state two right and then in this first
strategy B goes left in state two which
means we will end up going down this
path and the value there is plus seven
so seven is in fact the value of this
game with respect to a now we know that
because this is a two player zero-sum
finite deterministic game
perfect information that if a gets a
value of 7 B gets a value of minus 7 so
we could write minus 7 here 7 comma
minus 7 here but since we know that it's
equal and opposite let's just write down
the value for a okay just for
compactness sake that seem fair to you
yeah okay cool so with that in mind
let's see if we can fill out the rest of
this table I think you can do it I think
so okay then you give me a place to
write everything it will magically
appear go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
