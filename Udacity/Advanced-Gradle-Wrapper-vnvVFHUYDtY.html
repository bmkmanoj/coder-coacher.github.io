the start of this class to run our first
task before we had even installed Gradle
that's a pretty cool party trick but the
real strength of the wrapper is that you
can put your build tool under version
control so every one building your
project is building it with the exact
same tool the Gradle wrapper is composed
of four files a jar a properties file
and a pair of scripts a shell script for
UNIX Mac and a batch script for Windows
when you pass a command to one of these
scripts it will first check Gradle is
installed download it if necessary then
execute your command a wrapper can be
created by running the built-in wrapper
task here we go let's give it a shot and
here we see the files of the Grail
wrapper the two build scripts and then
inside the Gradle directory will find
the Gradle wrapper jar and the Gradle
wrapper tour dot properties we can now
run our Gradle build using the wrapper
we use the wrapper identically to how we
would use the Gradle command let's get
our task list oops looks like we don't
have this version of Gradle installed
since this was our first time using the
wrapper it went in ahead and downloaded
the appropriate Gradle distribution and
cached it locally we can also explicitly
configure what version of Gradle we want
the wrapper to use by setting the Gradle
version property of the wrapper task
let's change the version to 2.2 and run
the wrapper task again now if we use
this new wrapper to get the task list
it'll have to download Gradle again
because we don't already have version
2.2 if we run Gradle - - version to see
which version we're actually using here
looks like we're using version 2.2 just
like we asked for configuration options
of the Gradle wrapper is stored in this
Gradle wrapper properties file we've got
it opened up down here as you can see
what URL to get Gradle from is defined
here is currently using Gradle version
2.2 just like we set from the build file
let's change this back to 2.3 now if we
try running Gradle w version again we
see we're back on version 2.3
this is a really important feature as it
allows us to centrally control what
version of Gradle is used to build our
project in practice the Gradle wrapper
files including the scripts jar and
properties file will be committed to
source control this serves two main
functions first it means that everything
that is needed to get up and running
with development of our project is
included in the source repository second
it means that the Gradle version is
so version control which eliminates the
possibility that a developer encounters
problems with the build due to using the
wrong version of Gradle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
