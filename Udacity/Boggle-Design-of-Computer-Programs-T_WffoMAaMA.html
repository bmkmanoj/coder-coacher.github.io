boggle now boggle is played with a set
set of letters that are arranged into a
grid and n by n grid here four by four
but you should accept other sizes as
well and your task is to find all the
words that can be found in this grid now
it's you can simply take ones across so
play would be a word they don't have to
go all the way across so lay would be a
word as well and they can turn corners
and go in any direction so starting at T
we could go t o W we can continue from
there a d s and in general we can go to
any adjacent square horizontally
vertically or diagonally
we can't duplicate so H I s is a word
but we can't do H I s s because s is not
a neighbor of s so his but not his and
we could do si R but not si R s because
each letter can be used only once we
can't come back and repeat on ourselves
now I'm going to ask you to write the
function boggle words which takes as
input a representation of the board like
this and minimum length of the words
that count
so three letter words at least two
letter words don't count - don't bother
returning them and it returns a set of
words which again are taken out of our
words dictionary now because I'm going
to pass in the board I have to give you
the representation for that and I'm
going to make a slightly different
choice than I did for Scrabble boards
just to show you the range of options we
have for representing two-dimensional
objects like this now we're trying to
represent this two-dimensional array and
in Scrabble
we chose representation like this a
nested list of lists and so if we signed
board to this list then we can access an
element with to energy or subscripts
like that in our representation of
Scrabble we also made a small change so
that we didn't have to worry about going
off the board which is that we
introduced the
border markers the vertical bars to mean
a border at the at the edges of every
row and we also did it we had a top row
in a bottom row which consisted entirely
employers so as if we took this game
here and we just extended it by making a
border all the way around this 2d
representation would work fine in the
boggle case but I just want to show you
another possibility which is a one
dimensional representation where instead
of saying board sub J sub I for a
position we only have to say the word
sub I and we get that representation
just by concatenating together all the
elements so we take all the elements in
the first row and then add on to that
list all the elements in the second row
all the elements and the third and so on
now we have a one dimensional array now
why is that better why is it better to
have a one dimensional array to
represent an inherently two-dimensional
object seems like a step backwards well
one thing is that now we can have a
position in the array represented by a
single object by an integer rather than
by a pair of integers that have to be
broken up to subscript into the board so
that's one advantage and secondly it's
easier to enumerate over them we can
just say for I comma s in enumerate of
board
so remember enumerate takes a sequence
and returns the elements of the sequence
in term that would be the esses the
contents of each square which would be
the letters like P and L and also an
index into them the the letter the the
integer I which be an integer 0 1 2 and
so on so it's easier to enumerate over
the entire board in this 1d
representation rather than the 2d both
representations work fine but I wanted
to give you a little experience using
this alternative so let's do an example
of this representation here's a simple
board it looks like that now we want to
add on board ourselves so we'll do that
all around it looks like that now we
just put that together into a string and
so the final string would look like like
this now in terms of the indexes into
the array right here would be index
number 0 and we can
just enumerate them out so it's a 5x5
array the indices go from 0 to 24 now
let's say we want to find all the
neighbors of this central square that
the W and so the neighbors would include
basically all the letters here would be
a neighbor of W the index of W is 12 now
if we say that the the length of a side
of this matrix we'll call that n is
equal to 5 now if we wanted to know all
the neighbors of cell and let's say
looking for the neighbors of I equals 12
then at 6 7 8 11 13 16 17 18 so here is
I 11 and 13 are easy that's I minus 1
and I plus 1 the 7 is just I minus n the
17 I plus and and then you can fill in
the others so you see starting from I
it's easy to generate the 8 neighbors
just by adding and subtracting ends and
once it's a little bit simpler doing it
this way and then it would with the 2
dimensional representation so here's
what I'm asking you to write this
function boggle words given a board and
a minimum length reach the words return
the set of words here's some tests for
you first the board function and I've
written that so don't worry about it
we'll see it below here's a simple test
not many words you can find in there
that should be the whole set I've
defined for you a function neighbors
which takes a square location square
number 20 in a 6x6 board and tells you
what the neighbors are and then here's
an example for play this word game
here's the set of answers and for this
bigger board with more letters on it
there's 317 words in our small
dictionary that was found here's our
representation of board using the single
string representation that I talked
about here's a simple function to
display that it doesn't actually print
it but it returns a string which is
easily printable and then this part the
words and prefixes you might find very
useful
that's on
