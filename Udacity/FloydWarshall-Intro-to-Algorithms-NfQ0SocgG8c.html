bit you'll see there's really only two
possibilities if we're trying to find
the shortest path from hi to Jay that is
allowed to use K and any of the nodes
smaller with number smaller than K
there's two possibilities it may be that
we don't need to use K at all for the
smallest path we just follow a path from
I to J only using nodes who have values
less than K or we go and we visit K and
then we go from k to J but in visiting k
we don't ever need to visit k on the way
to K that wouldn't be a very good path
so the shortest path from I to K only
using nodes that are less than K then we
follow another path now from k2 J only
using nodes whose numbers are less than
K those are the only things that can
happen we don't want to visit Tate twice
and we're not allowed to use any nodes
that are greater than K so those are the
two possibilities and whichever one of
these two things is shortest right the
shortest path from I to K followed by
the shortest path from k to J or the
shortest path from I to J whichever of
those two things is shortest is the
shortest path from I to J possibly using
K and things less than K so we can just
write that in a straightforward way by
taking advantage of the fact that
someone has given us DK not tooth decay
but matrix decay right so the shortest
value the shortest the length of the
shortest path from I to K not using only
nodes less than K we have that already
someone gave it to us very helpfully so
all we need to do is compare the
distance of I to J not using K and the
distance from I to K not using K and K 2
J not using K it's weird but it's the
right thing to do so we can take
advantage of this insight to actually
create an efficient algorithm so we can
initialize D 0 so this is the lengths of
the shortest path from I to J using
nodes only numbered less than 0 which is
to say no intermediate nodes well that's
just the direct cost of going from I to
J so we could just fill in from the cost
in our graph we can fill in this matrix
and once we have D Sub Zero initialized
we can run K from 0 to n minus 1 and for
each pair of I and J we take DK plus 1
to be the smaller of DK IJ and DK i KD k
IJ add it together just just as I was
just describing before when this is all
over when this loop is done we have D n
well D n but D n IJ is the
length of the shortest path from I to J
only hopping on nodes that are numbered
less than n but that's all the nodes all
the nodes are numbered less than n
they're all numbered from 0 to n minus 1
so this is the length of the shortest
path from I to J unrestricted . so
that's pretty cool and if you think
about what's going on here this
initialization step is runs over all
pairs of nodes that's N squared this
loop runs over all pairs of nodes N
squared but it does this for each value
from 0 to n minus 1 so altogether we're
talking about n times N squared or n
cubed this is better than the n cubed
login we get by applying repeated
Dijkstra to a dense graph so for a dense
graph you're better off using fluid
wash-off and cubed instead of the n
cubed log n now you know log in is often
not that huge a number so your mileage
may vary you should actually try the
overhead but boy it's hard to imagine
having less overhead than this it's very
straightforwardly runs through the N
cubed possibilities and in fact if you
do this carefully you don't need to keep
a separate D matrix for each of these
cases you can actually do these updates
completely in place so the storage is
pretty low too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
