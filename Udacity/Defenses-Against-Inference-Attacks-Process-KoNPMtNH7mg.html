called the identification the
identification essentially says you know
drop or remove all the values that
identify a particular user
now the identification alone is is not
sufficient sometimes we have to do what
is called anonymization so think about
your example where there was only one
student with junior standing although we
dropped the student ID that directly
identified that student but the standing
field or attribute would tell us even
without the ID who that particular tuple
is about so one way to do that is you
can do some sort of anonymization and
one way to do an animation is what's
called generalization so you know you
replace an exact value by a set of
values or a range so we may combine
junior/senior standing and we can just
say upperclassman or something like that
and if you only have junior and seniors
then that would then would avoid that
problem we had with the junior standing
identified a particular student so even
when you do the identification and
anonymous ation it has to be done with
care depending on your data set that you
have or what's stored in the database
this may not be sufficient think of an
example where we're looking at people
with certain diseases who live in
various zip codes so you can say well
someone may be able to make some sort of
an inference based on zip code and
publicly available information you know
addresses and things like that so we may
want to drop the last digit of the zip
code or the last two digits of the zip
code so that's one way to generalize it
okay so Georgia Tech is three oh three
three two if we replace the last two by
zero zero then perhaps the three digits
we have match with a much larger area
but what if even after you do that
generalization you know the disease that
we have is the same across all those
different zip codes where the first
three digits are the same the disease
values are not diverse enough let's say
if they're exactly the same everybody
has some sort of infectious disease or
something like that which you know CDC
may be looking at you know how those
infections are spreading and and stuff
like that generalization won't do
anything in that case
is in it because it's the same value see
same disease D for example that we
didn't want someone to see that this
particular zip code had incidence of
that disease that's why we did the
generalization saying well it could be
any of the the four or eight or whatever
number of zip codes when you replace the
last two digits by zero zero but if the
values the disease values are not
diverse then just generalizing or non
amaizing the zip code value doesn't go
very far so you know generally you did
this transformation involves the
identification generalization
anonymization the things called que
anonymity so they at least multiple
tuples and you focus on certain subset
of the values that could be used as a
quasi identifiers are the same in the
database and then we have to see that
across the same sort of quasi
identifiers that we have there multiple
values so we can't say that that given
identifier that we have here for sure we
know that this must be the sensitive
value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
