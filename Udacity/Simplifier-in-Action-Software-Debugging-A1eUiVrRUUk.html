input and run it through our
simplification procedure let's find this
out we click on run you see that the
simplification algorithm correctly
returns select which actually means that
it has been able to very nicely simplify
this complex input into just these eight
characters let's take a look into how
this actually operates I'm inserting a
print statement in here which gives us a
representation of the string as well as
its length so we can see whatever
simplify has been working on and down
here you can see how simplify operate it
first takes the entire string then it
takes the first half test this fails
again of this it takes the first half
fails again takes the first hour fails
again and there we go with a technique
like this we can automatically simplify
any input all we need is an automated
test that tells us whether the program
in question passes or fails
unfortunately at this point our strategy
is not yet perfect we'll have to refine
it a bit because it doesn't work well
for all inputs what happens if we put in
another HTML input that is select poo
and end of select what do we get as a
simplified input with this function so
he's a quiz what's the result of
simplify here with this input select foo
and select is it a string consisting out
of the eight characters select is it a
string consisting of select and the
first two characters of foo is it a
strain consisting of select and all of
who or is it the entire HTML input over
