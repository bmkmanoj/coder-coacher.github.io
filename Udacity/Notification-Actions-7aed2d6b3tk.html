sample and how it looks let's talk about
what notification features are possible
on Android wear the first thing we can
do is add extra action buttons to a
notification the user can view these
actions by swiping the notification to
the left these actions are also visible
on the phone notification as well so
this is not wearable specific so you
make a call to the add action method of
the notification compat builder you need
to supply an icon to use and you also
need to provide a string to show
underneath and finally you'll need to
provide a pending intent for the
specific action you'll notice that this
code snippet creates a pending intent
that refers to a location so it would
open up a mapping application to display
this on the phone it is important to
realize that notifications created on
the phone always caused the intent to
run the phone as well not the wearable
it's also possible to have different
actions appear on the wearable device
compared to the actions on the phone to
do this we introduce a class called
wearable extender for wearable specific
features we want to use we use the
extend method of notification compat
builder and pass in the new wearable
extender object with wearable extender
we call add action here to add the
wearable specific action which is
defined here note that when you use add
action with the wearable extender none
of the regular add action calls will be
shown on the wearable and none of the
wearable add action calls be shown on
the phone they're decoupled from each
other now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
