commentator you've programmed one you
understand how to incorporate
measurements you understand how to
incorporate motion and you really
implement something it's actually really
cool which is a full common filter for
the 1d case now in reality we often have
many DS and then things become more
involved so I'm going to just tell you
how things work with an example and why
it's great to estimate it higher
dimensional space state spaces suppose
you have a two dimensional state space
of x and y like a camera image or in our
case we might have a car that uses a
radar to detect the location of a
vehicle of our time then what the 2d
common filter affords you is something
really amazing and here's how it goes
suppose at time T equals zero you
observe the object of interest to be at
this coordinate this might be another
car in traffic for the Google
self-driving car one time step later you
see it over here another time step later
you see it right over here where would
you now expect at time T equals three
the object to be let me give you three
different places please click at the
most likely location</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
