let's talk about how the perspective
camera is set in three.js
it's similar to the orthographic camera
in fact the creation call has fewer
parameters we know at the last three are
the aspect ratio is the image width
divided by height followed by the near
and far planes remember the view frustum
it's back at last the near and far
distances are measured from the tip of
the pyramid where the cameras placed
down a central axis back when I was a
young man we called near and far by the
names hither and yon which I think is
more poetic
you'll still occasionally see the terms
hither and yon used in products so keep
an eye out the first argument for the
perspective cameras the field of view
this is the angle between the top and
bottom plains of the view pyramid notice
that in 3 J s this number is specified
in degrees unlike many other angles
which use radians the field of view
along with the aspect ratio fully
describe the locations of the four sides
of the pyramid for the orthographic
camera we define the location of every
side of our view volume box here the
view is assumed to be symmetric around
the central axis in other words instead
of top at a bottom value we need just a
single angle describing both the field
of view same thing with the right and
left the aspect ratio along with the
angle is enough this is 3 J s is way of
doing things and 99% of the time it's
what you want
that said it's entirely possible to
specify each side of the pyramid and
WebGL itself has a frustum call that
does just this if you later change
values on the camera itself such as the
field of view near or far plains in 3 J
s you need to call camera update
projection matrix in order to have these
changes take effect for most demos these
camera parameters are usually set once
in creation and rarely touched so 3 J s
doesn't spend any time checking them
each frame if you change these values
while running your program calling
update projection matrix has 3 J s
evaluate these parameters and form a new
projection matrix</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
