we've talked about what happens to them
when they get to the exchange let's talk
now about how do the orders get to the
exchange from you well here you are with
your laptop connected to the internet
and you've just entered an order to buy
some stock your buy order goes over the
Internet to your broker your broker in
turn is connected to several exchanges
and the broker determines where to route
your order based on information that
knows about the exchanges let's suppose
the exchanges we're looking at our New
York Stock Exchange NASDAQ and bats for
the stock that you want to buy each one
of these exchanges has its own order
book your broker has a computer located
at each exchange and it queries a
computer say hey look at the order book
tell me what the prices are they're
Curry's added all the exchanges your
broker gathers and examines that
information and based on that route your
order to the exchange that has the best
price let's say that's New York Stock
Exchange your order enters the exchange
gets executed and the price comes back
to your broker and forward it back to
you and you get a confirmation now it
turns out that because this is happening
constantly all the time there's multiple
brokers hundreds of thousands millions
of people making orders that the order
books at each of these exchanges tends
to be pretty similar in other words the
prices don't differ much between one or
another and it's this sort of pressure
that keeps prices the same across these
different exchanges let's consider
another scenario suppose there's another
client of this same brokerage Joe and
that Joe wants to sell some stock well
the brokerage can observe hey I've got
some clients who want to sell some
clients who want to buy I can just make
that exchange internally and I don't
even need to go to the exchanges this
can be advantageous for the broker
because the broker doesn't have to pay
now fees to the exchanges for this
transaction to occur however according
to the law both the seller and the buyer
have to get prices that are at least
as good as they would have gotten if
they had gone to an exchange and
eventually at the end of the day this
transaction has to be registered with
one of the exchanges usually it's
recorded at the exchange where that
particular stock is honed let's consider
one more example in this case Lisa also
wants to sell some stock but she uses a
different broker than you do there's one
more kind of entity out there called a
dark pool that acts as an intermediary
between brokerages and exchanges so the
dark pool is looking at the order books
of the various exchanges and they're
often making predictions about which
direction stocks are going to go they
actually pay the brokers for the
privilege to look at the orders before
they go to the exchanges and if they see
an advantageous trade they'll go ahead
and take it so in this case this sell
might be routed through the dark pool
from broker to through the broker one
and again the transaction never makes it
to the exchanges in fact these days
eighty to ninety percent of what they
call retail traders orders never make it
to the exchanges they're either executed
internally within a brokerage or filled
using a dark pool the brokerages and the
dark pools argue the best just fine
because both partners in this
transaction are getting prices at least
as good as they would get at the
exchanges and the on the order books but
they're saving money because they don't
have to pay the exchange fees we've
talked so far about how exchanges work
and how the order book facilitates
transactions at the exchanges and we've
talked about how orders get to exchanges
or not now let's take a look at how
hedge funds can exploit inefficiencies
