voting voting involves lots of
cryptographic issues and there are many
interesting security properties that a
voting system should provide one
property that many voting systems desire
to provide as anonymity that it
shouldn't be possible for an adversary
to know who someone voted for the other
property and voting system should have
is that the count is verifiable these
are sort of in opposition verifying the
count would be easy if each voter would
be willing to publicly declare their
vote and someone could look at all of
those votes but if we want to keep the
votes anonymous and have a notion of a
private ballot well then verifying the
count becomes more challenging another
property some voting systems want to
provide is coercion resistance what this
really means is that a voter can't prove
who they voted for
if votes are secret and there's no way
to prove for whom one votes well then
there's no way to coerce the voter into
voting a particular way and then we have
all the usual goals of reliability and
security these things are hard to
achieve there are good ways to achieve
them with paper ballots if we have
trusted ballot boxes guarded by trusted
election officials and if we have enough
trusted third parties well maybe we can
trust them to report the right tally
we're going to look at one interesting
cryptographic way to do voting but I
want to emphasize that this is not a
solution to the real problems that are
necessary to run an election but it
solves this issue of can you keep votes
anonymous and still have a way to verify
that the count is correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
