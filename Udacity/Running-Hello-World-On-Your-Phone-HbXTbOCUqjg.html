but this isn't actually on our phone
this is pretty similar to when we were
working with the XML visualizer now we
actually want to see our app on our
phone to participate you're gonna need a
USB cable like this now this USB cable
should fit your Android phone but you
will also need what do I mean by fit
well I can pick up my phone and plug
this cable into it now if you don't have
these things there's a slightly more
complicated way you can get up and
running which I'm going to talk about in
the next video but if you have both of
these items I really encourage you to
use a real device it's a lot more fun
that way all right first things first
your phone is not set up to let random
code from your computer run on your
phone by default so you're going to need
to do a few steps to prep your phone
okay so the first step is to become a
developer this sounds a little funny
what would you know when your developer
well what this actually means it's
changing around a couple settings on the
phone which will allow you to access
developer options once your phone set up
you'll connect your phone to your
computer using the USB cable that I
talked about before now if you're using
a Windows machine the third step for you
and windows-only
will be to install a driver and a driver
is an extra little bit of software that
will allow your phone to communicate
with your Windows machine with Macs this
just works by default so you don't have
to worry about it and finally you'll
install your app all right let's start
doing these steps on newer phones
running Android 4.2 and later you need
to tell your phone that you're a
developer this is a pretty simple
process that I'll show you right now the
way to do this is to navigate to the
settings menu once you're here scroll
down to the bottom and click on about
phone on this menu also scroll down to
the bottom you should see something that
says build number okay so take the build
number and click it seven times cool so
now suddenly you're a developer wasn't
that easy
once you're done go ahead and hit the
back button ok now in developer options
there's a bunch of fancy sounding
options but what I want you to do is
scroll down until you see USB debugging
and then go ahead and click the little
checkbox next to USB debugging to turn
it on and say ok
by checking this box it's allowing your
computer to put applications onto your
phone awesome
now that you've enabled that you can
take your handy-dandy USB cable plug one
end into the phone and take the other
end and plug it into your computer if
you're on a Windows Device there's one
more step to set up your phone and
computer your Windows machine needs some
software called a driver to communicate
with your phone
I'll start by downloading the driver for
most phones besides Google Nexus phones
you can navigate to the Android OAM
which stands for original equipment
manufacturers driver website a link is
provided in the instructor notes I'm
gonna scroll down to the bottom here I
have a list of drivers for different
phones and I'll go ahead and download
the appropriate one in my case I have a
nexus phone so I'm gonna go up on the
page I click Google USB driver this is
again for Nexus phones ok so for me I'm
gonna go ahead and download the Google
USB driver
unzip it I'm gonna move this to my
desktop so this point have downloaded
the driver I've unzipped it and I put it
on my desktop what you need to do next
is double check that your phone is
actually plugged in okay let's look at
our taskbar I'm gonna click on the Start
menu and go to computer in windows
explorer I'm gonna right click on the
word here that says computer and then
I'll go to manage in this left pane here
I'm gonna select Device Manager so
looking through this list go ahead and
find the thing that says other devices
and expand it now you should see
something here that refers to your phone
for example Nexus S or ADB which stands
for Android debug bridge interface okay
so I'm gonna right-click and select
update driver software this is gonna
launch a wizard that looks like this and
I want to select the one that lets me
browse my computer because remember I
just downloaded it to my desktop I'm
gonna do browse computer and I'm gonna
go ahead and click browse and I'm gonna
go to my desktop and hit OK and hit next
I might see some security messages like
this go ahead and say install all right
cool so this autoplay just popped up
with my Nexus 6 so that's a good sign
that now the computer is communicating
well with my phone I'm gonna go ahead
and close this and the final window of
the wizard says that Windows has
successfully updated your driver
software so that sounds awesome I'll go
ahead and click close basically at this
point your phone is ready to accept the
application from your computer another
way of saying that you can now install
apps that you've built on your computer
onto your phone finally we're gonna
install our hello world app from the
computer onto the phone to do this
you're going to go up to the top of
Android studio - this green play button
and click it
it will take about 10 seconds or so for
the next window to pop up so be patient
at the bottom of the screen you should
be able to see that there's some process
being executed now if everything one is
planned your computer should detect your
phone and list it here make sure you
have the chooser running device radio
button clicked and not the launch
emulator radio button selected
if you can't see your phone try
unplugging it and reap lugging it in and
then try restarting the phone if that
also doesn't work and you're on a
Windows machine you might have installed
the wrong driver if none of those
solutions seem to solve your problem
we've created a troubleshooting document
which is linked in the instructor notes
and you can always try asking your
fellow students for help on chat or in
forms okay but hopefully things are
working you can select your phone and
click the ok button after about five
seconds you should see your phone looks
like this you've now successfully run
your first Android application on a
phone awesome work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
