affect correctness but may impact
performance is what we call spurious or
unnecessary wake-ups let's look at this
code for a writer and readers
let's see currently there is a writer
that's performing a right operation so
it is the one that has the log counter
mutex so this is the shared lock and
then elsewhere in the program readers
for instance are waiting on a condition
variable read face so there are a number
of readers that are associated with the
wait queue that's part of that condition
variable so what can happen when this
writer issues the broadcast operation
this broadcast can start removing
threads from the wait queue that's
associated with the read phase condition
variable and that can start happening
perhaps in another core before the
writer has completed the rest of the
operations in the lock construct now if
that's the case we have the writer on
one core it holds still the lock and
it's executing basically this portion of
the code and at another core on another
CPU and the threads that are waking up
from this shoe that's associated with
the condition variable that's part of
the weight statement they have to the
very first thing they do is they have to
reacquire the mutex we explained this
before so that means the very first
thing that these threads will do will
try to reacquire the mutex the mutex is
still hold by the writer thread the
writer thread still has the mutex so
none of these threads will be able to
proceed
they'll be woken up from one cue that's
associated with the condition variable
and they'll have to be placed on the cue
that's associated with the mutex so we
will end up with this type of situation
as a result of this this is what we call
spurious wakeup we signal we walk up the
threads and that wakeup was unnecessary
they have to now wait again the program
will still execute correctly however we
will waste cycles by basically context
switching these threads to run on the
CPU and then back again to wait on the
wait queue the problem is that when we
unlock
only after we've issued the broadcaster
the signal operation no other threat
we'll be able to get the lock
so spurious wake-ups is this situation
when we're waking threads up we're
issuing the broadcaster the signal and
we know that it is possible that some of
the threads may not be able to proceed
it will really depend on the ordering of
the different operations so would this
always work though can we always unlock
the mutex before we actually broadcast
our signal for instance by using this
trick we can transform the old writer
code into this code where we first
unlock and then we perform the broadcast
in signal operations this clearly will
work just fine the resulting code will
avoid the problem of spurious wake ups
and the program remains correct in other
cases however this would not be possible
we cannot restructure the program in
this way so if we look at what's
happening at the readers the signal
operation is embedded in this if clause
and the if statement relies on the value
of resource counter now resource counter
was the shared resource that this mutex
was protecting in the first place so we
cannot unlock and then continue
accessing the shared resource that will
affect the correctness of the program
therefore this technique of unlocking
before we perform the broadcaster signal
doesn't work in this particular case or
in similar cases</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
