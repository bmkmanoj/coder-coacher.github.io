extremely useful for security record
that the one way property means that it
is easy to compute a hash from the
message but it is impossible to find a
message from the hash you can think of
it this way you can make hash brown from
potatoes but you can make potatoes out
of hash browns let's look at this
example of using hash to verified
password hashes are particularly useful
for password verification we all know
that when we authenticate ourselves to a
system we need to supply a password now
let's look under the hood what happens
for example when a user
supplies a password candy the system
would take the input candy and hash it
and then compare the hash value with the
stored hash of a password on a system if
they match then the access is allowed
otherwise access is denied that is the
create X password candy is nervous to
war on a system only the hash of the
password is stole on a system and then
whenever the user types in a password to
authenticate him or herself to a system
the input will be hash and then the hash
of the input password will be compared
with the store hash of the password you
may ask why not just store the clear tax
password on a system think about it if
you do that then anyone who gets access
to system can look at the clear text
password and they impersonate the user
this can include attackers or even other
users on a system therefore we never
store the plaintext
of the passwords on system only their
hash values of course if an attacker
gains access to a system he can steal
the hash of the password then what the
attacker can do is to guess possible
passwords one by one and hash each gas
password and compare the hash value with
the stolen hash of the password if they
match then the attacker knows that he
had correctly guessed the password
therefore it is important for us to use
a password that's very hard to guess
for example we should not use any word
in a dictionary</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
