new features that you might want to add
to a data set but it's just as important
to know how to get rid of features that
you might not want now it might not be
clear right now why you would ever want
to get rid of the future it might be
like well but Katie that's throwing out
information that's throwing out data why
would I ever want to do that and I would
propose to you that there are many very
good reasons why you might want to get
rid of features we'll be talking about
some of those in the rest of this lesson
but I want to make you think about it on
your own first so here are a few reasons
that you might want to ignore a future
and I want you to place a check next to
all the ones that you think actually
sound like good reasons to ignore a
feature to you so perhaps one problem
with a feature is that it's noisy that
is hard to distinguish whether it's it's
reliably measuring what you want it to
be measuring another thing that could
potentially be happening is that a
feature maybe it is causing your model
to overfit for some reason maybe you
think that the feature is strongly
related or what we call highly
correlated with a feature that's already
present so it's giving you information
but it's just repeating information
that's already present in the form of
another feature and then the last
possibility is that additional features
maybe they slow down the training or the
testing process and so in order to keep
things moving along quickly you want to
be working with the bare minimum number
of features that are required to get
good performance so you tell me what you
think
which of these are good reasons to
ignore a feature</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
