do what we did before otherwise we go
into a loop until the sum of the x is
greater than or equal to the floating
point number that was passed in so now I
think we got a pretty good handle on
timing our functions another interesting
question would be how many assignments
do we did we take along the way not just
how long did they take now if our
program had been structured using
statements for statements rather than
using the big generator expression we
could do it like something like this we
could say we're going to count the
number of assignments we're going to
start the count at 0 and then every time
we go through an ordering we're going to
increment the count by one you know you
might say we want to increment the count
by 5 because we've assigned each of the
five houses one of the colors but I'm
counting that as one you can choose
which one you you want to go on and then
we just have a structure like that and
we can keep track of the counts and that
will work fine it's not too bad but it
bothers me a little bit that we had to
do such violence to this program that we
have this program we had to go in in so
many places interrupt it and put in so
many statements and I wanted to see can
we separate that out a little bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
