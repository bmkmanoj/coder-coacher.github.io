let me ask a couple questions first of
all what is this specification say if X
is the empty vector so if X is the empty
vector then why is also the empty vector
they're equal okay they have the centas
have the same elements right and in fact
there was a special case that checked
exactly that that thing okay here's a
little bit trickier one what happens if
the first element of X appears in more
than one place in the output I feel like
we're still covered because of the way
that we defined it we know that for this
element that does exist in X there's a
place and why in which that is also that
the element also exists there's at least
one place at least at least one place
and the exists quantifier doesn't care
which one you've got as long as you use
that jab that position consistently if
there's more than one occurrence of X
sub 1 in the output okay then when we do
our recursive permutation check on
smaller and smaller segments will run
into this situation again and eventually
we'll get down to where we're comparing
the empty vectors which we say our
permutation right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
