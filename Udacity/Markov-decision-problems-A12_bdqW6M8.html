we've been working with is something
called a Markov decision problem and
here's what makes up a Markov decision
problem there are a set of states s
those are all the values that this s can
take as it comes into the robot there's
a set of actions a which is these
potential actions we can take to act on
the environment there's a transition
function this is the T within the
environment and this is this is a little
bit complicated but let's just step
through it
t is a three-dimensional object and it
records in each of its cells the
probability that if we are in state s
and we take action a we will end up in
state s prime something to note about
this transition function is suppose
we're in state the particular state s
and we take a particular action a the
sum of all the next states we might end
up in has to sum to one in other words
with probability one we're going to end
up in some new state but the
distribution of probabilities across
these different states is what makes
this informative and revealing finally
an important component of Markov
decision problems is the reward function
and that's what gives us the reward if
we're in a particular state and we take
an action a we get a particular reward
so if we have all of these things to
find we have what's called a Markov
decision problem now the problem for a
reinforcement learning algorithm is to
find this policy PI that will maximize
reward over time and in fact if it finds
the optimal policy we give it a little
symbol pi star to indicate that it's
optimal now if we have these and in
particular if we have T and R there are
algorithms we can unleash that will find
this optimal policy
two of them are policy iteration and
value iteration now in this class
we don't start off knowing T and R and
so we're not going to be able to use
these algorithms directly to find this
policy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
