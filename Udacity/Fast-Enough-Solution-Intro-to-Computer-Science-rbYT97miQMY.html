are that it does depend on the number of
keywords if we have very few keywords
well then our lookups fast enough we're
probably going to have more keywords
than that so we want to look up to be
faster that third possibility is not
actually true so it doesn't depend on
how many URLs there are and the reason
for that is we're doing a lookup based
on the keywords the number of times we
go through the loop and look up depends
only on the number of elements in index
which is the number of keywords and then
the size of the URL list for each
keyword doesn't impact the time it takes
to do a lookup so it doesn't depend on
the number of your URLs certainly if we
have more pages we're likely to have
more keywords so that would increase the
size of index but just the number of
pages by itself doesn't impact the time
for lookup it does depend on how many
lookups we want to do so if we only want
to do one look up and that look up takes
a few seconds well that's okay it's
probably not worth spending a lot of
time to make that one look up faster but
chances are we're going to want to do
lots of lookups certainly if we wanted
to have a real search engine we'd want
to be able to serve millions of lookups
every day or in the case of Google many
billions of lookups every every hour so
if we want to do lots of lookups we want
look up to be faster so I think we have
good reasons to want to make our look up
faster and we're also going to learn
some interest in computer science
concepts by trying to do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
