this idea to count the number of steps
in Russian as a function of a so the
thing that you should be noticing here
is we now know the number of times this
loop is going to be executed this is the
floor of log base 2 of a plus 1 and for
each of those times
how many statements get executed well
there's these two statements that get
executed unconditionally and then
there's plus this conditional statement
this evaluation here gets executed so
these 3 things get executed and this
additional for statement only gets
executed when X is odd and as we talked
about before that happens however many
times as there are 1 bits in the binary
representation of a so that actually is
enough to get us get us our answer so
let me write it down how many steps is
it going to take to execute Russian a B
well as I said the floor log base 2 of a
rounded down plus 1 is the number of
times the while loop is executed there's
three statements that are going to get
executed inside post additional three
statements that are executed outside
plus there's going to be one statement
executed for each of the bits of a that
is on in particular the summation so
that's kind of a mess we can make it
slightly less of a mess if we notice
that this is upper bounded by four times
the round down logarithm of a plus seven
the reason for that being that the most
number of on bits you can have in a
number is if all the bits are on and how
many bits can you have in a number well
if you have a you have a number like
this a binary number like that each time
you have it you're chopping off one of
the bits the rounded down log base 2 of
the number plus one is actually a count
of the maximum number of bits that you
can have on now one thing that I'd like
to point out here is that this quantity
is much much much much much less in
general than some linear function in a
like what we get for a naive naive grows
a lot faster in fact exponentially
faster literally exponentially faster
than the bound on the running time is
for Russia naive very very bad Russian
actually quite good in him</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
