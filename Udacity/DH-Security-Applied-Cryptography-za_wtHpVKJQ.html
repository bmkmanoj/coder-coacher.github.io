discrete log is hard then we could prove
that definite is secure if we could show
that breaking diffie-hellman implies
that one can also solve the discrete log
problem no one's been able to prove that
instead the security of diffie-hellman
relies on a stronger assumption what's
known as the decisional diffie-hellman
assumption this is a little bit circular
that we're basing the security argument
for diffie-hellman on an assumption that
was invented because this is what
diffie-hellman relies on that seems a
bit circular and indeed it is but it's a
useful way of crystallizing what we
really rely on to know that the
diffie-hellman protocol is secure and
what we're relying on is this property
that G to the XY mod Q and this is how
we're computing the key when the X Y
values when is the secret value and one
is the value that was sent in the
previous message and the assumption is
that this value which is G to the XY mod
Q and that's the value that's computed
as the key and the diffie-hellman
protocol is indistinguishable from
random even to an attacker who knows G G
to the X G to the Y and Q these are the
messages that would be intercepted so if
this assumption is true that would be
enough to prove that the diffie-hellman
protocol is secure and then an attacker
who eavesdrops on all the messages can't
compute the key because what the
assumption is stating is that there's no
way that they could tell the depth value
which is the correct key is any
different from a random number even when
they have access to the information so
this is an assumption and it's even
worse than that it's known that it's not
true for certain values we can show that
it is distinguishable from random so the
security of the diffie-hellman protocol
would follow from this assumption if we
knew this assumption we're true we don't
but people have been trying for a long
time to break diffie-hellman and so far
it seems to be adequately secure that is
certainly not enough to guarantee that
it always will be next we're going to
talk about some issues in actually
implementing diffie-hellman</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
