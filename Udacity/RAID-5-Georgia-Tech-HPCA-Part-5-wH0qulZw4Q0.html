which uses a technique called
distributed block interleaved parity to
protect the disks it does block
interleaved parity just like rate for
but it's parity is not all on the same
disk it is spread among all the disks so
when we have four disks the first set of
stripes in raid 5 will be exactly the
same as in rate for there will be three
stripes of date on the first three disks
and the parity for these three stripes
which is computed by X soaring the data
bit by bit in the three stripes and the
resulting parity stripe is written to
the fourth disc but trade for would do
the same thing and put the next parity
here as well in contrast rate five puts
the next parity stripe not here but on
the next disc so we get three data
stripes on these disks now and their
parity is here then for the next set of
stripes we again move the parity to
another disk and then for the next set
of stripes the parity moves again and
then for the next set of stripes the
parity would again be here and so on so
as you can see the blocked interleaved
parity what it really does is it gets
the parity here and then here and then
here and then here and then again here
so each of the disks will get its fair
share of parity but for each set of
stripes we will have three stripes in
this case and the parity block is just
that the next set of four will have a
parity in a different place so what we
get is the Reed performance we're all
for this can actually be used for
reading data and we get n times the
throughput of one disk remember the
trade for was getting n minus 1 times
the throughput of one disk because one
of the disks was not used for data here
the data is spread over all four disks
so chances are of all the blocks we want
to read they will be equally distributed
among the four disks in this
right performance is still affected by
having to read and then write the data
and the parity so a single right results
in four accesses if you remember we
would read the data block and the parity
and then we would write the data block
and the parity so there are four
accesses / right but they're distributed
among all the disks so we get n over 4
times the throughput of one disk in this
case we have four disks so right
performance is equal to the throughput
of one of the disks if it was used
without rate remember that in rate for a
right performance is always limited to
half the throughput of one disk in this
case it would be half of the performance
of one disperses the full performance of
one disk so we win if we had for example
eight disks here we will get twice the
throughput of one disk with rate for the
eight disks would still have a single
parity disk and the right performance
would still be half the throughput of
that one disk and the reliability of
raid five is the same as rate for this
fails if we lose more than one disk just
like in rate for in any group of four
stripes here we could lose one of the
disks if we lose the parity disk we can
still read everything and right if we
lose a data disk we can reconstruct the
data using the parity here any one of
the disks play the role of a data disk
in some group of stripes and play the
role of a parity disk in some groups of
stripes so all groups of stripes are
still usable after we lose only one disk
if we lose stowe disks however then we
have a problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
