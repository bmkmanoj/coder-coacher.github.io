equilibrium and why you would care about
it I want to first introduce a game this
is game theory after all and this is the
game of chicken are you familiar with
the game of chicken I have seen the game
of chicken on like movies from the 40s
and stuff or 50s or 60s the general tab
part that doesn't make sense to me but
the chicken part it's like cars rushing
at each other and like teenage I'm going
to say boys deciding whether or not
they're going to be chickens and swerve
off the road or whether they're going to
be you know tough guys and risk dying
all right that's exactly right so the
two versions are two cars going towards
one another from room room room room and
who's going to swerve first although
what happens if they swerve in the same
direction I've never a better the other
opps the other one is where they're both
driving towards a cliff ooh as fast as
they can and who's going to either dive
out of the car at the last minute or
turn their car away and the chicken is
the one who loses the girl because this
is the 1950s the girls in the car going
over the clip know the girls are the one
that starts the race oh its the 50s it
was a different time Michael understand
and was it to do with general cells well
I'm or game theory for that matter well
it's a game right in fact we can turn it
into a game and how do we know it's a
game because I can draw a matrix so I'm
gonna say that there are two actions
here you can either chicken out okay or
you can there okay okay so let's just
draw a matrix that captures that idea so
just put it right here okay so there's a
matrix you can either dare or you can be
a chicken okay now if both of you dare
then you both get zero because that's
what death is equal to in this world 0 I
see nothing good ever happens again
right nothing good ever happens again
you just you there so you both got the
girl but you both died so it didn't
really help you don't get to grow if
you're dead that's probably true okay so
on the other hand you could dare and the
other guy could chicken out in which
case you get 7 and the chicken gets to
y2 because you get to live another day
you get to live but you get to live in
constant shame that's exactly right
which is worth to cool apparently all
right or of course this is a symmetric
game so if I chicken out and you dare
works the other way and the other option
is both chicken out and that's a whole
lot better than being
dead and it's actually better than
living in shame alone because you're
sharing the shame but it's not as good
as having dared while the other
chickened out okay okay that sounds good
yeah six seems kind of high but I can
live with that yeah it's it's math
Michael you don't use this really matter
so it's a general some game and it's a
matrix and all this other stuff about
cars and everything don't matter anymore
because everything is the matrix</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
