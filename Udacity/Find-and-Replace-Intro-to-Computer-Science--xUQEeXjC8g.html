two procedures the first one that takes
a match as its input along with a
replacement and it out put some sort of
structure which you'll be able to use in
the second procedure apply converter
which will change a string according to
the match and replacement I'll just do
an example so eh eh eh baa if this is
our match and replacement the ABA will
be replaced with be so the next string
will have will be a a ba then we've got
a ba again so we'll replace that with be
there are no more matches so we stop so
you can see it each step it's changed
and when we change it no more we stop
what our code is going to do is continue
as long as we've made a replacement at
the previous step would with the step
again if we haven't rec'd made a
replacement then we'll stop so on to the
code what structure do I want while i'm
simply going to make a list where the
first entry in the list is the match and
the second entry is the replacement ply
converter has as its input a converter
which we made in make converter so
that's the list and the string that we
want to change I said that I was going
to continue changing the string as long
as the string was not the same as it was
before so we're going to have to keep
track of the previous string and at the
start there isn't a previous string so
while previous is not the same as the
current string I want to carry on with
the loop so as soon as I enter the loop
I want previous to be equal to string
and then I want to look for the match in
the string so the position of the match
we can find using find and we're looking
for the first word in the converter if
we find it
then we're going to replace our string
with a new string which is the first
part of the string up to the position
not excluding it the start position of
our match we replace that with the
replacement and finally we want to
concatenate the part of the string after
the match and we find its position by
starting at the beginning of the match
and adding on the length of the match
and then taking that to the end of the
string and as long as we've made a
change the loop continues if we haven't
make a check made a change the loop ends
and we return the string</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
