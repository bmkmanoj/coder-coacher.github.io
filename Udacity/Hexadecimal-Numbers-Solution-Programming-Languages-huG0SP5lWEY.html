the lexer to handle hexadecimal numbers
so what is a hexadecimal number well
more importantly what is a decimal
number let's go over this very quickly
if you have let's say number you write
out four five one we consider this the
ones place the tens place in the
hundreds place and we do that because
this is the 0s position the one second
and ten to the zero ten to the one 10 to
the 2 this is one ten hundreds and we
calculate the value of this by
multiplying the position of the digit by
the value of the place and so this would
yield 451 in computer science we often
use base two that's because the
electronic circuits that we use in all
our fun little computers are most easily
designed with two states on and off and
that's represented by a 1 or a 0 so the
numbers that we often use are in binary
let's say we have this number 1 1 0 1 in
this case it's not the ones place the
tens place the hundreds place in the
thousands place we've abstracted this
idea of a base so that we have 2 to the
0 2 to the 1 2 to the 2 2 to the 3 and
if we multiply all that out like we did
with the testable number we get 13 so I
still haven't answered what a
hexadecimal numbers hexadecimal is just
base 16 and the reason we really like
base 16 it may seem odd to you at first
is that it's a very nice way of
representing these base two numbers and
handling them in a more concise manner
so 1 1 0 1 I can write that with one
hexadecimal number which is happens to
be d and convention dictates that
whenever you write a hexadecimal number
we're going to put a 0 and an X in front
of it
the 0 and the X don't mean anything
except that it's a hexadecimal number
that follows
so that's hexadecimal and for short I'll
say hex so the goal of this problem is
to modify the lexer to identify numbers
are written in hex and store it
value of the number as what it equals so
we're going to identify the number using
a regular expression and then when you
calculate the value using a formula much
like this so let's go straight to the
IDE so here I have the given code for
this problem let's quickly run through
it right here we have importing new
lexer then we name the tokens that we
want to have num stands for the
hexadecimal numbers that we're going to
identify and ID's pretty much everything
else but the definition is described in
the problem we have two types of nums
one is a decimal number and the other is
going to be the hexadecimal number which
we have to write we ignore spaces tabs
returns etc and we throw an error when
there's something we don't understand we
have some code that runs our lexer for
the sake of texting and then we have
some test cases let's fill in our code
because it's easier let's do the ID
purse we have to come up with a regular
expression the definition for the ID is
pretty simple it's just a railer
expression that matches sequences of
characters with the letters A through Z
regardless of their capitalization and
then we just return it so now we want to
do the definition for hexadecimal
numbers the regular expression here is
also not that bad here we have our
definition for a hexadecimal number we
require that there's a 0 and X because
that's what indicates that this is
written in hex and not decimal and then
we have one or more numbers or letters A
to F in this line I'm going to strip off
the 0 and the X because that doesn't
really help me calculate anything that
has to do with the value of the number
and now I'm going to go through each
digit of our number for every digit that
there is we're going to multiply our
number by 16 that gives us the power of
16 for every digit that we've done so
far here and want to check if the digit
we wrap is between 0 and 9 so we don't
have to do anything special with the
fact that it's a letter
but we do have to do a bit of a
conversion from the fact that it's a
character and not a number so one way to
do this is take the numerical order
value of our digit as minus dot of 0 and
that's going to yield a number between 0
&amp;amp; 9 because they're all together in that
also you could take use int the int
function which can well convert that
string into an integer either way works
here I'm going to handle the case where
the current digit is a letter A through
F I want to find out how many places
away from a it is and I'm going to add
10 so a is going to equal 10 B is going
to be some number minus the value of a
which is going to give 1 so 1 plus 10
plus her number we're going to add 11 to
the number because B represents 11 and
so on I'm going to wrap out this
function by setting the value of this
token to the number and setting the type
to num and returning the token itself
that's everything you have to do for
this problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
