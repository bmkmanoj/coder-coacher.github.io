rectangles now the first interesting
thing about rectangles is that they can
be drawn with two different shape types
they can either be drawn with shape type
line just to get the outlines of the
rectangles or shape type filled to fill
in the rectangles let's go with filled
for now shape renderer rect is
overloaded with about a dozen different
functions to do different things
honestly to have a look at them all you
should probably just check out the
documentation the basic version though
draws an access aligned rectangle
starting with the lower left corner and
then giving the width and the height
let's try running this so far so good
let's do something more interesting we
can do some super fun stuff with the
colors and rectangles like specifying a
color for each corner let's try this
there we go the rectangle smoothly
transitions between the colors at the
corners these next two rectangles are
being drawn in such a way that one's
going to overlap the other so which one
do you think is going to come out on top
is it this red one which is being drawn
first or the green one which is being
drawn second aha looks like the green
one wins when shape renderer is asked to
draw things on top of each other it uses
what's called the painters algorithm
just like the initial layers of paint
laid down by a painter get covered up by
what gets painted later
similarly shapes that are drawn later on
will cover up shapes that were drawn
earlier we can also use shape renderer
to draw rotated rectangles now here's
where the signature of rect starts
getting pretty crazy and the
documentation will come in handy again
here is the bottom left corner and
here's the width and height now in this
entry is the origin about which will be
rotating so if the width and height are
both a hundred then 50/50 is right in
the middle of the rectangle then we have
the X scale the Y scale and rotation so
we're drawing this 100 by 100 but then
we're gonna squash it by 50%
horizontally and rotated by 45 degrees
same thing with this one except we're
gonna rotate it 135 degrees let's check
out what this looks like cool so we've
got two rectangles that were drawn at
the same spot
they were smashed by 50% horizontally
and then the yellow one was rotated by
45 degrees so it was initially straight
up and down and now it's tilted to the
left and the green ones been rotated by
135 degrees to more easily understand
what's going on with this origin
parameter let's try something very
similar the setup is almost identical
but instead of the origin being in the
middle of the rectangle the origin is
now down at the bottom left corner of
the rectangle so now the rectangles
instead of being rotated about their
center are being rotated about this
bottom left corner OpenGL has an
interesting quirk it knows how to draw
in filled shapes but it doesn't know how
to draw thick lines so if we want a
thick line what we actually need is just
a rotated super skinny rectangle
thankfully a shape renderer gives us a
super simple way to do this it's called
rect line we give it the X on the Y
position of the start of the line the x
and y position of the end of the line
and the thickness and there we go we get
a fat line alright last thing time for
some silliness let's draw a rainbow
flower this saw might come in handy for
the next quiz pretty cool all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
