app you're going to see this app in
different forms but the core concept for
the app will be the same every time that
you work with it you start with their
hero robot who need some help exploring
this strange new planet above the robot
we see some dialogue and if we tap the
screen then we can progress through the
conversation so I'll tap the screen and
our robot starts moving along and we've
reached our first alien encounter I'm
going to be quiet for now and I'm gonna
let you read the dialogue
well that wasn't so good our robot
didn't give the alien anything but
that's where you come in each time I
Robot encounters an alien a question is
going to be asked it'll be your job to
correct the code responsible for making
the robots decisions I'm going to go
ahead and make a quick fix and see what
it might look like if a robot answers
more intelligently okay let's give this
another go I'll tap and I'll let you
read the dialogue
you
nice the robot made it through now you
probably noticed in this demo each alien
always ask the same question they were
looking for the most valuable object in
the robots inventory that won't always
be the case if you work on this app will
keep introducing new more complex
questions but I know you can handle it
the robots adventure depends on it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
