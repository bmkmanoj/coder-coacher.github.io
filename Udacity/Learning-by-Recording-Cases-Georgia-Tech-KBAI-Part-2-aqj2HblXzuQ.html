happening and learning by recording
cases there is a new problem a shown by
the color here and memory contains a
large number of cases again represented
by the different colors here so we
retrieve the case B that is most similar
to the new problem a in this particular
case we're deciding the color and
whatever was the solution to B we apply
to the situation a while this
visualization is useful is still very
abstract let's think in terms of some
practical everyday examples so you get
up in the morning and you want to go for
a run you put on your sneakers you have
to tie your shoelaces well how do you
tie your shoelaces that's a new problem
but of course you have tied shoelaces
many many times earlier so you have a
memory of kind shoelaces two different
kind of shoes let's all store these
cases in the memory so you start tying
the shoelaces were you shoot today you
simply retrieve the closest matching
case and apply it none of us really
thinks very hard in the morning about
how exactly to tie shoelaces if you were
to do it don't take us a very long time
so in learning by recording cases memory
directly supplies us with the answer we
don't have to think about it so another
example of this that comes to mind is in
programming oftentimes in programming we
deal with the same type of problem over
and over again so I might imagine I'm
starting out a new program and I'm
writing a program in Java so I'm given a
new problem of creating a new program in
Java all I'm going to do is look back in
my memory of cases in retrieve another
case of starting a new program in Java
and I'm going to apply the solution to
that program directly to this one in
this case it's going to be something
like when I'm starting a new program in
Java
last time I started with public static
void main when to apply that solution
directly to my new problem and it works
the solution can just be transferred
directly to the new problem without any
kind of modification then later in
developing that same program I might hit
for example a null pointer error I'm
going to use that null pointer error as
a new problem and use it as a probe into
my memory I'm then going to retrieve a
case of what I encountered a null
pointer error in the most similar
program I've worked on and that's going
to give me a solution that I potentially
can apply directly to my current problem
so for example the solution to the last
time I encountered that same error
might be to run the program in debug
mode and allowed to tell me exactly what
variable is Nowell at the time of
execution there's a good example David
and we can even try to generalize it to
medical diagnosis imagine that you went
to a medical doctor with a set of
science and symptoms so the doctor is
faced with a new problem what is the
diagnosis for your signs and symptoms
the doctor may even have a number of
cases recorded in her memory these are
the cases she's encountered during her
experience so the doctor may select in
most similar case the most closely
resembling case which mean this case
might be B and say that I applied to a
exactly the same diagnosis that I
replied to B so a case then is an
encapsulation of a past experience and
learning by recording cases was a very
powerful method that works in a very
large number of situations ranging from
tying your shoelaces to medical
diagnosis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
