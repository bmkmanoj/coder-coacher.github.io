machine which contains a couple of files
and I want to put one of them into HDFS
all of the commands which interact with
the Hadoop file system start with Hadoop
FS so first of all let's see what we
have in HDFS to start with I do that by
saying Hadoop FS minus LS that gives me
a listing of what's in my home directory
on the Hadoop cluster because I'm logged
into the local machine as a user called
training my home directory in HDFS is
slash user slash training and as you can
see there's nothing there so now let's
upload our purchases txt file we do that
with Hadoop FS - put purchases txt
Hadoop FS - put takes a local file and
places it into HDFS since I'm not
specifying a destination file name it'll
be uploaded with the same filename so it
takes a few seconds to upload and now I
can do another Hadoop FS minus LS and we
can see that that file is now in HDFS I
can take a look at the last few lines of
the file by saying Hadoop FS - tail and
then the filename and that just displays
the last few lines on the screen for me
there's also a Hadoop FS - cat which
will display the entire contents of the
file and we'll use that later there are
plenty of other Hadoop FS commands and
as you'll probably have started to
realize the closely mirrors standard
UNIX file system commands so if I want
to rename the file for example I can say
Hadoop FS minus MV which moves purchases
txt in this case - new name txt if I
want to delete a file Hadoop FS minus RM
will remove that file for me so let's
get rid of new name dot txt from HDFS I
create a directory in HDFS by saying
Hadoop FS - make deer and then the
directory name and now let's upload
purchases txt and place it in the my
input directory so that it's ready for
processing by HDFS once I've done that
Hadoop FS minus LS my input will show me
the contents of that directory
and just as I expected there's the file</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
