of rotation and scaling or reversed that
is first we'd rotate and then we'd scale
our sphere four o'clock exercise the
result would look like this the rotation
seems to have had no effect think about
what the order of operations actually
does to the object first we rotate the
sphere this has little effect of what we
see on the screen aspira looks pretty
much the same from any angle so by doing
the rotation first we've essentially
lost its effect stretching the sphere
afterwards gives us the shape we want
but the rotation has already been done
at this point I want to show you a great
program for experimentation the 3gs
interactive scene editor see the
additional course materials for link to
this program to start let's add a sphere
to the scene it comes in black as
there's really no light in the scene so
let's add a directional light put it
over here and select our sphere we can
move our sphere around and you can see
the change of position over here you can
also rotate it and obviously doesn't
look very different because it's a
sphere but you can also non-uniformly
scale it so here we've scaled it a bit
and I can rotate it and you can see the
effect give this program a try it's
really excellent for figuring out how
rotation scales and positions work
together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
