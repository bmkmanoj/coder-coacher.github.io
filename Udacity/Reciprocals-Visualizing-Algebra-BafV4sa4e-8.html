this division sign is what's really
interesting about the problem dividing
by a number is actually the same as
multiplying by the reciprocal the
reciprocal of a number is 1 divided by
that number so for example the
reciprocal of three would be one-third
the reciprocal of a fraction a over B is
B over a this was actually true for the
number three we can rewrite 3 as 3/1
since that's still three and notice the
reciprocal of 3/1 is 1/3 or one-third so
the reciprocal of negative 5 force would
be negative four-fifths and the
reciprocal of one seventh would be 7
over 1 or just positive 7 now what we
know what a reciprocal is let's go back
to this division we said dividing by a
number is the same as multiplying by its
reciprocal so i can change 4 divided by
2 into 4 times one-half so if i do 1
half times for i know i should get to
whether we know it or not we actually x
fractions right here for is the same as
4/1 and i got a result of two we're
going to look more closely at this
throughout the rest of the lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
