camera is and how to work with it let's
see one in action this demo creates a
simple scene which you can view through
two different cameras the first camera
just displays an overview of the scene
but the second camera the close-up
camera you can move and zoom give it a
try so once the demo is running you can
use the arrow keys to move the close-up
camera around the scene now here's the
interesting bit if you hit space you can
see the scene from the overview camera
along with a blue rectangle showing what
the close-up camera sees you can zoom
the close-up camera using Z to zoom in
and X to zoom out what's really
happening is we're reducing the portion
of the scene that's visible to the
close-up camera you can also change the
viewport height using W and s and the
viewport width using a and D when the
viewport is wide and short the world
looks super vertically stretched when
the viewport is tall and skinny the
world looks horizontally stretched you
can hit f2 set the aspect ratio of the
camera back to the aspect ratio of the
screen you can also rotate the camera
using Q and E beware that very strange
things happen when you've rotate a
camera that's super stretched finally
note that you can easily zoom the
close-up camera out to the point where
it can see more than the scene overview
camera so no matter how deep we get into
matrices and viewports and whatnot
remember that this is what cameras do
determine what portion of the world you
can see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
