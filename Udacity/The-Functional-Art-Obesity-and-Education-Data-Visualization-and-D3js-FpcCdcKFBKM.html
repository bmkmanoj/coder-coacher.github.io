interview with Cole I'd like you to read
about a blog post that we're going to
discuss you can find a link to that blog
post in the instructor notes this post
was shared by Andy Cree Bell a data
visualization guru over at Facebook he's
got an interesting blog named vizwiz and
he's also got a really funny quote on
his main page we'll talk more about why
this is true towards the end of the
course but I just wanted to show you
this humorous quote for now what I'd
like you to do is read through each of
these tabs by clicking on the next
button in each of these panels Alberto
Cairo is going to walk you through the
design process for creating data
visualizations he lays out how he
created the graphic for the cover of his
book in the final tab you'll actually
get to see that graphic and I really
want you to take some time to play
around with the final graphic that he
arrives at and then answer these next
questions what's the average percentage
of obese people in all the states which
state has the largest percentage of its
population that attained a bachelor's
degree or more enter that two-letter
state abbreviation here and then finally
do more states have an a majority of
obese people or educated people choose
one of these</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
