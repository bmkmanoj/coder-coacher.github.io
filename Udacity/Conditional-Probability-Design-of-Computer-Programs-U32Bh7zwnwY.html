writing with a pen wouldn't be in a
computer class so let's start modeling
this and so we're going to do our
concept inventory so what do we have
well these individual results here come
from random variables so random variable
is like the first child born which can
be a boy or a girl the whole universe is
called a sample space and then these
individual sets of circles are called
events like the event of having two boys
or the event of having at least one boy
and an event consists then of a
collection of sample points so sample
point is BG gb or BB in terms of
representation we're going to just
represent sample points as strings so
we'll have like the string GG and we can
represent events two ways as a
collection of strings or as a predicate
a function which is true of certain
strings and not of others so here's what
i did i imported itertools because we're
going to need that i searched for and
found a new class called fractions
within the fractions module and there's
a function or a constructor called
fraction which produces an exact
fraction and the reason I wanted that is
because when the answer is one-third I
wanted to see that it was exactly one
third I didn't want to see that it's
point 3 3333 so all a fraction is is a
numerator and a denominator paired
together and they know how to do
arithmetic so here's my random variable
I represent that as a collection of
possibilities and here I just drunk the
possibilities together I could have said
set of B and G or the list of B comma G
but I just put them together as a string
then I said we can combine random
variables with a Cartesian product and I
used itertools product and then I just
said get all the results to and which
itertools product produces two poles and
I want to look at them as strings and so
now two kids is the product of two
children and we're just so
if I evaluate that I get this collection
and one boy is just the points in two
kids that have at least one boy in the
string so it would be this one this one
and this one and then i can define two
boys as a predicate that's saying that's
true when the count of the number of
boys is equal to two that would be true
here and finally i can define my
conditional probability that says what's
the probability of p given e where is an
event specified as a list of sample
points all equally probable and
predicate is a predicate that returns
true or false of elements of that event
and so the true elements are just the
ones for which it is true and then I
return a fraction how many out of the
event satisfy the predicate and I can
ask what's the conditional probability
of two boys given one boy and the answer
is 13 so that's what we expected</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
