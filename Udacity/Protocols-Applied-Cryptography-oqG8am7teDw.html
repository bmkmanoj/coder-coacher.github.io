silly example but something that will
illustrate many of the properties that
are important for cryptographic
protocols as usual we have Alice and Bob
she's Alice in case you cannot recognize
her and we have Bob and Alice and Bob
wanted to decide whose turn it is to
charge the Robo dog if you can't
recognize my drawing this is indeed of
Robo dog but they're not in the same
place they're trying to do this over the
telephone they would normally do this by
tossing a coin so they decide let's try
to toss a coin over the telephone so
this is the first protocol they try so
before describing the protocol I want to
define more carefully what I mean by a
protocol we've actually seen a few
already but I haven't defined what a
protocol means and a protocol involves
two or more parties and what it is it's
a precisely defined sequence of steps
and what each step can involve is some
computation as well as communication and
communication can involve sending data
between the parties in the protocol one
way to think of this it's really the
same thing we mean by a procedure in
computing that's something that we can
define precisely enough that we can
follow it mechanically
but unlike a procedure which is thought
of normally as being followed by one
processor or at least a set of
processors controlled by the same party
with a protocol we have two or more
participants involved so that's why it
involves both computation as well as
communication in this class we're mostly
concerned with cryptographic protocols
which means one more thing that involves
secrets and the usual reason we want to
involve secrets is because we want it to
be a security protocol and a security
protocol means that it provides some
guarantees even if some of the
participants cheat and that means they
don't follow the steps as specified
so now let's describe our first protocol
for this and this is intended as a
cryptographic security protocol and its
participants are two parties Alice and
Bob the Robo dog that needs charging is
certainly involved in this process but
is not an active participant in the
protocol and here are the steps so the
protocol starts
by Alice initiating it so she initiates
the protocol by sending Bob a message
that says I'll toss the coin you call it
Bob calls the coin and so he sends a
message back to Ellis that says I call
tails at this point Ellis tosses the
coin and she responds to Bob that sorry
with the result of the coin toss in this
case she'll respond sorry it landed on
the edge and it's Bob's turn to walk the
Robo dog so I think I won't insult your
intelligence by asking a quiz about
whether this protocol works well if it
was a non security protocol and Alice
and Bob trusted each other completely
maybe it would work
Bob can trust Alice to actually toss a
coin and tell Bob the real result if
it's a security protocol it doesn't work
at all if Bob doesn't trust Alice Alice
decides the result whether Bob wins or
loses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
