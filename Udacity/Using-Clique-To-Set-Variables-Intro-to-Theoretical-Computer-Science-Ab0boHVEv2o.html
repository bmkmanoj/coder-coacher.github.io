graph does have a clique of size M then
what will happen is the following
so it contains exactly one vertex that
corresponds to a variable in that clause
and what we also know is because we
constructed the graph this way that we
cannot have two vertices connected here
in this graph where there's a conflict
so what we cannot have in this graph for
example is one vertex that represents
not x2 and another vertex that
represents x2 because we avoided this in
the construction but this directly shows
us how we can satisfy this boolean
formula here so if we have a not x2 here
we just set it to 0 so we could just set
this one to false so that not x2 becomes
true then this Clause here is satisfied
and also this one over here would be
satisfied and x1 that's a separate
variable so we still so we can set it as
we want and we could also set this one
to false so we have x2 and we can set
that to false so that not x2 becomes
true so that becomes true that becomes
true that one here is false over here we
have not x2 as well so there's no
conflict here x1 we haven't yet talked
about x1 but we can just do the same
thing we can set x1 to false so that the
whole thing not x1 becomes true we've
set it to false and we haven't even
looked at x3 but all of the clauses are
already satisfied and that's actually
the cool thing that you notice here x3
is also not contained in the clique so
the vertices in the clique tell you how
to set the variables so that the boolean
formula can be satisfied so what if this
graph here does not have a clique of
size M well in this case it means that
we have one Clause group which is not
contained in the clique and if we have
one Clause group that is not contained
in the clique this means that there's no
vertex in the clause group that has
connections to all of the other vertices
in in the smaller clique that we're
looking for and that means due to the
way we constructed the graph that every
vertex has a conflict with another
vertex in the clique
so if there is no large click this means
that every assignment of true and false
to the variables will lead to a conflict
such that at least one of the clauses
cannot be satisfied so then the boolean
formula does not have a satisfying
assignment so now that we have this
reduction we know that clique is
np-complete which of course makes Bob a
little unhappy so now what about vertex
cover an independent set are those
problems np-complete or are we not sure
