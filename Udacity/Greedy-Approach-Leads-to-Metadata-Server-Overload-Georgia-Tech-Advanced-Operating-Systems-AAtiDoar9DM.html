called a meadow server overload let's
understand how that happens let's say
that there's a whole bunch of users that
are generating content and one guy
generates a content with a key 149
another guy generates a content with a
key 148 152 153 and so on and now what
they want to do is they want to place
this key value pair this guy's noo
tidies ad this guy's notoriety is
something else something else something
else and all these guys want to keep the
key value pair and what will they do in
terms of this greedy algorithm well
they'll try to find a node whose ID is
closest to the key that they want to
place well it turns out that 150 is the
closest ID corresponding to all of these
keys that we're talking about here so
all of these puts will result in going
to one node namely the node ID 150 in
terms of the put operation and first of
all there's going to be congestion here
if a lot of content hash to a key that
are so closely together they all end up
in the same node ID 150 remember that
the actual content is with the puter of
this key value pair namely node 80 and
similarly the content is with this
footer content with this puter what this
guy is storing is the metadata that
allows everybody to discover the content
provider so not only is this node going
to find a lot of traffic if lots of keys
map to its node ID also the nodes that
are adjacent to this node in the overlay
Network they are going to be affected
also everybody is trying to reach this
guy so you can see that as we go towards
this there is sort of a tree saturation
effect that's going on the tree is
rooted at this destination node and the
nodes that are in close proximity the
intermediate nodes in the overlay
Network space they get congested and so
one and that is what is sometimes
referred to as a tree saturation problem
now this is for the porters further if
my content whose key value is stored
here the video that I generated from the
india trip if that gets hot and
everybody wants to find out how to
retrieve that particular video 149
they're all going to make get calls and
these get calls again end up with the
same metadata server because that's the
guy that is storing my key value pair
149 ed and so all these gets saying that
i want to get 149 i want to get 149 i
want to get 149 all of them go to the
same node ID 150 again there is
congestion at the metadata server it can
happen either because some content is so
popular that everybody that wants to
discover the content provider they have
only the key and they have to go to the
metadata server to find out the content
provider so that results in this
congestion which is the metadata server
overload problem and the combination of
these boots and gets result in what I
call the tree saturation problem the
tree being rooted at the congested node
and affecting all the nearby nodes in
the overlay Network because they are the
gateway to get to this node that
contains this particular key value pair</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
