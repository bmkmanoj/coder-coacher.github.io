originally from Germany as you can hear
and I'm emeritus professor here at
Stanford and also senior medical
director 23andme so we have three
billion base pairs and just one copy of
the human genome and we've learned that
you know we have two copies of the human
genome of the nuclear genome and our
cells and we've been learning a bit
about the coding regions the
protein-coding regions what what can you
tell us about the relative size of the
protein-coding regions of the genome
versus those sort of non-coding regions
the big question was how many protein
coding genes are there in the genome and
initially before the genome project CI
the number that's been kicked around was
like a hundred thousand sort of a wild
guess and then between two thousand and
two thousand sweet there was an official
betting game going on where people could
put on a dollar and a number and then
the years later it was five dollars and
then it was twenty dollars because
animals became more difficult and
everybody could only put down one bit
about 150 people put down a bit and they
arranged the ranges of their guesses
went from you wouldn't believe it 25,000
to 150,000 so nobody had really any good
ideas you mean was around 60 1,000 genes
and when the first draft was published
they said why we had a brief look at it
and we think it's between Saudi and
35,000 and when it was finally finished
the number had come down to 20 to 25,000
and many people were surprised because
this is hardly any mores and the
roundworm was a fruit fly so the humans
are so much more complex shouldn't they
have more protein coding genes so the
complexity cannot be immediately deduced
from the number of genes when you don't
know what these genes can be used for so
what percentage of the genome is
actually made up of coding region
roughly it's only one to two percent and
so all this other you know now
98 and 99 percent then I mean a lot of
people who you know just learning about
the genome may be wondering what exactly
is the rest of that sequence doing you
see originally people thought it was
just junk it was just a virus getting in
and replicating itself and in recent
years people started to look at how much
of that sequence is being made into RNA
how much is being transcribed and to
everyone's surprise more than eighty
percent is actually made into a copy of
RNA and these our knees have all kinds
of interesting functions for example to
regulate activity of other genes to
regulate the activity of messenger RNAs
how they are being translated and many
different functions that the rnase have
some of them are structural when they
are RNA sarahs structural components of
the ribosome and otherwise outside of
the coding sequence their control
regions that are important to regulate
the activity of each gene see so we
learn in this lesson about messenger RNA
mrna and so what you're saying there are
actually other kinds of RNAs that can be
made besides mRNA that doesn't get
turned into protein that's right and
what was found out recently that you
remember there are two strands in the
DNA and the messenger RNA is only made
of one strand that gives the information
for the protein but what is being found
out now is that there are anti-sense
rnase but actually the other strand of
DNA can also be made into Arnie it goes
in the opposite direction it has no
coding function for proteins usually not
sometimes it does but it has regulatory
function when you just can imagine if a
gene is transcribed in the other
direction then the transcription of the
messenger RNA has a problem you know it
runs into it's a train wreck white so
there is a regulation of gene activity
by antisense RNA that's one mechanism
right so it sounds like maybe some of
the complexity of different species or
the complexity of cells is in part not
so much the sheer content the number of
genes you have but maybe how you
regulate all
genes together to create something what
we are finding out now is that the
genome equations communicate with each
other that you can have an enhancer
region that is downstream away from the
gene or even in an intron of another
gene but then folds over communicates
with the promoter and sets in motion the
messenger RNA synthesis so the whole
genome is three-dimensional it's not
just one dimensional series of letters
it has a lot of three-dimensional
arrangement and interaction that's very
important for its function</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
