introduce some trigonometry into the
equation so here's Robin and you can
tell by her determined face that she
really wants to push this cart through
this brick wall and it seems like she's
not having very much luck in this
example something's different from last
time Robin isn't pushing exactly to the
right or exactly to the left she's
pushing at some angle and let's call
that angle here alpha I'm sure you can
already see the triangles forming in
your head let's take a look at what's
going on over here I'm going to draw a
diagram for the cart force diagram of
course as always we have the carts
weight pointing downwards and notice I
didn't even tell you what M was we don't
even care we have some normal force
pointing upwards we know because the car
isn't falling to the ground we have
Robin who's pushing well it looks like
she's pushing down and to the right so
I'm actually gonna put that force over
here let's label it fr4 Robin and we
can't forget that the wall is pushing to
the left of course if the wall weren't
there the cart would be free to roll but
since it is and it's stopping the motion
the wall itself must be providing a
force let's call that FW for a wall now
when I look at this force diagram
something jumps out to me I've got these
forces which are both vertical the wall
force which is exactly to the left and
then the force of Robin pushing which is
causing me some pain it's not to the
right it's not straight down it's some
combination of right and down wait a
second though I know how to handle this
this is just me breaking down a vector
into its components let's make a right
triangle where this will be the
hypotenuse well here's our right
triangle and now we see we get our angle
alpha back again and let's label these
sides well this is the horizontal
component of Robins pushing and this is
the vertical component so I'm going to
label them FR x and f ry one thing
that's important to remember is that by
writing FR
as these two together we can now get rid
of FR this is the exact same trick we
did last unit when we had some initial
velocity and it was at some angle alpha
we broke that velocity into x and
y-components here were doing the exact
same thing but with forces and just like
with velocity once we had expressed it
in terms of components x and y we didn't
care about this guy anymore
likewise we're now using the x and y
components of Robins pushing and we're
not going to think about this too much
anymore but we still have to answer the
question what are these values for the x
and y components of Robins pushing let
me give you some numbers so that
this is less abstract let's say that the
force Robin is pushing with is a hundred
Newton's total that's fr and this angle
she's pushing it is thirty degrees
can you use your knowledge of trig to
tell me what is fr X and what is fr why
enter your answer is here and here to
one decimal place I'll be very impressed
if you can get this right on your first
