problems that we can handle with
simulation that is choosing using a
random number generator some samples and
hoping that their representative of the
problem and if you choose enough you get
a close enough representation and i'll
turn the strategy is enumeration where
we actually go over all the
possibilities and we can compute an
exact probability now some problems are
so complex that it would take forever to
do that but computers are much better at
it than people are and so it's a
powerful strategy will show you some
simple examples and they can scale up to
more complex ones so let's imagine all
the possible families living in houses
and these houses have different
properties this one is colored red and
has an English men this one has a zebra
and so on but for now we're only
interested in the children that live in
those houses and in fact we're only
interested in the houses that have
exactly two children so we're going to
not consider some of them and consider
the other ones that have exactly two
children and then we want to be able to
ask questions of them and we can ask
probability questions we're going to
queer going to constrain ourselves to
ask conditional probability questions so
what is the probability of event a given
event B and an event is just a state of
affairs so event B might be the event of
the family having exactly two children
and so we've crossed off these houses
and we're only taking these other ones
and then event a might be the
probability of having a boy or a girl
saying now in real life we can do
simulation by going out and polling and
asking people in mathematics we can do
enumeration if we make certain
assumptions and so one assumption we can
make is that it's exactly fifty percent
probable that you get a boy and fifty
percent probable that you get a girl and
that one birth is independent from
another so let's address the question
what's the probability of having two
boys given that there's at least one boy
in the family and the universe of
possibilities is only the families that
have
exactly two children so we could put
that here in the condition as well at
least one boy and two children total
what do you think this probability is
equal to let's put your answer here and
enter it in the form of a fraction so if
you think it's one half foot one and two
if you think it's eleven seventeen put
11 and 17</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
