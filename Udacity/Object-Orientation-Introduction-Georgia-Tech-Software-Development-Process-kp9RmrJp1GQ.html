object orientation and the fundamental
concepts behind it and let's start by
discussing what exactly is object
orientation if you're younger than me it
could be that the first programming
language you learned was already an
object-oriented language but things were
not always like this before object
orientation became prevalent people were
not used to think in terms of objects so
what happened afterwards and what does
it mean to think in terms of objects and
to follow an object-oriented approach
first of all it means to give precedence
of data over function data items rather
than functionality become the center of
development activities this also allows
for enforcing the very important concept
of information hiding which is the
encapsulation and segregation of data
behind well-defined and ideally stable
interfaces in order to be able to hide
the design and also implementation
decisions and not that the terms
encapsulation and information hiding are
often used interchangeably although some
people prefer to think of information
hiding has been the principle and
encapsulation being the technique to
achieve information hiding the key
concept though no matter which term you
use is really to gather to seclude these
data behind sort of a wall and give
access to the data
only through interfaces that you the
developer defined and why is that
important or for many reason and one of
the main ones is that it makes code more
maintainable because the rest of the
code the rest of the system doesn't have
to be concerned on how the
implementation details or the design are
defined and therefore any change that
happens behind this wall doesn't concern
the rest of the system and doesn't
affect the rest of the system as long as
you keep your interfaces consistent
another advantage of focusing on objects
and encapsulating the information into
cohesive and it is is that it allows the
reuse of object definitions by
incremental refinement which is what we
normally call inheritance and
inheritance is definitely a fundamental
concept in audit orientation for example
we can define a car as a refinement of
the vehicle that there's some additional
characteristics with respect to a
generic vehicle and then we can use the
car wherever a vehicle can be used which
is what we call polymorphism and we
continue this disk
for a very long time because there are
so many things that could be discussed
when we talk about object orientation
its characteristics and its advantages
but in the interest of time let's for
now just stop here and start talking
about two key concepts in object
orientation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
