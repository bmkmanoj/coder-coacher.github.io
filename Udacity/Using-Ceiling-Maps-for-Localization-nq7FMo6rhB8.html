annika so we're not using depth sensor
anymore and this is about as simple a
vision as you can imagine so this is
work that was done by Frank del art
who's a professor now at Georgia Tech in
our robotics and vision group but in
1997 he was like six years old it looks
like no that's not Frank that's some kid
at the Museum Frank Frank was doing his
PhD at the time he did something very
cool they said you know we've got this
ceiling and the ceiling has lights in it
if we had a map of the lights we should
eventually be able to figure out where
we are by just do we see light or don't
we see light and the way that works is
you had a robot with a little camera
that just looked up all right here's
that little square and it would just see
you did I see something bright medium or
tort a dark right it could just get a
small number of sensor values or you
could think of it as just taking the
total value as saying about how bright
is that spot now to do that what I have
to be able to do is given being anywhere
in here I have to know what is the
probability of getting that brightness
in the image so that's what this shows
here that if this was actually the
brightness this is the probability of
the brightness that I would see so the
idea being if this is the actual
brightness of the state X of the
position then this is the likelihood of
what I would see so for example suppose
I'm under a light ok so typically what I
see is this brightest patch here and
this map is the likelihood of getting
that bright measurement at these
locations and by the way in this map the
black are the high points so you see
each one of these lights so if I was
actually under the lights the likelihood
of seeing something bright is high
otherwise the like that have seen
something bright is low sort of near a
light I'm going to see the tend to see
these gray things and when I'm far away
from a light I'm going to see mostly
darkness so those are Pee of Z's given X
and then here's the thing running and
it's a little hard to see you see all
these red dots
is going and what's happening is the
robot is actually following this red
line and it comes in and it goes down
and you'll notice after a little while
it knows exactly where it is now it's
going to turn off to the to the right
over here somewhere and if it hangs out
in a dark area for a while its
uncertainty grows because it doesn't
know exactly where it's moving in that
dark in that dark area okay so you're
watching it and it's doing some cool
stuff what's interesting is so we have
this map of the thing we can compare two
things the robot knows the commands that
gave to its wheels okay so it knows how
far it thinks it went it also knows how
much it thinks it turned you guys have
an odometer in your car Dominator
measures distance odometry is when you
measure how you think you moved based
upon how your wheels turned if we plot
on this map where the robot thinks it
went based upon its wheels turning we
see something that looks like this okay
and the reason we know that that's wrong
is that these are areas that it can
actually go through and you see it gets
sort of right but then it sort of gets a
little confused and it's going through
parts that it can't actually go through
when we add vision and why do I say add
vision well we still use the odometry as
the deterministic part Meghan jump for
that thing right so the odometry says
well you moved a foot to the right okay
so we add that that's our prediction
part so we still use the odometry but
then the measurement from the vision
improves our result okay and that gets
us the much better result and this is
using essentially a camera just looking
at a little area and saying in my
brighter in my dark or Wow bright is it
and I have a map of the ceiling so it's
pretty cool well done Frank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
