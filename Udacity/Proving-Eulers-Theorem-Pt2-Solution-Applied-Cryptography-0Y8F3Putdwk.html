are true for the first one we know that
the size of R is equal to the totient of
n that's the way the ocean is defined
it's the number of positive integers
less than n that are relatively prime to
n that's exactly how we define a heart
the second one is not true in order for
this not to be true and mean that
there's some element where a X I mod n
is equal to a X J mod n but that's not
the case because a n n are relatively
prime so we know that these values must
all be different that the only way these
could be equal is if X I is equal to XJ
that means that the sets are the same
size and this set contains numbers only
up to n minus 1 this set also contains
numbers from 1 to n minus 1 so that's
why we know that s actually contains the
same elements as our it must be a
permutation of arm now we can use a
similar idea to what we used in the
proof for Fermat's little theorem we can
take the product of these two sets since
we know they contain the same elements
we know their products are also equal so
here's what we get the product of r is
equal to the excise all multiplied
together which is equal to the product
of s which is equal to these values all
multiplied together and we also know
from this property that the number of
terms is the totient of n that's true
on both sides so that means we can
separate out the A's from the X's so
we're going to have a to the totient of
n power times all the X's still equal to
this product and now we can do the
division removing the excess from both
sides so we end up with exactly what we
need which is that 1 is congruent to a
to the totient of n power mod n for any
a n n where n are relatively prime</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
