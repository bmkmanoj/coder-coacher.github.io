representation of the relationship
between a and B in one view of the
transformation from A to B we can think
of Q the outer circle is remaining
unchanged and P the inner circle is
getting deleted let's look at another
view of the transformation from A to B
in this view we can think of P as
getting expanded and Q the outer circle
is getting deleted both of these views
are valid views if both of these views
are valid then how would anyone decide
how would an AI agent decide which view
to select let us suppose that the AI
agent had a metric by which it could
decide upon the ease of transformation
from A to B let us suppose that metric
assigned different weights to different
kind of transformations you will notice
that this transformation is like scaling
rotation reflection make for affine
transformations in this scale a larger
value like five points means more ease
of transformation and created similarity
a lower value means less easier
transformation a more difficult
transformation and less similarity given
the scale let us calculate the weight of
transformations for both transformation
number one and transformation number two
in transformation number one you can see
that P is getting deleted which we gave
a weight of 1 and Q remains unchanged
which would give a weight of 5 so the
total weight here is 6
in case of transformation number 2 the
weight of P being expanded we said will
be 2 scaled and Q getting deleted is 1
so the total weight is 3 if we prefer
the first transformation over the second
transformation that we can see why
someone will answer this square as the
correct answer and not a triangle let us
return to this exercise and now we can
see why both 3 &amp;amp; 5 are legitimate
answers we can also see why an AI agent
pepper 4-5 given this similarity matter
that we talked about in the last shot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
