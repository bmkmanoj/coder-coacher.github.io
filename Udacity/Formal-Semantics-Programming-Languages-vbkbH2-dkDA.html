what programs mean and especially what
they mean in terms of their context the
environment in which they operate this
is called formal semantics and while it
may initially seem a bit dry it's
actually one of my favorite topics in
computer science in fact before my
research moved on to the greater glory
of fixing bugs and programs I started
out trying to find bugs in programs and
one of the surprising lessons in finding
bugs in programs is that both the
program and our idea of what it should
mean matter all of you have probably had
a bug in your code at some point or
another and officially a bug is really
just an instance where the program's
meaning is different from its
specification what it does do and what
it should do don't agree a perhaps
surprising result is that in industrial
practice a lot of the time the mistake
is actually with the specification and
you've probably seen this in real life a
friend might have asked you to do
something you go and do it faithfully
only to discover that that wasn't
actually what the friend wanted to have
happen it's just what they told you to
do the same sort of thing comes up in
bug finding and bug fixing research
often the formal specification for a
problem this would never happen for the
homework problems here is vague or
imprecise not enough to tell you exactly
what's supposed to happen regardless of
whether the problem is with the source
code or the specification understanding
what code means in context is critical
to figuring out if it's right or wrong
and that's what we're going to do in
this unit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
