curve of learning angular the learning
curve is actually kind of like jagged
for angular because there's like mini
levels so they go like that the way I
like to think about learning framework
is you learn it as a user so you know
how to use it very very well but then
you learn it as a developer where you
actually know how it works and you
contribute to it so on the user side it
was it was pretty straightforward it was
it was kind of steep at first and might
have to do with my skills in JavaScript
generally they were not that good at the
time but I like to think of it as like
actually the less you know it's probably
better because angular introduces a lot
of new concepts and if you don't have to
unlearn something to learn English
probably a lot easier but the learning
curve was I guess it depends on how you
go at it if you like read books and
stuff it's going to be kind of jagged
you're going to read this blog that says
do it this way and this blog says this
way but actually if you just dive right
in and start building stuff with it
you'll realize that it's actually not
that difficult and it's pretty
straightforward and you could probably
get a nap done in a couple hours so just
keep building with it and then on the
developer side learning how angular
works internally and be able to
contribute to it that just took forever
I mean I literally have to take angular
part rebuild it from scratch and all
types of stuff to really understand how
it works what are some recurring
JavaScript techniques or concepts that
you found most useful when learning a
framework whew with this day and age for
sure is modules having some type of
module pattern and JavaScript because
you know on the web every line of code
you write is going to be in a global
scope and that's just not--that's just
not good so frameworks introduced some
type of module pattern to encapsulate
your coat so adopt adopting that pattern
whether it's through the framework or
using something like es6 or your own
module pattern that's definitely a way
to go totally used to writing everything
in modules that's one thing another
thing is get used to understanding how
component architecture work because
every frame that's kind of come out from
here on out it's going to be using a
component architecture which is based
off of the web component standard that's
going to be standard real soon so like
just wrapping your head around modules
and components it's just going to just
like bleep you bounce you know tour it's
like mastering all things web
development</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
