process of case-based reasoning learning
by recording cases gave us a method for
case retrieval called nearest neighbor
method so we went ahead and jumped into
the adaptation phase given an old
solution to a problem how do we adapt
that old solution to a new problem we
talked about three ways of doing that we
could do it by model of the world we
could do it by rules or we could do it
by recursion then once we've adapted
that old case how do we then evaluate
how good it was for our problem then
after we've evaluated how good it is we
looked at storing it back into memory we
want to build up a case library of past
solutions so if we've solved a new
problem we want to sort that back into
our case library then based on that we
revisited the notion of case retrieval
based on how our case library is
organized how do we retrieve a prior
case it's most similar to a new problem
now there are a lot of open issues here
for example should restore failed cases
should we soar failed adaptations do we
want to store them so we can avoid
failing in the future should we ever
forget cases can our case library ever
gets so big that's intractable we can't
really use it efficiently should we
abstract over cases so should we use
these individual cases develop a more
abstract understanding the concept or
should we stick to the individual cases
and adapt them from there if you're
interested in these questions you can go
over to our forums and we'll talk about
it there but will also be revisiting
these questions throughout the rest of
the course next time we'll talk about
incremental concept learning which takes
individual cases and abstracts over them
to learn some kind of higher-level
concepts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
