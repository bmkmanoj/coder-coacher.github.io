more carefully at these photoreceptors
and actually look at them for real you
would see tube types you would see rods
and cones now we've we've looked at this
picture before when we're talking about
color but now we want to talk about the
anatomy so the rods are these little
skinny structures here and there are
something like it says 120 million rods
plus or minus within your retina they
are very very light sensitive about a
thousand times more light sensitive than
the cones if given time to adapt we'll
see that in a minute and it can sort of
help you discriminate between different
illumination levels at very low overall
illumination the other structures here
are the cones and we've actually seen
these before the cones are the things
that allow you to discriminate color and
we talked about them when we talked
about the short medium and long
wavelength cones the cones are also the
ones that are packed within your what
are called your fovea that is that
middle area that has the very high
resolution we'll talk about the impact
of that in a minute and it's the cones
that give you sort of what we tend to
think of as the high quality vision and
the rods sort of provide everything else
now by the way even if you didn't have
an electron microscope and even if you
hadn't sort of peeled apart people's
retinas it sounds kind of gross you
would know that there are at least two
kinds of systems going on in the eye one
of the ways that this was discovered is
in what's referred to as dark adaptation
experiments okay so in dark adaptation
here's what we do we put you in a dark
room for months at a time no you put
somebody in a dark room and you let's
say after one minute you say how bright
a light do I have to have a light to be
before you can tell that it's on okay
you do that and then later we do it all
over again and we do it for two minutes
and then we do it for three minutes sir
right so we tracked to see how much
light you need in order to detect that
there's some illumination now we've all
had this experience before right you
walk in from a bright daylight into a
dark room and it takes a little while we
say for your eyes to adjust
well that adjustment is not your pupil
opening and closing that's a
rapid-response what's happening is is
that the photo is that the
photoreceptors in your eye
are adjusting to the amount of light all
right and if I were to track that I
would see this kind of a curve okay I
would see a curve that starts going down
like this and starts to look like it's
gonna flatten out and then somewhere
this says about eight minutes varies on
person to person somewhere around there
all of a sudden it starts to drop down
again okay
what's happened is your rods are now
kicking in your rods are now coming into
play and you can go away much much much
lower threshold all right and so you
know when when you have a single system
you never get psychophysical curves that
have sharp breaks like that right and
basically what you're seeing here is
there are two curves there's a curve
here four cones and a curve here four
rods and this was where they intersect
all right and that's this is sort of a
well known phenomena which implied that
there was multiple systems within the
retina in terms of light sensitivity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
