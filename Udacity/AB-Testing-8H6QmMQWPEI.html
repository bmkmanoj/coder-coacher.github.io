but you aren't sure about how to fix it
what do you do well you can make an
educated guess but the best developers
don't guess they know they use a B
testing which is testing different
versions of a game at the same time and
seeing which version gets the best
response from players it's called a be
because the simplest test compared to
versions in a and B version the a
version is given to one half of a game's
users and the B is given to the other
half and we see how each group of users
respond these tests can help you compare
any game content that you're unsure
about from the color scheme to game
content and you can test out two
versions or as many as you want let's
walk through an example of creating
effective AV testing scenarios let's say
we've made a platformer game where we
jump around and shoot enemies to
advanced levels our analytics have shown
us that only 20% of players make it past
level 3 we think that the level might be
too hard so let's change it let's test
out different levels of difficulty and
see how yours is respond to see how
players respond to different scenarios
we can use a B testing which is a method
of testing that compares the performance
of two or more game versions a and B and
so on the most effective a B testing
scenarios are designed to test out one
main variable X Y count color etc and
they monitor one or two results like
level completion or profitability things
like that our game versions are
distributed amongst our players and so
there are usually only two to four
versions tested at one time so for our
game we want to change level three let's
create three different test cases where
we change the number of enemies and see
how many more players will complete the
level you always want to test your
original version in comparison to the
new ones so we have an a original
version a version B with 10% fewer
enemies and a version C with 20% fewer
enemies the next step is to distribute
these versions to our players so that
about 1/3 of our players play each
version this is usually done by
percentage so we have 3333
and 34% which adds up to a total of 100%
distributed two versions a B and C then
we get our results and see how many
players complete the level we see that
only 20% of our group a players
completed the level 80% of Group B
completed level 3 and 70% completed
level 3 for Group C so both B and C seem
like a lot better options than a and
maybe the reason that C isn't as high as
B is because it's too easy so people get
bored playing either way AV testing lets
us know for sure that version B is our
best option</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
