drawing of a software under test that
I've I feel like I've drawn about 30
times already and recall that this
provides api's and the most of the sign
that's what we're fuzzing now on the
other hand and the software under test
uses api's like the UNIX read call we
could do fussing at this level as well
and it's most often called fault
injection when we do that and random
fault injection as we've discussed is
extremely powerful so we've looked at
examples of both of these and both of
them are incredibly useful so what it
talk like to talk about now is fuzzing
of the implicit inputs that we talked
about in unit 2 where we have non API
inputs to the software under test that
affect its behavior it turns out that
this is often pretty important and so
how would we do this well as we
mentioned earlier possibly the most
important implicit input is the timing
at which different threads are run on
different processors so that is to say
the thread scheduler provides a very
important form of implicit input to
multi-threaded software under test and
so an extremely important technique is
perturbing the schedule and as far as I
know there isn't a single best way to do
this and so we find in practices people
do a lot of different things one thing
you can do is just generate load on the
machine that is to say make sure that
your testing is not happening on a
completely idle machine it's often the
case that if you test software on a
completely idle single core machine even
if it has multiple threads the schedule
those threads will be scheduled in a
quite deterministic way similarly if you
have a multi-core machine that has more
processors than your application has
threads there's again the strong
possibility that they'll be scheduled it
in an extremely deterministic fashion
while you're doing testing and if
they're being scheduled extremely
deterministically that means that the
scheduler is exploring only a very tiny
fraction of the full set of possible
thread schedules and what that means is
concurrency bugs are going to go unfound
during testing so generating load by
running apps generating load by running
other applications is important
generating network activity on the
machine can also be valuable and that
work activities interesting because
incoming network pakista machine cause
interrupt handlers to fire they caused
lots of colonel routines to run it cause
cache lines to be stolen away from your
application and this causes some
perturbation of the schedule there also
exists specialized tools for stress
testing of multi-threaded applications
and if you have one of these available
two would be an extremely good idea to
use it to help test your multi-threaded
code okay so what I've discovered is
what I'll call external perturbations to
the thread schedule it's also possible
for your software to introduce
perturbations internally and one way to
do that is to do things like inserting
delays before and after acquiring mocks
and also around accesses to shared
variables this entails a fairly high
cost this isn't
so easy but on the other hand it might
it might be useful and I heard a story
one time it was about a group of
researchers who are working on formal
methods based tools for finding bugs in
threaded codes and these researchers
were having some sort of a competition
where each of them tried to find the
most bugs in the software under test but
they could and what happened was
somebody showed up and just put a bunch
of sleeps inside the application and
show that they could find just as many
bugs as these super heavyweight super
complicated formal methods tool so a
final thing you can try this is what I'm
going to call unfriendly emulators but
that in quotes because I not put that in
quotes because I'm kind of just making
up that name what these are is a kind of
this kind of special virtual machine or
other runtime but specially designed to
stress test your application by doing
things like invalidating cache lines
invoking thread schedules in odd ways
and other things and so there are some
of these kind of things generally
available and if you have and if one of
them fits the needs of whatever your
software under test is you should
definitely use it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
