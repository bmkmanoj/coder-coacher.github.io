you found it we want to start by finding
the lowest common denominator so we
should factor each of these denominators
we factor this denominator to be n plus
1 times n minus 5 this denominator will
need to use factoring by grouping we
need to find factors of 30 that sum to
negative 13 those factors are negative 3
and negative 10 they multiply to give us
positive 30 and they add are some to
give us negative 13 we use our factoring
tree method to get this lowest common
denominator we multiply our first
fraction by the missing factor of 2 and
minus 3 whereas we multiply our second
fraction by the missing factor of n plus
1 and remember we're really just
multiplying by a 1 here and a 1 here
we're changing these fractions into
equivalent forms we distribute em to 2m
minus 3 to get the first numerator 2m
squared minus 3 m next we distribute the
negative 3 to the n plus 1 we'll get
negative 3m and negative 3 now we want
to add the two numerators together and
keep our denominator the same the like
terms in these numerators are negative
3m and negative 3m so we have 2 m
squared minus 6 m and minus 3 finally we
want to check to see if this is
factorable we want to find factors of
negative 6 that sum to negative 6 well
there are no factor pairs of negative 6
that's sum to negative 6 so we're
finished so really subtracting rational
expressions is not that different from
adding them we just want to make sure we
remember to distribute the negative sign</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
