and you've gotten the tour you may have
noticed there's kind of an exclusive
wing of the castle that you do have to
pay to get into remember earlier when we
were talking about predictive traffic
time and certain features of the roads
API we mentioned the premium plan the
premium plan is a way for businesses and
users to get access to some exclusive
features of the API to enable a larger
amount of quota and to get help from
Google's technical support team there
are a few more things you get if you
become a premium plan customer as well
for example more weight points per
request in the direction service
requests more destinations and origins
in distance matrix specific places API
data not to mention generally higher
queries per second on the services and
access to more usage analytics check out
the page link in the instructor notes
for the exact usage limits and other
data on the premium plan we're going to
go through a few situations where
according to our Terms of Service you
must purchase a license to use the api's
first if you plan on using the API is on
an internal domain that is not publicly
available like for example if you are a
delivery service that wants to optimize
routes for your vehicles and visualize
them to run your business another
situation where you would need to
purchase a license is if you plan on
using the api's and some kind of paid
service for example if purchasing a
product gets user access to a site that
uses the api's or if you have a cost to
enter that site finally if you plan on
doing asset tracking that is using the
google maps api is to track one or more
physical objects you must be a premium
planned customer again a general rule of
thumb if your usage is free for users so
no fee and publicly available to
everyone no firewall you can use the
plan available through your developer
project that you created even if you go
above the free limit and enable
pay-as-you-go billing the page in the
instructor notes has more detail
information about the premium plan
benefits and usage limits now on your
own take a look at some more information
about the IDS we've talked about so far</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
