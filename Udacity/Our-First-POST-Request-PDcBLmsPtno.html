how there are various types of requests
that you can make to the server and so
far we've talked specifically about get
requests and I've seen how to use them
in our examples earlier in this lesson
we mentioned that we'd also be
implementing what's called a post
request to add a feature to our my
favorite movies app now it's time to
look at this in more detail a post
request as you may recall is a request
where the client submits data to a web
server for processing the data that sent
is enclosed in message body of the
request which can then be processed to a
specified resource will use a post
request to favorite or unfavorite a
movie in the favorite movies list of our
app so let's go back to the movie
databases API documentation by searching
for the word favorite on the API page I
found this method which allows me to add
or remove a movie to an accounts
favorite list which seems like what we
want now we'll click on the post banner
to open up the right-hand panel which
has information on how to set up this
request here at the top we see the URL
that the post request should be made to
in other words that's where the resource
we want to update is located now this
section underneath that is titled
request should give us the information
that we need to create this in code
these little drop down menus give us a
few additional options let's keep this
setting as production and this one
appears to be a language setting so
let's set it to Swift and see what we
get cool this looks like stuff we can
use even if we don't know exactly what
it is yet but before we dig into it I
feel like we missed something what was
this over here at the top before we
change to Swift headers hmm we haven't
talked about that yet so headers are
actually a part of an HTTP request along
with the URL and the message body they
allow us to supply additional parameters
that specify how the request should
operate here we see that for this
request two headers are supplied the
accept header field allows us to specify
which content types will accept in a
response in our case we want to accept
Jason as our response the content-type
header field lets us specify what type
of content were sending in the body in
other words what format our data is in
so that the server knows what's coming
and can determine how to parse it there
are many other
types of HTTP header fields a list of
them is linked in the instructor notes
awesome now we understand what these
headers are for let's go back to this
code and see if we can understand what's
happening so this already looks a bit
familiar we did this when making our
other requests here we're creating the
URL and then using NS mutable URL
request to make the request from the URL
now these lines are new but if you look
at them we already know what they're
doing request dot HTTP method equals
post we're setting our request method
type to be of type post then request add
value application jason for HTTP header
field except this is just the code we
need to set up our two header fields now
if we look back at what was displayed
when we had the language settings set to
raw there was what looked to be a bit of
Jason media type movie media ID 550
favorite true this seems like the
information we'd want to give the server
but with our own value specified so it
looks like this little Jason piece is
here to show us what we should be
sending let's look back at the swift
code example were provided request dot
HTTP body equals so it looks like here's
where we want to supply that data the
data that we want to post this is where
we should fill in what movie we're
talking about and whether we want
favorite to be true or not those can be
variables that we can put in our own
code the rest of this is actually all
stuff we've seen before just getting the
session making the tasks etc we already
know how to do that so when you make
this post request in your app in xcode
you should be able to copy over most of
this boilerplate code and only really
need to change a few things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
