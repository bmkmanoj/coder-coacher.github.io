is a stack of simple operations like
linear transforms values whatever you
want some have parameters like the
matrix transforms some don't like the
railers when you apply your data to some
input X you have data flowing through
the stack up to your predictions Y to
compute the derivatives you create
another graph that looks like this the
data in that new graph flows backwards
through the network gets combined using
the chain rule that we saw before and
produce these gradients that graph can
be derived completely automatically from
the individual operations in your
network so most deep learning frameworks
would just do it for you this is called
back propagation and it's a very
powerful concept
it makes computing derivatives of
complex function very efficient as long
as the function is made out of simple
blocks with simple derivatives running
the model up to the predictions is often
called the forward prop and the model
that goes backwards is called the
backdrop so to recap terrain stochastic
gradient descent for every single little
batch of your data in your training set
you're going to run the forward prop and
then the back prop and that will give
you gradients for each of your weights
in your model then you're going to apply
those gradients with the learning rates
to your original weights and update them
and you're going to repeat that all over
again many many times this is how your
entire model gets optimized I am NOT
going to go through more of a mass of
what's going on in each of those blocks
because again you don't typically have
to worry about that and it's essentially
the chain rule but keep in mind this
diagram in particular each block of the
back prop often takes about twice the
memory that's needed for the forward
prop and twice the compute that's
important when you want to size your
model and fit it in memory for example</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
