defining a state by just creating a
tuple and then getting at the fields of
a state by doing an assignment we can
use something called a name tuple that
gives a name to the tuple itself as well
as to the individual elements we can
define a new data type called state and
i'm using capitalized letters for data
types say state is equal to a name tuple
and the name of the data type is state
and the fields of the data type RP me
you in penting so i can just go ahead
and make that assertion name tuples is
in a module so from collections import
name tuple gives me access to it and now
i can say s equals state one two three
four and i can ask for the components of
s by name so SP that would be equal to
one st me has the value 2 and so on so
how would i choose between this
representation for states and the normal
tuple representation well the name tuple
has a couple advantages it's explicit
about the types it helps you catch
errors so if you ask for the p field of
something that's not a state that will
give you an error whereas if you just
broke up something that was four
elements into these components that
would work even if it was didn't happen
to actually be a proper state and there
are a few negatives as well it's a
little bit more verbose although not so
much and it may be unfamiliar to some
programmers may take them a while to
understand what name two poles mean and
i should say we could also do the same
type of thing by defining a class and
that has all the same positives and it's
certainly familiar to most Python
programmers but it would be even more
verbose and here's what hold and roll
look like in this new notation so hold
we're explicitly creating a new state
and we look at the state pd the state
dot use they put me in the state
depending and so on and similarly for a
roll so they look fairly similar you
notice
lines are a little bit longer in terms
of were being more explicit so it takes
a little bit more to say that and I'm
sort of up in the air whether this
representation is better than the
previous representation but tuples I
could go either way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
