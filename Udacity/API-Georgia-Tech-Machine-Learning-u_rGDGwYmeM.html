side let's go back to thinking about
this applications programmer interface
so I talked about the talked about
planning and I talked about learning and
it turns out that there's two other kind
of sub processes or sub components that
might be useful to think about that kind
of relate these quantities together
differently one is is the notion of a
modeler what a modeler can do is take
transitions and build a model out of it
that make sense and a simulator is kind
of the inverse where you can take a
model and you can use it to generate
transitions you can actually kind of
imagine running around in the world just
by simulating that world so this is
generally not a very hard thing to do
though there's certainly applications of
reinforcement learning where this
simulator is extremely expensive because
it's simulating a lot of things in the
world and this modeling problem you can
think of again as a kind of machine
learning problem right trying to try to
map this kind of information into into
models hmm so you call them
sub-processes does this mean that one
way to do learning would be to do
modeling and simulating so that I had
models and I knew what the reinforcement
function was and then I could just do
planning yeah that's a really good idea
in fact let's let's look at different
ways of willing these things together
