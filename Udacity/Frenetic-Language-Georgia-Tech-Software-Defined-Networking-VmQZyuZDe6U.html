center traffic engineering through
customized topologies and special
mechanisms for load balance can help
reduce link utilization reduce the
number of hops to reach the edge of the
data center and make the data center
network easier to maintain we saw in the
last lesson how existing data center
topologies provide extremely limited
server to server capacity because of the
oversubscription of the links at the top
of the hierarchy additionally as
services continue to be migrated to
different parts of the data center
resources can be fragmented
significantly lowering utilization for
example if the service denoted by green
is running mostly in one part of the
data center but there's a little bit of
it running on a virtual machine in
another part of the data center this
might require traffic to traverse links
of the data center topology hierarchy
thus significantly lowering utilization
and cost efficiency reducing this type
of fragmentation can result in
complicated layer 2 or layer 3 routing
reconfiguration what we'd like to have
is just the abstraction of one large
layer to switch this is the abstraction
that VL 2 provides so VL 2 has two main
objectives one is to achieve layer 2
semantics across the entire data center
topology this is done with a name
location separation and a resolution
service that resembles the fabric
manager which we talked about in the
last lesson and which is described in
more detail in the paper to achieve
uniform high capacity between the
servers and balanced load across links
in the topology vl2 relies on flow based
random traffic in direction using
valiant load balancing let's take a
closer look at how that load balancing
works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
