most likely sell is the fourth sell and
it makes sense because the best match of
red red to the world is right over here
in red over here and after seeing the
second red the word still moved one to
the right
finds itself in the fourth cell it's
shown over here now I want to celebrate
with you the code that you just wrote
which is a piece of software that
implements the essence of Google's
self-driving cars localization approach
as I said in the beginning it's
absolutely crucial that the car knows
exactly where it is relative to the map
of its road and why the road isn't
painted green and red there were his
lane markers and instead of those green
and red cells over here we plug in the
color of the lane markings relative to
the color of the pavement and isn't just
one observation per time step it's an
entire field of observations entire
camera image but you can do the same
with the camera image so as long as you
can correspond a camera image in your
model with a camera image in your
measurements and then a piece of code
not much more difficult than what what
you call it yourself is responsible for
localizing the HSU the Google
self-driving car so you just implement
it a major major function that makes
Google's cars drive itself so I think
you should be really happy and proud of
yourself and you should say to yourself
I just implemented localization now why
on earth does it take Google that long
to build a product that drives itself
well I to this the situation is little
more difficult sometimes robots get
taped over and change and we're working
on this but what you've implemented is
the core of Google's self-driving car
localization idea let me just summarize
the essential things we've learned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
