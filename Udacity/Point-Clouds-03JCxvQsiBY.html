well something more recent
newer approach is what's referred to as
point clouds and point clouds are
essentially you take all of your depth
pixels that you hit and you say aha
that's a little Reese's a word voxel
it's a little voxel of stuff and I'm
just gonna hang it out there in space
and so I would get this constellation of
points that's just a cloud okay now I
actually can't see inside surfaces so
it's maybe a cloud that I can only see
the outside of but if I had like another
camera and I knew how those cameras were
related I could take the points that it
saw and stick them out in the same cloud
area and eventually I would have this
big point cloud of depth points and it
would be a lot easier to reason about
the geometry of those now of course when
we do this that point clouds are doesn't
know how it got created right so did I
look at it from here or did I look at it
from there so I don't have that free
space information anymore so point
clouds of course have their advantages
and disadvantages the biggest one is
probably that it's view point
independent right so because it's view
point independent I can merge different
point clouds as long as they're in the
same coordinate system and I can
actually reason more about the geometry
the disadvantages include so for example
it's not it might not be very dense
right in depth image I've got a depth
everywhere point clouds whatever points
I got I got and if I want to know what's
the depth going this way I might not
know the answer I just know about these
set of points and so fundamentally
you've also lost this free space stuff
okay because you don't know wait you
still have a point right here I don't
know if was viewed from this way or from
this way it was viewed this way I know
that all these pixels along this ray are
free from here it's over there I don't
have that representation in point clouds
the other thing is as I get further away
essentially my cloud each individual
pixel that I see is taking up a bigger
and bigger voxel so the point cloud
density I'm sorry the the point cloud
resolution
you know how big is a point cloud point
the resolution is determined by how far
away from the depth sensor I observed
that point so nearby ones are tight
little points further back they're
bigger voxels but I didn't tell you yet
about the biggest advantage the biggest
advantage about point clouds is the
point cloud library there's all this
code out there and it continues to grow
called PCL for the manipulation of point
clouds and so that's code you don't have
to write all right so it allows you to
operate on depth just we're not worrying
about the details of the bookkeeping
about these depth representations so
that's that's really a huge element and
one might even say if it wasn't for the
PCL point cloud library point clouds
would not be merely as popular as they
are here's a here's a pointer to what's
the website point clouds org all right
which tells you something right dot org
this is open source so it continues to
grow and continues to improve</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
