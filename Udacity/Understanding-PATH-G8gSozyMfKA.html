a few times already and we know that
it's located within the /bin directory
but how come we didn't have to type the
full path to this file to run it why
didn't we have to type slash bin slash
LS Linux systems provide a nice little
shortcut system within the dollar sign
path variable let's take a look at that
and figure out how the operating system
saves us some typing if you type echo
dollar sign path and run that you're
presented with a bunch of paths
separated by colon characters we see
slash user slash local slash sbin slash
user slash local slash bin and on and on
and on these are actually the
directories Linux will progress through
and looking for a binary when you just
type the name of it like LS when you
type LS the operating system checks the
first directory for an executable file
named LS if it's not there it checks the
next and on and on and on until it gets
here to slash bin and it does find that
file so it runs it if you ever find that
your commands aren't being found or
things are just acting really crazy you
might want to check this variable i've
placed a link in the instructor notes
that will walk you through how to edit
this variable and save it if need be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
