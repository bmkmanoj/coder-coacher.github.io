kind of diagrams by using an example in
particular we're going to describe the
state transition diagram for part of our
example for part of our course
management system and we're going to
focus on the course offering class when
the class is created it enters the
initialization state in which the
activity performed is to initialize the
course at this point a simple case is
the case in which the class is canceled
so there is a canceled event and if that
happens the class is simply canceled so
gets into this final state which is the
state cancelled and the activity in this
case is to notify the registered
students obviously if this is the flow
there will be no registered students
however something else can happen when
we are in this initial State
so what can happen is that a student can
register so in this case the add student
event is triggered and the corresponding
action is to set the count in this case
will be the count of students for the
course offering to one and there will be
a change of state and the course
offering will get into this open state
and the action that will be performed on
entry will be to register the student at
this point more students may register so
other a student events may occur and
notice that we have a guard here that
tells us that this event will trigger
this transition only if the count is
less than 10 so we're assuming that
we're not gonna have more than 10
students just for lack of a better
number in our course offering so if that
happens if the count is less than 10 so
then the count is incremented so the
increment count action takes place and
the system goes back into the open State
and the new student is register now here
we have an interesting transition
because there's no event triggering the
transition but simply the fact that the
count is equal to 10 so you can imagine
this as being a transition that is
always enabled so can always be
triggered but will be guarded by the
fact that the count has to be exactly 10
so basically this transition will take
place only when enough students are
added such that we get to count being
incremented and being equal to 10 and
then the transition will occur and we
will get into the closed state in which
the class is no longer open because
there are enough students register and
at this point what will happen is that
the course will be finalized so there
will be this activity which performs
some operation that is needed to
finalize the course another possibility
is that when we are in the open State
the course is canceled and if the
courses can
so in this case we go again to the
canceled state but here the activity of
notifying registered students makes more
sense because we will have at least one
registered student in this state and
therefore we'll need to notify such
student that the course offering as
being canceled finally is it possible
also to cancel a course after it has
been closed and in this case again the
same thing will happen the class will
reach the cancelled state and all the
students in this case 10 students that
are registered for the course will be
notified that the course has been
cancelled so if we look at this state
transition diagram you can see that it's
pretty easy to see what the evolution of
objects of this class can be how they
can go from their initial state to
various final states depending on what
are the external events that reach the
system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
