of clinical operations I'm from San
Francisco California all right and what
does a director of clinical operations
do exactly so I work with physicians and
researchers to run clinical trials I
take the ideas that the clinical staff
the physicians have with a protocol and
I work to implement that protocol so I
will go out to key opinion leaders which
are most likely physicians try to
recruit them to participate in the study
I will work with data that comes out of
the study so data that's from the
patients that enroll in the study do
monitoring which is basically verifying
that the data that's recorded for our
study is accurate and matches what the
data looks like in the patient's medical
records and then you know all of the all
of the work that it takes to receive a
study it's a regulated environment so
it's regulated by the FDA or if in some
cases research isn't regulated by the
FDA but it's always regulated by good
clinical practice and international
guidelines on how to take care of
patients so you have to actually be
informed of a lot of different things to
be able to carry this out yes now for
those people who may be slightly
unfamiliar with how clinical trial works
or even what one is can you tell us just
briefly the significance of a clinical
trial sure so anytime you want to test
an intervention be it a drug a
diagnostic test or even just changes in
behavior you want to show that there's
actually a difference you want to run a
clinical trial because that's going to
give you the gold standard to show you
that there's a difference with your with
your drug or your intervention so the
clinical trial itself is a way to ask
your question prospectively design your
experiment in humans and then implement
that study see so this is sort of like
that okay prove that it works kind of
thing exactly and this process you said
itself is regulated by the government by
the FDA correct by the FDA and must you
pass a clinical trial to carry out your
test or your diagnostic or whatever you
want to do
is that part of the requirement of ever
selling your product it depends so to
back up there there are three phases of
clinical trial development for a drug
there's phase one where you're looking
for your safety so you've got to prove
that you're not going to do undue harm
to people with your dog and then in
phase 2 you're further refining your
safety day and you're starting to look
at efficacy and then phase 3 are your
large efficacy trials where you're
treating a lot of patients with the drug
at that point so that's kind of the
basic methodology but then within that
context yeah there is it is regulated by
the FDA they do have a say in what
they're going to accept from the phase 3
trials is something that they are
willing to approve and so a lot of
effort goes into putting together a
study that's going to meet their
requirements it sounds like it takes a
lot of time to do this yes it's sort of
a big commitment from anybody interested
big commitment for companies a lot of
resources go into these trials and
academic settings a lot of resources
will go into these these studies as well
for the type of clinical operations that
you manage or that you're sort of that
you work with can you give us an idea of
the time frame that you end up working
on like how long from start to finish
for any given project ah that's a good
question so um it takes many many years
to go from start to finish so you're
looking on order of seven to ten years
but within one study in a fake big phase
3 study that can take three years five
years sometimes when they're placed
longitudinal studies there you know
lifetimes so they do take a long time
wow so your your portfolio just keeps
going on a single project then yeah what
um can you give us an example of a
specific any kind of specific product or
diagnostic or anything that you're
familiar with it that you've worked on
at some point that you know sort of went
through this process yeah so a recent
example that's been approved as a drug
called zelboraf that looks at mutation
in
the melanoma cancer called v600e so it
looks at this mutation and says if the
patient is positive for this mutation
that if the cancer is positive for this
mutation this would be a good drug for
the patient to try and if they don't
have the mutation they're probably not
going to respond to the drug at all so
this is a great example of using
genetics in in a clinical study to
select patients but you can also use the
genetic information to stratify patients
if you want to compare patients with the
marker to those without so it would just
be a marker that would be used to look
at how you could break apart those two
groups to look at who did better or not
in that case right and you said so
that's an example of something that sort
of went through this process and has
been approved yes exactly in general for
a lot of groups that bring products
through clinical trials do you see an
increase in the use of genetics to
actually either bring these products
through or to stratify groups like you
say or just generally bring more
possible products to market by using
genetic information absolutely I think
this is really the opportunity is part
of the problem with with clinical
studies is that you're confined to the
population that you're testing them in
so sometimes we'll see a signal when we
look at the entire dataset they'll be a
signal in a subset of patients but you
don't really know why you've wasted a
lot of money on a negative trial one of
the opportunities that genetics provides
is to help us get the right patient on
the right trial so that increases the
likelihood that we're going to have a
positive outcome for the trial and
decreases the risk to the patients and
or subjects of being exposed to
treatments that are going to help them
so I think that that's one of the most
exciting things about the future of
personalized genetics in looking at
developing drugs and treatments so you
in general do you think there's going to
be a big increase in the number of
either individual companies or that you
know are sort of doing this as well as
the need for people who understand it
can carry out these this kind of job
yeah and I think I think that the the
old paradigm of the Big Pharma and
having these very large studies it's
going to shift towards running smaller
studies and targeted populations of
people that have markers that could
indicate that the drug is going to work
for them so a lot of that data can come
out in early clinical trials or even
preclinical trials and it's just going
to make it a much more streamlined
process to get those treatments out
there so tell us a bit more about your
background how did you get to be a
director of clinical operations what did
you study in school what did you do
before you got here yeah so I have a
bachelor's degree in biology when I
finish school I didn't really know what
I wanted to do I feel really lucky that
I found this this world of clinical
studies so I I started out in a crl
contract research organization so these
are companies that serve pharma
companies by helping to run the clinical
trials it's out sourced to that group
and so I I had my first job in a company
like that and from there came into
biotech and pharma and diagnostics and
have found it to just be a lot of fun I
like to solve problems right so that's
it's a great place to apply that it
sounds like it's it's a very fun sort of
problem solving or puzzle solving
scenario exactly tell me a bit more
about the methodology of the study how
you set it up so it all studies will
have a protocol it's the core of the
study it's a documents written before
you even start it has information about
the background of the clinical question
that's being asked eligibility so what
patients would be appropriate to enroll
in the trial and then it has information
about things like the every procedure
that's going to happen and all the data
that's going to be captured and finally
it has a prospective data analysis plan
so you know when that data is available
how you're going to analyze it okay all
that's important so that we're being
really targeted and going after a
clinical question that we've really
thought through so yes and once we have
the protocol complete then that has to
be reviewed by an ethics board so that's
an IRB and is
tional review board and they make sure
that the research is appropriate so our
number one is protecting patients that
includes really pretty not just
protecting them from harm in the study
but also protecting their privacy so
there's all kinds of HIPAA the health
insurance ? health and health
information Portability do you know yeah
chance protection protection act yeah I
think yeah I always get the yeah yeah so
so anyway so there's all kinds of
considerations that have to go into to
that piece with making sure that
patients are protected so in general um
you know let's let's go back to sort of
one of the examples you mentioned you
know for example that there is let's say
a genetic marker and in an individual
that says something about how they're
going to deal with this drug or that
drug or something like that when you go
through your selection process for the
clinical trial is that information I
mean how how private is that information
to to you is you're trying to direct the
clinical trial do you know the name of
the individual and you know exactly what
genetic makeup they are that causes this
and then you you know user don't use
them though it's a huge issue that the
industry is really struggling with we do
everything we can to protect patient
privacy so when we are looking at
genetic information its de-identified so
all of the identifying information is
stripped okay but that's challenging
because what is identifying information
and so it's been really an interesting
thing to be part of this evolution in
having more genetic information
available and trying to make sure that
the same time that we protect patients
privacy's as we go after these questions
so yes it's OD identification is kind of
at the core of how that would work and
we would as in a role like mine I don't
get patient names there there's a single
addy identification step that happens
where the patients become a number and
then a second di den
vacation stuff that happens we're with
the genetic information museum so Kate
work really hard to protect patient
confidentiality what aside from the
privacy issue how is this sort of new
age of personal genetics and sort of be
the advance of I guess whole genome
sequencing whole genome information how
do you foresee that changing the role
that you have to go through in the sort
of pre selection or selection process
and a clinical trial so the short answer
I don't know but you can see so much
potential right so there's this spit for
science from 23andme so patients are
self selecting based on their their
history to participate in that trial and
I can see a world where patients would
look at their genetic information and
then be able to self-select into
clinical trials based on you know the
the markers that they're seeing we're
not there yet it's not happening yet
there are lots of ethical questions that
have to be addressed on that road but
but I think it's really exciting so it
sounds like you really get in your job
you really get to sort of be exposed to
a lot of ideas and subjects that deal
with genetics but you also really get
the sort of I guess I like the the verb
wallow in the the ethics to and really
have to be concerned about procedure you
have to pay attention to detail you've
got to sort of know technically what's
going on but you've also got to be able
to remember where you are and what
you're doing with regards to K this is a
human study and these are all the things
we have to go through yeah exactly um in
general how would you describe how
difficult is this job do you think
compared to other jobs or it's difficult
probably in a different way than
somebody's actually crunching the data
we have to think through problems like
sometimes we'll have a study that it's
it's well designed it could yield great
data but we just can't find the right
subjects that want to join the study so
then a lot of effort goes into
recruitment planning for the study I've
never worked on two studies that have
the same problems they're always
different
so and then Nina builds on itself you'll
learn okay we got to have recruitment
plans in place before we start the study
we've we've got to think through how
we're going to ensure quality data
before we start the study all of these
things that kind of become part of the
methodology but yeah every study has its
own issues and the landscape changes so
it's it's interesting from that regard I
don't know if it's harder than any oh
sure what would you consider is probably
your favorite moments so far and the
kind of work you've done just sort of if
you can describe like a great moment a
really positive side of something you've
experienced yeah it's always exciting
when you see something you've worked on
that's approved by the FDA early in my
career I worked on a drug called sutent
I worked on a phase one study of ceuta
in gastrointestinal stromal tumors and
so when I saw that it was approved I
that was really exciting I also worked
on a drug called / tues mab the scalper
jetta and it's approved for metastatic
breast cancer so that's been exciting
wow that's very impressive um so they're
just these little you know those things
happen but of course those Turks were
approved many years after i was done
working on them but yeah so you never
know when you're working on something
where it's going and you just deliver
your little piece of the puzzle and then
other people take over that's both
frustrating and also kind of cool but
because you can see in the end looking
back oh yeah this is how the work I did
on that phase water feels good yeah fit
into the big picture so yeah um so
equally then mm-hmm excuse me what would
you consider one of the I guess the
hardest or most frustrating aspects of
your job then would be I've also worked
on studies that did not end well where
we unblinded data and found that
patients were being harmed which is
never a good thing but I'll say in in
that particular case the company and you
know the clone ops group I was part of
did a very nice job of immediately
stopping the study notifying all of the
physicians of the problem and doing what
we could to make sure that the patients
were no longer exposed to a treatment
that was
not treating them was hurting them right
you know I seem to remember in the news
not that long ago I only have a
peripheral knowledge base of certain
clinical trials but I do seem to
remember one about statins that was a
big was a big study and apparently if I
hope connect me if I'm wrong here but
like if you know but I think there was
like a big benefit to like people who
were at risk for a heart attack you know
if they were either on or off the Staten
it really decreased their risk
significantly and it became such an
ethical imperative it became so obvious
so early in their clinical trial that
this worked in this way that they
stopped the trial early and said it's
unethical to not give the Staten to
everyone in this case yeah that's a
great story it doesn't happen that often
and I not familiar sure sure but yeah
that's very cool well I think what's
nice is I mean you know when we hear a
story like that or other types of
stories you're sort of a face behind all
of that right you were in the process of
planning that clinical off about that
clinical yeah and somebody in clinical
operations was working very diligently
to make sure that everybody was informed
of the decision to stop the study and
that all of the you know like I said
this is a very in some ways a very
controlled methodology so we would have
to like let I arbys know that the study
was stopping and and make sure that all
the pieces were put in place to wrap it
up so how much of your job would you say
is sort of teamwork a lot of its
teamwork partnering with physicians and
researchers and colleagues doing the
same work I do I I would work with
people in a commercial organization of
course there's a huge financial
components you're working with people
that have budget responsibilities yeah
there's a lot of teamwork that goes
into it is there anything else you want
to talk about related to clinical
operations or anything else that you
think would be really interesting or
relevant to you know genetics or just
the job itself yeah I mean I think that
what's interesting right now is the
movement towards personalized health
care I want to see how this how
personalized genetics fit into that so
yeah so I just think it's an interesting
time to be in this field if you if
somebody is watching you right now and
they're super excited they're like wow
that sounds like a really cool kind of
job what advice would you give them to
either learn more or what advice would
you give them to learn more or to
possibly you know become a clinical
operations director themselves I think
it's I know it's a tough field to break
into because a lot of people are
interested in getting into this type of
a field so I think it's really getting
work experience there are degrees their
master's degrees and there are great
programs through like a UC Berkeley or
UC Santa Cruz that will give you a
certificate in clinical trial management
and those certificates are great people
learn all of the methodology behind how
to run the studies but it really comes
down to doing it and working on studies
which happen both in an academic and a
drug company diagnostic company now now
personalized genetics companies so
there's so many different places you
could get this experience so I guess
that the main advice would be not to
just focus on drug companies to look
across the board for other places that
are running studies and and see if there
are opportunities there would you
recommend anybody who's interested to
try to get work experience before school
experience in this I think work
experience is the foot in the door that
will help to land the job yeah and what
kind of work experience exactly so there
are entry-level positions running
clinical trials they're called a
clinical trial associate but also
background in have in a physician's
practice that are that where they're
running studies is another great way to
get exposure to it and
yeah I think that that it's not a lot of
people focus on getting into a drug
company and I think that might be the
wrong first step to take it's definitely
something to put on the list of things
to do eventually but just to break in
and get the foot in the door working in
other capacities is probably easier to
get that land the first job it sounds
like to carry out a job like yours they
want somebody who's very knowledgeable
and I mean you got to know the ins and
the outs and it sounds like you might
gain that better by like you say you're
sort of getting your foot in the door
maybe taking a lower level position on a
clinical trial or clinical operations
development great program first right
you have to be able to interview for
these bigger jobs if people talk about
the mistakes you've made it right sure
what you learn from those which you
can't get unless you're actually doing
this work so yeah there there are other
angles to get in than just going through
the drug companies sure oh thank you so
much for joining us and you know wish
you the best of luck on continuing your
clinical operations thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
