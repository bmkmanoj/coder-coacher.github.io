deploying your project or a remote
server is never an easy task how you do
things depends on a few factors such as
who your audiences the type of server
you're deploying to and your servers
capabilities you'll have to assess and
decide on each of these factors yourself
but let's talk about each of them in a
bit more detail to help you understand
which deployment strategy is best for
you
sometimes all we're doing is developing
a proof of concept to show our teammates
or managers for these kind of non
production facing situations it's easier
to keep our deployment process quick and
simple we don't have to worry about
optimization or speed because the most
important aspect is the functionality
when developing an angular 2 application
the client makes a bunch of small
requests for individual files which are
assembled if necessary and then
displayed to the user this is known as
just-in-time
or JIT compilation deployment files a
full of comments and whitespace for easy
reading and debugging this coupled with
the fact that each file can spend more
time communicating with the server than
it actually does transferring data can
lead to unwanted loading times and
strain on the server if there's a lot of
people trying to access it concurrently
but does it actually matter depending on
the life cycle of your project it may
not
the second factor to consider is what
kind of server you're deploying to and
its capabilities does it support tools
such as docker what kind of memory and
CPU specs does it have if you have
limitations angular provides some tools
and techniques so we can look at to help
reduce the number of requests and size
of your responses one useful
optimization strategy is called ahead of
time or a ot compilation when you build
your project ahead of time the compiler
bundles and concatenate the code and
libraries together in inline so HTML
templates and style sheets within the
application Java Script this leads to
faster loading times as the browser
downloads a pre compiled version of the
application with less Ajax requests
because
in line style sheets and templates the
angular framework size is also smaller
because there's no need to download the
compiler libraries which make up about
half of it finally compiling ahead of
time means you catch errors earlier and
the obfuscated code increases security
as it hides logic from the user and
minimizes opportunities for injection
attack so now we've understood the
options we have available to us let's
look at how to execute on a couple of
different options first we'll look at
how to do the simplest deployment
publishing a project to a server
directly out of the development
environment then we'll look at how to
deploy an ahead of time compiled project
we're going to create a simple node
droplet running on Ubuntu 16 to test our
deployments on we're going to SSH into
the server and clone our project and run
it manually in a production environment
you'd want to use a tool like Capistrano
to automate your deployments you'll also
want to set up a new user with sudo
access but for the purpose of this demo
we'll just use root
now our droplets installed this SSH in
setup our environment and clone our
project first let's install a few global
packages to make sure our project runs
execute npm i - g typescript and angular
CLI
you
now we can clone our repos and install
our local dependencies
I dropped this running behind a firewall
so let's enable port 4200 which is
angular CLI 'z development port run ufw
allow 4200 now we can use angular CLI
serve command to gal project running
we're going to pass the host argument
and set it to zero point zero point zero
point zero which will allow us to view
our project remotely so we'll run ng
save - - host equals zero point zero
point zero point zero
great our applications running but it's
using just-in-time compilation to
compile and run everything on the fly
this is fine if you're showing a
proof-of-concept internally there isn't
ideal for production let's build our
project ahead of time and serve that
using the HTTP server package first
let's install HTTP server globally run
NPM I - G HTTP - server now we can use
the ng build command to compile our
project will pass the IOT flag to
optimize our code
finally we can use HTTP server to serve
the static files in the disk folder by
default HTTP server runs in the
foreground outputting logs to a terminal
we want to keep these logs by ideally we
want it running in the background so
let's pipe the output to a log file
we're also going to pass a poor argument
to make it serve on port 80
our project is now production-ready
awesome by looking at the load times of
these two versions side by side we can
see how much of a difference it makes
compiling ahead of time
the server is under much less stress
which means the application benefits
from a huge performance boost if we want
to stop our server we can get the PID of
the HTTP server instance by running PS -
EAS and then add a pipe and grep HTTP -
server then we can run the kill command
with that PID in this series we've
learnt the basics of creating and
deploying and angular 2 projects using
angular CLI or with barely scratch the
surface of what's possible this project
has given us a great foundation from
which to build and test new things we'll
be using the to do application was
created in future videos and expand on
it to learn some more advanced
techniques such as observables and ng rx
but go ahead branch off and be amazing

channel to make sure you don't miss out
on the core new things we'll learn in
the future thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
