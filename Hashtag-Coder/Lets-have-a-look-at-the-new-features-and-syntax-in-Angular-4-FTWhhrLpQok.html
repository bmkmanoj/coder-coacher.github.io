angular team has released version four
of their popular framework borders I
actually mean what's being changed what
happened to version three and is it
going to be as much of a pain to update
projects built in angular 2 as it was
updating from version 1 luckily the
answer to the last question is not
angular 2 was a complete rewrite of the
core libraries meaning apart from a few
upgrade options projects had to be
largely rewritten updating from version
to version 4 and onwards however isn't
as painful from this point onward I'll
refer to version 1 as angular 1 and
angular tua nua is just angular to keep
to the preferred naming convention the
purpose of the latest release was
successful filling the google team's
commitment to make angular apps smaller
and faster by reducing the size of
generated code by up to sixty percent
may also took animations out of court
and into its own package to help create
bad documentation and auto completion as
well as enhancing some template binding
syntax that we'll look at in detail a
little bit later on in the video finally
angular was updated to a more recent
version of typescript to improve the
speed of the compiler and enable
developers to get better type checking
throughout their application so what
happened to version 3 back in September
of 2016 when the first version of the
new angular framework was released the
team announced so they'll be switching
to semantic versioning as the name
suggests semantic versioning is all
about adding some meaning to version
numbers a semantic version consists of
three numbers major minor and patch a
bump in the major version indication of
breaking changes a minor version bump
tells us the news non-breaking features
have been added and the patch number is
incremented to indicate bug fixes
angular school libraries live in one
single git repo hosted on github but
distributed is different NPM packages
for the most part the versions of these
packages were
life except for the router after talking
to developers at ng-conf 2016 about the
design flaws prominent in the router the
team decided to deprecate version 2 of
the package favoring a rewrite that was
then referred to as version 3 due to
this misalignment the team decided to
get everything back in line with version
4 and essentially start with a blank
slate so what features can we expect in
the template binding syntax first off
the NGF directive has been updated to
include else statements we're now also
able to assign local variables in our
templates which is useful in cases such
as when we run rolling and observable
let's look at some basic code to see how
these new features could be used in this
example we use an else statement in the
NGS directive to show a loading
indicator if the user list hasn't loaded
yet we also create a couple of local
variables one called users the
references the user list and another in
the ng for directive named count these
variables can be used anywhere in the
template as long as they're in scope so
what's next the angular team has set out
a tentative roadmap for the next six
months the outlines are release schedule
that split up into three cycles a new
patch version of the framework is
scheduled to be released each week with
minor updates being released on a
quarterly basis and finally a major
release with easy to migrate breaking
changes coming every six months this
means there with the release of version
4 and march of 2017 we can expect
version 5 around September and so forth
so what does this all mean first off and
most importantly we shouldn't worry
about version numbers anymore is
updating applications to the latest
release of angular should be on the
whole a pain-free experience open-source
development is hard technology is
constantly improving and the community
is only now just following suit but the
angular teams removed to embrace
semantic versioning and involving a more
transparent predictable an incremental
way is a shift in the right direction
and enables us to avoid another angular
version 12 version 2 situation again in
the future these are exciting times for
us and hope
I've managed to answer any lingering
doubts you may have had about what a new
version of angular means for your
project version 1 of angular CLI has
already been updated to generate new
packages in angular version 4 to go
ahead and update your packages today and
start benefiting from the performance
and syntax update</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
