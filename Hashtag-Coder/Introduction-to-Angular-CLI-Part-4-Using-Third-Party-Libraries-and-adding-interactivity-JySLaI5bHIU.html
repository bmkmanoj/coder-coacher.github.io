behind me if we had some interaction and
made our list saved state so the user
can carry on where they left off later
in this short video we'll look at how
easy it is to add third-party libraries
to your project
we'll also be able to reap the benefits
of the service pattern that we've
implemented in our list application by
demonstrating how we can add items to
our list array and see the list update
in real time let's start by adding a new
component to let the user add new items
this component will consist of a text
box for the title a date box for the due
date and a submit button
just as before in your terminal type ng
component add item in a component class
let's add a message that gets called
when the user adds a new item and click
Submit
we're going to be using template
reference variables in our view to pass
a title and due date values to our
submit function we use template
reference variables so reference Dom
element angular component directives and
web components to declare reference
variables we use the hash symbol for
example to declare a title variable on
our title input element we do input hash
title now let's go ahead and add off one
now we can add the new component
underneath our list component in the app
component template or separate these
components with a line break to keep
things spread out
let's make a couple of tweaks to our
list component and make the experience
slightly better for the user we're going
to remove the test data that we've been
using and then we'll add an alert that
displays if there's no items in the list
first let's remove the for loop from our
list component constructor and now we'll
add an alert to tell the user their list
is empty we'll use the ng-if directive
to make sure the alert only shows if our
list array has no item
now we're able to add items to our list
but wouldn't it be great if the items
persisted when we refresh your screen
let's add some functionality to save the
list to the browser's local storage each
time the array changes we're going to be
using the angular 2 local storage
package all we need to do is install it
add it to our imports and add some basic
configuration and we're ready to save
and load our data as we need in the
terminal use NPM to install the local
storage package by typing NPM I - - save
angular - local storage in the app
module let's import the local storage
modules then add it to angular's import
array we're going to pass in two options
a prefix and the storage type
you
okay in our list service we're going to
use the local storage service to load
the list into our arrays and create a
safe method so we can call every time a
new item is added removed or changed
let's add some items to our list then
refresh the screen to make sure they
persist great in a short amount of time
we've managed to add some interactivity
and more importantly made our
application remember state to make it
much more useful this demonstrates the
power of angular and angular CLI we've
gone from blank canvas to a functioning
list application with hardly any effort
the biggest benefit of these tools is
that they do a lot of the heavy lifting
for us leaving us to get on with the
important parts without having to mess
around under the hood in the last part
of this series we're going to look at
the different deployment strategies
angular provides to us exploring the
advantages and disadvantages of each and
walking through the steps necessary to
get our app deployed in a production
environment if you like this video or
