video on this cool new package I found
what I was looking for micro-services
and no js' I came across this package
called micro you guys may have already
heard about it it seems like a really
basic implementation of Express really
bare-boned nice and easy to use they
expose a command called micro which you
can use just to get the server up and
running it uses all the cool new es6
features
it just seems pretty cool but what
really caught my eye was when I went to
their website and I it's like geo it
seems like they also do Reese imple
cloud deployment and it's the way that
they do it which seems really
interesting to me there's two different
ways to do it you can download their
desktop app they have versions for Mac
Windows and Linux as well in Mac you
just add this little button to your
taskbar and the installation process is
really quick and simple
just a few clicks and you're done it
whilst you're doing that also asks you
to install now which is there CLI
package which is the other way that you
can do deployment once you have your
project up and running you just drag and
drop it into the taskbar and it uploads
the files
it runs NPM install if you're in a
docker container it works with that too
it's just really cool or you can just
type from now in your CLI in the
terminal and that's it we'll do the same
process seems pretty cool so I thought
why not have give it a little run
through and see how easy it actually is
so I thought okay let's let's create a
little endpoint that just flips a coin
and just returns heads or tails nothing
too complicated just want to test out
the features of the microservice and see
how fast it is and see how easy it is to
develop on so let's get this going so
I'm going to create a new folder called
coin flip and I'll go into it I'll be
using NPM obviously so I'll initialize
my package JSON file and literally the
only package I'm going to be using is
micro it doesn't even seem like you have
to use micro to use their cloud
deployment and I think the only thing
that it requires is for you to have your
startup script in the NPM start and in
your package JSON so now we have
everything installed we can put that
into our IDE here we can add micros as a
start script that's it and the only
father we're actually going to be using
is this one here index jr. and if you
want to call it something different all
you have to do is change that and order
load that one and from the documentation
it seems like all we need to do is just
return a function with the standard
request and response objects and
whatever that function returns is what
gets output so let's test it out just to
make sure
donating right so modules exports equals
response requests and response and we'll
just return hello world classic just to
make sure that everything's working when
we come back to our terminal we just
type NPM start it's going to spin up a
server on port 3000 and it's even going
to copy that address to our clipboard so
all we have to do is go to our browser
and
we paste that in we should see hello
world awesome alright cool so let's make
this coin flip at the way I imagine it
working is that will generate a random
number and if that number is odd then
we'll output heads and if it's even will
output tails really really simple
nothing much to it
so let's go ahead and create our random
number method we'll give it a precision
parameter just so that we can specify
how random we want the number to be so
we'll just basically say that we want to
return a whole number a whole random
number between zero and whatever that
precision number is that means that the
high the precision the more random that
number will be so let's go ahead and
change module exports so we can create a
variable called coin and it's going to
get that random number we'll set our
position to like thousand you know we
can even do 10,000 why not
and then we'll get the remainder
if there is a remainder so it's hid odd
so odd equals heads even equals tails so
if we have a remainder it's odd so it'll
be heads otherwise it would be tails
and then we can just return an object
just to make it look a little bit better
and our data will be the coin cool and
that should be it
and so we can cancel this and start a
backup hopefully there's no errors and
then when we refresh cool tails tails
make sure that is random in a bunch of
tails heads cool all right awesome so we
have a little micro service going and
that was pretty painless so according to
site all I should have to do is type now
so let's do that so it tells me it's
deploying to note version seven point
six point zero I don't know if there's a
way to change that I'm sure there is
some some options there as well we can
figure that out
which I just downloaded it that's all
good all right
seems like it's done something here we
go so it's building it did the npm
install installed a micro package
awesome it ran NPM start which ran micro
and deployment completed up here it
tells me the URL and even copied it to
the clipboard so that's useful too and
so when we open a new tab here awesome
there it is sweet
make sure that's actually random to get
a bunch of heads this time
hey it was cool you know it's not the
best implementation but it does the job
and so we can actually see what we've
deployed if we go in the taskbar and the
desktop app we can see a list of our
deployments here
and then we can I guess delete them copy
the URL or open them and brought in our
browser so that's really cool I thought
it was pretty interesting
we got something up and running in you
know less than 10 minutes and it was
just it was just cool to see what people
are doing out there I hope you enjoyed
this video if you did give it a like
just so that I know to do more of these
and you check out the other videos in my
channel and subscribe if you like them
too thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
