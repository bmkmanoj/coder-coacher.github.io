us who transitioned to angular from
angular 1 have is where's my order byte
in filter pipes for those of you who
don't know what pipes are they're a way
to transform inform our output interview
for example we could use a pipe to
format a date to be more readable like
this when angular interpolates this
expression they will look for and apply
a date filter to the unformatted date we
can chain multiple filters by separating
them with the pipe operator and even
pass arguments to them so now we know
the very basics of pipes let's talk
about some of the built-in pipes that
angular gives us and what's disappeared
since the previous version angular gives
us a few pipes that we can use in any
template such as date upper case lower
case currency and percent with their
permitted pipes of filtering and sorting
lists that were given to us in the
previous version and there's a reason
why let's switch the list application
that we've been working on for the last
two videos and create a custom pipe to
understand how they work this will help
us understand why we can't sort and
filter our list out of the box and how
we can create a custom pipe using
angular CLI to get this functionality if
you haven't been following along and are
interested in creating the list
application head over to the first video
before you go any further angular CLI
has a built-in generator for pipes that
can be used exactly how we have done to
generate interfaces services in
components so let's go ahead and create
one that will let us push all done items
to the bottom and then sort the done and
undone items by their due date in your
terminal type ng G pipe order by done
and
just like with services angular CLI
defaults and generating pipes in the
root app folder but we can change this
behavior by specifying a folder in the
terminal it also adds an entry to the
app module so we don't have to remember
to declare it the pipe definition that
angular CLI generates reveals the
following points firstly the pipe class
implements the pipe transform interface
and requires a transform method this
method accepts an input value followed
by any parameters the transform method
should retain the updated value to tell
angular that this is a pipe we apply the
pipe decorator the pipe decorator allows
us to give the pipe a name that will be
used within our template expressions
let's encapsulate the sorting logic in
the list service if we want to update
the list logic later it helps to have it
all in one place
I'm going to separate sorting by done
and due date into two separate sort
functions I could do it all in the same
function but in this instance I'm
favoring readability if as the
application grows this becomes a
performance bottleneck I can easily come
back and update it an important
principle in software development is to
embrace iteration your code doesn't need
to be perfect the first time they'll
always be opportunities to refactor
later on
we're going to use this pipe in the ng
for expression that outputs the list
items so we need to update the transform
method to accept our list array it won't
take any argument so we can remove the
uggs parameter finally the returned
value will be the sorted list of items
let's set our imports call the list
services sort method and then return the
list items
now let's add the pipe to the mg42
transform the items they should apply
the saw every time the array changes
hmm there's no errors but clearly the
sort isn't being applied there's a
reason for this and I'll explain why the
angular team decided not to build this
sort functionality into its core library
let's take a look at the documentation
to find out what's going on the
documentation tells us that by default a
pipe only detects change if a primitive
input value such as a string or a number
is updated or if an object reference is
changed it also ignores changes within a
composite object this means that one
call a pipe if you add a value to an
array or update an object property the
reason for this is performance angular
tries to avoid doing deep checks with
differences because our list is an array
of objects angular isn't watching for
changes when something happens so now we
have two options
angular lets us set a pure flag in the
pipes decorator to avoid this
functionality when this flag is false
angular executes the pipe during every
component change detection cycle this
means it can be cooled as often as every
keystroke or mouse movement not ideal
when there's a lot of data or if we're
creating a complicated transformation
but in some cases is unavoidable the
second more performant is therefore
preferred option is to avoid using pipes
for filtering and sorting altogether we
could just fly the sort method manually
when our list array changes from within
our service let's explore both options
and see how we could implement them
within our list application first let's
look at the pipe option the only change
we need to make to our pipe is to add a
pure flag to the decorator and set it to
false let's see if this works
cool now when we toggle the done status
we can see a pipe working to sort the
list but I'm worried that if we have a
long list the pipe may be executed too
often and infect the user experience so
let's remove the pipe and call the sort
functionality manually we want to sort
the list every time the toggle done or
add item methods are executed let's call
the sort method in both of these
we don't need the pipe in the ng for
expression so let's remove it and test
to make sure we haven't lost any
functionality great things are still
working and I feel a lot more
comfortable with this implementation the
list now only resource itself when
something changes rather than on every
cycle the lesson we can take from this
is that pipes are great for visual
transformations on simple values like
formatting a number or currency but when
we're working with more complex data or
transformations we should probably try
and avoid them and instead defer the
logic to the component or service in the
next part of this series we're going to
update our project to let the user enter
their own list and see how we can save
this data to the browser's local storage
