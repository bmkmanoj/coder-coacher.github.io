announced a new tool called angular CLI
that makes creating and scaffolding
angular applications simple and painless
by now unless you've been living under a
rock you should at least have heard
about it in this video we're going to
explore and familiarize ourselves with
some of the most common commands like
new generate serve and build by
scaffolding a basic to-do list before
gang started with angular CLI let's make
sure we have the right version of node
and NPM running we should be running at
least node version 4.0 and NPM version
3.0
let's check by going to the terminal and
executing the node - V and NPM - V
commands great next let's install
angular CLI we can do this through NPM
we use the install or I command for sure
along with the global flag to make sure
the package is installed globally
now we have everything installed we're
ready to start making applications to
create a new application we use the ng
new command let's do this now type ng
new to do list and add a style flag this
flag tells the CLI that we want to use
the sass preprocessor for our Styles
instead of defaulting to CSS the new
command recognizes a few different flags
such as the stuff like we already saw as
well as routing and a few others I
suggest you check out the documentation
for a full list of options that are
available the output tells us that our
project files have been created an NPM
is installing the packages necessary to
make our application work so whilst that
happens let's have a look at some of the
files angular CLI gives us out of the
box by default angular CLI gives us the
packages and scaffolds files necessary
for us to unit tests and in turn test
our applications our end-to-end tests go
in the ete folder in the root directory
and when we generate components and
services were provided with spec files
for unit testing to configure our
application we can change config params
in the angular CLI JSON file among other
things we can change a prefix for our
components and extend all the style
sheets and scripts such as jQuery and
the bootstrap framework and setup our
build environments the source folder is
where we spend most of our development
time angular CLI creates a component
called app which acts as the root
component for our application as
projects start to get bigger this is
where it begins the app component is
comprised of four parts we're given a
class file where a component code goes a
spec file to write tests of view and a
style sheet the CLI also generates a
module file where all the declarations
imports and providers can be added let's
have a look at the generate command our
to-do list is going to be made up of
three
an item interface a list service and the
component to output the list first let's
generate the interface in the terminal
type ngspice or interface item we can
see the interface in our app folder by
default angular CLI generates interfaces
classes and services in this folder we
can also specify a folder in the
terminal by prepending it before the
name followed by a slash let's generate
our list service in the same way we will
type ng G but use service instead of
interface this time and call it list the
CLI will generate a file called list
service along with a spec file one thing
to note is that the CLI automatically
adds service to the end of the file name
as well as the class name so we don't
have to call it list service the CLI
reminds us that although the service has
been created it hasn't been provided
meaning if we want to inject it into our
components or services we're going to
have to go through another step in the
app module file we'll get to that in a
second before we switch back to the IDE
let's generate our list component in the
same way type ng G component list
great now we have everything we need to
make our list app let's start with our
item interface we're going to keep it
really simple
so our interface will consist of just
two properties a title which will be a
string and a due date which will be a
date now let's add some code to our list
service we want to hold a list of items
so let's start by importing our item
interface
next we can create a member variable
called items which will be an array of
items lastly let's add a couple of
methods to add and delete items from our
list
if you remember when we generated our
service and get a CL I warned us that we
need to provide it before it can be used
so let's do that all we need to do is
import it into our app module file
now we can add it to the providers array
great now we're able to inject our list
service into our list component
constructor unlike our service and
interface when angular CLI generates a
component it creates a new folder inside
our app folder there's a few files it
gives us first we get a component class
file where our logic goes there's also a
spec file for our unit tests a
stylesheet and a view file let's start
with the component logic first thing to
do is import our list service an item
interface
now let's inject it into our constructor
we're going to make it a public variable
so that we can use it directly in our
view file
let's write some code to generate a few
basic items in our component we'll use a
for-loop to add some items to our list
now we have everything set up this
output our list in our HTML file we're
going to loop through our list items and
output them to the screen one thing I
always have trouble remembering is a
syntax for angular's ng for directive
luckily angular CLI has a convenient
command to help us search the docs in
our terminal we can type ng doc followed
by the search query in this case ng 4
and this will open the search results in
our default browser
now we're armed with enough knowledge to
output our list where we use an
unordered list with an NG for outputting
the title the due date and the delete
button that will call our list services
delete item method
the last thing we need to do is add our
component to the app component view file
as I said before the app component acts
as the root component of our application
now we have our application coded it's
time to test it we can use the CLI cerb
command that would do a few things first
it Lintz our code to make sure there are
no syntax errors then it builds and
minifides everything finally it spins up
a server that watches for changes and
automatically reloads when a file
changes we can view our application by
navigating to local host on port 4200
great seems like everything's working
finally let's have a quick look at the
build command angular CLI lets us build
our code using custom variables
depending on the environment we're
building for for example we're looking
at the production environment variables
the CLI adds a production setting that
set some options for minification but we
can add our own here too in our terminal
we can type ng build with the prod flag
to make angular go through the build and
minification process and create a new
directory called dist with the output
files ready to deploy to a server it's
really that simple thanks for watching
in the next video we'll look at how easy
it is to load the Twitter bootstrap
library into angular 2 and style our
list application to make it look
presentable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
