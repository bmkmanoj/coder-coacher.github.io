popular and easy to use CSS frameworks
currently available it helps develop a
style their projects and make them
presentable quickly and effortlessly
we're going to look at how easy it is to
integrate bootstrap into a very ugly
looking to do this application built on
top of angular CLI and give it some
character if you're interested in
finding out more about angular CLI click
the link in the description below to
learn its basic commands and how we
built the list application because our
list application is scaffolded using the
sass style preprocessor we're going to
be using the bootstraps at NPM project
but it's a similar process if your
project users playing CSS let's start by
adding the package to your app using NPM
in the terminal type NPM I bootstrap
staff with the save flag the save flag
adds the package to our package JSON
file now let's add a new sass file
called under school variables in the
source directory will use this file to
override any bootstrap variables so that
we can customize the app and give it a
unique look
the first change we need to make your
bootstraps default settings is a path to
the points directory set the icon font
path to the path to i installed
bootstrap package
now we need to import bootstrap and our
variable file into the project in Our
Stars the a CSS file add the following
the order of these imports is important
we important the variables file before
bootstrap to make sure our overrides
take priority if we've done everything
properly when we run our project using
ng serve we should see our less font
change from Times New Roman to Helvetica
new let's update our item styles and
give our lesson life we're going to use
bootstraps list group to give each item
its own container and the grid system to
center the list on the page will also
give each items elite buying a badge
class to align it to the right
you
we're getting there but the button
doesn't look quite right so let's add
some styles to our component any stars
you apply to a component apply only 10
sack components this is known as viewing
capsulation by default angular enables
this modularization to avoid class
conflicts within your application and
group the components code together this
means we can override our list items
badge class without it affecting any
other badges let's give our badge a red
background to make it look more like a
delete button and remove the border we
can find it an import bootstraps
variables file within the node modules
folder to make them available to us
to demonstrate view encapsulation let's
add another batch our app component this
shows a total number of items in our app
component class let's expose the list
service class by first importing it then
injecting it into the constructor
now we can display the bags in the
header
finally let's add some functionality to
let us mark an item is done in the item
interface at an optional boolean flag
code done we'll be able to toggle this
flag by clicking on an item now in our
list service we can add a toggle method
to set the done flag
next in our list view file we can add a
click event that flies the toggle method
when they user clicks an item
finally let's add an NG class attribute
to the list items that toggle the items
active class if it's marked as done now
a list is starting to take shape there's
still some opportunities to enhance its
functionality which we'll cover in the
coming videos in the next video we'll
look at creating a custom pipe to order
our list items by date and done styles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
