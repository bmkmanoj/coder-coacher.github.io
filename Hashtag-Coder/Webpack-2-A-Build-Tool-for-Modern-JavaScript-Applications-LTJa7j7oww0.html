build tool for modern JavaScript
applications in this guide we'll look at
how to streamline a development workflow
by creating a project that uses common
features we find in all modern web and
hybrid mobile applications and use
webpack to serve cache and optimize our
various assets using a number of
different bundling strategy each chapter
deep dives into a different topic
meaning the guide works well not only as
an introduction but also as a useful
reference for web back as we continue
developing our skills although this
guide goes to the full lifecycle of an
application build process from creating
a basic configuration all the way to
catering for unique environmental
requirements it's regularly updated with
bonus chapters containing tutorials on
new and interesting creatures and
plugins as the ecosystem continues to
mature by the end of the guide will be
equipped with enough knowledge to
understand that sometimes confusing and
intense documentation and be ready to
integrate web back into our own projects
with e along with this guide I've
included comprehensive code samples
broken down into chapters to make it
easy to follow along and we'll be
supplementing what we learn with free
videos on my youtube channel so be sure
to head over and subscribe to make sure
you don't miss out I hope you enjoy
going through and developing awesome web
pack configurations as you continue your
journey to becoming a JavaScript ninja
