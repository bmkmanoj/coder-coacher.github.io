previous tutorial we developed a simple
web application we wrote a simple
servlet and we executed this up let's do
get method we also understood how Tomcat
interacts with the web application to
identify what method the pod sublet
needs to run we did all the
configurations in our previous tutorial
using annotations we used a simple web
server with annotation and we mentioned
what is a you are Adam that the servlet
catches there's actually another way in
which we can configure servlets in fact
before annotation support was introduced
in java the only way to configure the
sublet was using the XML so that's
another thing that we can have a look at
we'll learn how to do the same thing
which is create a simple web server but
this time using no XML configuration so
the XML that we are going to configure
is in the web-inf folder the name of the
XML is web dot XML web dot XML is
normally called as the deployment
descriptor in a web application so what
that means is the XML contains the
information which is required for
deploying the application and for
running the application so let's open up
the project that we have already created
and open up the deployment descriptor
I have a source here again let me remove
welcome by list that so now okay
so right now our deployment descriptor
contains nothing except for the display
name and of course you know the XML
header so the only only value we have in
the deployment descriptor is you know to
the PAP node and we have the display
name so all the other configuration are
going to go up in the space it's going
to be inside this webapp node so we're
going to create another servlet and
we're going to put the configuration
here at this time so what we'll do is
we'll go to the Chairman resources
source
in the same package I'll create a new
servlet I'm going to create a class this
time so I'll call this
the XML servlet
and this will extend a ship piece of
come on
and it will not have any main methods
and inherit the abstract methods
we finish
okay so here's a bare-bones sublet class
it really doesn't do anything what we'll
do is we'll copy the same do gate from
our previous class and it'll place it
here so it you know it makes sure you've
got all the imports it automatically
does the imported not just make sure you
add them all okay so now we have the do
get here but we need to tell the web
application that this has to be run upon
calling a particular URL you've used to
do that by mentioning the deployment
descriptor here but we're not going to
do that here we are going to use the web
dot XML and we're going to mention the
deployment descriptor related
information over here so in order to
grow you know mention that this is the
servlet that gets executed first I need
to give the servlet a name so I'll
create the servlet known
and in the sublet node I will have a
node called servlet name which tells
what the name of the sub letters I'm
going to call this XML sublet
okay for this name I need to mention
what class is being called when you you
know ask the server so the class that we
are going to call as XML servlet Java so
I will create a node called servlet
class here and I'll keep this class name
of course with the package name
okay so we have defined a servlet here
we have we have mentioned that we want
XML servlet class to be a servlet and
give given it a name you can give it any
name here this is you know you want to
make it third explanatory so that you
know you get to know what that servlet
does but there are actually no rules
that this has to be same as the class
name it can be anything the reason why
we give a servlet name here is so that
we are also going to map this servlet to
a particular URL so that's the that's
the second part of the annotations that
we did earlier we had a property of the
annotations called URL pattern so we're
going to give a URL pattern that maps to
this servlet so that whenever you know
an access HTTP access is made for that
URL pattern the servlet gets executed so
let's go ahead and define that URL
pattern here so I'm going to create
another node
called servlet mapping
should be in lowercase so what sublet
mapping does is it takes one of the
servlets that you've defined here and it
maps it to a particular URL pattern so
do that just say so let me mushroom I
take and copy the same line here
so what we saying is this of that XML
servlet has to be mapped to this URL
pattern call that slash Thanks so let
but I'm just going to add a path so that
you know not not everything that's the
same name you might get confused so yeah
that's that does it so I have have a
sublet node which says okay this is the
name of my servlet and there's the class
of my sublet and then we have another
node called sublet mapping which says
this is the name of the sublet and then
this is the URL mapping I'm going to
save this save this flash and we're all
set because we can execute this now but
in order to see something happening let
me let me create a simple system out
let's say XML servlet called
so when we check the console to know
that this has executed so now I can go
ahead and right click run as run on
server tomcat starts it's going to call
this XML servlet but then says XML
sublet call which means that the do get
method as executed so what's happening
here is very similar to what we did in
our earlier tutorial instead of having
an annotation here we move the
configuration to the web guard XML file
and you know Tomcat reads this file also
to get the information about what's up
later on when a particular URL axis and
that's how it got to know that this has
to run and then it is called this
particular servlet
you know if you compare this
configuration you know this sublet and
sublet mapping configuration if you
compare it with our previous annotation
configuration you can see that this is
actually more you have you have more
things to type and more stuff to do when
compared to a single line of annotation
configuration so the question you would
ask is why would I need to do that I
think annotation is a much simpler way
to do this there are two reasons why we
need to know how to do this one is of
course as I mentioned before annotation
supports started only from Java version
5 before that and of course sometime
after that also people were using the
XML configuration a lot of people still
use XML configuration so to access I
mean to try to understand code which was
written earlier we need to know how to
configure this in an xml-based format
the second reason why we would want to
learn and in fact even use this kind of
as the annotation configuration is tied
to the class itself say I make an
annotation configuration here and I want
to change it I will have to compile this
class and I'll have to deploy it again
whereas in the case of an XML
configuration I just have to make the
change to the XML and then of course
restart Tomcat and then the changes are
going to take effect
I don't have to change the code and I
don't have to read compile and redeploy
we do however have to restart Tomcat
because Tomcat looks at the web dot XML
when it starts up say there are five
applications deploy than the Tomcats
Tomcat folder it's going to look at the
web node XML of all those fire
applications and make a note of the
configurations so once Tomcat has
started if you change web products it's
not going to take ethic so whenever you
make changes to this file you will have
to restart Tomcat but that's all that
you have to do you don't have to compile
and build the reason why you want to use
annotations instead of web products ml
configuration is of course it's less
verbose you don't have to type a lot and
the beauty of annotations is that it
carries a lot of meaning depending on
where the annotation is written see in
this case I need to mention what class
it is what is the package and what is
the path in the case of annotation since
I'm writing it inside the Java class I
don't have to mention what class I'm
referring to because it's simplistic so
that's that's one advantage of using
annotations it's less verbose and it's
much more easier to understand I look at
the class and I can know what are the
configurations instead of referring to
two different flights so again this is
one more thing that you should be
knowing and you know you can choose
either of these options when you're
develop
