certain steps that the JavaScript engine
does when it processes functions I'm
going to just walk you through what
those steps are and I'm not going to
tell you why in the next video I'm going
to explain why it even does that right
work as a point of these steps but in
this video I'm just going to give you a
rundown of what happens behind the
scenes when the JavaScript engine
processes functions so let's say I have
a simple function like this it's a
function foo which is an empty function
right it really doesn't do anything now
what happens then the JavaScript engine
processes a function like this you
remember I told you that functions are
basically objects in JavaScript so when
the engine processes the function like
this what it does is creates an object
which happens to be a function object
and it gives it the name foo now if I
were to access foo
I'm going to get back a function but
what it actually is is an object right
it creates an object it turns out
whenever the JavaScript engine processes
functions it doesn't create just one
object it actually creates two objects
now the first object is this function
which is the name whatever you've given
and right here the name is foo so so
there's a variable called foo which is
pointing to this function object now
what is this other object there are two
objects that are created for every
function what is the second object the
second object that gets created for
every function is actually what's called
the prototype object every time you
create a function there are two objects
that are created one is the object for
the function itself the second is the
object for the prototype so let's say I
have another function here which is the
function bar open/close and this is an
empty function as well now again
JavaScript creates two Phung two objects
one object is for the bar and the other
object is the prototype object right so
what is the point of the prototype
object if you will have to wait for a
bit I'm going to explain what that is in
the next tutorial but for now remember
that there are two objects that are
created now how do I access these
objects now there are thanks to these
two functions there are some total of
four objects created I can access the
object foo by typing foo here I can
access the object bar by using bar but
now how do I access the prototype of
was created for this line in the
prototype object was created for this
line turns out what the JavaScript
interpreter does is it creates a
property on these function objects that
point to the prototype objects so foo
has a property which points to the
prototype object that was created for
foo and bar also has a property that
points to the prototype object was
created for bar so I can access those
prototypes by typing foo dot prototype
so if I hit enter you see here there is
an object that's created and similarly I
can do a bar dot prototype and that's
going to bind to the prototype object
for bar so if I were to draw a diagram
here every time you create a function
javascript engine creates a function
object and it also creates this other
object which is the prototype now you
can access the function object by just
accessing the name of the function but
in order to access the prototype object
you have to use a property of the
function because whenever the JavaScript
engine creates this prototype object it
sets a property on this function object
called prototype and that property
points to this prototype object so in
order to access the prototype of any
function you just say the function name
dot prototype and you're going to get
this object what's important to remember
is that these steps happen for every
function even if the function doesn't
necessarily create objects you see here
the functions foo and bar were just
empty functions it didn't really have
anything in the body itself but so this
thing happens right so what I'm talking
about
applies to all functions even if the
function does not create objects for
instance I can have a function great we
have seen this before console the log
hello right it's a simple function which
has nothing to do with objects right
into of course the grip itself is an
object but then it's not creating an
object just printing something to the
console I can call greet open close and
it prints hello like it should but now
the greet itself is a function object
and greet has a prototype object created
for it as all functions - in JavaScript
and I can access that prototype object
by typing read dot
door type and I get the prototype object
so there is this extra object that's
getting created for every function even
if the function has nothing to do with
creating objects now you might be
wondering why am i explaining this right
now I thought this unit was about
creating objects well the thing is yes
it is about creating objects and that's
actually the reason why this prototype
object exists but if you have a function
it you don't create objects with it at
all this prototype objects just sits
there sadly in the corner not used it
just comes into effect then you do
create objects from functions for
instance we have an empty function
called foo here right there is this
function has no body it's it's empty
it's like open closed right I can call
foo just like that and it's not gonna do
anything however I can call new fool and
then what should happen well there are a
couple of lines that JavaScript is going
to inject into the function it's
basically creating a new object and then
executing foo with the value of this set
to that new object in the context of foo
and then it just returns that thing so I
can basically save for my obj equals new
foo and now I'm still calling foo but
now I'm creating a new object out of it
since food doesn't do anything with this
reference my object is going to be empty
right so my obj is going to be empty but
the fact that you created a new object
from this function it's time for the
prototype object to get busy how does a
prototype object affect the situation
here if you look at the my obj object I
just click on this object and I able to
expand this but it looks like it's empty
but you notice here there is this view
property call underscore underscore
proto underscore underscore okay this
property is again something that the
JavaScript engine creates for a V object
that is created using the new keyword on
a function okay this property this
weird-looking property is actually
pointing to an object can you guess what
object it is so this object turns out is
the prototype object half the foo
function again to switch to the diagram
the function had the prototype object
referred to in the prototype property if
we were to execute the function as is
without using the new keyword this
prototype is not used doesn't apply but
if I were to execute the function using
the new keyword there is a new object
that the JavaScript engine creates right
you can modify it you can change it but
then there is this object that the
engine creates for you now then the
engine creates an object like this
actually sets a property on this object
pointing to this guy pointing to this
prototype object okay this property is
called the this weird name underscore
underscore proto underscore underscore
so I can access this object's proto
property and it still points to this
prototype okay if I were to call this
function again another time with a new
keyword there is another object that
gets created and guess what even this
object has the underscore underscore
proto property which points to the same
prototype object all right so since the
function is the same the prototype
object is also the same in all these
different objects that are created using
the new keyword all have this proto
property which points to this prototype
object let's verify that in the Firefox
console</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
