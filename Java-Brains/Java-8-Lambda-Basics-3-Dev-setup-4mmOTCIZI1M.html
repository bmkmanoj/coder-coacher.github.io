so that we have our dev and environment
ready to write Java 8 applications the
first thing we're going to need is an ID
I have the Eclipse neon ID setup on my
machine you don't have to have this
exact same version you can probably have
a different version what's important is
you have Java heat setup which is
obvious but let's make sure that that's
done I'm going to go to my command
prompt and if I type in Java - version I
should get 1.8 if you are getting an
older version which is 1.7 or 1.6 make
sure you go to the Oracle website and
download the JDK you don't want to
download the JRE right you want to
download the JDK because that's what
lets you build applications in Java
versus just running it so if you don't
see 1.8 when you type Java - version go
download the latest version of the JDK
to setup that installation on your
machine and you should see 1.8 setup
after that open your Eclipse IDE and you
can create a new project I'm going to
create this project Java 8 project and
I'm going to choose the execution
environment which is Java AC 1.8 and I'm
going to call this sure white lambda
basics which is the name of the course
click Next
I'm going to leave these as the defaults
and click finish and I'm going to open
the Java perspective alright now we have
a simple project setup and we can start
writing our Java code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
