filters in jax-rs
the best way to implement authentication
in your jax-rs api's is using filters so
we'll learn that feature of jax-rs first
what is a filter filter is a way for you
to take some of the cross-cutting
concerns and crosscutting logic out from
your individual resource classes into a
common filter class the idea is if you
have some logic to be applied to
different API in different resources
rather than make a copy of that logic in
each of those resources you take that
logic out and create one common class
which contains that logic and then you
apply it to different requests right so
that's the concept of a filter it's a
cross-cutting concern that you isolate
out into its own separate entity so what
you do is you create a filter which
contains that cross-cutting logic and
then you configure what are the API
requests for which that filter needs to
apply an example is logging let's say
you want to log all the API requests and
responses and the times at which they
were made one way you could do it is
make sure that logging statement is you
know coded in each and every resource
class which is a lot of duplication of
work what you could do instead is create
a logging filter and have that do the
logging now when you create a jax-rs
filter jax-rs is sure to call that
filters logic when an API call is mean
so that's how you isolate that logic out
I'm going to demonstrate the filter
logic by creating a couple of filters in
this tutorial the first filter that I'm
going to create is a powered by filter
you must have seen some software
solutions that provide a powered by tag
to applications or websites you see you
tags like powered by WordPress or
powered by angularjs or something like
that
so I'm going to do something similar
here when there's a REST API call that's
made the response it goes out should
ideally have a header value which is
powered by and the value should be Java
brains so every response has a
powered by Java brains so I'm going to
create this filter now instead of having
this be a part of every resource I'm
going to isolate this out as a filter so
I'm going to go ahead and create this
new class in the rest package I'm going
to call this powered by response filter
okay so for a class to be a filter it
needs to implement an interface that
comes with jax-rs now what interface you
want to implement depends on what you
want that filter to be so turns out
there are two types of filters in jax-rs
one is a request filter and one is a
response filter a request filter is a
filter that executes before a request is
served and the response filter is a
filter that's executed after the
response is prepared and it's about to
be sent to the client right so you're
basically intercepting either the
request or you're intercepting the
response so depending on whether you
want your filter to be a request filter
or response filter you got to pick the
right interface to implement in the case
of this powered by filter
I want the response to be changed right
so in the response I want to add a
header so what I need here is a response
filter so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to implement an interface called
container response filter and the mean
port this and I had the unimplemented
methods now you see here I need to
implement this filter method now the
powered by response filter implements
container response filter so this is a
response filter the jacksons framework
is going to call this filter method
implementation when the response is
about to be sent okay now here you have
a chance to modify the response you have
a chance to add a header value let's
look at the parameters to this filter
method
the parameters depend on whether it's a
request filter or a response filter in
the case of a request filter the jax-rs
framework sends an instance of a class
called container request context it's
basically a context object right it's an
object which contains details about the
request in the case of a response filter
though you get two context objects one
is the request context and one is the
response context since the request
filter happens before the request is
processed all you have is the request
context but the response filter is
called after the response is prepared so
you have access to both the request
context and the response context so you
can actually tweak and modify both in
our case we're doing the powered by
filter so I'm going to modify response
using the response context so what I'm
going to do is change these names I'm
going to call them request context in
response context and then I'm going to
do a response context dot I need to get
the header values so I'm going to say it
get headers dot add need to add this
powered by header so I'm going to say X
powered by as the key the value is Java
brains now the last thing I need to do
is mark this as a provider as with all
the other things in jax-rs marking this
as a provider
conveys that special functionality that
this class has so I'm going to save and
run this on Tomcat
and I'm going to switch to postman make
a REST API call to this endpoint
examine the headers you see there is
this extra header value X powered by
Java brains so this is a filter in
action so this is not something that we
added in a resource class this is a
separate filter so it's applicable to
any REST API call that's made to an
endpoint that this application serves
what's also interesting is if I make any
API call to send to an endpoint that
doesn't exist for instance I change this
to error
I changed look at the header value here
well it still says powered by Java
brains so the filter is actually getting
executed no matter what you whether it's
a successful response are there is an
error response the filter is guaranteed
to execute which is pretty cool alright
so I'm going to do one more
implementation off a filter this is
going to be a logging filter
I want to log let's say the header
values for the request and the header
value for the response so I need both I
need to log the header values of a
request when the requesters main and
before the response is sent back I want
to log all the header values of the
response so I'm going to go ahead and
create this new class called a logging
filter click finish and now since I need
to do both before and after I can do
this I can actually do an implements
contain a request filter import this and
at the unemployment admits this as we
just saw is a filter method which takes
in just the request context change this
to request context and let's print the
request header value here I'm going to
say request context dot get headers and
I'm just going to do us this out
of this alright so with this I am going
to be printing the header values for
every request that lets me do this to
this application you can see here the
request headers are all being logged in
the console but now what I want to do is
also log the response headers so I could
of course create a separate filter for
it but since these are just interfaces
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
also implement that response filter
interface so I'm going to say implements
container response filter and now if I
add the unimplemented methods I'm going
to get the method that we just saw it's
a filter method which takes in two
arguments let's the container request
context and the container response
context now both these methods happen to
be in the same class but since we have
registered them as a provider and an
implementation of these two interfaces
jax-rs knows what method to call when
right it's going to call the first
method for request filter and we
actually do us this out request filter
here and I'm going to do us this out
response filter here to make sure that
this is printed in the response
and I'm going to print out the response
headers response context dot get headers
now I make this call in postman if I
switch to the console but here you can
see there is a request filter and
request headers and we have the response
filter the response headers so it's
pretty cool so this is how you implement
filters and jax-rs you can either do a
request order responds our like we've
seen with the logging filter you can do
one filter which does both just has two
methods and the jax-rs framework knows
which method to call when</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
