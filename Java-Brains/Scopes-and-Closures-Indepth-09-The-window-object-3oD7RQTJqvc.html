about is the global object and throwing
all these concepts at you because I
think these are the building blocks to
kind of understand Hough scopes work in
JavaScript so let's look at the concept
of the global object remember I told you
that when you declare a variable and
that variable is not you know the
variables declaration is not enough
function then that becomes a global
variable so if I say var a equals 10
here now a is a global variable have a
function foo and then inside this
function I say where B equals 20 now B
there's not a global variable because
this is inside a function so the scope
of B is the scope of this function since
this is outside any function this is the
global scope now I'll be talking about
the global scope but what you also need
to understand is there is this global
object and that object is kind of like
the root object which holds all these
global variables the root object or the
global object depends on which runtime
you are using here I'm using Firefox I'm
running JavaScript in the browser so
when you run javascript in the browser
the global object is usually the window
object okay then a javascript piece of
code runs in a browser it's usually due
to a page loading in a window okay you
access a URL and then that you are a
load the page and that page happens to
have JavaScript and that's how you run
javascript in the browser right that's
typically how you do it so the global
object in that case is the window that
has loaded the page and it is executing
the JavaScript so there is a global
object called window every time you
execute JavaScript in a browser so I can
actually get the window object by just
typing window here and I hit enter and
we see here the window shows about blank
because I have a blank page open but I
can actually click on this and see the
object let me see here there is a bunch
of properties that this window object
contains and these properties are
actually global properties because
window is a global object now a
little-known secret is whenever you
create a global variable right so let's
say I do of
our ABC equals 100 and I reload and run
now what happens is if I open the window
object again notice that it has a
property called ABC and it has the value
100 what's going on here now let's say I
declare one more i say VAR DF equals
hello window object and i'm going to
reload and run again and let's open the
window object again there you go the EF
is a property on the window and it
contains the value over here so
basically what's happening is when you
create a global variable you're actually
creating a property on this global
object every global variable there's a
property on the global object okay this
is actually happening behind the scenes
and we don't even know it
we can access the global variable D EF
by accessing d EF directly or we can do
window dot DF they both mean the exact
same thing ok so even though you feel
that you're creating random variables
and less signing it to the global scope
what you're actually doing is creating
properties on a global object called
window this works not only for variables
it also works for functions well let's
say I have a function my function solar
blog hello then I'm going to reload and
run now let's examine the window object
again here you see there is a my func
property on the window object which is
this function ok so essentially whatever
you do in the global scope write
whatever you do which is not in a
function which automatically translates
to a global scope is basically just
creating properties on the global object
now I mentioned that the global object
itself depends on the runtime and in the
case of a browser it makes sense that
it's a window because the window is
a starting point for the page to tender
and for the script to execute now this
is again different for different
runtimes if you're looking at something
like node the global object is AG object
called global and then there are other
end times which would have different
global objects but the point is that in
the JavaScript runtime at least
according to the spec there is one
global object that is available across
the board and whenever you create global
variables you're essentially creating
properties on that global object</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
