you to a tool that
requests and see the responses I'm
talking about a REST API client there is
some amount of work that you can do with
recipes in a browser for example if you
type in the URL in the address bar and
then enter in any of your favorite
browsers the browser actually makes a
get request but that's actually not what
we want you want to be able to send a
request and examine the response in good
amount of detail you also want to be
able to choose the kind of methods that
get sent right we have the put method we
have the delete method the browser is
not really ideal for that right the
browser is usually capable of handling
just get and post methods so we want
more control over the kind of requests
that we send and we want to be able to
examine the responds in good amount of
detail so we're going to look at a tool
which helps us do that there are a lot
of clients out there in the market and
some of the best ones and some of the
easiest ones to get started with are
typically browser plugins in my opinion
I'm actually using Chrome right now and
chrome has this really nice plugin for
rest client which is called postman in
order to install postman what you need
to do is go to the web store in chrome
and once you're there you search for
postman and you see this postman rest
client you don't have to go for the
package tab just get the postman rest
client just click on it and you should
see an install button over here since I
already have it it says launch app so
once you've installed it you should see
it in the installed apps so click on
that and you see the postman interface
you don't have to use postman by the way
if you're using Firefox there are a
bunch of plug-ins for that and even in
chrome there are a couple more plugins
postman just happens to be my favorite
you can use whatever plugin e1 and
follow along but if you're interested in
postman I'm just going to give you a
quick overview of what this plug-in does
so at the very top here you have the
request URL which allows you to enter
the URL where you want to make the REST
API call I'm just going to choose HTTP
colon double slash Java brains card my
website I'm going to do a get request
here and if I hit Send basically it's
going to return the response itself
right so this is how it's different from
the browser if you're accessing this in
the browser you would see the rendered
HTML but here you actually see the
response body right and you have a
cookie stab here where you can actually
see the kind of cookies that the site is
assigning you have the header stab which
shows the header values for the response
there's also this information bar over
here which says the statuses 200 ok
which is the ICT HTTP status code now
here in the drop down you can choose the
kind of HTTP method that you want to use
to access this URL now if I were to make
a post request to the same URL it's
going to give me an error message right
and you see here there is a get request
and there's a post request it's
basically tracking all the different
kinds of requests that I've made so I
can immediately switch back to the get
request and just hit Send and it returns
the same response because it makes the
same request so here it stores your
history which is a set of all the kind
of requests that you've made
you also can enter URL parameters over
here which is basically the question
mark and then key equals value that you
typically have for your URL but you can
actually enter a key value pair kind of
a format over here you can also enter
header values which is basically what
it's again a key value pair set of
values and it it basically sets the
request header values and when you hit
send the request that goes in will have
these header values preset if you do a
post request or any of those other
requests let me switch these two off do
a post request you see that you get
this option you can choose farm data URL
encoded data and raw the raw option is
what we're going to choose mostly in
this course and when you choose raw you
get a text box over here what you type
here they'll go in as the post body
after request if I were to do a put I
still get this box where I can send
something in the put request body of
course this box goes away when I'm doing
a get because you really cannot send
anything in the request body of a get
but yeah if you were to use one of these
methods you can enter the request body
now if I were to use JSON I can enter
JSON over here and it's going to color
code it because I selected this JSON
value or you can just choose text to
enter any kind of text here so this is a
postman in a nutshell you would have
similar functionality in any of the
other REST API clients you use you're
free to use whatever you want but in
this course I have to pick a tool and
I'm going to choose postman if you want
to follow along you can install postman
in Chrome or you can follow along with
any other plug-in or tool of your choice
it really doesn't matter but the fact is
you are going to need some kind of a
REST API client when we are developing
the REST API it's because you want to
test out our API s and make different
kinds of requests which is not possible
in a standard browser so if you're
looking for a to give postman a try and
have it installed I'll see you in the
next tutorial thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
