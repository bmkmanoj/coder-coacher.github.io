before we start off with the topic for
this video I just want to mention that I
think I might have made a mistake in the
previous video where I talked about
extracting the end point interface out
of the implementation so if you remember
this was the implementation product
catalog it had all the annotations what
I did in the last video was extracted
out to a product catalog interface and
then the interface had all these
annotations right and the product
catalog had just one annotation the web
service with just one property which is
the interface which contains all the all
the information now what is the mistake
that I did let's check out the interface
where I'm overwriting all these names so
you see here there is a name a port name
service name and target namespace so I'm
overwriting all these but my own custom
values and I'm not ordering anything in
the product catalog of course the
endpoint interface is just a pointer but
here is where I'm specifying all these
values right so now if I'd apply this
application what do you think would be
the name of the service that gets
generated out of this code well it
should be the service name that I'm
giving over here which is the test map
catalog service right well surprisingly
well at least surprising to me I realize
that that's not the case so this is the
application deployed in GlassFish and if
I open this mod now let me view the
endpoint and the wisdom
and here you see the name of the
services product catalog service and if
I scroll down the name of the Border's
product catalog port so these values
that I've given over here which is the
port name and the service name I'm not
getting applied at all but however you
notice the namespace here namespace is
getting the value of tes Montcalm which
is the value that I'm giving over here
so apparently the target namespace value
is getting applied but these values are
not getting applied and the way to get
that to work is to remove this out of
the interface say this and add it over
here and implementation and now if I
save and publish this
and refresh this now if you see product
catalog service is not valid anymore and
I can access the test mat catalog
service and the board name is also the
value that I've specified over here so I
didn't get a chance to troubleshoot this
I'm not really sure what's happening if
it's a bug or if it's an expected
behavior so if you happen to know please
leave a comment and I'll update the
video or the blogpost with what's
happening ok so now let's move on to
what I want to talk about in this
tutorial so one of the things that we
saw in the previous tutorial was the
return type being a custom data type
right we created a new class called
product and this was a custom data type
that a web service returned so I created
a new method called get products version
2 which returned a list of my product
custom objects and what did we have to
do to get this to work we didn't have to
do anything right it happened by default
happen out of the box here you see the
response is actually in a nice XML
structure so this is our basic Java Bean
just getting converted to XML so in this
tutorial we're going to understand a
little bit about how that's happening
and how we can customize it so given a
Java class given a class like this if I
would ask you to convert an instance of
this to an XML how easy or how hard of a
task would that be I have a product
object instance I have a specific name
value of a specific skew value in a
specific price value now if I have to
convert this instance to an XML it
should be a fairly simple task
because if you think about how things
would work in an XML so you have a root
value you have a root node and inside
that you have individual elements
for each of the member variables so I
have 3 member variables here so I'll
have 3 XML elements right so it should
be fairly straightforward now things
could get a little bit tricky if this
were a collection if it was a list or a
set
or if it was another complex type as a
member variable so this was actually a
reference to another class which again
had a whole lot of them in the variables
of it so on but even then it's actually
very easy to map an instance of a Java
object to a piece of XML that contains
all the information that the Java object
contains so it's actually fairly
straightforward for us to do the mapping
and one of the technologies that
actually helps us in this conversion is
a technology called jacks P and what it
helps us do is to actually bind
different parts of a Java object with
different parts of an XML structure and
vice versa so it actually helps us
convert a Java object to an XML or a
piece of XML code to a Java object so
I'm going to talk a little bit about how
to do this here I'm not going to go into
the details of Jack's P because that's a
completely different topic but I'm going
to briefly discuss how to apply Jack's
be here to get this conversion more to
our liking so this conversion is
happening by default but I'm going to
use Jack's P to customize some of the
things that's happening over here the
good thing about Jack speedo is that it
doesn't really need a lot of help out of
the box for example let's take this
class so I have a public class class
name whatever be the class name so
instinctively you would know that the
way to convert this into an XML is to
have a start and end tag right so the
contents of the class name are going to
be bound by this start and end tag and
if the you know the class has like three
member variables like I've mentioned
over here they are going to be
individual XML elements so a direct
translation would be something like this
so VAR one would have an XML element
with the value similarly for y2 and y3
so the value of the instance would be
bound between these two tags okay now if
this is a list or another class as a
member variable that would probably be
nested over here but it would follow the
same structure so by default you don't
really need to give a lot of information
to Jack's P to make it do the conversion
properly it
knows how the conversion needs to be
done by default one scenario where you
would need to give extra information to
Jax because if you want something to
change from the default like for example
I want to change the name here to my own
custom name I don't want it to be the
name of the variable I want it to be my
own custom name so in this case I would
have to give this that additional
information to Jax P to say hey when you
when you convert this particular member
variable to XML don't use the name of
the member variable use my own specific
name instead okay so that's pretty much
how you would customize a class with Jax
P so when you have a Java class and you
want it to be converted to Jack's P and
whenever you need some kind of an
override like this what you would do is
provide that extra information and once
Jack P reads that extra information it
knows what to do and this extra
information actually happens to be
Jack's P annotations so you actually
annotate the class with specific Jack's
P annotations and then Jack's P knows
what to do so let's say you have an
instance of this class right you have a
Java object and it has the stacks P
annotations at runtime so when you when
you give this object when you give an
instance of this object to a jak
speedrun time the jak speedrun time is
going to look at these annotations and
it's going to know how to convert this
to an XML you know external piece of
code and then you get the output XML
based on the configuration that you've
provided over here so this is what we're
going to do now for our product class
we're going to provide some Jack's P
annotations to let Jack's be customized
how our XML is going to turn out and
we'll add these annotations and apply it
and see how it works
