JavaScript here are the top-level things
that we're going to cover in this unit
we're going to talk about what
javascript is you know that it's a
programming language proving a look at
some details about the language itself
we're going to talk about violence our
script what are we going to gain by
learning JavaScript what are the things
you can do with the language thirdly I'm
going to talk about the history of the
language
what causes JavaScript to be created the
history of the language is particularly
important in the case of JavaScript
because it affects your experience with
the language javascript was actually
created with certain motives in mind
certain reasons in mind and those
reasons actually influenced how the
language was designed so understanding
those reasons those motives is helpful
because when you do see those design
decisions and those quirks in the
language you will kind of understand why
the language was designed in that thing
and finally we will wrap up this unit
with some heads up on some problems
there are certain problems that will
likely face when you're learning the
language in your writing code so I'm
going to give you a little bit of a
heads up so that you can be better
prepared when you do encounter those
problems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
