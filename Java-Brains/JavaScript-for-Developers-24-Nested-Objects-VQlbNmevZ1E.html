about how objects work in most
programming languages as in JavaScript
an object is essentially a reference to
a location a memory location on the heap
so when you say why my object equals any
give it an object the my object variable
is essentially pointing to a location in
memory where the object has been
allocated okay so this works in most
programming languages and it's something
similar in JavaScript as well so since
this whole thing executes in the browser
there is this memory location in the
browser's memory the browser's memory
space which it's managing for your code
and there is this location allocated for
your object and your variable is
essentially pointing to that object okay
you can have another variable which
points to the same object by just saying
bar my object to equals my object in
which case both my object two and my
object are essentially pointers to that
single location in memory for that
object okay I'm assuming that you're
familiar with object-oriented
programming concepts in another language
and this isn't much of a surprise to you
right so variables are essentially
pointing to a memory location in an
object now what are the things you can
assign to available we've seen primitive
types right we've said var a variable
name equals and you've given a primitive
type and we've assigned different values
like a string and a boolean and a number
and all those things to that variable
similarly you can also assign an object
like we've seen a location in memory do
that variable and that is one thing that
can go into available that's one thing
that the variable can hold as a valid
value now the thing to remember is
anything that's a valid variable value
is also an object property value so just
like you can have a variable which
contains a number you can also have an
object property which contains a number
or a string or any of those primitive
types so what's interesting here is just
like you can have a variable which
contains an object you can also have an
object property that contains an
object's
that's pointing to an object so you can
have an object in which there is a
property which is another object right
that object would have a property which
is another object so what we're looking
at is nested objects this shouldn't be
too surprising you can have you know in
different languages you can have classes
where the property of the class is an
instance of another class so you can
have objects containing the properties
containing objects and so on so let me
demonstrate a nested object structure
here and I'll show you how you can mix
and match the dot operator and the
square bracket operator now here I have
the my object you know variable here
which contains an object now I can have
an object property and I'm going to call
this Abdi an object I can do something
like this this is an empty object okay
or I can initialize it to something else
I can have inner prop be inner property
all right so this is still an inline
definition of an object right I'm
defining all those properties and the
values I just happen to have a property
which is having a value of an object and
then I'm defining the object in line
okay
this can be mixed and matched so let's
say I get rid of these two lines here so
in order to print the inner property of
this object property the way to do this
is I can say my object which is the
variable which holds the top-level
object and I can get to the object
property by using the dot notation again
obj prop and the value of this is going
to be an object okay so I can console
dot log of this and I'm going to get the
inner object
you see here I get the inner object now
what if I want to access the property of
the inner object well I can do that by
adding a dot operator on top of it so
this expression is going to resolve to
an object and now that's an object can
access a property as usual by using the
dot operator so I can say a dot inner
prop and if I reload and run I'm going
to get that string which is the value
off that inner property I hope this
makes sense this shouldn't be too too
surprising and all the things that you
have learned works the same way you can
create new properties on this inner
object just like you can create a
property on the outer object for
instance I can say my object dot object
property to get to that object property
and then I can create a new one new
inner equals new inner value and now if
I do a console dot log I'm going to
print the whole object here let's see
reload and run you see here I get object
property which is an object in a factual
akan it gives me the details there are
two properties here one is in a prop and
the new inner which is something that we
just added over here so you can do the
in the same techniques over here and the
other thing one last thing that I want
to show you is you can mix and match the
dot operator and the square bracket
operator so instead of doing this let's
say I want to print this new in alright
so copy this your
and bring this value that should work
like we would expect it to you get the
new inner value but what I can also do
is I can use the square bracket operator
for the second part of this expression
over here so I'm using the dot operator
to get to the object proper here and
then I'm using the square bracket
operator to get to this property all
right so I can potentially mix and match
and that works just as fine just as well
you can of course have you could have
had the square bracket operator first
and then the dot operator which it's all
fine that works the same way so here dot
operator and the square bracket operator
can be mixed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
