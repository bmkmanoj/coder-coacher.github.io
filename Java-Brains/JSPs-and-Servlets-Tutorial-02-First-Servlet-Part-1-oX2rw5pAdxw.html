write simple web application it will
have just one servlet but we'll learn
how to write that servlet and how to
execute it as well so let's get started
first let me stop Tomcat
we don't want it running for now today
you see you have the Tomcat logs printed
here and don't get has been stopped
ok so I'll right-click and clear the
logs here so if I think we need to do
here is create a project just like any
other java application you will have to
have a project here the project will be
a java web application project in this
case so I go to the package Explorer tab
right click select new and I learnt you
is Java project here I'll go to other
and here you have a list of project
templates you will see this only if you
have installed Eclipse for Java EE
developers so when you go to the Eclipse
site and download the Eclipse
installation you have different versions
of eclipse you have Eclipse for Java or
developers have eclipse for Java EE
developers and a whole lot more so it's
recommended that you choose Java for EE
developers so if you do that you will
see all these other options we have
options for EJB you have Java EE whole
lot of other stuff what we are
interested is in this Web folder this
has an entry called as dynamic web
project so this is what we will select
here so I say next now it will ask me
for a project name so I will choose
simple servlet
project it uses the default location
which is same as the workspace location
this you would have selected when you
start eclipse it's going to ask for the
target runtime that our target end time
is going to be Apache Tomcat which we
have already selected I'm going to leave
this as the default 3.0 configuration is
going to be the same Apache Tomcat
configuration so pretty much I have left
everything here as a default that one
just entered the project name press next
now it's going to ask for the source
folder so I will choose
SFC so what this what i'm doing here is
i'm telling eclipse that i want to
create all my source code in the SRC
folder the default output folder is
build slash classes again this is
something that I'm going to leave as
default and press next now it's going to
ask me for the context root and content
directory this needs a little bit of
explanation let me just leave this as a
default here and I'll get back to that
when we actually run the mirror on the
project so I check generate by Brad XML
deployment descriptor and click finish
okay now it's going to ask that this
kind of project is associated with the
Java EE perspective do you want open
that yes a perspective is nothing but a
layout of tabs it Dana you know it
chooses this particular set of tabs in a
particular layout so it's it's
convenient if you have this Java EE
perspective so I'm going to select the
service tab here so here is our project
we have quite a few nodes here which we
are not really concerned about initially
one that we are concerned about you know
to start off with is this node called
the deployment descriptor
this is actually an XML file let's say
let's open up the navigator as we go to
the window show view navigator so this
is this is how the files are actually
organized in the file system so dot
slash path and dot project are metadata
for Eclipse to manage this project so
expand this web content folder by by
enough you see this web dot XML file
let's double click on this not showing
the XML view I'll go for source there
you go so this is web dot XML file it
has you know the XML header the webapp
node inside the webapp node you have
something called as a display name which
is simple sublet project and it also has
something called as a welcome file list
it has quite a few HTML nsj piece index
default and so on that's a burden very
simple file which configures what is the
Welcome file welcome file actually means
when you are not entering any particular
HTML or JSP file name in the URL
it just enters the web
application URL directly then what is
the file that the web application should
show so we have a few files specified
here it if it finds any one of these
files it's going to show that but before
we go there first I need to tell you
what a web application context does when
we configure this we entered two values
one was for the context name for which
we entered simple servlet project which
is same as project name here and the
second one we entered the web content
directory name which was web content as
you can see here it's created one folder
called web content so if we had entered
something else there the name of the
folder would have been different if
you're entered web this would have been
called web so what is this do this
contains all the web content that
content means HTML files JSP files
JavaScript files so all those files will
be stored over here so let me do one
thing here if you know you have a list
of welcome files right so what it's
trying to do here is it's trying to find
one of these files here we don't have
any such files ilet's let's go ahead and
create one so I'm going to right click
new and I'll choose other HTML file
next we'll get the file name I will give
index dot HTML
and I'm creating this inside web
contents it since it's a HTML file it
has to go to the web content folder I'll
say next I will leave this as default
let's say finish so here is our
index.html created directly I'm going to
enter some I'm going to make some
changes here
title is inserted here so I'm going to
change this this will be simple web
application and in the body I will type
the same thing and says hello ok so this
is a simple HTML file now we are
actually all set to run this application
we have everything ready so what are the
things we have ready we have an XML file
which actually tells the web server what
to render as default we have all these
things we only need index or HTML in
fact we can actually remove all these
things we don't need that we have when
you just need to configure welcome file
as index dot HTML let me go ahead and
remove these let's save so that's it
so welcome file is index dot HTML if
created that index dot HTML here and now
we can run this right click run as run
on server whichever you want to run it
on this is Apache Tomcat you can also
define a new server here we already
defined it so let's say next now you
know you remember we saw this time
before you know it when we are
configuring the server it has flatter
available and configure it all of them
were
blank now we have a simple servlet
project here and it's in the configure
the list so which is good they finish
now it's going to start Tomcat and
deploy the application and it's going to
call this we actually have a browser tab
open inside Eclipse itself as you can
see here so it's going to call this URL
and it's going to render this HTML file
so whatever we typed here in extras
shimmer is actually getting rendered
here so it's calling Tomcat Tomcat is
providing this file ok so now we will
talk about the context you know the
other entry that we made there was the
application context and we had entered
simple servlet project what this means
is you know earlier we tried this right
we just write HTTP localhost colon 8080
and we got the tomcat home page now this
particular tomcat instance might have
many applications running in it we can
have one web application one EJB
application one simple you know bunch of
HTML so we can have a whole lot of
applications running so to access one
particular application we need to give
that application name over here so it
needs to be localhost colon 8080 which
means you know I'm calling the tomcat
instance and then after that I need to
enter the name of the application which
I've deployed on this instance so that
Tomcat goes to that particular
application and says hey I'm there is
this request that's coming for you now
you need to serve this request so I'm
going to enter simple servlet project
since this is the the context root which
we had configured when we you know
created this project this is what this
is this is the application that Tomcat
will call when you enter this if you
have another application installed on
the same tomcat instance you need to
give that application name so when I
pray press ENTER now this application is
called and when this application is
called you don't have any resource here
you don't have slash index dot HTML or
anything like that
so what Tomcat does is it goes to web
dot XML and it looks for the welcome
file list you know here you have
configured one welcome file which is
index dot HTML so it puts that up from
the web content folder again this is
another thing we configured earlier it's
going to pull up index dot HTML it finds
it and it renders it now say index dot
HTML was not there some we had few other
files and we had configured all those in
the Welcome list you know where there
were a few other files here so instead
of index dot HTML say we had a default
dot HTML it's actually going to look at
all these files one after the other it's
gonna check for index.html no it's not
there an extra HTM not there JSP you
know the default dot HTML it finds it
and it renders it so any one of these
files if it's available in the web
content folder it's gonna render that
and it's going to display this so now we
have actually created a web application
which actually doesn't do anything much
it just has a HTML file let me save this
index dot HTML now the next step is to
actually create a servlet which runs
this HTML is static content you know the
Tomcat isn't doing much it's just just
pulling up the file and it's just
sending it to the client side now let's
say I wanna I want to run a Java program
so how I do that is clicking you let me
get this rid of the stab and why do that
is by creating a servlet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
