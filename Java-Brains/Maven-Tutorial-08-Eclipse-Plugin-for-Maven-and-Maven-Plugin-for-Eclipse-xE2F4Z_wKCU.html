modular architecture and it's comprised
of a lot of plugins Eclipse is an IDE
that was very widely used and even that
has a modular architecture there are a
lot of plugins inside Eclipse and it
just so happens that maven has an
eclipse plug-in and Eclipse has a maven
plugin we'll have a look at both of them
in this tutorial but it does make sense
because even though you use maven and
the command line for having a project
structure using art types and things
like that you won't actually be doing
any coding in the command line using
text editors you would normally use an
IDE for that and once you're inside an
IDE you might have to run maven command
so you need you need a good integration
between maven and your IDE and you know
thanks to these plugins maven in Eclipse
work very well together and we'll have a
look at how we can use these plug-ins so
the first thing I'm going to talk about
is the Eclipse plugin for maven so if I
have a maven pray you know um pom Road
XML here and I have the source directory
here now say I want to open this inside
Eclipse
I can use the Eclipse plugin in order to
generate an eclipse project out of a
pond or XML so what I need to do is I
need to call the mvn Eclipse coolin
Eclipse now note that I'm not entering
the details about the Eclipse plug-in in
the Palm D'Or XML you don't have to
mention all the plugins that you use in
the build phase inside your pomerode xml
may even automatically connects to the
repository and checks what plugin it is
the first part of the command you know
gives information about what the plug-in
is so it's going to have a look at the
repository and identify what they clips
plug-in is and you would enter some
configuration values in the Palm D'Or
XML above the plug-in and that's the
only reason why you would you know
modify the bombed-out XML if you have if
you are happy with the defaults there's
no reason to add the plug-in details in
your pom dot XML so I'm ok with the
defaults here I just want Eclipse
plug-in to create an eclipse project so
that I can open up the source code
inside eclipse so I
press Enter so again women is going to
look at the repository and download the
plugins and the components required for
running this command okay so it's
finished the download and here you can
see there's an info message it says
wrote the Eclipse project from my web
app at this location which is the web
and my web app so this is the location
where the Eclipse project has been
created and since the files are hidden
by default if I do a show hidden files I
can see the dot class path in the dart
project that has information to eclipse
about how to open this project in the
workspace so now what I'll do is I'll
open eclipse and I will open this
project location inside of Eclipse so I
don't have to do imports and things like
that now what I do is inside Eclipse I
just open the project as if it were a
project that was created in Eclipse
itself okay so I'll say you file import
and let's say existing projects I don't
have to do any configuration actuality
an existing project so I will choose the
root directory just my web app say ok
now it detects that it is this my web
app project so when I say finish it's
going to open this up all the
configurations are in place no matter
what all configurations you have in your
palm load XML all those will get
imported in some cases you might see an
error here here you see a red
exclamation point and there will be
errors and it says unbound class path
variable M to underscore ripple so
what's happening is the jars that this
project is
offering to since it's coming from the
maven repository Eclipse does not know
what the maven repository is now means
right click properties so here you go
the the libraries is from M to
underscore a poem to underscore it was
available which needs to be substituted
with the actual value of the repository
and the repository is most flange it's
in the home folder with the underscore
I'm sorry it's dot M - yeah here it is
dot M - repository so this is the this
is the directory location which the M to
underscore turbo variable should point
to so what I will do is here I'll add a
variable and say configure variables
create new one m to underscore repo and
this will be slash dot m2 and repository
okay I can also choose the folder here
and I can configure the same thing here
but yeah here you go just press ok so
it's the same thing now say ok done now
it says the classpath variables have
been changed you want to do a full build
yes say ok and ok again now it's going
to do a full build and that edit is
going to go away of course this is a
code related error but the variable
error that was there
there is no longer showing up and since
we are given the location of the
repository it knows where to pull of
these jars and it's referenced those
jars accordingly ok so now we have
imported the project inside eclipse but
now the problem is we have to run any
maven commands I would still have to go
to the command line this movie I can run
it inside eclipse so here what we do is
we will install a maven plugin for
Eclipse so this plug-in which is
I am do Eclipse plugin will help us run
naming commands inside eclipse itself
and you know once you have the plugin
inside Eclipse if eclipse is your main
development environment you wouldn't
ever want to go and run commands in the
command line
everything can be accomplished in the
GUI and it makes life a lot easier
so we'll install the m2 Eclipse plugin
now so what we do is in Eclipse menu the
health menu you would go and there is
this manual I entry here called install
new software just click on that and here
what we need to do is we need to enter
the site where the m2 Eclipse plug-in is
available now if I just look at what all
are available I'll say all available
site and m2 Eclipse sites are also
available here so I will just say search
everything and I select all available
sites everything comes up and I can
search here I will search for maven so
there are a few plugins which have the
word maven in it this is what I'm
looking at
maven integration for Eclipse so I'll
just choose this one there are a few
extras and a few other plugins we're not
going to worry about that for now I'll
just use this main plug in let's say
next so it's going to gather all the
dependencies and it will install ok so
this is the only plugin that's required
I press next again and it's gonna you
know there's a license terms and if you
agree click on I accept and press finish
now it's going to download and install
click its plug-in and after the
installation it's going to prompt for a
restart it's better to restart my clips
is going to restart and the m2 Eclipse
plug-in will start working now man
eclipse loads up after installation I
see this overview screen where there's a
new entry which talks about the maven
integration for Eclipse you can probably
read through some of the stuff here
but I'll go to the workbench now the few
of the benefits of having this em--to
Eclipse plug-in is that first of all you
can run maven commands from the Eclipse
IDE so if you go to the bomb load XML
you right-click you have this entry for
maven and you see this IDE dependency
add plug-in new maven module so all
these maven commands can be run over
here and then when you go to the run as
menu so here you see you have a few
entries for me when you have a maven
build maven clean maven install an even
package
so all these correspond to the MV in
commands that you'd run in the camp and
you know in the command line so I'm even
build would be a build commander maven
clean would be and being clean let me
even install me even package all
corresponds to M bein install and me in
package commands so this is something
you can use to directly run the maven
commands another benefit is you can
search for dependencies you can search
for artifacts right from the maven and
right from the Eclipse IDE and this is
something that we're going to look at in
the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
