compliation process in some languages
like Java or C sharp you might find a
couple of things that the typescript
compiler does a bit surprising we can
walk through a couple of those things
that at least surprised me when I was
learning typescript initially and I'm
pretty sure it's gonna surprise someone
new to type 3 - now here's the hollow
ball that yes we were working on in the
last video we had three variables with
three different types and we ran the
typescript compiler on halliwell 30s and
take a look at this javascript file that
it's rendered there are three variables
that are declared and the values that
are being assigned so what happened to
the types we had three types here we had
number boolean and string all the types
of compiler has done is it's taken those
types off it just has three variable
declarations and assignments but thanks
a lot typescript compiler what use is
this well here's what's happening the
types that you've assigned over here are
for the purposes of checking during
development time it's not for checking
during runtime the whole process of
transpiling
your typescript code to JavaScript code
is to help you as a developer catch bugs
in your code before it goes to the
browser or before it gets run by the
node runtime so when you do something
like this you have declared all the
types typescript compiler catches those
errors if there are any if there are
errors in the way you're assigning
values like this other four if you
assign a boolean to a number type it's
gonna catch it but this is not gonna be
useful when you're deploying the code to
run on a browser because a the browser
doesn't understand this right this is
typescript code the browser doesn't
really know what to do with our
declaration it's gonna flag this as a
syntax error
oh the second thing is you're not really
worried about that kind of type checking
on the client side or on the node.js
environment during runtime you're
interested in type checking only during
development time which is why the
typescript
features exist only during development
time when you compile types for to
JavaScript what you're gonna get is pure
JavaScript which doesn't have any of the
types of features obviously so it's not
gonna have any type declarations but
here's the thing it's not gonna have any
type checking either there's no
validation of types that happens once
you compile to JavaScript all that
happens during development time only
alright this is the first surprise the
second thing that you wouldn't expect is
this now let's say I change this to a
boolean and now this is an error right
and I run the compiler again I get an
error as you would expect but if you
look at the JavaScript file that it's
rendered it's actually compiled at to a
JavaScript file even though it
complaining about an error right so you
see here a as the value of true just
like we expected it to from the source
code and the compiled nation has
happened even though there's an error
let me prove that to you I'm gonna
delete the javascript file that was
there before right no JavaScript file
single texture file with an error I'm
gonna run the typescript compiler on it
the compiler says hey there's an error
but look at this javascript file is
rendered and it has created the
corresponding javascript file for this
error type script file but it's actually
completed the process and why is this
again this is a philosophy that the
typescript compiler follows what are you
doing here look at the typescript code
here this if you remove the declarations
this is valid JavaScript JavaScript
would be okay with you having available
with the boolean and then maybe changing
it later to a string or changing it to a
number or whatever right JavaScript is
loose on typing so if you're making a
mistake in your typescript code the
typescript compiler complains about the
mistake but it goes ahead and compile it
anyway because that would have been
valid JavaScript
anyway if typescript wasn't in the
picture so the typescript compiler
flags errors again during development
time for the purpose of developers I'm
stressing this again and again but this
is important because this is different
from the other compilers in the
traditional compiler if you're compiling
code and there's an error the
compilation stops because the intent is
to make sure that the compiled code is
error-free but with the typescript
compiler that's not the intent the
intent is to make sure that the
developers know what they're doing and
to alert the developers if there is an
error that's a huge difference in the
philosophy of the compilers and that's
what causes typescript to behave in this
way right so a couple of things to note
that we learnt at this video first when
the compiler trans files from typescript
to JavaScript it removes all the types
from specific features like you would
expect the result has to be JavaScript
only the second is that if typescript
compiler finds errors in your typescript
code it is going to whine the developer
during the compilation process but it is
going to go ahead and do the compilation
anyway if the thing that it's compiling
would have been valid JavaScript valid
JavaScript anyway so it's I'm gonna stop
you it's still gonna go ahead and
compile its warns you and then it says
okay I've done my job if you still want
to go ahead here's your JavaScript file
and that's just the way typescript has
been designed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
