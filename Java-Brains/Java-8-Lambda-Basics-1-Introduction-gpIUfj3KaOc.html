Java 8 lambda basics this course covers
an exciting addition to the Java
programming language as a version heat
which is lambdas lambdas is a new
programming construct which lets you
build Java applications in a completely
different paradigm there is a kind of
paradigm shift from the traditional
object-oriented programming that we are
used to in Java 7 this is an
introductory course which covers Java 8
lambdas this assumes no previous
knowledge of lambdas are of any of the
features in Java 8 this does assume that
you are familiar with Java programming
and you have coded using a previous
version of Java it could be Java 6 for
Java 7 you're going to be focusing only
on Java 8 in this course and
specifically about the lambda features
that were introduced in Java 8 so here
is a quick overview of what I plan to
cover in this course and what you can
hope to take away from it we're going to
start this course by really looking at
what lambdas are again like I said this
is a new paradigm so we'll spend some
time and understand what land has bring
to the table and why they're even added
to the Java spec I will then want to
using lambdas will write some sample
code which uses the land as the
Cleveland and we'll learn some of the
features of lambdas along the way a
couple of important concepts that we'll
be covering are functional interfaces
and Method references if you haven't
heard these terms before then these
wouldn't obviously make sense but these
are concepts that are associated with
lambdas we would really look at what
they are and use them in some sample
code finally we're going to be looking
at some improvements to the collection
the API is in Java 8 specifically in the
context of lambdas now the lambda has
been introduced into the language there
are ways in which the collection api's
could use it and they have actually made
changes to the API is in order to
leverage lambdas to work better with the
collections so this is something that
I'm going to just briefly touch upon at
the end of this course so this is a
whole different topic on its own you're
just going to be looking at it in the
context of lambdas and we'll be looking
at a couple of API changes that really
benefit from the addition of lambda into
the Java language so that's a lot to
cover so let's get started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
