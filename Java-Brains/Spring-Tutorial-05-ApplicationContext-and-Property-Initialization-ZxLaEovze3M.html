springs beam factory object in order to
instantiate an object of our own we did
not use the new reused spring API using
the beam factory object so in this
tutorial first of all I'd like to
introduce you to another object called
application context this application
context does mean factories Big Brother
does everything that the bean factory
does but it also has some additional
functionality it has features like even
notification AOP and other
functionalities we will have a look at
those functionalities later on but the
point here is that the application
context does all the things that the
bean factory does and more also since
there is not a huge difference in the
cost and thus far as performance is
concerned you would want to go with the
application context and you want to use
a bean factory only when the resources
are very crucial so now in this case let
me change this line of code to use the
application context but then I only need
to change this part where I'm actually
reading the configuration from spring
apart from this all the other syntax
remains the same I can also do a get
bean for the application context just
like I am doing a get bean for the bean
factory so the way I instantiate an
application context is call this context
equals now again just like the bean
factory the application context is also
an interface and you have different
implementations depending on your
configuration so there is this object
called class path XML application
context which is similar to what we are
doing here we are picking up an XML from
the actual class path of our application
so here what I'll do is I'll say new
class path XML
application context if the advantage of
using the classpath xml application
context is you don't have to you know
send new file system resource as a
parameter you can just specify a string
with the XML file name and it will pick
that up so I'll just have to pass a
string spring dot XML
now of course I'll have to import these
two classes are now insert a factory I
will use the context save and another
change we need to make is here my spring
Road XML is in the root of the
application I need to move to a class
path so let me move this to the SRC
folder here so now that it's in the
class path now let me run this make sure
that it works fine yeah it's working
fine I'm still able to instantiate the
triangle okay then we'll go back to
where we ended our previous tutorial we
said that the advantage of having a
triangle class instantiated by spring
here it doesn't really make much sense
in this case because a triangle is a
very simple object so in this tutorial
what I'm planning to do is I'm planning
to have a member variable for triangle
I'll show you how you can instantiate an
object with the member variable preset
so say for example I have a member
variable here called
type and let me check the kiddos and
setters for this
okay so now what I can do but the spring
container is when I'm instantiating an
object and I'm getting this triangle
object I can actually preset the value
of this type I can have whatever string
I need already instantiate it inside
this object that I'm getting and the way
I do that is again by using the spring
roll XML so here in our spring roll XML
you need to close this since we have
moved this guy here okay in a spring
roll XML I told you this is a blueprint
for our object that we're going to
create and this this is a very simple
blueprint I'm just given the class name
but I need to I extend this blueprint
and I need to pre-fill a value for this
new member variable that I've added here
so what I'm going to do is here I will
close the stack
okay so inside this tag I can write a
property tag property name equals so the
name of the property that I want to
preset which is type and the value that
I wanted to be prefilled as so here I'll
be mentioning the type of the triangle
just a geometry refresher there are
three types of triangles one is
equilateral one is isosceles and one is
killing so I will say this is a
equilateral triangle well close this
property so what i'm doing here is again
i'm defining what's going to be the
blueprint of my beam and i am also
having a preset value for this type
member variable so what's going to
happen is when I ask spring to get me
this triangle object here what spring is
going to do is it's going to look at
this blueprint and say it's okay this
guy wants a triangle
of this class it's going to instantiate
an object of this class and then it sees
this property tag so it's going to fill
the value which is set over here it's
going to assign it to this property and
then it's going to return me an object
that has this value set for this
property for this property so now what
I'm going to do is I'm going to just
change the draw method here and I'm
going to print out the type so I'll see
gate type okay and I'm going to save
this so if I run this now so you can see
equilateral triangle is drawn so this
value is already set inside the triangle
object so I don't have to set it no so
no matter how many properties I have I
don't have to initialize the object
every time I need an object once I can
figure it in my spring rod XML it's
going to be there and ready so our Mac
it's actually like a preset for an
object all the properties are filled in
and I can get the completely prepared
object just by running one call to the
gate beam</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
