at the typescript syntax we've learned
how to write code using typescript in
this unit we're gonna be focusing on
running typescript we did a very
bare-bones set up for typescript in the
very first unit and we haven't really
explored some of the features of
typescript and you're gonna be covering
that in this unit in order to make your
life easier when you're working on a
larger scale application you have a
bunch of files in your project you don't
want to be running a command ition every
time and checking the output and all
that stuff you wanna use some of the
features that comes out of typescript in
order to make that process easier and
that's what we're gonna be doing now we
we have this created this test file or
the test dot es and I'm gonna create a
class person like before I have a last
name and first name I save this you know
that in order to compile this you will
have to use TSE and then test 30s and
this would compile to add our J's file
for the exact same name but what you can
do is when you're compiling a file like
this you can provide certain options to
the typescript compiler in order to
customize what it does when it does
compile so let me give you a couple of
examples let's say I delete the J's file
that gets generated and now what I'm
gonna do is when I ask typescript
compiler to compile test dot es I pass
in an option called out and this lets me
specify what the output file is here
let's say I call it output script dot
Jes and now what typescript is gonna do
is it's gonna compile it do this name
right you see here now the name is not
automatically inferred from the name of
the file it's compiling it is whatever
you have provided over here alright the
next thing you can do is you can have
this compilation process be continuous
all right so the thing we were doing so
far in this course is you know you make
a code change in your 30s file you
compile it and then you make another
change you compile it again and so on
but there is a better way to do this
what you can do is I'm gonna retain the
out command out parameter but what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna have typescript
compiler watch my changes by specifying
the - - watch option so what the
typescript compiler does is it compiles
your file generates the output but then
it constantly monitors that file for
changes so if something were to change
in your dirtiest file the compliation is
going to happen all over again and it is
going to generate the output all over
again right so it's continuously
watching this so let me demonstrate that
so I'm gonna do the - - watch if you
notice here the typescript compiler says
that the compilation is complete and
it's watching for file changes now I'm
gonna open the output file in a separate
tab over here so you can see those two
here you see I have a class person and
then there is degenerated I'll put over
here the member variables are
essentially ignored in the generated
output because I'm not doing anything
with it now let's say I create something
let foo equals new person and notice
what happens when I save this file I'm
gonna hit ctrl save and the types of
compiler detects the change and see it's
automatically generated the output with
the new thing compiled alright the
changes have been compiled and the
output has been generated again and this
happens every time you hit save every
time this file gets changed you are
gonna get the output so let's say foo
dot first-name equals
test I save again and here's the output
again there are of course many more
command-line arguments and to get to
know what those are
you can type the TSC - help option and
what this does is it prints out all the
command line
means that the typescript compiler a
laughs so here you see it's a very
detailed help documentation about all
these command-line arguments and what
those commands do so I definitely
encourage you to check this out and try
out some of these if you think that'll
help you in your workflow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
