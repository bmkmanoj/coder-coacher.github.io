options to the typescript compiler but
when you're working on a large
application you don't want to be typing
in the command-line arguments every time
typescript compiler has an option of
specifying a configuration file which
contains all those arguments and then
you just run the compiler without any
arguments it just refers to that
configuration file and gets all the
information that means all right so the
way to do this is by creating a
configuration file called es config dot
JSON right it's a JSON file that you
place at the root of your project and
you can specify what configuration you
need in that JSON file and rather than
typing TSC and then the whole lot of
configuration over here
you just type TSE and hit enter and the
typescript compiler is going to look at
that JSON file and get all the
information it needs to run right in
order to create the JSON file you can of
course create it's just a simple text
file you can create it and call it TS
config dot JSON that's the name that the
typescript compiler is going to be
looking at but typescript compiler also
has an option of creating that JSON file
for you using the init fly so you
basically running the typescript
compiler with dash dash in it so this
you're not compiling anything but you're
asking the compiler to generate a sample
TS config dot JSON file by hit enter
it's gonna create this TS config dot
JSON file as you can see over here this
is a JSON file nothing special about
this but what this does is it has a
bunch of configuration that comes out of
the box it has for example this line
target has been set to es 5 module has
been set to common J's struct has been
set to true so these are some default
compiler arguments that the TSC in it
sets for you alright so now that you
have this rather than specify the
command-line arguments yourself you just
need to run tse and hit enter that's it
this is gonna look at the Stears config
dot JSON and get all the arguments from
here right so you'll notice if I do TSC
it is going to generate
test dart J's file just like do you
stood before but we don't have to give
the name of the file right it's
basically looking at all the ts files in
this folder and it's gonna generate the
corresponding GS funds here's an
interesting thing though if you notice
here there are a couple of error
messages that has been rendered if I
were to rent if I were to run the
command like we did before test that TS
the compilation happens but no error
messages are shown but if I run TS see
there are gonna be a couple of error
messages this is bickers of one of the
default configuration options that is
available in TS config dot JSON you see
here there is this thing called strict :
true this is a command-line argument
which as you can see here enables all
strict type checking options one of the
things that it does by being strict the
compiler is being strict here and what
it's saying is hey I noticed that a
couple of member variables which have an
any type implicitly that means you
haven't really specified a type for it
here you see there is last name and
first name are two member variables
which don't have a type specified like
we know from our previous videos when
typescript does not see a type it
assumes any type and anything goes right
that's not a good thing to do in a real
world application so the defaults check
that the types of compiler does based on
the ste is configure JSON is strictly
enforce that strictly enforce typing for
all the variables so what I can do is
let me get rid of this genius file here
and what I can do here is I can type
this out I'm gonna say this is a string
and this is also a string so I'm
strictly enforcing typing I have these
two types declared and now if I run TSC
it's gonna be happy no error is printed
out and dart J's file is created like we
expected right
the deus config dot jason as you can see
has a whole lot of commented lines you
see there are bunch of lines that are
commented out these are things that you
can configure it's kind of created like
a template and if any of these struck
your fancy or you find useful all you
have to do is kind of uncomment that out
and configure it the way you want
alright so let's take a couple of these
here so you see here there's this thing
called out dir right so this is the
output directory where the typescript
compiler is going to generate the output
now it's a dot slash which means that
all the GS files that are created are
going to be at the same folder as the
files the TS files so let's say you want
to create a separate folder called out
and this is where you want all your
JavaScript files to go so what you can
do is just provide that configuration
over here see if this TS config dot JSON
I'm going to delete this dart J's file
so that it does not get in the way here
and now if I were to run TSC you're just
going to generate the compiled
JavaScript file in this out folder you
see this super here that's because
you've configured other than TS config
dot J's fun there are a bunch more
options here that I really like which in
volcana
enforcing certain checks and making sure
you don't make certain mistakes right
picking things a little bit stricter
when it comes to compliation
for example strict no checks it makes
sure that you're checking for null you
also have checks like no unused locals
if you have a local variable that you're
not using it's going to report an error
and use parameters you have a function
which has a parameter that you're not
using it's going to report an error so
things like these which makes the
compliation a little bit stricter can be
a little bit of a pain sometimes but it
kind of enforces you follow certain
could mention and it makes your code
less likely to have bugs we looked at
all these things which enforce
strictness and report errors Wrentham
something goes wrong but here's the
thing about typescript compilers that
we've already looked at the compiler is
going to compile and even if it reports
an error it is going to generate the
a script file which is really weird but
that's how it's been designed right no
matter what errors it finds it's gonna
render the dodgiest file
let's see you don't want that you want
the compiler to stop and not render that
Archie s file you use this flag called
no omit on errors you see there is this
thing called no Emmet which has been
commented out if I uncomment this
typescript is not going to generate the
output file at all you see here the out
folder is empty this is just going to
report the errors and not generate the
JavaScript file but that's not what we
want we wanted to generate the
JavaScript file but we don't want it to
generate the file only if there are
headers so there is this property called
no Emmet guess it's now if I set this
flag to true
there's no emitter letter set to true
which means if there is an error the
JavaScript file will not be generated
all right so I'm gonna go here to test
es and let's say I put a non number here
which is gonna be anti better right it's
supposed to be a string that I'm passing
in a number so if I were to do TSC now
it's gonna propose an error and the file
is not rendered I will to make this back
to a string and compile it again then
the compilation succeeds and the tar J's
file is generated this is very handy you
want to make sure that you don't proceed
with the compilation if there is an
error you wanted to stop immediately so
this helps in that case and again as
with the compiler options I highly
recommend you check these all out
theaters these overlap obviously because
all these are options to the compiler
but this is I feel a better way to look
at all these configuration and learn
about it because there are really handy
descriptions for each of these
compilation options and then you can
change these and run the compiler and
play around with it which I find a
better way to learn what these options
do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
