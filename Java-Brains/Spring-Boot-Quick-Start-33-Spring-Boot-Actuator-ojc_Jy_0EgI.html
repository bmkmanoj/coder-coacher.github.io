let you monitor your Springwood
application and production or really any
environment
after you've deployed it what I'm going
to be talking about in this video is a
thing called actuator so if you go to
start that sprinkler i/o and if you
switch to the full version you see here
there are all these categories for
dependencies you have core you have web
template engine sequel no sequel a whole
lot of stuff but at the very bottom you
have this thing called ops and this has
a bunch of dependencies over here what
I'm going to be talking about is this
thing called actuator has a description
says here it consists of
production-ready features to help you
monitor and manage your application so
if you were to choose that when you're
building your Springwood application
you're going to get one other dependency
that gets added to the bomb that XML I'm
going to add that over here manually
because I don't want to create a new
project again this dependency is the
spring boots starter actuator just like
you have the spring would start our data
JP and spring boots starter web does
have a spring boot starter actuator
actuator is a group of binaries which
get added to the class path and just the
fact of them being in the class path
enables a few features so let's look at
now since I've added this me even has
had a chance to get the dependencies now
I'm going to run this project now open
postman and if I do a get for topics
with returns an empty list again because
there's no data which makes sense but
here's what this opens up I can do a get
request to this URL localhost 8080 slash
health of this is not a controller that
we wrote this is thanks to actuator if I
hit Send up here you can see that it is
a JSON file with a bunch of metrics it
sees the status is up it has a JSON
object called disk base which tells you
what's the total disk space is what's
the total is what's free and then it has
a database set
which also says the status is up and the
database is Apache Derby this is the
embedded database right so this is a new
endpoint that got added to our
application without us having to write a
controller this is thanks to us creating
this actuator dependency and adding it
in there so this actuator dependency
figures out and what are those metrics
and makes them available as a new
endpoint over here alright this is now
attached to the application itself now
whatever is your application URL
whatever you'd apply it there's also
going to be a health you are this is not
necessarily the same you could have it
be a different URL so again in order to
do that just go to your resources
application dot properties we've already
seen server dot port now what we need is
management at port and what I'm going to
do is I'm going to set it to a different
port which is 9001 you save this kill
the server and start it again and now I
should be able to access the application
itself in localhost 8080 and that should
be able to access the actuator endpoint
in localhost 9001 sorry now we see this
exposed at a different URL so this is
handy if you want to create different
rules and access rights for who gets to
access your metrics URL versus your
actual application in order to learn
more about actuator I would recommend
this guide using restful web services
with Springwood actuator which kind of
walks through what I just did but here's
another resource which is the actuator
documentation itself and here you see
the endpoint section has a bunch of
different endpoints that makes it very
easy for you to look at what's happening
so what we saw was held let's look at
beans
now here you see you get a list of all
the beans that you have in your
application so it gives you the name of
the bean the scope what's the bad what's
the type including the package name the
resource which links to the actual class
file and what dependencies it has so
this is super useful if you want to
analyze an existing Springwood
application and see what's going on so
there are a lot of really cool features
which I definitely recommend you check
out so this was actuator in a nutshell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
