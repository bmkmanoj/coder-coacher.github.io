side of things so far now let's switch
back to the client side and learn about
WS import which is the tool we use to
generate client stubs previously we did
add obvious import early in this
tutorial series where we used a free
external web service and a few Nova
still associated with it that was
available online it was just a random
choice but now we will switch to our own
web service and write a client for the
web service that we have written which
is the decimide web service you already
can look at the W import utility that
comes with the JDK when you run WS
import with the Vistal URL it creates
some handy classes which are called
stumps that hide the web service calling
complexity for you you just call a
method on this generated class and then
that class does the complete web service
call and gives you the response as a
return type
so the stubs have one method for every
web service operation so calling any web
service operation making any web service
call is literally as simple as calling a
method on that generated class there are
a few things you can do while the Bleus
importing that helps you customize how
the tool generates these stubs for you
so we'll take a look at some of those
options now to open the command prompt
and navigate to a temporary folder any
folder will do we're just using this to
generate the classes and then we'll copy
to our Eclipse workbench or we've
already seen the basic command
it's SS import options and the Vistal
the options here is optional their
configuration options which change the
weight of this import behaves but add
the very minimum you need to enter the
location of the Vistal the location
could be a web address like HTTP some
web application comm / web service
question mark crystal or it could be a
local file on the file system both would
work but I would definitely recommend
using the first approach right using an
external URL whenever
possible so make sure whenever possible
you use an external HTTP Vistal URL as
an inputted of this import rather than
using a local file URL we'll take a look
at why in the next tutorial I will copy
the visual URL for our test mat service
and run up this import
of the tool passes the whistle and
generates all the necessary types so
here it is generated two directories
containing the classes this is because
of the two package names now let's say
you save the visible file on your hard
drive and run the place import do you
think that'll work well let me save the
file here I'll save the visible file to
a local directory which is the same
directory that I'm running the blaze
important it's the same directory that
I'm already in
so I'll run the blues import product
catalog dot Vestal
notice that it still works now why am i
mentioning this the reason is that the
Vistal file the file that I've saved
locally just now is not the complete web
service definition it's only a part of
the web service definition if you
remember the vessel file refers to types
which are in a separate existing file so
I didn't save those now I just saved the
vista file but w s-- import is actually
smart enough to detect that right it
starts with your local digital file but
then if there is any references to xst
files which are in HTTP locations it
looks that up in there right it should
appear locations now let's take a look
at some import options you already seen
the directory option - d that lets you
specify the output directory where you
want the generated classes to go and
we've seen the - keep option which lets
W import to save the source files by
default the Blaz input deletes all the
dot Java files after it compiles them
but if we use the - keep it saves the
Java files also and then you have the -
s and the directory - D lets you specify
the directory where you want the class
files to be saved and - s directory
specifies where you want the source dot
Java files to be saved as you can
imagine if you use the - s option it'll
automatically turn on the keep flag
there are a couple of other obvious
options here you have - verbose which
makes it will give more detailed output
and then the - quiet
which gives little output these two do
not have any effect on the output
classes themselves they're just the
console output that gets generated when
the tool runs now let's take a look at a
couple of options that do affect the
output classes there is a - B package
name now take a look at the output
classes that it's generated by default
they're in the package hog dot character
Java brains because that's the package
that I wrote the webservice in of course
I did some overrides I specified the
package name comdata smart and all those
have gone to the calm dot test my
package basically it's the package that
the web service belongs to right so
what initially happened was when I'd
applied the web service the package was
picked up into the Vistal as namespaces
when the vessel was generated now when
I'm running a SS import that is again
automatically getting picked up as
package names by the SS import output so
it's all linked but if you need to
overwrite this during the SS import you
can change the package name of the
generated classes by using the - P
option for example if I use SS import -
B let's say our kasha generate it as the
package name right so the classes will
all be over here the two forces all the
packages to be off the specified package
name
next let's take a look at the - B
parameter now every program that
generates Java code carries with a kind
of like an implicit responsibility the
responsibility that the code that it
generates has to compile as we've seen W
is important rates Java code and it
compiles it so can the stool the SS
input to guarantee that the code it
generates will compile fine well
unfortunately doesn't provide that
guarantee we'll take a look at the code
that W simple generates later but as you
can imagine it uses a lot of names as
type names same as what is used in the
Vistal right the class names that it
generates it copies the names from the
type names in the Vistal so a nexus T
type name becomes a corresponding
generated class name now in some areas
Java is stricter when it comes to names
than xst accessory is a bit more
forgiving so when you run into cases
like that we have a problem because some
names that might be valid in xst might
not be valid on the Java side so when SS
import generates the code using those
names the result in code will be
generated the Java files will be
generated but when it tries to compile
them you get a compile error the
resultant code will not compile so like
I said the common problem is with the
type names you can have multiple schema
types that use the same name but when
they end up on the Java side when they
get converted to corresponding Java
classes if they end up being in the same
package well that's a compiler error the
compiler is going to complain so to
avoid this problem you can use what are
called as binding files so binding files
are XML files that let you specify
custom over rights to the way the code
is generated by SS import you can
override certain names you can override
certain ways in which the code is
generated I will not be going into the
details of binding files but I do
encourage you to look them up you can do
things like configuring a specific xst
type to have a specific Java class name
of your choice instead of the default
existing type name you write all these
overrides in an XML file which is the
binding file and then you supply that to
WS import with this - B option so you
see the prison board
P your binding file name and then your
Vestal file as usual and there are a lot
of customizations you can do here the -
B option we saw before lets you
customize just the package name but this
- B option lets you customize a whole
lot more and it's very handy when you
have you know troublesome vessel files
like this which leads to Java classes
wish to run compile ok so in the next
tutorial we're going to take a look at
two more options related to the WSDL
location that you should definitely know
about there is a specific problem in the
way the Java client works and will
understand what that is see you in the
next tutorial and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
