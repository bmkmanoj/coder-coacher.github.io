some of the tools you need to install on
your machine to set up your development
environment and start writing angular
applications which explore services in
this course there are essentially three
things that I want you did start you
might have some of these already
installed but I'm just going to run
through them the first installation is
no js' node.js is kind of become like
this standard thing that you have to
install before you do web development
these days a lot of the web development
utilities and tools are written using
node so that's one thing that we would
need in this course as well go to node J
star arg website and choose the download
you can choose the latest download and
install it on your machine
norge ace is essentially a JavaScript
runtime that lets us build JavaScript
applications on your machines on on the
server in this case we are not going to
be building applications using node we
will use some of the tools that help us
write angular application just so
happens that those tools are written
using node so you need the node runtime
in order to execute those tools alright
so that's the first thing you need to
install just node.js the second thing
you need to install is HTTP server HTTP
server is built using node which is
where you install node.js first now what
is HTTP server HTTP server is a command
line HTTP server utility true to its
name
what it does is it serves up static
files on a particular directory and
makes it available over HTTP now why do
we need this so think about how you
would test your angular applications
after you've built them which you've
quoted some angular application you have
your HTML files how do you test them we
can of course open those files in
Windows Explorer or finder and double
click on them and it will open the HTML
in a browser but if you do something
like that you will notice that the URL
on the address bar is going to read
something like file colon double slash
it's basically opening that in the file
protocol the problem with opening HTML
files in the file protocol is it's not
reflective of how things work when you
actually deploy HTML
on the server let's say you have done
with your angular application you
deployed on the server right so the way
to access your app from browsers would
typically be your HTTP colon double
slash and the URL to your file that
works in the HTTP more which is
different from the file mode that we may
be gonna end up with when you open the
file from your Windows Explorer find so
when you're building HTML web pages you
would like to verify that they're
working using the HTTP protocol rather
than the file protocol so HTTP server
lets you do that you go to your
directory where you have your HTML files
and then run this command HTTP server
and it is going to start a simple HTTP
server and make your file available
using the HTTP URL it's a temporary URL
that's running on localhost it's going
to not work anymore when you kill this
process but as far as development is
concerned it works just fine so this is
the second thing you would need to
install the third thing you needs to
install is something called JSON server
again note the URL over here JSON server
lets you create a simple REST API a fake
REST API so to speak which is backed by
JSON files
what does lets you do is start up a
simple REST API with very very little
effort less than 30 seconds as the
speech seems to promise why do we need
recipe is well we're going to be
building angular applications which
interact with the REST API endpoint make
get request and make post requests and
all that stuff and we don't want to
build an actual REST API in this course
because the scope of this course is
angular it's not Nord our job or
whatever else so having a fake REST API
it does work as far as your angular
learning is concerned it really doesn't
matter whether your next API is fake or
real you just need a REST API endpoint
and this gives you that so if you're not
very sure about what these things do
don't worry about to be actually going
to be using this and it's all going to
make sense then for now all you need to
do is install these three tools first go
to node J star argh click on this thing
download and install it scrub your main
installation package the installation
process is going to be different between
window
is Mac and Linux and all that so make
sure you run the installation for your
operating system
once you have done that open the command
prompt and install these two tools this
is how you install it so open your
command prompt and first make sure that
node and NPM is in stuff
so you do that by typing nord - v this
can give you the version number of node
that's installed my version is 5.1 the
webpage actually had a six version of
node so if you've downloaded that it
should your thing should read six point
something and then now that you're ready
with node you need to install two node
applications HTTP server and JSON server
the way to install the node application
is by using a tool called NBN so you say
npm install and the name of the
application HTTP - server and then you
have to specify our - g switch which
tells no to install this package
globally so that you can use this no
matter which location you are in the
command prompt so you type this and node
is going to fetch that package and
install it on your machine similarly you
need to install JSON server so it's
basically the same command but the name
of the package will change so it's NPM
install JSON server - G hit enter and
notice going to fetch that packages also
and install it globally so that you can
use it anywhere in the command prompt
okay so we have JSON server installed as
well now let's verify that these two
programs have worked so I type in HTTP -
server and you should get something that
looks like this correct so I press ctrl
C to end it and then I try to JSON
server and you should probably get some
message as well so the DES we know that
these two programs have been
successfully installed and this we are
pretty much done that the development
environment set up the two other things
that I we need that you probably already
have installed are a browser and a text
editor my recommendation for a browser
is google chrome and madman Dacian for a
text editor is Visual Studio code
although
some other text editors like atom
brackets sublime text all those should
do any text editor we can open like a
directory and see all the contents of
the directory in a tree view
double-click on a file and edit it
that's perfect that's all we need right
so I hope you have all these things
installs you see in the next tutorial
where we can start building our address
