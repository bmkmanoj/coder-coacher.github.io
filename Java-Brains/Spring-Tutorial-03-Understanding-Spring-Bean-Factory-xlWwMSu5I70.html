tutorial we'll understand what the
spring factory being is and we'll also
understand some of the concepts that are
fundamental to spring you know in the
first tutorial I told you that you know
when you talk about spring the first
thing that normally comes to mind is
dependency injection and the whole
dependency injection concept is possible
because the spring is actually a
container of beans and spring behaves as
a factory of beans now what do I mean by
a container now say you take an example
of servlet container for example Tomcat
is a servlet container what does that
mean Tomcat creates the sublet objects
which are required in order to run an
application so you would say you're
deploying an application what you would
do is you would configure all the
servlets in an XML and you would supply
the classes now what dumb cat does is it
reads the XML and then it identifies
what are the servlets that needs to be
instantiated and then it creates those
servlets so spring it's something
similar it's a container but it's not a
container of servlets it's a container
of beans so pretty much any POJO that
you have can be contained inside a
spring container so you can have a
spring container and inside this you can
have as many number of objects as you
want and then all these are managed by
the spring container managed in the
sense it handles the instantiation of
those objects it handles the whole
lifecycle of the objects and it handles
the destruction of those objects you can
of course have objects outside of the
container as well in your application
but adding the objects inside the spring
container so that spring manages the
objects gives you a whole lot of
advantages now what are the advantages
of having our objects inside the spring
container we will have a look at that in
the subsequent tutorials but the point
here is that you're learning spring and
we're implementing spring in order for
spring to manage our object lifecycle
now in order for spring to manage your
object
see I have this object here and I want
to spring to manage the lifecycle it's
obvious that spring needs to have a
handle on this object spring needs to
own this object it needs to know what
their object is and where it is the way
it works is the creation of the object
is actually done by spring now you say I
have an object here that's dependent on
this object okay normally if you're not
using spring what you would do is you
would say let's call this object a and
let's call this object B okay inside the
code of object here you would say object
B equals new object B so I am creating a
new object inside this object now if I
do that the new object that gets created
is not handled by the spring container
because that's something that you are
creating here spring doesn't know that
that object exists so the way the
objects are created by the spring
container is instead of creating I want
a new object instead of writing the code
that says new object what you would do
is you would write code to ask the
spring container to instantiate this
object and then pass it to this object
so this is something called as a factory
pattern so let's have a quick look at
what factory pattern means now again I
have the object here instead of creating
a new object B what I do is I make a
call to another object which is a
factory object now I have this object
factory which is again another Java
object but what this does is the whole
job of this object factory is to create
new objects and then hand it over to the
object it's analogous to an actual
factory the whole purpose of this is to
produce objects so now how does the
object factory produce objects what it
does is it reads from a configuration it
reads it as probably has a configuration
file somewhere or some data metadata
which has details about all the objects
that it needs to create it's a blueprint
for all the objects that this object
Factory has to create so what this
object Factory does is it reads from
this blueprint and then this object will
tell hey I need an object of
such-and-such a specification the object
factory finds out what is the blueprint
for that particular object
specification and then now the object
factory knows what object needs to be
created so it's going to create this new
object and then it's going to hand it
back to the requesting object so now
this object has object that it wants but
then it's not actually doing a new by
itself it's referring to the object
Factory and then the object factory
creates this new object by reading from
a configuration and then hands it back
so this is something that spring does we
can use the spring library in order to
do this functionality so how it would
work in spring this spring has a bean
factory it has an object called a bean
factory you can use the spring bean
factory in order to let spring create
new objects for us so I will have an
object here instead of calling a new I
would call I would reference the bean
factory the bean factory would read from
a spring XML will have to supply the XML
file which contains all our bean
definitions the bean definitions are the
blueprints here the bean factory creates
a bean from this blueprint and then it
makes a new spring bean and then this
spring bean is handed over back to the
object the advantage here is that since
this new bean has been created in the
bean factory spring knows about it
spring has a handle to this bean and
then it manages the entire lifecycle of
that bean so in this case spring acts as
a container for this newly created
spring bean so this is a high-level
overview of how you can use a spring
bean factory in order to create beans so
now we will actually code the whole
stuff here so we'll have a main method
here which calls the spring bean factory
okay and then we'll have to provide a
spring XML as well so we will define our
beam the beam that needs to be created
and we will define it in our spring XML
and then we'll talk to the bean factory
and say hey bean factory get me that
bean and now the bean factory is going
to read this XML and give us the beam so
there's not really dependency injection
yet we are still using the basic factory
functionality of this
bring framework and they're getting a
beam out of it we had not started doing
dependency injection but this is the
first step</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
