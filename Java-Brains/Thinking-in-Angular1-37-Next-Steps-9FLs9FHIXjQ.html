thinking in angular I really hope we
have achieved the objective which is to
get you to think in this unique
different way when it comes to building
angular applications we have applied
this concept and a lot of different
exercises as well as looked at what I
needed provides for us the idea of
creating a model and modifying the model
and wiring it to the views or the view
automatically updates is a fundamental
way of thinking for you to be building
angular applications now that we are at
the end of this course I should let you
know that we have just scratched the
surface of angular angular 1 is a fairly
complex framework it's fairly vast is
what I would say there are a lot of
concepts not it's not deep in terms of
complexity but it has a lot of breadth
to it so there are a lot of different
concepts that you'll have to learn so
here are some of the next steps angular
has something called services which let
you create reusable code components that
can be used in multiple different places
so it's important for you to understand
what services are how to create services
and how to use some of the existing
services one of the most popular
services that you'll be using is $1 HTTP
service which lets you make REST API
calls the to-do app that we built in
this course is really a browser only app
write the billy-oh to do applications
and you click the refresh button install
got it's all in memory what you'd
ideally like to do is versus this lino
server somewhere in order to get data
from a server or to send data to the
server you'll have to work with the REST
API calls in angular in order to do that
you definitely need the dollar HTTP
service that service lets you make HTTP
calls and in order to understand how to
use HTTP service you also need to
understand what promises are so these
are the three concepts which kind of go
together so this is dollar HTTP and
promises so this is very very important
I definitely encourage you to learn more
about this next thing you have to learn
is creating directives and components I
started talking about angular in this
course and I mentioned how angular has
the model of declarative programming
rather than imperative programming you
don't write the steps you need to be
executed what you actually do is build
these component
we've been using some of the components
that angular provides but we haven't
created a component in this course that
is again vital for you to be taking full
advantage of the angular power you need
to be able to create new components and
use them in multiple places and in order
to create components you'll need to
learn what components and directives are
and how to create them next I'd
encourage you to look at unit testing
angular is very very flexible when it
comes to unit texting compared to some
other frameworks angular separates the
code from the view so when you're
writing code you don't really have
dependency on the view you look at your
angular code that you've written so far
there's really nothing in that code that
tells you what the view is that's going
to be using it the view hooks into the
model but the model and the controller
doesn't really depend on the view which
makes testing super-easy
testing an angular is another important
concept for you to learn you use
frameworks like Jasmine and protractor
in order to test Jasmine for unit
testing and protractor for integration
testing is again another important
concept for you to learn when you're
learning angular so these are some
starting points to further your journey
of learning angular I'll try to make
courses for these topics and once the
course is ready I'm going to link it to
this I cannot promise that I'm going to
make courses for all of these but I will
definitely try so if you really really
need any of these courses on Java brain
send me a message and let me know which
one in F n of people request it I'm
going to prioritize that and try to make
a course sooner so with this we conclude
the course thinking in angular I hope
this was helpful good luck and have fun
