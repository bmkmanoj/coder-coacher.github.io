previous tutorial we saw that hibernate
provides an implementation of cache by
default when we using the session object
and if you inside a single session you
get the same object twice it does not
result in two separate queries whereas
if you open a new session and then get
the same object in the newer session
then it's going to fetch data from the
database and screen returned in a query
so this is a first level optimization
that hibernate this as long as you are
in a single session you don't have to
worry about making multiple queries to
the same object it's not going to result
in queries if you do a session yet every
time we also looked at another way in
which we can configure the cache which
is the second level cache so apart from
this default implementation of cache in
the session object hibernate also gives
us the option of configuring a second
level of cache and this cache is going
to be you know it can be used across
different sessions so in that case when
we use the second level cache the
scenario that we you know we wrote in
our earlier tutorial the opening of a
session getting an object closing a
session then opening another session and
getting the same object now what should
happen is once we have the second level
cache this should not result in a query
to the database what should happen is
when it tries to see ok it's not there
in the session because it's a new
session then what it should ideally do
is it should go look up at the second
level cache and in the second level
cache the object will be there and it's
going to pull up from that cache so
let's say we run this now we have to
selects so you know once we configure
the second level cache ideally what
should happen is they should still be
only one select even though we are doing
the session dot get in a different
session okay so in order to configure
the second level cache there are a few
configuration changes we need to do the
first thing we need to do is open up the
hibernate dot CFG role XML this is the
configuration XML for a hibernate note
that there is this element over here
which is called
cache dot provider class and then it has
been said to
I've got hibernated cash start no cash
provider and the common C is disabled
the second level cache so that's what's
happening right now
we have disabled the second level cache
and there is no second level cache
happening so this is the default
configuration that we have imported what
we can do is we can change this
configuration in order to implement the
second level cache now what would be the
value over here so this value would be
the class off the cache implementer or
the cache provider now in order to find
out what the name of the class is we
need to look at the classes that are
available in our dot hibernate dot cache
package so let's have a look at that now
if you open up the hibernate char see
here this is this package org dot
hibernate cache if we expand this you
see that there are a few classes over
here and one of the classes we have here
is the no cache provider dot class and
this is what them you know this is what
we have configured here which means that
there is actually no cache in place so
what we can do is we can change it to
some of the you know providers that
hibernate comes up with with default one
of them is this eh cache and one of them
is the OS cache for this tutorial I'll
be using the eh cache implementation so
we will follow along with the steps
needed to configure eh cache but then
you can configure any of the other
caches also there are some cache that
come by default you can get more details
about that in the hibernate
documentation so in order to configure
eh cache as our cache provider so what I
need to do is I need to provide the name
of the cache provider class this is not
the actual class name each of these
caches come with a provider class along
with its zeh cache has a eh cache
provider and OS cache has a OS cache
provider and so on
so we will use the providers name over
here so I will specify the name of the
sketch provider over here
so I will change this from a no cash
provider to a eh - provider okay so now
we have set what is the cash provider
but what we also need to do is we need
to tell hibernate to explicitly switch
on the second level cache because by
default it's switched off so for that I
add another property name equals the
property is cash dot use second level
cache and I'll set it to true so what
we're doing here is first we are
enabling the second level cache
whittling type in it that we want to use
the second level cache the second thing
we are doing is we are providing the
class name of the implementer of that
second level cache which is the eh cache
provider now that we're using eh cache
provided what we need to do is okay
first let me change this comment here
because that's no longer valid okay now
this is our second level cache
configuration I'll save this now in
order to use the second level cache that
we have mentioned over here what I will
do is I will go to the eh cache site and
I'll download the each cache jar so that
I have the latest jailable in my class
path so I've actually gone ahead and
done just that I have the eh cache
downloaded over here it's available at
eh cached org so now what I will do is I
will add this to the class path so I
have my hibernate library over here so
I'll go to properties use the libraries
so in this hibernate library what I lose
and say I'd jar and I have this eh cache
folder over here which have downloaded
inside this eh cache folder there is a
lib folder so I will use this eh cache
core dart jar so this might be different
depending on the version that you are
downloaded but they are it's better to
take the latest version
I include this and press okay so now my
hibernate library has the H cache and it
can provide the caching service
so what hibernate will do is now that we
have the cache provider that hibernate
has included inside it by default
hibernate will use the CH cash jar that
I have added to the library and it will
use that jar to provide the caching
services okay so now that we have
configured the you know the
configuration file in hibernate
the second step that we need to do is to
actually configure the entities that we
want to be cached not all the entities
by default are cached unless we mention
an entity as cacheable it does not get
cached so since we're using the user
details here I will make the changes
over here so just below the entity I
will write an annotation that tells
hibernate that this entity is actually
cashable so the way I do that is by
using the annotation at cashable so this
this annotation tells hibernate that
this is a cacheable entity and this has
to be considered for caching now the
second thing that I can do here is I can
also mention what is the configuration
for the scash this is also called as the
caching strategy so what I'll do is I
will write another annotation in wish I
can configure the caching strategy so I
use the annotation called cache and this
is actually if you import it so all to
hibernate annotation so it's a hibernate
specific annotation so this cache
annotation takes in a parameter called
usage now I will say usage equals now
there is a like with all other
configuration or annotations even this
can be supplied values by using an
enumeration and the enumeration here is
called cache concurrency strategy
okay now this cash concurrency strategy
has a few values we have read-only
read/write non-strict read/write and
transactional so what these values do is
they tell hibernate how they how you
want the cash to be configured as now
read-only is the basic level of caching
what it does is it assumes that the data
that you have is read-only data any
application is only going to read data
it's not going to write any data to the
database and this is for this entity of
course
so for user details if we specify
read-only then hibernate is going to
assume that the data that you have for
user details there is only something
that you fetch from the database in your
application the application does not
write any user details data back to the
database so this is the simplest of the
cache is what hibernate does is it just
pulls up all the data once once you have
the data in the cache it's not going to
worry about whether the application
modified it or not whether it has to you
know clean the cache update the cache
all those things are not going to be
checked it's going to assume that it's a
read-only data and so once the data is
there in the cache hibernate is not
going to worry about it it's going to
just supply value to the application
from the cache itself the next thing is
readwrite this is where you're telling
happening that no I don't have read-only
data I have readwrite data the
application might write data back to the
database for this entity and now what
hibernate does is it keeps track of what
updates have happened and if there is an
updated updates the cache accordingly so
all these optimizations are done by
hibernate there's also a non strict
readwrite where it doesn't really
strictly me know how enforce this kind
of a check so there is a chance that you
might read something from the cache that
was updated somewhere else but rewriters
is pretty strict and make sure that you
don't you know read any dirty data that
was updated in another part of the
application or in another application
that's using the same cash transaction
is the strictest of all it makes sure
that cache is on a transaction
transaction basis actually good to go
for a read right because in that in the
case of transactional you're not
achieving a significant benefit when it
comes to a having a second level cache
so in this example what I'll do is I'll
do a read only option because I'm not
writing any data back to the database
I'm just pulling up the user details
twice so I'm just going to go with
read-only and press save so these are
the two configuration annotations that
we use for entities one is I'm making
the entity as cacheable and the second
thing is I'm using add cash annotation
of hibernate to mention what is the
caching strategy that I need for this
entity so of course it goes without
saying different entities can be
configured in different ways we can make
an entity cashable or not and of course
once you make the entity catchable you
can configure how exactly the caching is
happening okay so now that we have set
the su files well now we are ready to
run this again so now you know this is a
result of our previous run it ended up
in two selects the same code I will run
again and let's see how many selects it
comes up with okay there you go
it's just run one select and the reason
for that is after the first select what
has what happened it has done is it has
added this user detail object of primary
key one it's added this object into our
second level cache which is the eh cache
implementation and now that we close the
section the object is still in the
second level cache and now when I open a
new session and I'm asking I believe to
get the same object instead of directly
going to the database first it checks
this again they will cache and sees the
object is already there now that it
finds the object the second select is
not that it pulls it up from the second
level cache and it assigns to the user
and that's a reason why we do not see
the second select statement here so this
is this is a high-level overview of how
you can use cache in order to minimize
the you know the number of round trips
to the database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
