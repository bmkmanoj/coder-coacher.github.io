certain scenarios where the dot notation
doesn't work one scenario is where the
property name is a reserved word or some
kind of an invalid identifier let's say
I define a property over here with the
name one this turns out is not a valid
variable name a variable name typically
starts with a letter and then you can
have numbers which follow it you cannot
have a variable with the name 1 now
let's say I have a have a property on
the object called 1 and then I have a
value which is just a string doesn't
matter what it is now do you think I can
do a my obj dot 1 so let's say I do a
console dot log of this I'm going to do
a preload and run we see here I get a
syntax error
what's this tack sir I'm not really
doing any syntax error I'm still using
the dot notation it's the object dot
property name turns out when you have
available when you have a property name
which starts with a number that is an
invalid identifier you cannot have
property names that start with number
and then use the dot notation to access
it that's not going to work so the only
way you can access it is by using a
square bracket notation so let's say
you're given an object which has this
property name don't use this property
name by the way it's not really a good
idea to have a property name with the
number as the name but let's say
somebody gave you this object and it has
this now how would you access it the dot
operator does not work so the only way
you can access it is by using the square
bracket notation so let's say I use the
same thing in a square bracket notation
and I reload and run and see here it
works now I'm able to access the value
so there are certain cases where the
name of the property is invalid it's an
invalid identifier in those cases you
have to use the square bracket notation
but again try not to do this try not to
have objects try not to create objects
and put properties in there which are
invalid identifiers it can get confusing
the third case is when the property name
is dynamic okay know what do I mean by
this okay so let's say I have these me
remove this stuff you'll need this and
remove the comma at the end now I have
prop prop 1 and prop 3 now let's say I
have I know already what property I want
whether I want proper proper nor prop 2
or prop 3 I can access my obj dot and
then type in the name by Lam coding but
now let's say I need to pull up a
property based on some external factor
maybe a user input or something I when
I'm writing the code I have no idea what
the property is going to be that I need
so in that case I really cannot do this
right now let's say I get the property
name in a string so let's say I have a
bar property name equals prop 1 now
somebody gives me this variable which is
property name it has a value and I
somehow have to get the property with
the name which is the value in that
string and I pull that out of the object
now how do I do that
one way to do this is by using a square
bracket notation so I can pass in the
property name into the square bracket
notation like I can show you now console
don't log my obj and I cannot do a dot
property name because there is no
property called property name what I
want is the value of property name so I
can use square bracket here rather than
pass in an inline string let me see
property name so now what's going to
happen is whatever is the value of this
variable property name
hopefully it's a string so whatever is
the value of that it gets that string
and then checks if there is a property
in my object with that name okay if it
finds it then it's going to pull that up
so it's more dynamic let me reload and
run there you can see the value 1 2 3
sprinted so I don't have to know what
the value in this line I don't have to
know what the value of property name is
if it happens to be a property it's
going to get that property and if it
doesn't happen to be a property in the
object at the time it's going to return
undefined so it makes it all the more
dynamic so that would be another reason
why you use the square bracket notation
the thing to remember though is when you
have a square bracket notation it
reduces the opportunities for the engine
to optimize when you have the dot
notation the engine knows upfront what
the code is going to do it knows what
variable you know what property of the
object you are referring to so it could
do some optimizations but when you're
using the square bracket notation it has
no idea the property that it needs to
pull up when you use the square bracket
notation is the value that that string
happens to have at that point of time so
there may not be opportunities for the
JavaScript engine to optimize so there
is a chance that a dot notation is
faster to access that a square bracket
notation that is a trivial trade-off in
my opinion because there are some cases
where you have to use the square bracket
notation but the whole point I'm putting
this you know note here is that if you
can get away with the dot notation use
the dot notation when you have some
constraint like this that I've covered
over here you have to use a square
bracket notation that's where you use
the square bracket notation
dart in square bracket notations can be
interchanged and you can have one
following the other I'm going to talk
about that when you have nested objects
so let me actually demonstrate that
