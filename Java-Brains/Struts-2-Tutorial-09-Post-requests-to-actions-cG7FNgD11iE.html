in the previous tutorial we used a query
parameter to pass in a value to the
action class and we used this query
parameter and add you and we created a
property for the action and we learned
that there are interceptors that
actually get that value and populate
this property of the action which is
there in the value stack so that we have
it available and we don't have to worry
about getting the property it's
automatically copied and made ready for
us so this is one of the ways in which
we can pass values to a HTTP request
this is the gate there is another way we
can do it which is the post so will try
take a look at how we can do the same
thing with post and we're going to look
at another approach which is actually
preferred when you are working with
starts to applications okay so here is a
get request we have a query parameter
which is obviously a get and we have
learned that the Interceptor is going to
take this value and populate the
corresponding property in the action
class but what's going to happen if we
do a post request does the Interceptor
check for that as well how do we have to
do something else let's try that out so
I'm going to create a new JSP I'll
create a new JSP file and then I'll call
this search form dot JSP and finish so
this is going to be our search page
which will have a text box instead of
having a query parameter I'm going to
have a text box and then a submit button
and the user can enter the language that
they want to search tutorials for and
then hit submit
so this will be a new form here and have
some HTML over here for the language and
the submit so
farm I'm going to make method as post so
that it's not the default get and the
action okay now here's the thing the
action could be the URL of the action
that we have which is this one tutorials
and get tutorial directions let me just
copy this and see how it works all right
so I have farm which is doing a post to
the action which we are interested in of
course we here we try to do a get but
now we are trying to do the post for the
same action so I enter the same URL over
here for the action and then I have one
input text which has the language as the
name and then we have the submit button
okay now let's save and run this we'll
see what's going to happen so I will
change this to a search form JSP okay
for some reason the text box is showing
up as black here so let me just open
this in a browser okay so I'm going to
enter this in a browser and okay so here
we have a text box and a submit button
so if I enter job over here and press
submit it's going to go to Java brains
and if it's anything else it's going to
say language not supported it so as you
can see the value is going in right so
the Java value is being picked up
properly it is actually populating the
action class the member variable of the
action class with the right value so
irrespective of whether it is a get or a
post the Interceptor is going to
intelligently detect that the parameter
that's being passed has the same value
as the member variable over here and
it's going to populate it
so this is one advantage you don't have
to worry about a get request or a post
request as long as the parameter matches
the member variable off the action class
you're all set
it's going to automatically copy the
value by default okay so having said
that take a look at this search form
this form here is pure head stable so
you have a form tag and that has a
method and an action you have two inputs
one for a textbox and one for a button
and then we are closing the form tag so
this this form is pure HTML and this
works we've just tried this out and we
know that it works as long as it's
supposed to cuesta doesn't really matter
where that request is coming from it
could be your HTML page that triggers
the request but the thing is stretch to
provides some tags that you can use for
generating this content and as long as
you're using a stretch to application
anyway unless there's a very good reason
you should try to implement the stretch
to tags because one they make it a bit
easier and then secondly they have some
extra features that do come in handy so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
take this out and I'll replace this with
a stretch to form so they are stretch
two tags that are equivalent to the tags
that you see over here so there is a
stretch to tag equivalent to the form
there is a stretch to tag that's
equivalent to a text box input over here
and then there is an equivalent stretch
to tag for a submit so we'll replace
that and we'll see that that works as
well and it actually is simpler to link
two actions if you're using it starts to
tag so let's let's try that out now so
the first thing that I need to do in
order to use starts two tags is of
course to add the tag loop so I'll add
that first I have that copy paste with
I'll just pasted here so I'm declaring a
tag lip with the prefix of s and this is
for the starts tags
so now that I've declared this target I
can do a s : and then Eclipse is going
to give me a list of suggestions so
- s : and then there is a s : form so
I'll use this the esculent form has only
one attribute that it requires that will
control space so that it gives the list
of possible attributes and now here I
will choose the action so this is what
is required
you notice what it says here it says set
the action name to submit - without the
dot action suffix so this is one of the
advantages you don't have to type in a
dart action suffix because this is a
stretch form after all so it knows your
struts configuration so all I need to do
is choose this action and then I'll take
this it has to have the name space as
well so a lad name space but I do not
use the dot
action it's because it's really
redundant we don't have to do it because
stretch already knows what your
extension is it will intelligently
figure it out so this is all I need to
do as a definition of my stretch form so
I'm just specifying the action without
the dot action okay so now the form is
done now I need to add the text box so
the equivalent for the text box is s :
text field so this text field generates
a text box and it there's one other
interesting trick over here so let me
just type this out and I'll show you
this text field requires something
called as a key the key is the property
that you want to assign this value to so
in your action whatever property you
want the value to get populated to that
property is going to be your key so you
have to put the name of the member
variable in your action that you want
this value to get populated to so we'll
leave it at that and I'll just come back
to this once I show you the HTML that I
was talking
okay so text field is done this line
alone generates a text box and it also
knows that this is the value that it
needs to populate to and now I need to
add the submit button so the submit is s
:
submit they go and this is it so this is
if you compare you can obviously see
that this is a much simpler version of
the form when you compare it to this
HTML form and since we are using starts
anyway it's always a good thing to have
this the only reason I would not want to
use this is if you are not allowed to
use stretch two tags for some reason are
you want this page to be HTML in which
case HTML form is ideal but as long as
you're using JSP s and you are using
starts two tags it's always better to
use a starts form okay so let me remove
this set of HTML tags so now we know
that our JSP has only starts tags for
generating the form so I'll save this
and let's try accessing this page again
okay so I'll place this URL and you
notice here right away
there is one difference there is a label
and then there is a colon and then you
have the text box so it was a plain text
box earlier now you actually have label
and the label happens to be the key that
you have entered in your starts tag so
we'll take a look at what the history ml
is but let's just make sure that this
continues to work fine for ad linter
Java and hit submit
okay it comes to Java brains so this is
working fine so the language property is
getting populated with the textbox value
that I've entered here but okay now
let's take a look at this label and in
fact let's do a view source so you see
here it's actually generating the HTML
form obviously because it has to go get
rendered in the browser
so the ideas get tutorial names get
tutorial and the action is tutorials
slash get tutorial it is doing a post by
default and you notice here so this is
where it's actually generating the text
box so it's generated a label over here
and it has generated the text box as
usual with the input type equals text
and images language so there are a few
other things it's generating an idea
here but we don't really worry about
that at this point of time and of course
there is input type equals submit which
is required for the supplement so
essentially what it's doing it is almost
the same HTML that we had typed a little
few extra additions but for as far as
the functionality is concerned it is the
same HTML but it is doing all these
things behind the scenes it has created
a label for us and it has created a text
box along with the submit button so now
this is not really an ID label you know
in a real world application you wouldn't
want to actually display the name of the
property of your action you might have
something else and you want to display
something else to the user so in that
case what we can do is in our text field
tag you have something called as a label
property so I can add any label I want
here enter the language you to search
for okay so I'm not going to add the
code in here it's just going to be the
text save and let me reload the page so
there you go it has entered it has
displayed the entire label along with
the additional colon and you can also
see that the form has been aligned
properly so the textbox is moved the
submit button has moved so it all looks
good you don't have to worry about
alignment starts to tags takes care of
all that and it also gives you the label
that you want so you don't actually
display the property name over here
so this is let's do a view source again
so this is actual HTML like we saw and
there are some things that it does in
order to track internally it's actually
creating a table in order to do all this
alignment and it has this named action
underscore property name that it is used
in a couple of places over here so you
see here the ID of the textbox is action
and the score property name so and even
here it is the action underscore 0 so
you don't have to worry about all this
know that it's generating HTML for you
and it does all these other additional
things which justifies using starts tags
before I wind up there's one thing that
I want to point your attention to and I
don't know if you already notice you
notice the action over here the action
is tutorials slash get tutorial there is
no dot action over here and you must be
wondering why we will cover this in a
little bit more detail in a subsequent
tutorial but what's interesting to know
is let me take you back to eclipse ok so
you see here let's open this gate
tutorial or action so this is the URL
that we'd used earlier we are directly
calling the action URL and as we are
passing a get parameter correct
so notice what happens if I remove the
start action removing this and I'm just
using get tutorial I don't have a dart
action suffix it still works it's still
showing Java brains so this is something
we'll cover in a subsequent tutorial but
I just wanted to point that out and you
know if you're curious you can explore
and see why this is happening thanks for
watching and see you in the next
