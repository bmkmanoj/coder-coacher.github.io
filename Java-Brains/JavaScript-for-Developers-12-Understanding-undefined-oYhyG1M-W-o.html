right even though there are some new
answers they're familiar these are types
that you would see in other programming
languages the next type that I'm going
to talk about is kind of unique to
JavaScript and till you get what it is
can look a bit weird and the type is
called undefined so in order to explain
what undefined is I need to explain to
you what the difference between
declaration and definition is and these
are terms which are not specific to
JavaScript you will find these terms in
other programming languages as well so
what is the declaration and what is
definition declaration is when you ask
the compiler or the interpreter to
create a new variable and then give it a
name okay so you have different ways of
declaring in different types of
languages but the idea is you declare
when you want to create a new variable
you create a new variable a placeholder
and then you give it a name so it can be
something like an int foo or a VAR value
in the case of JavaScript definition is
when you assign a value to that variable
okay for something like this value
equals 42 so the first line is when I'm
declaring the variable I'm just giving
it a name the second line over here is
when I'm assigning a value that's when
it is defined and that's the definition
line you can also do these two together
like we've seen before you can say a bar
value equals 42 so that's one line which
does both declaration and definition all
right now if we have two lines like this
we have one line where you declare in
one line when you define write what's
the value of the variable going to be
between these two lines between
declaration and definition these again
depend on the language different
languages have different ways of
handling the space between when the
variable is declared and the variable is
defined in the case of JavaScript
however as soon as a variable is
declared the minute you say of our A or
AB our value of our foo there is an
plus it value and assign to that
variable okay even though you're not
assigning the value yourself there is a
value being assigned to it and that
value is undefined okay it's basically
JavaScript's way of saying here you've
declared it but you haven't defined that
so the variable is at this point of time
undefined okay now what is the value
undefined which type is the value
undefined belong to so javascript has
created a separate type called an define
which contains just one value which is
undefined I know this can be a bit
confusing but stick with me here in the
case of a boolean think of the boolean
type how many values are possible in a
boolean type you have true and yet false
right so there can be two possible
values in a boolean type in the case of
the undefined type there's actually one
value possible which is undefined so the
whole type system has only one value so
the value is undefined and whenever you
have a war something right there is no
type information to it I told you
javascript is a loosely typed so it
doesn't have type information that it's
a number or a string or whatever what it
does have is the assignment of the type
undefined so you can be sure that if a
variable is declared you haven't
assigned the value to it it is going to
contain one value which is undefined
which is of the type undefined okay I
hope that makes sense it's it undefined
as a type which contains just one value
so at this point value is undefined but
then when you assign value to it then it
becomes that value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
