we need to be able to send links to
resources in the response if you
remember the tutorial in unit 1 that's
what haters is all about right we want
to be able to make the response
navigable for example if you get a list
of messages each message in that list
would probably have a link to the
message itself right you get the
resource URL for the message in the
response of the message you could also
have resource URL for the comments of
the message in the response of the
message so once the user gets hold of a
response they know all the things that
they could do right so they could go to
different resources they could go to
like for example the author who posted
the message or a whole lot of stuff like
that and it's all there in the response
that's what we want to do I'm not going
to go into the details of having each
and every URL in each and every response
that's going to take a lot of time but
I'm going to show you how to include
these resource links in your responses
so if you look at the message resource
that's returned in the response it
contains all the properties of the
message itself but the objective nam is
to add links that provide the client
information apart where to find other
related resources so one link could be
linked to itself which is the self rel
attribute there is another link for
example the profile right so there could
be a link to the profile URI resource
URI for the author of this message it
also be a link for the comments for this
message the likes and the shares for
this message and all that so these are
additional links that we would like to
send in the response right now we don't
have any links we want to add to it so
the links could be something like this
right so let's let's set this as a goal
for this tutorial you want to be able to
send these links in the response now how
do we do this the obvious way is to
enhance the model that gets converted to
JSON so let me switch back to the model
in Eclipse so this is what's getting
converted to JSON right so this is
what's the resulting in the JSON
response that we just saw
so what we need now is a list of links
to be added to this so what I could do
is create a new class a new model call
link and then have a list of those links
in the message instance so I can create
a new class call link and all that this
class needs is the URL which is the link
and then the rel attribute which is what
this relation is if you remember unit 1
the relation could be something like SEF
for the link to itself or it could be
profiles commons or whatever and then I
have getters and setters for each of
them I don't need to annotate XML root
element because this is not going to be
a root element it's going to be a member
attribute of the message class okay so
this is a very simple straightforward
class which is going to store the link
information that we need to send back
now in my message class I could have
this list of links which I'm going to
import list an ArrayList and of course
I'm going to have getters and setters
for the link okay so now what I need to
do is in my resource class then I'm
getting the message I'm going to look at
getting the single message now this is
the similar implementation for getting a
list of messages as well then I'm
preparing this message instance what I
can do is I can set the links for
whatever resources I want right I create
new instances off the link class and
then added to this ArrayList once I do
this it's going to show up in the
response over here so now that this is
set up now comes the actual challenge
how do you figure out what these links
are you need to go to the message
resource over here I'm going to take
this into a local variable called
message and now I need to set I need to
add these different links based on the
resource you are
I want to provide now how do I figure
out what those links are let's start
with the link to self
what's a stander didn't hate us every
resource is going to have a link to
itself it's not very important for this
API because they need to know the link
to the to the actual resource to be able
to access this in the first place but
let's say you're you're making a call to
get messages and you're getting a list
of messages so for every message
resource it helps to have a link to that
resource so that the client can get more
details off that particular resource so
I'm not going to touch this API I'm just
going to modify get message so the first
link that I'm going to add is a link to
the resource itself so if I switch back
to the end goal of this tutorial you see
this self attribute so this is the self
link that we're going to focus on first
in order to be able to add these links
I'm going to create a convenience method
in the message resource which is called
add link so what this does is it takes
in two arguments one is the URL and one
is a rel attribute and it creates a new
instance of link sets those two
attributes and then adds it to the list
of links so it makes it easy to add
multiple links so I'm going to use this
then I add links here so what I want to
do here is I'm going to do a message dot
add link I need to get the URL for the
link to itself and I'm going to call
this self right now the challenges in
finding this URL how do I get this the
way to get the URL to itself should be
pretty straightforward we've already
done this the way we do this is we use
the context we use a class called URI
info and we expect jax-rs to send us an
object called URI info which gives
information about the URI we've already
done this for the create header we're
going to do something similar and create
a new argument called URI info and
annotate it to that context so that I
have this ready
now I can get the current URL from URI
info so we already seen that URI info
gives us a handle to the URI builder and
URI builder has several methods that let
us build the URI one of them being the
path method which lets you specify any
arbitrary string that you want to add to
the path right we want a SPAD dot path
off bra it's going to do a slash blah
slash in the URI that it's going to
build right what if you're going to use
is another overloaded path method which
actually accepts the resource class as
an argument right so you can do a dot
path and passing as argument any
resource class what this is going to do
is it's going to find the path
annotation do this resource which is
annotated at the class level and it's
going to add that to the URI that it's
building for example if I do a dot path
of message resource class it's going to
find the ad path annotation for message
resources or class which is annotated at
the class level value slash messages so
it's going to add slash messages to the
path if I do a dot path of profile
resource or class it's going to add
slash profiles so this is very very
handy when you're implementing haters it
lets us find URIs for different
resources easily without having to hard
code the URI and that's what we're going
to use okay so let's use this to build
the API now I get the URI in for
instance and then I do a URI info that
get base URI builder to get a URI
builder with the base path and I add a
path segment - message resource class
it's going to give me the path that the
message resource is mapped to add the
class level and then I append to it a
path segment which is the ID of the new
message and then I do a dot build and
the start build is going to give me a
URI but what I need is a string so I'm
going to do a dot two string right and
I'm going to assign this to a new local
variable called URI and that's what
I send over here now this URI is going
to be a string which contains the
complete URI to the get message API now
I add this to the message to add link so
it's going to create a new link instance
and assign it to the list of links in
the message and now I can return the
message all right now let's test this
and see if it works okay I'm going to
make a get request to messages slash one
and there you go looks like it's worked
so there is a links attribute which has
a value as a list because it's an
ArrayList in Java and then each element
of that list is the link model that
we've created it contains one attribute
called the link which is the dynamically
constructed URL that we just did and
then the rel is self so this is a
hitter's link which contains a link to
itself okay so I'm going to switch back
to eclipse and what I'm going to do is
I'm going to take this out and refactor
it as a separate method right I'm gonna
extract method and I'm going to call
this get URI for self so that that logic
goes into a separate method in this this
method is a bit cleaner
okay and what I want to do next is
create a link for the profile
