other objects that come out to the box
which are pretty useful they're pretty
handy I have links to the Mozilla
developer Network page for these for
these objects quickly click on it and so
the first object that I'm going to talk
about is the matte object this is pretty
handy this is useful for doing
mathematical calculations using
javascript it starts out with a bunch of
constants there is the e constant there
are a lot 10 and log2 constants but what
are usually useful are the methods on
this object so you can in order to do
absolute you can just do math dot abs
and pass in a value and it's going to do
an absolute value of it so you have the
you know all these mathematical methods
I'm obviously not going to cover all of
these so I encourage you to look up the
documentation for it if you happen to be
doing a lot of mathematical calculations
math is as essential objects to use you
can you can look this up the other
object that is again essential as the
data object when you're dealing with
date and time you want to know what the
current time is with current data you
can look up the date object and this is
again an inbuilt object you can use the
new date operator in order to create the
new date I haven't covered the new
operator yet in this course I will be
creating another course talking about
how to create new objects and what the
new operator actually means but if you
just need a date just just use this you
don't need to know what the new is in
order to use a date but then I
definitely encourage you to look this up
there are a few properties on the date
operator
so there's value which provides the
integer value from the UNIX epoch which
is Jan 1st 1970 a lot of systems use
this in order to figure out what the
data to the precise millisecond there is
a date string which gives you
String there's a year-month-day are all
the usual suspects when it comes to
dealing with dates</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
