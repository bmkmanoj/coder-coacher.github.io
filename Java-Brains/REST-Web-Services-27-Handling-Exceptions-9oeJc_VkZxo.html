about
a pas so far we've looked at the happy
pattern
when everything works we know what the
response is going to be we know what the
status code is going to be and all that
stuff but what if something fails to
work it like it's supposed to right what
if there is an exception that's thrown
what do you want to send as a response
when there is an exception you want to
have some kind of an error code or an
error message that send as JSON and not
some random HTML page that the Tomcat
server throws up right so there are a
couple of ways in which we can approach
at a handling in REST API so let's look
at that first and I'll talk about the
Tom Coderre page later before we start
looking at how to handle exceptions with
jax-rs
let's actually throw an exception so if
you look at our service that'll pick
message service
so this handles the happy path scenario
right there are no exceptions are thrown
so let's add a scenario where we
actually throw an exception I mean a big
get message get message sticks in the
message ID and looks up a message
instance from the map if the ID is not
available this returns null because
there is no check that's happening so a
map dot get off a key that's not
available is going to return that so the
service returns null the resource class
returns null and jax-rs returns no
content because you're not returning
anything at all let me show you what I
mean by that so if you were to access
messages slash 200 where 200 is an ID
that we know for sure doesn't exist if I
hit Send
there is nothing returned and it's 204
no content that's because we are
returning null here so this is a good
opportunity for us to add an exception
so I'm going to create an exception and
I'm going to throw it well here if there
is no message or with the ID that's
requested so let me create a new class
and I'm going to create it in the
package
exception and I'm going to call this
data not found exception okay
now this I want it to be a runtime
exception so I'm going to extend runtime
exception now I need to add a serial ID
because runtime exception has a serial
ID and I'll create a constructor here
nothing too fancy just takes in a string
message and then calls the parent right
so this is standard Java not that I have
an exception here I'll enhance the
message service to actually throw that
exception if it doesn't find the data
that we are looking for so I'm going to
remove this and I'm going to check if
message is now
else I'm going to return message okay
very simple I'm just checking if what we
are requested is available if it's
available I'm returning it if not I'm
throwing a custom exception called data
not found exception okay now that we
have this let's actually start looking
at exception handling in jax-rs
now what if you were to handle this
exception well before that let's see
what happens if I make a call do this
with an unavailable message switch to
postman
making the same call we know that ID 200
does not exist if I were to hit Send
look what we see we see our Tomcat error
report page and the error report says
HTTP status 500 and this is our
exception that we created and threw from
the service but why are we getting this
you're getting this because while we
threw the exception from the service we
didn't write anything to handle that
exception
so the message service is throwing this
exception to the resource the message
resource the message resource has a get
message method which doesn't catch that
exception so that gets thrown further
the exception keeps bubbling up and
jax-rs doesn't handle it it goes all the
way up to the Tomcat sublet container
and the Tomcat sublet container has some
default behavior when there are
exceptions are get bubbled up right in
the default behavior is to show the
standard Tomcat header page for any
exception this is bad we don't want to
show HTML responses to a REST API you
want to create a custom JSON payload
that we want to show when there is an
exception so how do we prevent this the
way to prevent this is to actually
intercept this bubbling up off the
exception so the service throws it to
the resource handler the resource
Handler throws it further to the
framework now we want the framework to
catch this and return a JSON response so
that it does not go all the way to the
Tomcat
sublet container how do we return a JSON
response when there is an exception
that's thrown there are a couple of
steps here the first step is to actually
prepare the JSON response the second
step is to map it to the exception so
that we tell Jersey hey when this
exception is thrown return this JSON
response the concept is similar to
mapping a URL to a response see that's
what we've been doing all along we've
been mapping URL patterns to a response
what we are doing now is mapping an
exception to a response all right so
let's first create the payload that we
want to return when there is an
exception as I told you before we want
the payload to be a JSON payload it has
to be a JSON object with some
information about the exception this is
a REST API so that inclined is actually
a developer we want some good
information so that the developer knows
what's happening and also we can give
additional information about what to do
and how to troubleshoot that exception
so I'm going to create a new model and
the model we have common message and
profile right so I'm going to create a
new class here call add a message this
is a valid model as well just like you
have JSON for message you should also
have JSON for error message the error
message object very simple have three
member variables one is the message
itself as a string one is the error code
which is a code which could be unique to
your API not the HTTP error code you
could have your own custom error code
gives you more flexibility and then
there is a documentation link so let's
say you have online documentation you
can point the developers to the right
documentation so that they can figure
out how to resolve this issue now I have
getters and setters I also have two
constructors one is the knower
constructor because we need to
deserialize and serialize this and then
there is the argument there are three
arguments to this constructor which let
me create these instances on the fly and
then finally I annotate this class
with XML root element because I want
this to be converted to JSON all right
let me save this now I'm done with the
error message now all that's left to do
is to map this exception to that
response how do we do that the way we
map exceptions to responses in jax-rs is
using a class called exception mapper
I'm going to create that next create a
class here in the exception package I'm
going to call this data not found
exception mapper every exception wrapper
in jax-rs
needs to implement a class called
exception mapper from our SD XD package
now exception mapper is a raw type right
you need to make it a generic type now
the generic type is going to be the
exception that you wind this exception
mapper to map right the exception in
this case is data not found exception so
that's going to be the generic type here
you create a new class called exception
mapper it implements the exception
mapper that comes with jax-rs and that's
it that's a generic type the type being
the exception that you want to map in
our case at state a not found exception
now once you implement this there is a
method you need to implement right if
you do this this is the method the
method is called to response it takes in
an exception which is what we want to
map the data not found exception and it
returns a response this should make
sense now right
so whenever you whenever you get an
exception that's thrown in the
application we can have jax-rs call this
method right it's going to pass the
exception that was thrown to you and now
here you can write code to create your
custom response then return it and then
jax-rs is going to take the response and
return it back to the user so the
exception doesn't get bubbled all the
way up this is one way to catch that
exception and then prepare a response
then send it back all right I'm going to
create a simple response here response
status when you use the status
enumeration there should be a not found
here yes there is not fun and then this
is since there's a builder I do a dark
build all right so I'm going to just
return this I'm not I'm not looking at
this exception at all right so whenever
there is a data not found exception I'm
just returning a response with the
status not found I'm building it and
sending it back the one the other thing
I need to do here is annotate this class
with add provider annotation this is the
first time we are seeing this annotation
but what the sanitation does is it
registers this in jax-rs whenever you
Hannett ate a class with provider it
registers it so that Jax artisan knows
that this is there and it can map this
exception right it's just one way of
registering it think of it as an
equivalent of for declaring a class in
XML and other frameworks ok just this
lights Jax let us know that this class
is there all right so now when this
service throws this exception it's going
to get bubbled up to the resource
resource doesn't catch it here's a gift
message resource doesn't catch it it
throws into Jax Alice now Jack Cyrus
looks at all the exception mappers that
have been annotated with that provider
and it sees if there is anything that
maps to the exception that is thrown
well it finds data not found exception
mapper so it's going to call the to
response method and it's going to pass
in the exception right it's going to
call this this runs turns a dummy
response with the status not found and
it's gonna return that it's going to
take that response and it's going to
send that response to the user all right
so let's test this out I'll have to
restart the server because I've created
a new class with provider remember to do
that every time now let's see what the
response is going to be I'm still going
to call the same URL messages slash 200
200 is a message that doesn't exist and
now you see a record for
for right this is different from the
error code 500 that we saw before but
here's a problem we accessed via you
know we updated the status code but this
content still shows up this is still
Apache Tomcat we can actually fix that
by sending some content in the response
right now you see there is just the
status there's no content over here so
let's add some content we have created
this nice error message class let's use
that I'm going to create a new instance
and I can pass in the arguments first
thing is the message what do I want the
message to be I just pass in the message
in the exceptions I'm going to see e^x
dot get message at a core will be 404
can be a custom error code documentation
link I'm just going to send the link to
my website okay I will have a custom
error message now I can send this as the
entity in the response dot Beth alright
so the only thing I'm doing here extra
is sending some content back okay now
let's try this again we call the same
URL and I hit Send now I see JSON
response right because we are sending
the response so Tomcat says hey I'm
already getting response to this I'm not
going to send HTML back alright so this
is the response that we created we get a
good error message so it's message with
ID 200 not found there is an error code
if you want to send it there is some
information to the developer if they
want to access it it can be a very
detailed error object which contains a
lot of good stuff for the developer and
of course there is also photo form in
the status so this is how you map
exceptions right you create an exception
mapper implement the two response method
and build the response that you want to
send back ok now this can be implemented
for any kind of exception it doesn't
have to be custom exceptions that
we created right now there are a whole
lot of things that could go wrong when
making a call to the REST API now let's
let me give you an example let's let me
call a URL that just doesn't exist at
all right now I get pair of code 404 not
found because Tomcat is handling this
now how do I catch this now you can have
a bunch of exception mappers to handle
all these different exceptions right all
you need to do is figure out what is the
exception that was thrown and then
create a new exception mapper to map
that exception and Jersey is going to
call that and return the response now
I'm not going to go into details of all
the exceptions that could be caught I'm
just going to create one generic
exception mapper so that no matter what
happens you don't see the Tomcat HTML
page right you always get some JSON open
it is encouraged to have more exception
mappers so that you can customize the
exception but this is like a generic
exception mapper which is what I'm going
to call this okay now this is going to
be similar to this so this is generic
exception mapper that implements
throwable so basically saying no matter
what the exception is just catch this
this is like a catch all right so I'm
going to take throw a go here throw bill
e^x
now I want the status to be an error
write a server error I don't want it to
be not found in this case so it is
internal server error a generic message
right I'm going to call the codis 500
and save now no matter what happens
whatever the exception is this is like a
blanket catch so every instance is
definitely going to be a throwable so
this exception mapper is going to get
caught
while and this is the JSON response so
this has a hierarchy if there is a data
not found exception this is targeted to
that exceptions of this mapper gets
called for all other exceptions since
there is no explicit mapping this is the
generic mapper that gets called right so
I encourage you to look at more of these
exceptions and create multiple mappers
so that you can customize the error
message that gets sent restart the
server because this is a new provider
and let's try this again there you go
the generic exception caught this and
then we get the response that we
prepared right so this is a simple way
to handle exceptions in jax-rs
in the next tutorial I'm going to show
you another way to throw and handle
exceptions which is a feature of jax-rs
called web application exception not
really a big fan of it but for the sake
of completion I'm going to cover it so
see you in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
