course this was an introduction to
JavaScript we covered some of the basics
of datatypes
objects and functions in JavaScript and
how to work with them in order to do
some simple programming I'm not going to
talk about some of the next steps you
have just scratched the surface of
JavaScript by covering this course
unfortunately there's a lot more to
JavaScript we need to learn about
objects and constructors how to create
new objects and what this argument means
when it comes to constructing and using
those objects so let's talk a little bit
about some of those important concepts
the next concepts you need to learn
about our scopes and closures I'll be
creating a separate JavaScript course
which covers scopes and closures in more
detail once that courses up I will
provide a link to that course in the
description of this video or on the you
know on the tutorial page on the website
so that you can go and check that course
out next
there's also concepts on objects and
prototypes which is what I talked about
right creating new objects and the way
you can simulate the concept of classes
in JavaScript JavaScript does not have
classes but there's an equivalent to
classes using the concept of prototypes
again this is going to be a course and
I'm going to create an link to this page
once the course is ready the next
concept to really understand is
asynchronous javascript javascript is
actually single threaded and this idea
usually comes as a surprise to somebody
who is coded in C++ or Java for a while
they fail to understand the different
way of thinking that you have to
implement JavaScript with because of the
fact that it's single thread you don't
have multiple threads you cannot just
spawn a thread and do things in parallel
so because of the fact that JavaScript
is single threaded it's very important
to write asynchronous JavaScript if you
want to have responsive programs so
there is this whole concept on callbacks
in promises that I will be creating a
separate course on hopefully and I'll
link to this page when it's ready again
and even if that course is not ready yet
and you want to explore this this is an
important concept for you to understand
dealing with more complex JavaScript
there's also client-side frameworks that
you can learn now that you have some
basic understanding of JavaScript we can
move on to concepts like frameworks like
angular JS jQuery react backbone and all
those client-side frameworks in order to
do client-side programming and finally
you you can look at server-side
frameworks to do server-side programming
so this involves nodejs and Express and
you can use javascript code running on
the server which sells out webpages
using MVC so these are some of the
places you can you know places and
topics you can explore as I create
courses covering some of these concepts
I will link it to the page that you're
watching right now it's either on the
YouTube page are the tutorial page from
Java brains so if you see that while
you're watching this definitely check
them out or if you don't see them yet
definitely look up a lot of good
material on this is available online so
look them up and hope you enjoy your
journey of continuing to learn
JavaScript and I hope this course was
helpful thanks for checking this out
again I'm kasha kothak oh and this was
JavaScript for developers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
