tutorials on hibernate in this series of
tutorials we're going to look at what
hibernators how we can use hibernate in
our applications and we'll also
understand the features that hibernate
provides so what is hibernate hibernate
is something called as and Wharram tool
if you don't know what Wharram means
we'll have a look at that in just a
minute
hibernate is actually much more than a
warm tool there are a lot of features
that have been added to hibernate over
the years but when it first started it
started as in what M 2 so it's used in
primarily in the data layer where you
want to persist your application data
into a database thirdly it implements JB
JPA stands for Java persistence API this
is a set of standards that have been
prescribed for any persistence of
implementation that needs to be met in
order to get certified as a Java
persistence API implementation so what
this means is that it follows the rules
that have been set in the Java
persistence API specification so that
later if you if you don't want to use
hibernate you want to use some other
provider which pre implements the same
java persistence api you can do that
with minimal code changes we'll have a
look at what these are in more detail in
the subsequent tutorials but first let's
try to understand what and Wharram dual
is and why it's required so what is the
problem that hibernate is trying to
solve let's take an example of a simple
class that you have in your application
I have a user class example here it has
five fields the ID the name address
phone number and the date of birth of a
user now in a running application you
would have a lot of such objects in the
memory say I have five users in the
application let's try to simplify it for
the example I have five users and the
data for five users and my application
is actively using that function now I
would have five you
they're objects in my memory now let's
say I want to save these user data how
would I do that I would use a database
and 99% of the time we would be using a
relational database because that is the
most common database at least as of
today so I would have to persist all
these user objects into the database
persisters again another word for save
so I would have to store all these user
objects and the data in those user
objects into the database how would I do
that I would have a user table and each
of these user objects would have data
for a particular user and I would save
them as rows in the table so what will
happen is I would have this table like
this I would call this the user table
and I will have five columns that
correspond to the five member variables
of this user class so each of this data
has to be saved so let's say I have user
object number one I would save this as
row number one in this table user object
number to be saved as row number two so
depending on how many objects I need to
save I would have so many rows in this
table so a class corresponds to a table
and an object of the class corresponds
to a row in the table so this is
something that we have been doing with
the years and what we normally do when
it comes to a java application as we
normally use a JDBC connection and we
would connect to the database and then
we would take this user object let's say
I want to persist user object object 1
now I would take this user object and I
would pull up all these fields and I
would create a sequel query that would
do an insert and I would insert it into
this database so depending on what the
users information is those data would go
as sequel query and it would do the
insert the same way if I need to create
the user object I'll have to do a select
on this table and
once I do a select I would probably get
a record set now I'll have to pass this
record set and pull up all the
individual data and I will have to
create a new user object and I'll have
to feed in all the data say I've got
user ID one now when this new user ID or
have to do a user dot set ID and I have
to give the value user dot set name I'd
have to give the name so depending on
what I've gotten in the record set I
have to create the object so the problem
here is this I have objects here in Java
but I do not have objects here in the
database level this is a individual
entity that needs to be converted to
this individual entity which is the true
and the very normally converted this by
using some boilerplate code which takes
each of these properties takes each of
the values of the member variables and
maps it to sequel queries now this
mapping is what is a pain I need to
convert each object into a sequel query
and for saving and then for retrieving
I'll have to convert a record set into
an object and I need to do this for each
and every object say I have another
class here there would be another table
and I will have to do the conversion
every time so this is a common problem
to say to put it mildly because you know
it's there in every Java application
that has a persistence layer and it
connects to the database in order to
save and retrieve values so what are the
problems that we face here what are the
pain points the first pin point as I
told you we need to map the member
variables to the columns each and every
member variable that we have to persist
has to be mapped manually of course you
can have a procedure for each of the
objects and you know you write the code
ones but you still have to do it now
let's say add and you call him or I add
a new field in my object now I'll have
to make those changes in the code in
order to map it I will have to go to
that particular
loop's a where I'm pulling up the record
said data and I need to add this extra
field so that from the record said I
pull up this extra field so any changes
have to be done ourselves using we need
to write our own code in order to
accommodate those changes and you know
even otherwise even if you're not doing
any changes you need to write the code
in order to map this the second pain
point mapping relationships now we saw
you know a user object and a user table
now let's say a user object has a
reference to an address object now how
would it work I we would probably have
an address table in that case I would
have to map the user object to the user
table I have to map the address object
to the address table and if there is a
dependency between these two objects I
would have to create you know a foreign
key and then map it to a primary key so
you know the address tables primary key
would be mapped as a foreign key or user
table so this relationship also has to
be taken care of the third pain point
handing datatypes now let's say I have
have a boolean in my user object says
active user now I want to track whether
a particular user is active or inactive
so I declare a boolean and then I give a
value of true or false now how would I
do that in the database most of the
databases do not have a boolean data
type it will probably be a cat so that I
can save a Y or n or it might even be an
integer where I would say a 0 or a 1 or
I could have different data types which
have a representation of a true or a
false but they are not really boolean
now I will have to handle this data type
conversion myself when I'm actually
writing the code to save the data or to
retrieve the data
so this manual handling again is a
problem because if you are making
changes you have to go to that piece of
code and then make the change in the
code itself ok fourth pain point
managing changes to the object State now
I pull up
user information I want user ID one two
three okay I pull it up from the
database I have a record set and then I
create an object and I put all the data
into that object have the object ready I
pass it on to the business service now
the business service that's some changes
to the subject it updates I don't know
the email address or it updates the name
something there's a change now how would
I manage this change I will have to
again manually execute the procedure
when I say manual execute the procedure
I mean that there has to be some other
component which calls this procedure to
make this change it will have to trigger
an update query and what would be
updated again we will have to frame the
sequel query assets and depending on the
value that has changed we will have to
update the database in order to
accommodate the change so again this is
something that we need to handle
ourselves so these are common pain
points we see this in in each and every
application there are a few others but
I'm just highlighting these because
these are something that we would
definitely handle when we are writing an
application that interacts with the
database now what's happened is many
times because of all these problems you
would normally have an object that maps
to a table so you say I have five five
tables I would have five objects and
most of the times I've seen this happen
a lot we would not worry so much about
establishing object relationships let's
take the example of the user and address
now a user has a particular address a
user row in the user table as a
corresponding address row in the address
table and it has been mapped by a
foreign key now ideally if I have to
represent this as an object I would have
to have an address object and then I
would have to associate it with the user
object but what I would do is since it's
a pain to establish this relationship
depending on the you know the primary
key and the foreign key I would treat it
as separate objects and
establish the association based on the
key itself even in the Java layer this
is actually a very bad solution and I
won't say it is common but I've seen
this happen it's tough to maintain these
relationships and to maintain the whole
object state because what's happening in
the relational side is completely
different from what's happening in the
object side so there is this huge gap
between a relational way of doing things
and the object-oriented way of doing
things so what usually happens is since
I you know we cannot change the
relational part of it we have to save
this in the database it has to go to
tables the data has to end up as a
relational set of data so what usually
happens is people tend to compromise on
the object side of it we would not have
proper object-oriented programming and
we would tend to compromise on the
object oriented design just because we
know it's a pain to manage all of this
and what happens is our object-oriented
design is influenced by the relational
state of what happens to the data in the
end so this is a big problem and this is
something that many people have tried to
address over the years and there have
been solutions which handled this
elegantly and we see more and more
solutions which provide more and more
elegance ways of handling this and
ideally a solution that addresses this
problem will help us map the objects
with the relational database hence the
name of what the solution is trying to
do is called object relational mapping
so this is o RM and this is the primary
reason why hibernate even came into
existence in order to help the users to
map such a thing and it's a framework
which addresses this among other things
and the primary use is to map this gap
between objects and relational databases
in our next tutorial we'll have a look
at how we can write
a simple hibernate application which you
know uses the Cybernet framework in
order to save or use a class into the
database see in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
