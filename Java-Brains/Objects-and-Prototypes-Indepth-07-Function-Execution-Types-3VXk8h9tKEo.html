all the different types of values that
it can hold we need to understand what
are the different ways in which we can
call functions in JavaScript turns out
there are four different ways in which
we can call a function in JavaScript
we've looked at two ways one is got what
I call the regular mode of calling a
function in the second one is calling
using constructors there's a total of
actually four different ways in which we
can call functions in JavaScript so
let's try and understand that first and
once we've got that that's going to be a
good foundation for understanding that
this keyword so let's look at whether
what are the different ways in which we
can call a function in JavaScript so
let's start with a function foo and this
is just going to print console that blog
let's say hello right very simple
function now this is a function
declaration all right so what I'm
talking about can apply to function
declaration as well as for function
expression I just have to choose one and
I'm choosing a function declaration it
doesn't matter if this were to be a war
foo equals a function what I'm going to
talk about is exactly the same all right
now I have a function here and I can
call this function by using foo which we
have already seen we should be familiar
with now this is calling this function
so what the interpreter does is when it
actually compiles this code it looks at
this function declaration and creates a
function object and then foo is
basically executing that function object
all right if it's a function expression
then the function object would be
created during the interpretation stage
but still you do have a function object
here and we have this function being
called if the difference is between the
compilation and the interpretations step
that I just mentioned isn't clear I
highly encourage you to check out the
scopes and glories in that course that's
available on Java brains I go through
this in a lot of detail alright so now
we have a function and you're calling it
this is the first way of calling
functions in JavaScript
this is method one
of calling functions in JavaScript let's
do another way of calling functions
let's say I have an object so you have a
war obj equals and in the object and in
that object I have a function property
let's call the function property foo
itself and then I'm going to have this
function this is a function expression
and I'm going to print the exact same
thing here it really doesn't matter just
some function now I can call this
function by using obj dot foo so I'm
calling a function not directly but
using an object handler right so this
function is a property of an object so
you're basically executing this in the
context off this object
alright so this is the second way in
which you can execute functions in
JavaScript now you might be thinking hey
this aren't these two methods more or
less the same you're basically referring
to an object a function object and then
executing it here you are referring to
the function object as a property of
another object but eventually it is just
executing function object isn't it for
the purposes of what we're going to talk
about with this reference these are
different the method 1 which is
executing a function as is vs. method 2
which is executing a function as a
property of an object are two different
ways for the purposes of the
conversation we're gonna have next so
yes these are two different methods the
third way in which you can execute the
function is using it as a constructor
and we've just seen this anytime you use
a new keyword in front of any function
execution it calls that function in the
constructor mode so we saw what happens
when you execute on any function in a
constructor mode right so there is a war
this equals empty object that connect
implicitly gets created in the very
first line and it returned this gets
added to the very last line implicitly
so this is third way in which we can
execute functions in JavaScript now
there is a fourth three I told you there
are four different ways in which we can
execute functions in JavaScript but I'm
not going to talk about this fourth bit
just yet in order to truly understand
how this fourth way is you really need
to know the concept of the execution
context and did this reference so I'm
going to hold off talking about the
fourth way of executing functions until
we cover the this reference so we're
going to talk about this much later in
this unit but remember that there is
this mysterious fourth way that we're
going to get to later but for now
remember that there are four different
ways in which you can execute functions
in JavaScript the first way is by
calling the function as is of course you
can take parameters in any of these
things the parameters don't matter I'm
just referring to the way in which we
can call these functions so this is
method 1 method 2 is referring to a
function as a property of an object in
executing it so it's an object reference
dot property which happens to be a
function and then executing that method
3 is executing a function as a
constructor by attaching a new keyword
to that execution and then finally the
fourth mysterious method that we haven't
covered yet but I want you to keep at
the back of your mind that there is this
other way as well alright so in the next
tutorial we're going to look at a
concept called the execution context in
JavaScript</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
