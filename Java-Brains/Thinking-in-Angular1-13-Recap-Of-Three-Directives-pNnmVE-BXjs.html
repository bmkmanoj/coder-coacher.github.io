we're going to look at some basic
angularjs features in the last unit we
looked at how angular solves the MVC
problem and we actually set up a symbol
angular application in this unit we're
going to explore some of the basic
features of angular a little bit more
there are some features that we can up
the box like we saw within G if so we're
going to see what we can do but some of
the out-of-the-box features and the kind
of functionality that we can build into
our client applications so let's start
by looking at some of the angular
directives that we've already covered so
the cut directives we covered were the
sub real ng app right ng app is a
directive that comes out of the box with
angular and it helps to auto bootstrap
an angularjs application this is how you
actually tell angular that this is my
angularjs application just adding the
angular script into your HTML the lawn -
you have to designate some Dom element
some an element in the Dom tree to say
angular this is the root of the
angularjs application so go ahead and
use that to bootstrap the angular
application so this designates what's
referred to as the root element of the
application angular is going to be
concerned only with that node and the
children below it anything that you add
outside the node either on a different
branch or a ballot or whatever does not
be affected by angular right notice also
that I've mentioned in the first point
that ng app auto bootstraps an angularjs
application what I mean by that there is
a bootstrap process that you need to do
in order to bootstrap in order to
kickstart an angularjs application you
don't actually have to do this if there
is just one ng app in your page that's
what happened right we just had one ng
app and we didn't do any bootstrap
process things just work out of the box
that's because there was this one ng app
if you have more it'll still work
I'm gonna have to do a manual bootstrap
alright so you can have multiple ng apps
you can have multiple angular
applications per page but once you have
more than one ng app angular will not
know which one to bootstrapping in which
order so you're gonna have to do a
manual bootstrap I'm not going to cover
manual bootstrap at this point you can
actually look it up if you're interested
but let me tell you I have been coding
in angular for like a couple of years
now and I've never once had to do a
manual bootstrap it's a very rare
situation most of the times you're gonna
have just one HTML and one angular app
in that HTML right okay so that was the
first directive Leland was an extract
that we learned about ng in it ng in it
as a directive that you use to create
initially initialization logic where you
create analyzation code that executes
when the page loads when the angular
application is bootstrap and it hits
that ng in the directive or you can use
this to evaluate expressions we did
evaluate expressions right we created a
variable called R of thing and we assign
the value to it you can use this you
know you can use ng in it to do that but
now that I've told you what ng in it is
and what you need to use it for let me
also tell you not to use it it's not
best practice I use ng in it has a very
convenient way to demonstrate executing
a piece of logic in your angular
application but this is just for
demonstration purposes we are never ever
going to be using in Zenith again in
this course there is probably just one
valid the use of ng in it and that's
inside a loop which I'm going to cover
later but you don't want to use ng in it
they're actually better ways to write
authorization and we'll cover that later
right
the third director we used was ng if
it's kind of like an if condition in
your code you could selectively show or
hide certain elements in your
application more accurately this
selectively removes or recreates
portions of Dom based on an expression
you assign the ng if had to be
to a particular dump element angular
evaluates the expression of that in GF
figures out if that's a true value or a
false value and depending on that it
either adds that element to the Dom tree
or it just removes it from the Dom tree
all right so that's the key here
I'm placing focus on this because of
what's gonna come up in the future I'm
gonna have to contrast that with this
but this is what happens then gf if the
ng expression evaluates to false
remember that angular just removes that
element from the Dom tree it doesn't
even exist in the Dom tree once that
expression evaluates to true angular
general pathetic put that node back into
the Dom tree</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
