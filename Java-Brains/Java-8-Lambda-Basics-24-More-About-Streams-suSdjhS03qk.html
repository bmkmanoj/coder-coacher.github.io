more detail and I'm going to answer some
possibly unanswered questions from the
last video
first of all stream is basically you can
think of it as a new view of the
collection the stream is always
something that has a source in this case
the source is a collection the list of
people so a stream in Java 8 comprises
of basically three different elements
the first one is a source which provides
the elements on that can be a belt on
that string right this is this always
have to be a backing collection the
source is the first element the first
part of a string the second part of a
stream and all the operations that need
to be performed on that stream so here
you see there is a filter operation
that's performed on the stream you can
have multiple operations that are
performed on it and then finally we have
a terminal operation the end condition
so here this is a for each so this is
the end condition this is what causes
the stream to do its thing this is what
causes the stream to act unless you have
an end operation the stream doesn't even
get started alright I'm not going to go
into the details of this because again
like I mentioned it's a separate topic
in itself but you need to remember that
these are the three different parts of a
stream I'm going to give another example
so let's say I stream through this again
people that stream let's say I do just
this right what I get back let's say I
were to assign this to a local variable
what I get back is a view of this
collection we can think of this as a way
of looking at the people collection now
nothing happens just by executing the
statement doesn't mean that there is an
iteration that happens across the
collection now what I could do is also
put some operation on top of it right
you had this filter over here let's say
I do just this
if this were to execute again what we're
doing is we are setting the operation on
the stream it's like you have asked a
worker to sit at a particular position
on the assembly line but we haven't even
started the assembly line yet however if
you would add a terminal operation for
instance there is the terminal operation
called count which basically provides a
count of elements in that stream so this
is where the stream ends so this
provides a result which is the number of
elements at this point in that assembly
line at the spine in the string now I
can't change anything on top of this
because what we have here is a number
which is a count so I can't have any
other methods here so what is this -
this is a tunnel condition which starts
the stream and all these collection
elements are going to go through and
this is a filter which filters that the
last name that starts with the letter C
and then this returns a count and what I
can do is I can assign this to a local
variable called count and now let's say
I were to do a print of the count and
let me comment this thing out and now if
I were to execute this I'm going to get
the count which is 2 so it's basically
started the stream and it has gotten the
count now let's say I pick the last name
that begins with D and now the count
should be just 1 because it has to pick
only child students so if I were to run
this I get the count as 1 so this is
another example of a string and again
what you should remember is that each of
these operations taken lambda
expressions and these are the lambda
expressions that you should be quite
familiar with now you can use these to
declare what needs to happen for each
element in that stream and then you just
have the stream execute them now one of
the things that I mentioned in the very
beginning of this course is that lambda
expressions enable parallel process
now what is back and how does it enable
it now we see here stream is basically a
way for you to take the iteration out of
your control right it's not an external
iteration now it's an internal iteration
you're having the runtime do the
iteration and you're just declaring the
intent you're just saying I want this
filter to happen I want this for each to
happen you're saying do that for every
element but you're taking control of the
looping out of the developers hands and
into the runtime so the advantage of
doing something like this is you can
have different portions of the
collection handled and different
processors and if you have a multi
thread Amino multi-core processor you
can have portions of a huge collection
for instance execute these different
things in different course you can think
of it as two separate assembly lines we
have a bunch of different elements of
one portion of it go to one assembly
line another portion go to another
assembly line right you can have that
happen and the way to do this is using
another method here on the collection
called parallel stream what is this - it
returns a possibly battle stream with
this collection as the source so it's
exactly like the stream but this could
potentially we're done a battle stream
if it feels that multiple cores would be
used to make this faster it could
potentially split the collection into
multiple streams and do the exact same
thing the result is not going to change
but it could potentially do things in
parallel so this is the advantage of
functional programming model that lambda
is enable again I recommend you look at
collections and streams in Java this is
a very powerful new construct and
there's a lot of stuff to learn here so
definitely check that out but this is
where I'm going to wrap this video at
least in the context of lambdas you can
see how lambdas enable you to set up
different steps along a stream and have
different operations applied to them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
