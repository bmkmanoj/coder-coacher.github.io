you to understand before we look at more
advanced scope related stuff in
JavaScript and that's the concept of
read versus write operations we are kind
of familiar with what read versus write
operation is general in computer science
but what I'm talking about here is
specific to variables when you write
code that uses variables there are
certain operations which read data from
variables and there are certain
operations which write data to variables
it's important to understand this
distinction because this affects the way
JavaScript treats your variables
I'll explain what I mean by that but
first let me give you an example of a
read and a write operation with
variables now let's say I have a bar a
equals 10 now this is a write operation
now I'm basically assigning the value 10
to the variable a so I'm writing 10 to a
now let's say I do a console that log of
a now this is a read operation because
I'm reading the value of a okay so I'm
not updating the value of it another I
think do a I'm reading from me because
this is something that takes the value
of a and prints it on the console so
this is a read operation okay so this is
right and this is read a lot of the
things we do in JavaScript kind of you
know when you're dealing with variables
you're either writing to it or reading
from it right so let's say I have a bar
a equals 10 and then I have a Warby and
then let's say I do B equals a now here
this line I'm reading from a and I'm
writing to be okay so as far as variable
a is concerned this is a read operation
as far as B is concerned this is a write
operation because I'm taking the value
of a and assign it to p.m. writing to B
so this is a read and write operations
in a nutshell Kyle Simpson in this book
you don't know jeaious actually calls
this the RHS and the LHS okay so the RHS
is a read something like you know are
just by the way stands for the right
hand side and LHS stands for the left
hand side okay so here in this line the
RHS is a and RHS is usually a read the
LHS which is B is usually a write
because you basically take the value
from the right hand side and assign it
to the left hand side there are a lot of
scenarios where it's not
obvious what the left hand side on the
right hand side is but it's very clear
what the read and the write operations
are so you usually prefer to call them
read and write rather than RHS analogous
for instance let's say I have a function
name let's say call this greet again I'm
going to use the same you know example
that we've seen before console that log
of name and now let's say I call greet
with with my name all right now what's
happening here is I'm passing a string
tooth function and I mean is basically
available that gets created in this
function scope and it gets assigned the
value Kaushik so at this particular line
there is a write operation on the
variable name and in line five who here
there is a read operation on beautiful
name okay I hope this makes sense
the write operation over here is
basically when I'm calling the function
right I'm taking the string and
assigning it to the variable over here
because this is called with that
parameter so name is allocated the value
which is the string Kaushik so line four
there's a write operation on the
variable name and the line five is a
read operation on the variable name so
here you can see there is no left hand
side and write that said there's no LHS
and RHS but the fact that one line is a
read and one line is it write becomes
obvious when you look at what values are
being assigned this concept of read and
write operations are important because
it affects how Java Script deals with
certain errors in certain ways in which
you execute stuff so I'm going explain
what that is in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
