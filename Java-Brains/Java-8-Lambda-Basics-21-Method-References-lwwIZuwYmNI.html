going to look at another concept which
is very important with lambdas which is
method references you can think of
method references as an alternative a an
alternative syntax for writing lambdas
which is very readable in certain
scenarios we're going to look at some
examples of method references and then
in this unit we're going to move on to
collections and how the collection api's
can be enhanced and made easy to work
with
by using lambdas I'm not going to go
into the details of collections because
I don't think I can do justice to that
in this course granted this course is
called lambda basics and I don't think I
can do justice to lambdas itself I can
create a follow-up course with a little
bit more advanced lambdas if I get
feedback for it but it rest assured that
we're not going to be dealing with a lot
of depth when it comes to collections
I'm just going to be covering some minor
improvements to the collections api's
and those improvements are kind of there
because of lambdas because lambdas are
being introduced into the java spec so
we're going to start with method
references and we'll see what they are
and when to use them let's look at some
simple examples of method reference in
action so I'm going to create a new
package here for unit 3 then in recruit
a class called method reference example
1 and this is going to be in the package
unit 3 again I'm gonna have a main
method here so we looked at an example
of how you could use the thread
constructor and pass in a lambda to the
thread constructor in the previous unit
we were able to implement an instance of
runnable without having to implement an
anonymous inner class we were able to
sign in a lambda to it so I'm gonna
create something similar and we'll show
you how you can use method references to
make the syntax even more shorter so
let's say I have a public static void
print message right this is a is
basically a method which is a static
method inside the method reference
example 1 class and this is going to do
a system toward
ventolin off hello and now I can execute
this by just calling print message and
just will obviously print hello to the
console and what I'm going to do is
create a new thread and use the print
message in that write I want to make
this runnable and have that execute in a
separate thread you know how to do that
you say thread T equals new thread and
here I need to pass in an instance of
runnable and rather than create a new
anonymous inner class of runnable I can
create a lambda which is basically
something that takes in no arguments and
then it executes print message right so
this is this piece of code here is a
land expression and it gets treated as
an instance of runnable by the thread
constructor and it's going to execute it
so I can say T dot start and this will
print the message to the console we've
already seen this now there is another
way in which you can use lambda
expressions and there is a shorter
syntax the syntax is applicable if this
lambda expression is kind of like a pass
through what is this lambda expression
doing now it's basically taking in our
input arguments and it's executing a
method so what this lambda expression is
doing is a method execution okay then
something like that happens when there
is no input arguments and you're
executing method with no parameters or
if there are certain parameters over
here and then you're passing those
parameters to the method if these two
match or if these two are obvious then
there is a new syntax for it right and
that is Method references
now I'm going to replace this with a
method reference and we will know what
the rules are in order to use a method
reference as I give you a few more
examples but here's the first example
when you have an end expression which
takes in no input arguments and it's
calling a method without any arguments
then you can replace this lambda
expression with a method reference and
the method reference it looks like this
the first thing is you give the class
name where you have the method
so in this case it's method reference
example one which is this class that's
where the print message method is and
then you'd I can do colon symbols and
then you follow that with the name of
the method in this case it's print
message so this is a method reference
expression and this is equal into the
lambda expression that we have seen
before
so this is exactly the same as doing
something like this print message okay
so this is what we are familiar with
this is a shortcut for it basically
you're telling the Java compiler than
the Java Runtime that this expression
the one that you have over here is
basically a pass through all I need to
do is execute this print message method
okay it's just passing through the
control you know doing anything extra so
if all you're doing is just executing a
method in your lambda expression you can
use a method reference for it all right
so this is one example I'm going to give
you another example and this time with
an input argument so I'm going to copy
this over and create a new class here
called method reference example two and
what I'm going to do in example two is
copy over the functional interface
example and make some minor changes to
it I'm going to copy this stuff here and
fix this here so what are we doing here
we are creating a list of people we've
already seen this and I'm going to get
rid of all this other stuff I'm just
going to retain one lambda expression
that should be sufficient for
illustrating this now we have a method
here a static method which takes in a
list of people it takes in a predicate
to define what should be acted upon
which people in that list should be
acted upon and it takes in a consumer
which is basically what operation you
need to perform for those that are
cleared by the
predicates for which the predicate says
yes what is the action that's the
consumer so we are doing these three we
are passing these three as n per
arguments right now look at the lambda
over here this is basically saying given
a value of P pass this to system dot out
dot println so it's basically saying
execute this method for every value
that's being sent to it and this works
fine let's verify that once before we
make changes to this if I were to run
this we are printing all the people here
now this is another example where you
can use a method reference you look at
the first example where we could use a
method reference where the method
reference is substituting this kind of
an expression where there are no input
arguments and is just calling a method
without any arguments okay now here is a
second example where you have one input
argument and you are calling a method
with that same argument right so again
this is being a pass through you saying
take this value then pass it to system
there out dot println right this is
another example where we can replace
this with method references now what did
the previous method reference look like
it looked like the name of the class and
then the method itself right because
this was a static method what do you
call a static method is a class named
dot method name however this is not a
static method this is an instance method
you see here you're using a static
reference to get the out object but out
is not a static reference it's an
instance right and you're calling a
println on that instance so in order to
replace this with a method reference
you're going to have to take the
instance and then double colon and then
the method name let me actually do that
here I'm going to take this out and then
I'm going to do a system dot out which
is basically the instance on which the
println method has been called double
colon and then the method name which is
println now this is again a shorthand
for the Java compiler to say okay I'm
taking an input argument and then
passing it in
right now how does it know that it needs
an input argument because this is taking
the place of the consumer the consumer
is something that takes in an input
argument so if a method reference is
taking a place of something that does
not accept an input argument well tell
on the compiler knows that ok this is
just a simple method call without any
input arguments however if a method
reference takes the place of a consumer
then it knows that there is something
that needs to be passed in to that
method to this system there order
println so it's basically maps to
something like this when there is an
parameter calling a method of that
parameter so wherever you have this
structure you can replace it with a
method reference just like you can
replace this which is basically
something without any parameters calling
a method without any parameters right so
this structure can be replaced by a
method reference and then this tracking
of the structure can also be replaced by
a method reference let's save and
execute this here you see things still
work fine and the reason it works fine
is when the Java compiler gets this
method reference it realizes that this
is a consumer so it basically takes in
an input then passes it to this method
which happens to be system dot out dot
println</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
