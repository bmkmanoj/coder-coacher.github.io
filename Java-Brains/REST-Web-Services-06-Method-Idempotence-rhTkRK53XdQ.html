about item 410
2db methods yes that's actually a word
and it's an important property of HTTP
methods according to the specification
well and what that means so when I was
learning about restful web services
the one thing that confused me was the
difference between a put and the post
like we've already seen you use a put
when you want to update an existing
resource and you use a post when you
want to create a new resource but if you
search online you're likely to find a
lot of material that contradict each
other when it comes to the put and the
post some are just plain wrong while
others tell you the right thing to do
but they don't really explain why so
I'll try to explain the difference and
hopefully it'll be clear to you by the
time you're done with this tutorial
so think about method classification
there are two ways in which we can
classify the four popular HTTP methods
so what are the four popular methods the
get the post
put-put and the delete right so if you
were to classify these HTTP methods
there are basically two different ways
in which you can classify let's start
with the easy classification the method
get' is a read-only method because it
gets something from the server whereas
the methods put post and delete are
right methods because they write
something to the server right in the put
does an update a delete does the actual
delete and the post submits something to
the server so these three methods are
write methods but as the gate there's a
read method right so this is one way to
classify the four HTTP methods okay so
we look at another way of classifying
these methods now since a get there's a
read-only method it's safe to say that
no matter how many times you do a get
request
nothing changes on the server and it's
actually safe to make multiple get
requests right but you're getting a
message right you do a get request to
get a message with a particular ID
doesn't matter how many times you make
that request because nothing changes on
the server so it's safe to make multiple
get requests
and not worry about the side effect but
how about put post and delete since
these are methods that ride to the
server you obviously cannot make these
calls multiple times or can you just
because an operation is not read-only
doesn't automatically mean that it
cannot be duplicated take for example
this piece of Java code this is an
assignment statement assume that count
is an integer variable so assigning a
value hundred to count variable is
definitely not a read-only operation the
statement writes the value hundred to
the variable count now imagine if you
were to repeat this operation three
times write lines two and three don't
really do anything well maybe they do
write the value to the variable but for
all practical purposes they don't have
any effect right it's only the first
assignment that writes the value so you
can actually repeat this like a hundred
times and it still doesn't change
anything the value of count will still
be hundred by the time you're done with
all these different repetitions so this
nature of some of the operations that
let them be repeatable is important in
HTTP method right so it's an important
consideration is an important property
of methods whether they are repeatable
or not like we saw get is clearly a
repeatable operation because it's
read-only now the question is are put
post and delete the beatable operations
or are the non repeatable operations
let's start with deed so you make a
delete request to slash messages slash
ten it deletes message ID ten now let's
say you want to make that same call
again message ID ten has already deleted
so nothing happens while it doesn't
really require or desirable to make
multiple delete calls to the same
resource you can see that it's not a
problem at least if you were to make the
repeated calls by mistake
you will not have unwanted side-effects
right so delete is actually safe to make
multiple calls with okay so how about
put let's say you make a put request to
slash messages slash 20 but some message
text in the request body this is going
to replace whatever was message ID 20
with this new message text in the
request body so you make the exact same
call again message ID 20 is again
replaced with the exact same message
text again make the same request a third
time and the result is still the same
well guess what even put is safe when it
comes to making multiple calls if you
were to accidentally repeat a put
request don't worry about it the final
saved message
remains the same after every request so
you can make a get request as many times
as you want there is no effect on the
server you can make a delete request as
many times as you want it's only the
first later quest that has an effect on
the server subsequent requests do not
and again you can make a put request as
many times as you want it's only the
first request that has the effect on the
server subsequent requests do not have
an effect on the server the problem
however is with the post request if you
want to make a post request to slash
messages you create a new message say
you forgot you made this post request
and you issued this request again now
we've actually created a duplicate
message it repeat that call and you get
another message so every time a post
request is made something new happens so
this is clearly not a safe method to
make multiple calls with every duplicate
call changes something on the server by
creating a new resource it's actually
not a good idea to make multiple post
cause unless you actually need multiple
resources
ok so post is different in this case so
now we have another way of classifying
HTTP methods into two types the first
one the set of methods including get put
and delete which are safe for making
multiple
repeated calls without having to worry
about the impact they may not all be
read only but they do not cause
subsequent effects if you're you know if
you're making the same request multiple
times and there is this other category
consisting of the post method but you
have to be very careful with you make
only as many calls as you need if you
make a repeated call you actually end up
changing something on the server so the
methods of this first category are
called
I'd important methods get put and delete
or idempotent post is non-id important
because every time you make a repetition
of the request you change something
here's the Wikipedia definition of
idempotence idempotence is the property
of certain operations in mathematics or
computer science that can be applied
multiple times without changing the
result beyond the initial application so
get put and delete are idempotent and
post is by definition not idempotent and
this is what they should EP
specification requires the HTTP
specification requires get put and
delete methods to always be idempotent
if a line makes a request with one of
these methods they don't have to worry
about making duplicate requests but if
they're making a post request they
cannot safely make duplicate requests
without any effect on the server which
is why resource creation should always
be wire a post method because resource
creation requests are non idempotent
when you make a resource creation
request you do create a new resource
every time even if you repeat the same
request you end up with multiple
resources created but updating a
resource like we saw can be called
multiple times safely deleting a
resource can be coiled multiple times
safely right and of course getting a
resource can be called multiple times
safely which is why an update request
ideally use
an HTTP put method which is supposed to
be idempotent as per the specification
right so this is the difference between
the put and the post a put request is
idempotent and a post request is non
idempotent like I've mentioned before
these methods have standard meanings the
fact that it's a standard means that if
you ignore it when implementing your
api's you will either confuse your
clients or you will cause that code to
function improperly for example one
common thing that many api is do is
cache some of their get responses when a
client makes a get request what the api
does is it also caches the response so
that if there is another get request to
the same resource within a short period
of time it doesn't go and compute the
resource again it deserves it from the
cache because it's already there and it
had recently calculated the same point
and a little pile back right so this
caching works only on get requests
because it doesn't change anything on
the server so it's cacheable you can
definitely build an API that creates new
resources when a client calls it get but
if you do that you will not have your
clients using your API for long we'll
definitely be confused on the other hand
if you choose the right HTTP methods
your client can build safeguards to make
sure duplicate requests does not happen
for non idempotent methods take for
example the browser refresh button every
browser has a refresh button that does a
very simple function
it just resubmits the last HTTP request
that was made by the browser if the last
request happens to be an idempotent
request like a get the browser just goes
ahead and make that makes the request
when you hit refresh because it knows
that it's a non idempotent request
there's nothing that happens on the
server but if it were a post that was
the last request that the browser
submitted and you hit refresh the
browser wants you right let's say you've
submitted a form which is likely a post
and now you hit refresh the browser
wants you the message say something like
you've already submitted this data
before are you sure you wish to resubmit
this is simply the browser protecting
you from making a duplicate non
idempotent request so it pays to
generally use the right HTTP method for
the right operation because the client
can use safeguards like this to protect
the user okay so in this tutorial we
learnt about what idempotent and non
idempotent requests are make sure you
keep this in mind when you're designing
your restful api so that you choose the
right methods for the right operations
