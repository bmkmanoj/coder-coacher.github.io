about the beam scopes in spring we know
that spring is providing us the beans by
instantiating them and configuring them
depending on whatever values we provide
but then when is this happening and how
is this happening we're going to look at
it in a bit more detail in this tutorial
so we've seen this diagram earlier we
have a few objects that's managed by the
spring container and we have objects
that is not managed by the spring
container when you see manage by the
spring container what we mean is any
object can reference any object from the
spring container by providing the ID and
then spring provides an instance of that
object that we request so this is
happening using the factory pattern that
we saw earlier as well now note that
here we have an object that's actually
referring to the factory the application
context we had seen this diagram earlier
with the bean factory over here this
block was the bean factory but I've
replaced it with the application context
because we are coding with the
application context which is actually a
bean factory with additional
functionalities so now the object makes
a reference to the pair you know the
application context in order to get an
instance of the bean now the application
context refers to the spring XML and
then it gets the information gets the
blueprint about the object and then it
creates the bean and then it hands it
over so this is what we saw this is
actually the way in which of factory
pattern works and spring can work this
way but actually this is not the default
way in which spring beans work I'll just
go over what is the default way in which
the spring beans work and then we'll
have a look at how we can configure
spring to behave this way now what
actually happens by default is see we've
seen the you know the triangle object in
the point object initializations
and we have actually initialized those
objects using spring now what's actually
happening there so what's actually
happening there is when we start the
spring container then I say start that
is when I define the application context
by providing an XML for that application
context what they have
context does is it actually refers to
this spring dot XML okay this is before
we make a call to any gate beam nothing
has happened the initialization of the
application context it reads the spring
XML and it looks at all the beans that
are available in the spring XML and it
actually creates them by itself note
that there is still no call to the gate
beam ok without any call the application
context during initialization itself
hasn't realized all the spring beans
that we have configured in the spring
XML now after that then we have another
object that's actually doing a get beam
then the application context hands over
the beam that has already been
initialized so the creation of the beans
happens when the application context is
being initialized not when the gate
being is happening so this is the
default behavior of beans but this can
be configured in different way we can
configure a bean to be initialized only
when a gate beam happens and we can also
configure the application context itself
to initialize beans only when the gate
bean happens but as long as you're not
doing any such configuration the default
behavior is that the application context
creates all the beans in your XML then
the context has been initialized and
then when the gate bean happens that's
when the application context hands over
the beam that it is already created in
and already has now this leads to a
couple of points which we have to
understand before we see how we can
configure it differently this leads to
the concept of scopes now there are two
basic bean scopes in spring the first
bean scope is called singleton now the
singleton is kind of analogous to the
singleton pattern that we have in Java
but it's not fully the same width there
are a couple of differences we will look
at that but basically what the singleton
means is that once you have a spring
container once you initialize an
application context and then you give it
a spring XML it's going to look at all
the beans in the XML and it's credential
eyes one being per bean definition and
no matter how many calls are made to the
gate bean
the spring container returns only that
instance it's not going to create new
instances every time there's only one
instance that it's going to hand over
for every call to the gate beam in our
example in our earlier tutorials we had
a triangle object initialized and we did
a gate be enough triangle there was only
one class that was doing a gate beam say
there was another class that was doing
the gate been off the same triangle it
would have got the same object spring
would not have created a new object it
would have got the same instance of the
triangle object and the way it's
happening this when the application
context is initialized it creates the
triangle object then itself it doesn't
wait for a gate be the triangle object
is already there and available and no
matter how many calls to the gate beam
of triangle is made the same object is
passed around ok so this is the default
and this is called as the singleton by
default all beans in spring are
singleton we can override the scope and
provide other scopes but if you do not
specify any scopes it behaves as a
singleton and then there's only one
instance per spring container the other
scope that the beans have is called as
prototype prototype is actually it works
the other way we have new beans that are
created with every request so say I
define triangle as a prototype instead
of the default singleton then what would
happen is if another class made a call
to the gate bean and it passed the
triangle ID then spring container would
create a new bean and then pass it to
that class so it's going to create new
objects every time there is a kid bean
so this is a prototype bean and then new
beans are created with every request or
with every reference this is also
important to note here it doesn't have
to be a gate Bean even if it's actually
a part of a ref then it's going to
create a new instance say for example we
have we have a zero point defined in our
example which stands for a point
coordinate 0 0 now if I had defined zero
point as a prototype bean and if that
zero point was referenced into other
beans each of those
beings would have a different instance
of that zero-point object so no matter
it's if it's a call to a gate beam and
you're getting the object or if it's
actually a reference and you are
indirectly getting the object through
the reference if the beam is a prototype
there are new instance is created for
every request and every reference so
these are the two basic type of scopes
that are available the first one is a
singleton which is the D file and the
second one is the prototype so the
singleton default is what causes spring
to initialize all the beans
during load time itself so if a bean is
defined as a singleton when this context
is being initialized all the singleton
beans are going to be getting alized
during the initialization of the context
itself it does not wait for a get B
however if a bean is defined as a
prototype then spring waits for the gate
bean to happen and only then it
initializes a prototype which makes
sense because for every get been it has
to do with the initialization anyway so
instead of doing a default
initialization while the context is
being created it waits for the gate beam
so every gate beam creates a new
instance or every reference creates a
new instance so these are the two basic
beam scopes that spring has there are a
few other scopes which are the Webber
wear scopes now what I mean by Webber
where is spring actually ties in very
well with web applications say you have
JSP or a servlet application you can see
you spring to create all yourself legend
to create objects related to your sublet
application now since it ties in well
with the servlet api's spring is capable
of knowing when there is a new request
when there is a new session so you can
tie the bean scopes to the request and
the session so you have a request scope
where a new bean is created per servlet
request so spring will be aware of when
a new request is happening because it
ties in well with the servlet api's and
then depending on a request it creates a
new bean so if you have you know have
been a get bean inside
request scope then for every new request
there's going to be a new get beam but
as long as it's in the same request Co
the same beam is going to be used same
way for session you can have a new beam
per session as long as there is one user
accessing in a single session no matter
how many calls to the gate beam happens
in the code only one beam is written but
if it's a new user in a different
session then a new beam is created and
the third one is a global session this
is applicable in the portlet context but
you have a global session and the
individual portlet sessions in that case
you can tie a B into a global session
we're going to look at these web aware
scopes later on but I hope the basic
scopes of singleton and prototype are
clear so once again to reiterate
singleton is the default scope for
beings unless you specify it as a
prototype and what happens with
singleton is when the application
context is created all the beans are
initialized and kept ready so when it
get beam happens the same beam is being
sent for every get beam so it doesn't
create a new initialization for a get
beam or a reference but in the case of a
prototype when the context is being
initialized the beam does not get
created it gets created for every
reference to a get been or for every
reference of an object that is dependent
on this object so the way to specify the
scopes for any beam has to go to the
beam definition and enter the scope over
here so let's say Mark the scope a
singleton now this is the default
implementation this is actually
redundant I don't have to do that
because the default is singleton but
what I'm doing here is I'm specifying
the scope of the beam by using the scope
value here now I can specify the scope
as prototype now when I specify the
scope as prototype this beam behaves
like a prototype beam similarly I can
mark request session or global session
over here in order to assign the scopes
accordingly there's one note about
singleton arm
there's a bit of difference in the way a
singleton works in spring when compared
to the actual singleton pattern the
singleton pattern says that there is
only one instance of the object overall
but then here when we talk about
singleton we are talking about a spring
container loan you could have multiple
spring containers running the same JVM
and each of those have the same object
configured and we have multiple
instances the object in the same JVM so
in that case it's not actually pure
singleton but then singleton is just one
of the words one of the scopes that is
used inside spring in order to me know
specify this kind of behavior the
behavior that in this particular spring
container there's only one instance of
the bean created and that has being used
across different references</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
