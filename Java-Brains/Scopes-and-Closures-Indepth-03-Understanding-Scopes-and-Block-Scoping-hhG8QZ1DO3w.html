it helps to kind of understand what
scopes are in general scopes
are the concept of scope is not specific
to JavaScript there is a similar concept
in pretty much every programming
language that I'm aware of the idea is
that a scope dictates a portion of the
program where a particular variable is
accessible when a particular variable
makes sense and if the variable in a
particular scope is accessed outside the
scope
well that variable doesn't exist right
so let me give an example for why scopes
would be helpful now let's say I have a
variable here bar equals 10 and let's
say this is somewhere in the middle of a
long program right I know it says line
21 here but let's assume this is like
line find in 21 for instance it's just a
huge program and there is this line
somewhere in the middle which says bar
equals 10 now just by looking at this
line would you be able to tell me if a
is accessible everywhere else in the
code it is accessible at line 21 because
that's where it's declare but could it
be accessible in other places in the
program could it be accessible
everywhere else in that program so the
answer to that question as well it
really depends it depends on how
variable a is declared where it's
declared and all that stuff
the reason it depends on that is not all
variables are accessible in every place
in every program all right it doesn't
work that way
variables are accessible only at certain
locations depending on how you've
declared it if every variable is
accessible everywhere then it's going to
be chaos
there is really no sane which part of
the program is working on which variable
it really doesn't work that way there is
usually controlled portions of the code
where certain variables are active or
not so typically what happens is there
is one global scope there is one scope
which is accessible across the board via
the program but then there are these
small pockets of scopes where you access
certain variables right now let's say
you're assigning the value of 10 to a in
order to do something there is the small
portion of logic that you need to
execute
so if a is needed only for that small
portion it doesn't make sense for you to
publish into every other portion of the
core what you'd like to do then is to
kind of isolate a to a particular
portion so what you would do is you
typically create like this box that is
accessible you could have a bunch of
other variables over here and they all
work with each other but then they
achieve something which is the result
that you want and then after the result
is achieved then all those variables can
be discarded they don't need to be
accessible outside the box okay so you
can create a bunch more boxes like this
let's say you're working on some other
piece of functionality so there's this
other box which contains those variables
and those pieces of functionality what's
inside one box is not accessible outside
the box it's available only in that box
okay the other thing about scopes is
that they typically have a hierarchy so
you can have a scope inside a scope for
instance this is one scope I can create
one more scope inside it now the scope
the code inside the scope can
potentially create variables the code
outside the scope can potentially create
its own variables now the code inside
the scope could access the variables
outside it could access the variable
over here but the code outside the scope
cannot access the variable inside all
right now that you've seen how scopes
work as a concept not let's say you want
to create a scope and this is your code
again you don't want to make this
available to everybody we want to
restrict it to a scope how do you create
a scope it again depends on the language
for instance if you were writing a code
in C++ or Java the standard way to
create a scope is to do this open closed
curly brace right so this curly brace is
what's referred to as a block now any
code you put in that block there's going
to have the scope that is that extends
as far as this black extends rights once
this block ends this Khobar deleted the
ends so this is a very simple way to
create scopes in Java or C++ there are a
bunch of different ways which let you
create blocks for instance you can have
an if statement okay this is a condition
which always evaluates to true of course
but this could be another valid
condition and now the if block has the
spoken closed now we have created a
block
any variable declaration over here is
isolated to that block okay
could be a far loop which again has the
open closed curly braces so any of those
open closed curly brace syntax elements
creates a block between the open and the
close this is when it comes to languages
like C++ or Java but this is not the
case in knowing when it comes to
JavaScript in JavaScript having an open
close curly brace does not create a new
scope okay so let's take a look at what
actually does create on your scope in
JavaScript now let's say this is your
statement and you want to isolate this
to a scope you want to create a new
scope so that it does not become a
global variable how do you create a new
scope in JavaScript so let's find out in
