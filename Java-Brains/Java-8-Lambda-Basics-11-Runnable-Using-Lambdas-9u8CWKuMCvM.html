new function type in Java that all these
lambda expressions are typed as we have
reused the interface type that's been
available in Java for all along there
are actually several reasons why the
Java language designers decided to use
an interface as a type for lambdas
instead of creating a new function type
the most important reason though is
backward compatibility think about what
needs to happen if they had chosen to
create a new type called the lambda type
or the function type what would happen
is you could have used the lambda type
only in other code which also used the
same lambda type for example let's say
you want to use a library and pass a
lambda expression to that library the if
there was a new function type you would
have had to rewrite the library to
accept this new function type as well
now the advantage of using an interface
is we can use lambdas in place of all
those anonymous inner classes and all
the other methods signatures which
accept the interface you don't have to
rewrite them for the new function path
so this is a huge advantage when it
comes to backward compatibility let's
take the example of a thread and a
runnable remember that there is a
runnable interface which has a method
called run and in order to create a new
thread you would have to create a new
instance of runnable and use that
instance in order to create a new thread
well guess what since runnable is an
interface which has just one method it
works just as well with a lambda you can
use lambda in order to create a new
runnable again remember though that
whenever you're doing something like
this it must be an interface with only
one abstract method and runnable is a
perfect candidate for that so in this
tutorial I'm going to demonstrate how
you can use a lambda to take the place
of an instance of runnable I'm going to
create a new class called on a bill
example and take in a main method need a
main method here so get rid of this
comment now what I'm going to do is
create a new thread and pass to it an
instant Java runnable for example I
could say 3
my thread equals a new thread now this
needs to take in a new instance of
runnable I could of course create a new
class that implements the runnable
interface and then create an instance of
this here but I'm going to create an
anonymous inner class when I see new
runnable and now since runnable is an
interface I just cannot senior runnable
and be done with it I need to provide
that implementation here because if I
you just do a mouse-over here it says I
haven't implemented the method so add
unimplemented methods ideally there
should be just one which is the run so
I'm gonna implement this I'm going to
have a simple system out print it inside
runnable so this is a classic example of
an anonymous inner class I need a new
instance of runnable and the runnable
just has one method so rather than go
create a new class create a separate
file for it and then create an instance
I'm just doing an anonymous inner class
and just I just need this once and I'm
not going to do this again so I can run
this you can say my thread dot run let's
execute this and here you see you get
the message printed inside I notice I
was able to spawn a new thread and then
I was able to execute this piece of
logic this is a classic case where you
can use a lambda rather than create an
anonymous inner class we can create a
lambda and the thread constructor
doesn't know any better we can create a
lambda which has the same signature as
the public wide front which is the one
method of the runnable interface all
that the thread expects is an instance
of runnable we are going to sneak in a
lambda and since the lambda behaves like
the interface that it expects thread
doesn't know any better it's going to
execute it so let's demonstrate that I'm
going to create a new thread my lambda
thread which is going to be a new thread
again but now rather than create
and give this a pipe sorry now rather
than create an inline anonymous inner
class I'm going to create an inline
lambda so I'm going to say this is a
lambda expression that doesn't take in
any arguments you see Rand isn't taking
any arguments I am just going to print
something to the console even here I'm
going to call this lambda runnable okay
this is all I need to do rather than do
all this boilerplate code I just create
the simple inline lambda right here and
now I can do all my lambda thread dot
run and this is still going to work just
like this and the thread class doesn't
know any better remember though that
this thread class has been implemented
way before Java 8 did the Java
developers go in and fix it so that it
works with lambdas well no they didn't
have to because a lambda pretty much
behaves like an instance of what it's
trying to match as an interface so this
lambda is pretty much indistinguishable
from an implementation of a runnable
that we have over here so the thread
class doesn't know any better so this is
the magic of having the interface
mechanism for declaring lambdas you get
this huge backward compatibility and all
the old API is that we have come to know
and love in Java are still accessible
but now with lambdas the again the only
constraint is the interface that those
API is expect has to be something that
has only one abstract method these
interfaces are what are called
functional interfaces we'll talk about
that in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
