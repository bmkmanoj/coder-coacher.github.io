function called
for each which is pretty interesting so
I'll demonstrate that in the scratchpad
now it's a very common feature you know
it's a very common requirement to loop
through an array and examine each and
every element in the array so JavaScript
has this inbuilt method for arrays
called for each and this method is
pretty interesting because you get to
use that a lot when you're working with
arrays and secondly it uses the feature
of passing functions as arguments to
another function you will see how
powerful it is to be able to pass
functions and the way the for each
method works is a let me do this here my
array dot for each now this for each
method takes in a function as an
argument okay now I can pass a function
here and let me do a console dot log for
element and element okay so I'm
basically passing a function into this
alright so if this is confusing let me
take this out have a bar my function
equals test so this is a function
expression which has a value of a
function
just just console that blog what it does
is an important but what I can do is I
can take this function and pass it in
here okay so this is same as well as
what I did before before I did the
function inline now I'm assigning it to
a variable and then passing that
variable over here okay so that's what
the far each does the far each accepts a
function as an argument and then what
the far each does is after it gets the
function it executes the function for
each element of the array okay now how
many elements does my array have it has
four elements now it's going to execute
my function for each of those it's going
to execute the function four times so
let me run this there you see foreign
element loaded four times it was
executed for this element this element
this element and then this element
all right so this is you can see how
powerful the functional programming
aspect of JavaScript is so this is okay
it's cool and all but it's not all that
exciting it's just executing the same
function four times so wouldn't it be
cool if you could say hey for each
method you are executing the function
that I'm passing to you for each element
can you do also send that element as an
argument to my function so that I can do
something with it all right so the my
function is executed for ten it's
executed for twenty is executed for
hello it's executed for this object so
when you are executing my function for
ten pass time to me when you're
executing my function for twenty past
twenty to me so each time it executes
the function for an element it would be
nice if we could pass that element as an
argument to the function right that'd be
great but turns out the for each method
actually does that it just happens that
we are not accessing it you're not using
that argument that's passed to it you
remember we talked about when when a
caller calls a function with more
arguments than what is required those
extra are given setting dot right so
that's actually what's happening the far
each method is actually calling our
function with each of those elements as
arguments each time and we are not using
it so it's just you know it's discarded
so in order to use it I can actually
declare an argument in the function and
I don't know you can use it for printing
it like this so now what's going to
happen is when the far each method
executes the function it is passing this
argument anyway when the function is
called but now since you're holding on
to it you can use it in console that log
now if I run there you see each element
gets printed okay so it's still the same
function that's executed for each
element but whenever it executes the
function for an element it passes that
element is an argument so it can hold
onto it and that execution gets that
element isn't this cool
this is really cool you can use it for a
lot of powerful stuff you can use it for
iterating over an array so rather than
have a for loop you can have a function
which accepts
this is an argument and then iterates
over it what's interesting is there are
also a couple of other arguments that
get passed each time this executes we
just use the first element first
argument which was the item turns out
there are two more arguments that's
passed the second argument is the index
the position at which the the loop runs
right so it's executing for each the
first time the function executes the
first argument will be the first element
the second argument will be zero
okay the second time the function runs
the second the first argument will be
the second element and the second
argument would be one and so on and the
third argument in the function execution
is the array itself in case you need it
for some reason but it's not very
commonly used so far each very powerful
feature comes out of the box with all
arrays in JavaScript or you can use it I
highly encourage you to use it instead
of for loops if this can do the trick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
