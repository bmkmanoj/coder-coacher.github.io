we've learned how to write a model
object and we've learned how to annotate
various fields in the model object so
that hibernate creates a table for us
and then we do the mapping we've learned
how to save this object into the
database they've learned how to retrieve
data from the database and create model
objects with the data populated and we
learn to do all that using hibernate EP
is this is all fine but we are making
one assumption here we are assuming that
the member variables inside this model
object can all go inside single columns
we made the assumption that an ID can be
just one column the name member variable
can be one column so and so on so the
example that we've taken I loves this
it's possible to have single columns for
each member variable because of the data
type that it's using zero they're
primitives ID is an integer name is a
string address is a string phone number
is a string date of birth is a single
date so each one of them can be
represented as individual columns which
is fine now the question is what if one
of these member variables were to be an
object instead of just a you know a
simple data type which can fit into a
column say one of these were an object
and that object had a few member
variables inside of them each of them
having particularly use now how would
you save that using hibernate what if
one of them was an array what if one of
them was a list or a set how would we
save that using hibernate so that's what
we're going to learn in this tutorial
and not just this tutorial we're going
to have a few more tutorials in which we
will explore this option because there
are a few permutations and combinations
when it comes to having objects inside
objects or any of these collection
objects inside our model object so the
first scenario that we're going to take
is this we will have a user class and
use a class instead of having an
address string you'll have an address
object we'll write a separate at this
class and the address class will have
Street city state and pin code and now
I'll use a class instead of having a
simple string as an address member
variable it'll have an instance of this
address object now the question is how
do we save this address object in the
user table it's not a string anymore so
we cannot have it inside one column we
have four member variables of this
address object now how are we going to
save all those four we look at the most
simplest implementation for this
scenario in this tutorial and we'll look
at a little bit more advanced
implementations later on but as of now
the simplest way to do this is to have
each of these member variables off the
object inside the user class also to
have separate columns so what I mean to
say is now the user class has an address
object and the address object has some
member variables we're going to treat
the member variables of this address
object the same way as you would treat
member variables of the user class
itself so we'll assume that there's no
address object it's just straight
city-state pin-code are for other member
variables of the user class itself and
we would save it the way we would save
for member variables so what we are
essentially saying is to have supplied
columns and have Street as a column City
as a column State as a column and the
pin as a column so we are assuming that
you know it's almost as if these member
variables are member variables with the
user class and so it's not like there's
another object and the member variables
are of that object which almost as if
it's just one class and all these are
flat member variables that's how we're
going to represent this this option
works fine on a particular scenario and
that scenario is if the object inside
this user class there's a value object
now what do I mean by value object when
dealing with hibernate the we see two
kinds of objects
one is the entity and one is the value
object now an entity is something that
we saw earlier that was the user class
user is an entity it has an object needs
to be saved as a separate table in the
database and it actually you know it's
it's an entity in the sense of the word
that it is independent and it contains
data that provides meaning about itself
now what is a value object and a value
object there is an object that has data
and even that has to be saved to the
database but it does not have meaning on
as of itself it provides meaning to some
other object let's take a dress for
example a dress yes you can have an
address object with the street city
state and pin code values all populated
but the address object as of itself does
not carry any meaning when you say
address then you say whose address it's
it's an address off user class just like
a name here is name off this user phone
is phone number off this user the same
way the address is the address off this
user now without having a user object
distance address doesn't make sense just
a phone doesn't make sense it doesn't
have a purpose so its purpose in life is
to provide value to this user object so
that is what differentiates an entity
from a value object an entity has
meaning on its own but a value object
does not have meaning on its own so it's
not just this address object here even
name it's a string so it's a value
object it has a value for an entity and
it does not have meaning on its own so
that way add this object here is a value
object so when you are dealing with
value objects you have a different
approach versus when you're dealing with
entities itself well you can have an
entity inside another entity so there's
no stopping you from having say another
object here which is actually an entity
but it is related to the user object so
we can have a member variable which is
another entity and that entity might
have a meaning of its own but it happens
to be inside another entity but that's
not the case when it comes to the
address address does not have meaning on
its own it has to be inside a user
object has to be associated with the
user object or device there's really no
point in having an address object so
that's what makes the address object as
in as a value object so this approach
that we're going to look at in this
tutorial can be applied to value objects
so we're going to look at some examples
of how we can have an entity inside
another entity later but for now if you
understand what a value object is and
how it can be associated to an entity
that should suffice so this is a value
object and this is the approach sniffing
undertake we're going to have the
columns separately for this value object
so which works fine because there's no
point in having an address is a separate
table again as we discussed it doesn't
have meaning on its own it has to be
associated with the entity so why not
have it in the same table okay now let's
look at how to implement this in
hibernate so I'll create and you add
this class and this address class will
have string Street
okay city state and I'll leave the south
string for the encoding okay and I will
generate getters and setters for all of
them now in order to mark this as a
value type and in order to have
happening not to create a separate table
for this I need to use the annotation at
embedded at embedded Tilt's hibernate
that this object needs to be embedded
inside something else
now what allows will go to the user
details so class I don't have much here
I just have the user ID in the user name
I will create a new member beta book
here for address and I'll also generate
the getters and setters for this
okay so now this should do now we are
high beneath will know that this address
there is not a separate entity by
looking at this guy here it sees address
as embeddable so it has to be embedded
so it automatically does the embed you
can you can also actually have another
annotation here which is embedded now
this embedded again is another clue five
we need to say that this is you know
right it's an embedded object you don't
have to do this this is not mandatory if
you have this class and the class of
screen marked as embeddable that should
do it will it'll tell hibernate that
attach to our embedded it has to put it
in the same table and the table we
already defined so let's let's run this
I will have to create a value fee for
the address also now we have initialized
the two users say address addr equals
new address addr dot set street okay
I'll have to import address from the DTO
set straight street name addr dot set
city city name yeah that should open up
another fill on all the values I'll say
user dot set address addr and user - dot
set address I'm going to say okay limit
remove this I'll just set for user the
first object alone and I'm going to set
for the second object so now I'm
persisting this
I don't anymore this I don't need this
second user is to simplify things a bit
I'll just have one user and one address
simple enough and I will save that user
I'll close now let's see what happens if
we run this yes leave this okay it's
inserted and look at look at the query
that's it's generated this generated
city pin code State Street everything
are columns of the user details stable
loan so if we run the query know what
the database looks like well there you
go you have the city name the pin code
State Street all these are actually
member variables of the address object
but they end up in the user table itself
because we have set the address as
embedded and we have the address class
here as an embeddable class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
