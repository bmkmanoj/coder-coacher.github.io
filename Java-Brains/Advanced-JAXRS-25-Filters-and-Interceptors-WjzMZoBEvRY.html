okay in this unit we're going to wrap up
this course by covering a couple of
miscellaneous items that we didn't get
to cover in the previous units in this
lesson we're going to talk about filters
and interceptors we did cover filters in
the previous unit we used it to do
logging we used it to do authentication
and authorization what we didn't cover
is there is another such entity called
interceptors that jax-rs provides just
like filters interceptors kind of have
the similar model the intercept requests
and you can again intercept both the
request and a response just like you do
a filter but see well you might be
wondering why you why do we need
interceptors when we already have
filters what's the difference between
the two so interceptors have been
designed to manipulate the entities to
manipulate the input and output streams
so this way it is different from filters
in the sense that filters actually
manipulate the header information or you
know metadata information while
interceptors manipulate the actual body
of the request in the response there are
two kinds of interceptors one is the
reader interceptor and one is the writer
interceptor this is again similar to
filters you have one to read and want to
write but what's different here is
what's being read from and what's being
written to in the case of filters it's
the request information and the responds
information in the case of interceptors
it's the request body and the response
body here's an example for an
interceptor this is taken from the
jax-rs documentation for jersey there is
a gzip writer interceptor the way to
implement an interceptor is to implement
this interface writer interceptor this
has a method called
around right - which gets a context
object which contains the output now
here what's happening is we're getting
the output stream and doing a gzip for
the output okay so we are basically
gzipping the contents of the response
which is why the tool for the task here
is intercepted and not a filter because
we are changing the body I personally
haven't
found a lot of uses for the Interceptor
you know gzip is a very classic example
of why you would need interceptor but
it's not very common for for you to
write interceptors but it's not anything
to know in case you need to mess around
with the request or the response bodies
now let's talk about the difference
between filters and interceptors
interceptors like we said is used to
manipulate the entities and filters are
used to manipulate the request and
response parameters like the headers
URIs and all that stuff there are two
kinds of interceptors one as the reader
interceptor and one is the writer
interceptor similarly there are two
kinds of filters the container request
filter and the container response filter
so a couple of examples for you know an
example for a interceptor would be
encoding an entity to sponsor encoding
an entity request we saw gzip as an
example that's a perfect use case for an
interceptor we have already seen
examples for filters we have logging
security all the cross-cutting concerns
which manipulate the request and
response parameters all right so this is
a high-level introduction to
interceptors what's also interesting and
we didn't cover this in the previous
lessons is filters and interceptors work
not only on the server they also work on
the client these are things that you can
implement on the client if you're
writing a jax-rs client using the jax-rs
api we have we covered the jax-rs client
in detail in unit 3 if you were to use
that API you can build filters and
interceptors for your client code in the
client side we have filters you have two
types of filters which is the request
and response but these are not called
container request filter and container
response filter on the client side they
become client request filter and client
response filter they do pretty much the
same thing when a request is sent out
there is a client request filter that
comes up and when the response is
received from the server there is a
client response filter that acts we also
have two interceptors we've seen this
just now we have reader interceptor and
writer interceptor another entity that
works on the client side which we've
already seen for the server side is
message body so you have message body
reader and message body writer this
works similarly to the server side but
in the case of a server side a message
body reader is when a request comes from
a client and the server is reading the
request message body writer is when the
server is sending something to the
client and the message body writer is
writing to the response in the case of a
client it works the other way the
message body reader is when the client
makes a request to the server and the
request body needs to be written to the
request and the message body reader is
when the server sends a response back
and other client is reading it right and
so things are flipped on the client side
if this is very confusing let me
illustrate this with a diagram now let's
say you have a client here and the
server here and the client makes a
request I'm going to highlight all the
different elements that act now let's
say you have a bunch of filters
interceptors and message body readers
and writers on the client and you also
have a bunch of filters interceptors and
message body readers and writers on the
server now what's the order what gets
called then I'm going to cover that in
the slide and hopefully where the end of
the slide you'll be clear about what
happens when the client makes a request
the first thing that gets called is the
client request filter if there is a
clear request filter on the client side
that filter gets called so you have an
opportunity to change the request
parameters from the request and the
client is making this request now you
get a change the parameters off the
client request before it even goes from
the client to the server once the
request filters are done then the writer
interceptor takes over now you have your
object you have let's say you're making
a post request you have your Java object
that needs to be converted to an HTTP
payload now this is where the writer
interceptor comes in before the
conversion happens from your instance to
the HTTP payload the Interceptor gets a
chance to modify that payload and now
once that's done the message body write
or takes over now you have your Java
instance being written
actually written to the HTTP requests
using a message body writer on the
client-side with this the request now
leaves the client and goes to the server
now on the server side this should be
familiar to you now we have a container
request filter which is the first thing
that gets executed on the server side
which modifies the request params and
now we have the reader Interceptor which
intercepts the read action and lets you
modify the payload and now we have the
message body reader which actually
converts from the payload to your java
instance and now that java instance is
sent to a resource method on your so now
let's say the resource method executes
it does what it needs to do and now you
have a response to be sent back here
things work the other way around now
before anything else the container
response filter kicks in allows you to
change the response parameters then the
writer interceptor intercepts the right
and finally the message body writer
converts your instance on the server
side to the response payload and the
response gets sent to the client now
before the client gets hold of the
response there is a client response
filter which lets you modify the
response parameters and then you have
the reader interceptor on the client
side which intercepts the read and then
finally you have the message body reader
on the client side which converts from
the payload to your instance java
instance on the client if this looks
confusing don't worry too much about
this it's very unlikely that you have
one application with all these different
things abloom nted you would have only
certain bits and pieces of this for
instance you would have like a message
body reader and a container request
filter right so it's very unlikely that
you have all these different entities
working on every request but this is the
order if if at all you were to deal with
the request which has multiple of these
entities this is the order in which they
get executed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
