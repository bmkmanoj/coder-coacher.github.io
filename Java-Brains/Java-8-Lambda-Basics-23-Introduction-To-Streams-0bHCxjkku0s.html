streams which is a powerful new gif
working with collections in Java 8 Java
collections and streams are a whole
different topic and you know we could
have a course for just that so I'm as I
mentioned in the introductory video I'm
not going to be able to do justice to
this I'm not going to be covering a lot
of details about Java 8 collections and
streams in this course
my interest in streams is particularly
in the context of how lambdas work with
streams in order to make the interaction
with the API really elegant so this is
going to be a very very brief
introduction there is much more to this
topic than what I'm going to be covering
in this course so what are streams in
Java 8 the definition as per Java Docs
is that it's a sequence of elements
supporting sequential and parallel
aggregate operations this is not super
helpful so let me give you an example of
a collection as we know it let's say we
have 6 cars and you have to have some
work done on these cars right so let's
say you want to paint the chassis of
these cars you want to fix the engine
and fix the tires right so there are
three things that needs to be done now
let's say you have three people who can
work one person on each of those things
right so one person can fix the engine
one person can fix the paint the chassis
and one person get fix the tires right
we have three people who each know what
to do and they have to work on these six
different cars now they could approach
this in a couple of different ways so
let's say I have the person who paints
the chassis say you go to that person
and say ok these are the six cars and I
want you to bring the chassis for all
these six cars so what this guy does is
is going to go across all these cars one
by one and it's going to paint the
chassis for all those cars right and
then he says ok I'm done now next there
is another guy who fixes the engine you
say ok I'm going to fix the engine for
all these cars one by one and when he's
done with the last car it says ok I'm
done and then similarly for fixing the
tires this guy goes through all these
cards one by one and then I say ok I'm
done now what's happening here
each of these three people who need to
work on the cars are actually iterating
over the cars every time right
so there are three iterations that are
happening so each person has a specific
unit of work that they need to perform
on these cars but they're actually
looping over these cars every time into
the three iterations so this is not very
efficient you want these people to just
do the work that they're supposed to do
looping over these cars like going from
car to car is just an overhead you don't
want them to do that so this is
something that is usually not the
standard practice I mean you're looking
at a car manufacturing industry the
standard way of fixing a bunch of
different cars a collection of cars is
by using a mechanism called assembly
line you basically have the people stay
at a particular location and then you
have an assembly line right some kind of
a conveyor belt of sart's which has all
these different cars and then these cars
move in an order and then these people
stay put
they stay where they are and the cars
come to them and they each know what to
do what kind of an operation to perform
on these cars and as the cars keep
moving they perform the right thing on
each of those cars right so you
basically have the looping the
integrating isolated out into the
separate thing which is the conveyor
belt which is the assembly line and then
all these different people who need to
work on each individual element they
just stay put and they know exactly what
to do and they don't have to worry about
the looping part right this is a good
analogy at least in my mind for what
streams are streams let you build this
assembly line it let you build this
conveyor belt and then you declare all
the different things that you need to do
for each element right and then you say
okay now go and then the stream
basically creates this conveyor belt of
Sarge where each element in that
collection goes through that list of
things that need to be done and then
each element has the right kind of
action applied to it this might be a
little bit abstract so let me give an
example of what streams look like in a
simple java code all right so have this
new class here called streams example
one and our main method I'm going to
paste this collection code that we have
been working with so far
types and now we have a list of people
over here now we've had this use case
where you wanted to loop through this
list of people and get the people who
have their last name that begins with
the letter C and then print them right
we were doing this in a non-destructive
fashion but let's say we want to have a
sub list you want to get a new list
which contains all the person objects
which have the first name that begin
with the letter C and then you get that
list as a separate instance and then
print that value but one way to do this
is by looping through this list of
people and filtering out the list of
filtering out the person records that we
are interested in and then looping
through it again and printing it right
so that's the first approach that we
were talking about then we have the car
mechanics go through each car and they
do the iteration which is not very
efficient if we were to do this in this
approach it means looping through the
people array once to identify the person
objects which have the first name or the
last name that begins with the letter C
and then looping through it again in
order to print it that's not efficient
what we can do though is create an
assembly line of these people objects
and set the write operations to do the
right thing and then just run the
assembly line alright so how do we do
this the way to do this is by using a
stream method as of Java 8 every
collection comes with a stream method so
let's say I take this people instance
and now here you see there is a stream
method and this as a Java doc says
returns a sequential stream with this
collection as its source
so the stream method returns a new type
called stream off person it's a generic
type which returns the stream of person
so if you were to think of this people
as that list of objects in a horizontal
line you can think of the stream object
as an assembly line which is basically
putting all those person objects on a
conveyor belt and streaming them now
what's the point of having them be
streamed the point is that now the
stream has a bunch of methods that you
can
on it for instance there is a for each
method that we've already seen we saw a
far each applied directly to the
collection we can actually do this to
the conveyor belt as well you can do
this to the stream so I can do a for
each and this sticks in a consumer and
let's say I acts I write in a lambda
expression here which just says system
dot out dot println off V dot get first
name what is this gonna do it's
basically putting all these people
elements to the conveyor belt and for
each element that shows up in the
conveyor belt I'm printing out the first
name it's not too fancy we've already
done this but here's where things get a
little bit more powerful so let me first
run this to make sure that we still get
all the first names now let's add one
more thing here so what I want to do is
not print every records first name I
want to isolate out the people who have
the last name that begins with the
letter C we've already done this before
now this is a conveyor belt and right
now we have just one mechanic working on
the conveyor belt we can actually have
multiple people work on the conveyor
belt so let's say I want to add one more
over here so turns out there are
multiple methods that you can perform on
each element in the conveyor belt apart
from just the far each now here you see
there's another method here called
filter and this is it returns a string
consisting of the elements of the stream
that match a given predicate so case
what filter is a method that takes in a
predicate functional interface it takes
in a lambda expression which is a
predicate and it actually filters those
things in the stream so you can think of
this as a quality control expert that's
examining all the cars in the assembly
line and if something doesn't meet the
requirement it just takes that car out
of the assembly line so if I were to
filter over here and pass in a predicate
now only the elements that pass the
predicate go to the next step in the
assembly line to the far edge if the
predicate says false for any of those
elements
just doesn't go to the next step all
right let's stick this predicate and
give it something that we are looking at
which is basically the last name that
begins with the letter C so for each
element the predicate is true only if B
dot get last name that starts with the
letter C now what happens this is still
a stream every person object goes
through this and now it does the first
check which is the filter and the filter
sees if the last name starts with the
letter C if it is true then that element
remains in the conveyor belt and then
the next operation is performed and it
prints it but if this is false the
element is removed from the conveyor
belt and this never executes for that
element all right let's save and run
this up here you see Lois and Thomas is
printed which are basically those two
persons who have the last name that
begins with the letter C guess what
happened to the other elements the other
records have been removed from the
conveyor belt at this step so this never
got the execute I hope you can see how
powerful this pattern is again if you
want to do multiple operations on a list
or a collection you don't want to do
this with multiple loops or have one big
loop with a very complicated logic this
pattern makes such kind of operations
move very very simple it basically
streams the collection and on a stream
you can have multiple operations
performed for each element of that
stream and each operation has a chance
to modify the stream it has a chance to
change what happens in the next step in
that stream so here a filter was able to
either retain the element or remove it
look at some other methods which
actually modify the element before it
goes to the next step if you take the
analogy of an assembly line it actually
makes sense each person was working on
an assembly line each mechanic working
on a car in assembly line somehow makes
a small change to each element as it
goes to the next mechanic so what you
get add as the end result is basically a
cumulative effect
Meishan of all these individual
modifications or individual changes to
the elements of that stream this is a
very very powerful pattern so in the
next tutorial we're going to look at a
few more examples and a few more use
cases where you can do all this kind of
powerful stuff with streams and lambda
expressions see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
