dependencies there are a couple of
dependencies that are like to add the
first is a request library which lets me
make REST API calls from my node.js
project you can use the HTTP API that
comes with node.js but I prefer to use
the request API because it's nicer the
second thing that I need to install is
lodash or is like to install those lor -
because we couldn't be sorting a bunch
of objects and lodash has a really cool
utility to sort those objects we've
looked at low - in the last unit the
installation procedure is going to be
very similar so I'm gonna be installing
request and no - let me go ahead and
install those libraries first I say
indian-style request the request library
and hello - and I'm gonna do - - save so
that this gets registered in hit start
JSON so I hit enter it's gonna go fetch
those libraries and my node modules
folder is created with those two
libraries and everything else that it
means and in my package dot JSON I've
got these two libraries registered now
we looked at how you can import type
definitions using the typed libraries
for us many of these popular libraries
solo - had ad types / low - turns out
there is a library for request as well
for the type definitions it is ad type
slash request so I'm gonna go ahead and
install those two if you're not sure
about the library that you're using if
it has definitions of math we can
definitely google it the ad type are the
definitely type is a github repo which
has a lot of these really cool type
definitions it's pretty comprehensive it
has a lot of type definitions for a lot
of the popular libraries so if you're
using something that's fairly popular
you should you should really likely see
the type definitions there so I'm going
to go ahead and install them the type
definitions read that is ain't human
star at types
slash
blow - and at type splash request and
these two are development time
dependencies right they're not
dependencies that need to get bundled
with the project if you're applying it
to an end user so the convention is to
do save dev so this indicates that this
is a development dependency so I'm gonna
hit enter and it's gonna fetch those two
libraries and you have this installed as
well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
