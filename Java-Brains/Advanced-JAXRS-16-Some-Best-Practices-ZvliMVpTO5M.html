best practices for building client-side
code when you're writing client code
using the jax-rs client api there are a
few things that are good to follow it's
not necessary but it helps you in the
long run so I'm just going to cover some
of those best practices the first thing
is like I mentioned before you have one
instance of a client that you use for
your requests the other thing that you
do is when you do a client target you
don't just create a target for the whole
URL what you see happening over here
which is the whole hard-coded URL there
is not good practice what you do instead
is create a base URL target that you can
add on to so consider something like
this let's say I do a client dot target
and I don't pass in the whole URL over
here what I do is I pass the base URL
which is basically the context so this
would be the base URL because this is
common for all the API is in the
messenger application so you would have
something like this prefixing all the
urls you basically separate that out and
create a web target object which is I'll
call it base target we've learned in the
previous tutorial that we need to a
client or target you get a web target
right so this is what you do first the
next thing you do is take the base web
target and add on the rest of the path
to it so if I were to see base target
dot there is a path let me spell base
target the right case here now there is
a path method to the base target which
takes in a path segment that gets added
on to this so in this case we have
messages so I'm going to pass messages
here and now this is my new target for
the messages API so I'm going to assign
it to a new local variable called
messages target okay now what this does
is it creates a target
far all my messages interactions right
so this is a base target for all web
interactions with the messenger API this
is going to be a target for all my
messages interactions now that I have
this I can add on do this right now if I
were to say I want to get a particular
message ID I could do a couple of things
one thing I could do is messages target
dot again I do a path and I pass in two
now this is going to get me a target far
the message ID tool okay and if you
wanted message ID three I got to do a
messages target dot part of three this
would work but it's kind of cumbersome
what you can do instead is something
like this now let me delete this I'm
going to say web target single message
target equals messages target dot path
and I can pass in a placeholder okay I
can pass in message ID over here
okay now this gives me a generic web
target for any message ID I can actually
plug in this message ID later if you
remember for you know the curly braces
here kind of indicate a variable portion
of the path right it happens on the
server and there is a similar convention
here on the client as well now when you
get a single message target over here in
the end what this points to is HTTP
localhost 8080 advanced jax-ur is 0 6
web api which is your route context
slash messages slash message ID variable
ok so now we can plug in this variable
portion with whatever you want so rather
than doing client dot target I do a
single message target dot and there is
the resolve template if you remember the
haterz video from the previous course
you saw something some
the same thing applies here as well
result template lets you take a template
URL diverges which could contain
variable portions and replaces it with
the actual value so here you're
resolving template you're saying
wherever you see a message ID variable
replace it with the message ID to
alright now when you do a result
template you still get a web target back
and then you do a request and you do a
get like before so that at the end what
you get is message ID - alright so let's
test this out I'm going to save this and
run this again we still get hello Jersey
the cool thing about this is you don't
have to create multiple web targets now
I can do I can create a copy of this
thing I'll say message one we call this
message two or let me flip this around
message one is the same thing with ID
one message two is the same thing with
ID 2 so you basically have a bit more
extensible way of creating disk so once
you get hold of a single message target
here over here that you prepared with a
variable you can plug in different
values here and have that executed so
I'm going to print these two now it
should return me the two messages over
here and the eco it does so this is a
recommended way of managing your target
instances in your REST API client</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
