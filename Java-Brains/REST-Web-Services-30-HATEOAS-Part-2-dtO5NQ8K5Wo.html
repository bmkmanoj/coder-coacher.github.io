create a link for the profile so the
message has an author attribute which
contains the author of the message
itself what I want to do is add another
link with the red last profile and the
link being the resource URL for the
profile resource that corresponds to
this author so in this case the author
is Kaushik so the link will be messenger
slash Web API slash profiles slash
Kaushik now how do I figure out what the
profile URL is I'm going to add another
method over here so let's say I look at
this I say get URL for URI for profile
let's say I have a method like this
right and I'm going to call this profile
what's going to be the logic for this
method added a method here now how do I
figure out what the URL for the profile
is well it turns out it's very similar
so you have the URI info and the message
instance I'm going to get the base URI
builder because I need that to start off
with and add a path segment but this
time I'm not going to send the message
resource I'm going to send here the
profile resource because I want the URI
that's mapped to the profile resource at
the class level which is slash profiles
so I get that and add it to the path
next I get the author because that's
gonna be the next part of the URI right
so I do a dot path and I pass in message
get author and then I do a dot build now
this is going to give me the URI and now
I'm going to do a URI dot to string and
there you go that should work alright
let's test this out quickly make the
call here again now you have the profile
rel attribute with the profile resource
so this should make sense basically the
path method can take in the resource
class right so you do a resource dot
class and this is going to give the path
that's annotated at the class level
pretty straightforward so far now let's
look at comments this is where things
get a bit tricky
now let's say I want to add a uri for
all the comments for this message I want
to send to the client the URI where they
can get all the comments for any given
message so once the user has a message
or presentation they can just follow
that link to get all the comments for
that message all right now I'm going to
implement this method create method okay
I'm going to copy the same code and
let's see if we can make tweaks to this
base URI builder which is fine
I'm going to call comment resource right
just like you did profile resource
there's going to be a comment resource
and we don't need the author segment
over here we remove that line and do a
dot build and we're going to return this
this should work right well
unfortunately it doesn't then I'll tell
you why we could get requests again now
look what happens just ends it Web API
what's happening here the problem is
comment resource there's a sub resource
and we look at the comment resource and
look at what's annotating the class
level it's slash right so that's what
this code is adding over here so what
happens over here is you get the base
URI builder add to the path slash which
is a common resource class level
annotation and do a dot build which is
what you get over here which is just Web
API this will not do what we need is
something similar to what Jersey does
when it maps to comment resource right
first it gets the path for the message
resource then the path for the get
comment resource method and then the
path for the comment resource here that
happens to be just slash but then you
get the idea so you need to go through
all those different levels to get the
comment resource URI how do you get that
let's try the message resource path
we know that that part is really simple
it's message resource so I'm going to
add that over here base URI builder that
get message resource it's going to give
slash messages now I need to add the
path to this method how do I get hold of
a URI that's mapped to a method well
there is a way to do that there is a
path method which takes in if you look
at a look at the signature for the path
so here's a signature which takes in two
arguments one is the resource class name
and one is the method name which has the
path annotation so this is perfect for
what we need right so I'm going to pass
in the resource class name which is
again message resource dot class AR and
caps and then the second argument is the
name of the method from which you need
to pull the path annotation so here the
name of the method is get comment
resource so I'm going to pass in that ok
now I do a dot but I could of course add
a path to the comment resource just in
case you know it's just last year but
that could change later so it doesn't
hurt to add this so this is basically
what jax-rs does right so it gets the
message resource in the class level then
at the method level and the sub resource
level into a dot build right now here's
a problem now you're getting the class
level annotation which is slash messages
that's good but now if you get the
annotation at the method level you see
here there is a variable portion here so
there is something called message ID
which maps to whatever request is coming
in now what we need here is that message
ID to be replaced with the actual ID of
the message the way to do that
replacement is using a method called
resolve template
our oil template takes in two arguments
the first argument which is a string
lets you specify what's the name of the
variable that you want to replace the
second argument specifies what's the
value you want to replace it with right
now the variable portion that you want
to replace is message-id so that's going
to be the first argument and then the
value that you want to replace it with
is message dad get ID okay so now it's
going to take this variable portion
which is message ID and replace it with
the actual ID so that you get the actual
URL for this message instance now I do a
dot build and then convert it to a
string and send it back now it should
have the actual comment let's test this
out so as link to comments Web API slash
messages / 1 / comments this looks good
let's make sure it works by making a
call to the other message gets replaced
with 2 this gets replaced with 2 we're
replacing the template right so this is
a brief overview of hey toss it's not
the most elegant way as you can see we
are doing a whole lot and it's very much
tied to the kind of classes and the kind
of methods that you have let's say you
change this method name to something
else this is not going to work right
because you're specifying the method
name here so it's not very elegant but
this is the way you can do this in pure
jax-rs
there are some other alternatives for
example instead of using this link class
that I created on my own you could use
something that comes with jax-rs
here you see a class called link in the
Java Docs
it's RS core which the description says
this is a class representing hypermedia
links this link may include additional
parameters like rel or type this looks
like it's perfect for what we want but I
found this to be a little bit
depending on which converter you are
using right right now we're using moxie
to convert from link to JSON I found
this buggy at times so it's my personal
preference to use my own custom class
which contains only the properties that
I want so that it's it's more flexible
right I can add and remove stuff that I
want but you can potentially use this
link class and use a list of this link
instances rather than your own custom
link instances so I hope this was
helpful I'll see you in the next
