be a string it can be an object so let
me actually change this to an object I'm
going to call this app data service so
it's basically some data doesn't have to
be just one so I have an inline object
over here that I populate it with a
bunch of different things so I'm going
to call the name of the app be contact
app and the author is Kaushik and the
company is Java brains and the version
is one all right
simple object and this is the value that
the app data service is going to hold
now I have changed this service so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to go to
the controllers which depend on that
service I'm going to paste that instead
so what is getting injected is the
service again but now AB that title is
going to be AB data service dot name
similarly this is going to be AB data
service top name let me refresh the page
to make sure things work yes they do
but there is another API which is very
similar to al you and it's called
constant all right so this is a way to
define a constant value in your angular
application when you know that there is
a value that's not going to change you
can use the app constant the API is
still the same you give that constant a
name and then the second argument is the
value of that constant and then again
you can use the constant by injecting it
in your controller like this right I get
this it's going to be the value that
you've declared and then you can use the
properties for instance right if you are
using a primitive it's just going to be
a primitive pretty much the same the
difference between value and constant is
really in the one scenario where you can
use a constant where you cannot use a
value and that's
the app configuration phase that's
beyond the scope of this course
so I'm not going to be covering that I
do encourage you look it up if you're
really interested in learning the
difference but for the most part you
would really know what you're going to
get when you use a constant versus a
value it's going to be this value object
or a value function or primitive that
can be dependency injected into the
controllers so I'm not going to belabor
the constant part of it but just know
that there are two different api's in
order to get this kind of an object now
the cool thing about the value and the
constant API is is that it's not just an
object you can also have a function
that's passed in so let's say I have
another function that you have another
value over here like AB dot value I'm
going to say logging service and the
value is going to be a function right
I'm going to have an inline function
here which is going to be a logging
function I'm going to log something
right so I'm going to say console dot
log hello all right so this is a value
right just like an object over here this
you change this back to value just like
you had declared an object value and
given it the name here and declaring a
function value and giving it a name
called logging service now this is also
something that can be injected in
JavaScript functions are pretty much
objects right so I can inject this over
here and I can call this since this is a
function I can call the function by
doing open close and let me do that
again here so I'm essentially calling a
value which is a function and that
function just prints console that log of
hello so let's test this out I'm going
to refresh the page and open the console
it has printed hello twice so the value
API is not just for shared data you can
also use shared functionality which is
really really</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
