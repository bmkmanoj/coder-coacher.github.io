there is this directive called ng in it
it's not really recommended in this
tutorial let me start talking about why
it isn't recommend it first of all there
is really not a lot you can do with ng
in it right so you have this directive
over here or and you can say ng in it
equals and execute some JavaScript logic
the problem is for something that's not
as trivial as what you're seeing here
our update was nine or something a
little bit more complicated it's hard to
write all that logic in the HTML right
imagine having lines in lines of
JavaScript logic over here separated by
semicolons it's going to be messy the
other thing you need to think about a
separation of concerns we always want to
separate the business logic from the
view so you don't want to have a lot of
JavaScript logic in your markup so why
would we need something like this right
why would we need to execute JavaScript
logic typically what happens is when
you're rendering your page you would
want to execute some business service or
some business logic to get the data
before you render the view in this case
look at the simplistic example we have
this R of the equals nine so there is
some data gathering step there is a step
which prepares the data and then there
is a view which renders that data so
there is always in most of the
applications 99% of the time there would
be some business logic some data
processing that happens and after the
data processing happens that's when the
view gets rendered and we talked about
how this is traditionally handled using
a pattern call and we say it's the Model
View and the controller so we have the
controller which does all the business
processing and the data which is the
model then the view which reads from
that model and then renders it right so
we need to do something similar we don't
want to have business processing logic
all the controller logic in ng in it so
imagine if you have some arbitrary
JavaScript logic that you want to
execute before the view loads alright so
let me add this script bag over here at
the end of the body tag
that I want to execute then the page
loads
now this is obviously a very simple
console that log statement but assume
there are some business logic to be
executed here and this is initialization
logic but you want to do something like
ng in it but rather than have a
hard-coded statement here you want to
execute a function so the way to do this
in angular is by using another directive
call ng-controller right so I'm going to
get a tip over here let me wrap this
whole thing in a div and you will know
why I'm doing this in a bit so basically
have these statements wrapped inside
this step now I can use a directive that
comes with angular called ng-controller
to execute controller functions to
execute functions that contain this
business logic which is the C of the MVC
right any processing that needs to be
done before the view needs to render and
the way to do this is by doing something
like this ng - controller equals and
then I give it a function name so by
doing something like this what we're
asking angular to do is we are saying
hey angular I have this controller
called main I want you to execute it
before you render this view right so
this ng controller is annotated to this
still so before angular renders visited
it's going to make sure it's calling
this main method write angular finds
this main method to execute it whatever
business logic there is and then it's
going to render this div so if you need
some data for rendering the div you can
put this in the controller method and
then I access it in the view to render
to the user alright so this is at a high
level the purpose of ng-controller you
want to execute a controller function
before rendering a view let me however
tell you that the code that you're
seeing on the screen right now will not
work it used to work before in the
earlier versions of angular I believe it
worked till angular 1.1 and it stopped
working from an angular 1.2 onwards so
this is not recommended
I would say it doesn't even work so you
know it's far from recommended the
reason why they kind of made this not
work is that they kind of enforce the
convention about what a controller
method is right you don't want to have
ng-controller point to a global function
so what's mean over here it's a global
function that's what I did right I
create a global function and I said
ng-controller equals that global
function this is not a good idea having
global functions is not recommended well
I think in programming having a global
anything is not recommended but in this
case global functions are problem
because a you are going to end up with a
lot of global functions and it's going
to be a mess secondly the angular
recommended view of doing things is to
kind of register a function as a
controller if you're using ng controller
and you're pointing it to any method you
want to tell angular beforehand that
this is a controller method so not only
do you have to write this function name
you also have to register it with
angular you have to say hey angular I've
created with this function called mean I
want this to be used as a controller and
then angular is going to say okay I got
it at register this is a controller and
then you go ahead and use ng controller
equals and you give that function name
and angular is going to say okay got it
you've already registered this now I'm
going to execute it right so there is
this extra step required to create a
function and register it before using it
in ng-controller right let's talk about
how to register a function as a
controller in angular</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
