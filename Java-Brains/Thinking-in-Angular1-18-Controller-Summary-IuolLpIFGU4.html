global place for creating registering
and retrieving angular modules a module
like I mentioned is like a phone book
it's a collection of directives
components controllers and other stuff
let's look at what the other stuff is a
bit later right now we know that there
are certain things in angular that we've
used and already familiar with we are
familiar with directives and now we are
familiar with controllers just a bit of
executing functions so you register all
these things you register directives and
controllers in the module and the way to
create a module is using the syntax bar
your variable name equals angular dot
module and you give it two arguments the
first argument is the name of your
module the second argument is an MD
array here again angular is a global
object that you get by adding the
angular script and of course the square
bracket the empty square brackets which
is an empty array is super important
we'll cover what that is and by me
needed a little bit later but for now
when you're creating them what you'll
just make sure your second argument is
always an empty array once you've
created a module like this you need to
be able to use it in your HTML so here
i'm using the name my module in the code
example we created a module called my
app the name here doesn't matter what
matters is whatever name you use in your
create module code you've got to use
that in ng add write whatever name you
have over here should be the same name
here when you are having an ng app this
is what ties these two things for
angular alright so now that you have
created a module you need to register
your controllers right now module is
like a collection of things so anything
that you want to use has to be
registered with the controller so the
beta register it is by doing something
like this so let's say you have a main
function which has a simple console log
log statement now you have an angular
module created by using this syntax then
you register it by doing the module
object dot controller and then you pass
in two arguments first the name of the
controller
second is the name of the function you
got to remember here that you're
registering the control
in the module not with angular ready use
the angular object just to get a module
to prepare a new module using the
angular module now that you have this
module object you're going to register
things to this module object not too
angular
so we have my module that controller you
pass in these two arguments all right so
now that you've created this thing
you've registered your controller next
you use it by using ng - controller and
the value of n G - controller attribute
will be the name of the controller that
you've registered it as again notice
it's not the name of the function name
of the function could be anything what
you're registering here there is a name
of the controller so it here it's
registered as main controller so you
just use main controller over here the
my module should be same as this my
module here this name should be same as
this name and then this name for the
controller should be same as this name</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
