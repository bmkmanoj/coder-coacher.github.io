developing restful api s but jax-rs
my name is Kasia cata go and in this
course I'll teach you how to write
restful web service applications using
the jax-rs technology to learn how to
write restful api is a restful services
using jax-rs
you will essentially need to learn two
things first you'll need to learn about
restful api itself and secondly you need
to learn how to actually implement them
using jax-rs accordingly this course is
split into two important sections the
first few tutorials of this course
introduce you to restful web services it
explains the concepts and the best
practices there are a few standard
things to keep in mind when building
restful web services you'll learn about
them first I'll also walk you through
developing a restful api for a sample
application we'll build a simple social
media messaging application throughout
this course so this application will
have some of the basic functionalities
are similar sites like Facebook or
Google+ nothing too complex but this
should be enough to get us started on
exploring all the different
possibilities when it comes to API
design and implementation now after
learning concepts we'll implement some
of these features of our social media
messaging restful web service using
jax-rs well that features as we go as we
learn more about jax-rs itself and we'll
write code to implement those features
restful web services have recently grown
in popularity I think that was a great
time to learn about them and work on
them I hope you are excited to get
started
so let's start with web services so what
are web services web services are
services that are exposed to the
Internet for programmatic access their
online API is that you can call from
your code so think about this when you
call any bi when writing java code you
basically add the jars or the class was
to your class path everything executes
inside a single
in a single environment in the case of
web services however you have different
pieces of code deployed in different
machines and they call methods of each
other over the network you must have
seen different Facebook or Twitter apps
you must have seen games which can post
to your Facebook wall even though those
games are not designed by Facebook
themselves how can they do that how can
they post to a wall off a completely
different system a completely different
application they do this by calling
online api's companies like Facebook or
Twitter they publish web services that
let other developers call them from
their code so other application
developers can actually write code to
consume these services and they can post
things on Facebook or Twitter they can
read or access data from Facebook or
Twitter using the API so the web
services that Facebook or Twitter have
provided in a way they're similar to web
pages you see Twitter as a website at
twitter.com when you access Twitter or
come on your browser you get an HTML
response that lets you read and write
tweets they have some HTML elements for
the data and they also have all the
styling and CSS this is because that web
page that you see is meant for human
consumption they know that there's
actually a human being who was behind a
browser on a laptop or a device was
reading those tweets so they want to
make sure it's formatted properly so
that it's easy to access but Twitter
also has this other URL called
API tour twitter.com it is a lot of the
same things as twitter.com but it
behaves a bit differently
for instance this API dot twitter.com
gives you response which does not have
HTML or CSS it contains data but it is
returned in an XML or JSON format it's
bare-bones data and there are specific
URLs for different operations
this is what the developers can use from
their code to read or write data to
Twitter since it deals with just the
bare bones data it's actually very easy
for the developers to actually parse the
data and then convert it into their
objects in their code their data
structures so that they can use it later
no need for all the fancy HTML and CSS
in this case right so this is what
they'll be learning in this course so
this is what will people in the online
API part of it of course there are many
ways in which you can build such online
aps or web services one way to build
them as using restful api switch is what
we're going to be learning in this
course restful that service is a restful
api is are a type of web services that
are modern they're lightweight and they
use a lot of concepts behind HTTP which
is as you know the technology that
drives the Bell there is another type of
web services that you can choose to
write your services in and that's called
soap web services there is a separate
Java brain scores on soap web services
in the link provided in the description
but this course is going to be only
about rest let's talk about web service
characteristics when you talk about web
services in general there are a few
characteristics about them that we have
to keep in mind first they're all web
services so the exchange of data happens
over the web or HTTP the client sends an
HTTP request and the server returns back
an HTTP response in this way they are
very similar to websites like we discuss
but instead of the response being
complete web pages with all the
formatting and the styling only the data
has returned because the client is a
program and it's not a human being so it
doesn't need all the formatting the
client could then have its own logic to
present the data to the users in a
presentable form right this could still
have the formatting there could still be
a human being who consumes the clients
product but the exchange between the web
service client and the web service
server is usually bare-bones data the
next characteristic of
web-services as the protocol used now
what is a protocol but a web service
client makes a request to the web
service endpoint
there are usually messages that are
transmitted from one machine to another
right the client makes a request it
sends a message to the server and the
server makes a response it returns a
response and that message is sent back
to the client
so these messages need to be in a format
that both the client and the server can
understand obviously but this format is
sometimes referred to as the protocol so
this protocol is sometimes standardized
and some web services for example the
sort web service uses a standard
protocol for all these communications
which is the soap so soap stands for
simple object access protocol well do
used to stand for that and the name is
now discontinued but you're stuck with
the acronym but that's what it is
right so Web Services use the soap
protocol so this is a specific format of
messages right in the soap web service
world so there are you know the messages
are in an XML format and there are
specific rules which detail how that XML
should be write the client and the
server needs to talk to each other using
the soap protocol only in the case of
soap web services now what's the
protocol in the case of breast there's
none a rest client can send messages
using XML or it can send messages using
JSON or text format or any of the new
format as long as the climb and the
server understand each other they're
happy there are no rules let's look at
the next characteristic how the
communication happens we saw that
restful Web Services our web services
that means that the request and the
response is happening over the web right
there always exchange almost always
exchange over HTTP
but in HTTP there are different methods
that are available you're the world off
the get method the post method the put
method on and so on
now what methods would you need to use
to exchange data between the client in
the server we know that it's HTTP
but what is the method that we need to
use what's the standard there in the
case of rest the answer is there is none
messages can be exchanged in any HTTP
method or all HTTP methods there are
some guidelines which tell you when
you're designing your API or your web
service what method to choose depending
on what the operation is but there is no
rule as such you can pick any method
actually let's look at the next
characteristic service definition so
what service definition when you're
coding in Java and you need to call a
method of a library class you need to
know certain things about that library
you need to know the name of the class
you need to know what's the methods that
are available need to know what's the
input arguments you need to know what
the return type is so you need to know a
little bit about the API right you need
to know about the library about the jar
that you're using in the web service
world a similar concept applies right
you're making a call to a web service
you need to know what that web service
does right you need to know what's the
operation what's the input argument
what's the return type similar stuff so
this is typically referred to as service
definition right it's a definition about
the service in the soap web service
world the service definition is
typically called by a name Vistal WSDL
right it's a document which defines what
the web service does right it has all
the details it has what are the methods
with the return type input arguments
output all that stuff and this document
is made available to all clients so when
a client gets all of this Vistal they
have all the information they would ever
need about the soap web service right so
that's the standard document in the case
of soap web services now what's the
standard in the case of rest you might
have guessed the answer now yes there is
not most web services most restful web
services have little to no documentation
and if they have documentation it's very
likely in
a format that we read from right human
beings can treat from there'll be a you
know a webpage listing what it what the
operations are and things like that so
there'll be it's common to have restful
web services with little to no
documentation and in fact the best
designed restful web services wouldn't
even need any documentation this is a
topic of a much later tutorial we're
gonna get there but for now consider
that there is no such formal service
definition available in the restful web
service well there is something called
body
Wado which is kind of an equivalent of
the best deal in the soap web service
world but Vatel didn't really catch on
you don't have a lot of users using are
implementing viable I have been using
restful Web Services for quite some time
now and I still haven't encountered you
know having do swag to do something
right it's not that popular so there are
no standards as such in there are school
that service world okay so I could go on
with this discussion but let me stop
here for a bit you might have gotten the
idea you're probably wondering is it
really true there is there are no rules
and the swih web service were right
there's no protocol standard there's no
communication channel standard there's
no service definition standard does the
restful web services have any rules at
all do you even have to read up anything
to define and build a restful web
service could my grandmother have built
a restful web service but based on what
we've seen so far
anything goes there are no rules how is
it possible in contrast a soap web
service have strict rules defining each
and every characteristic that we have
seen so what's going on here well the
reason for this is actually very simple
all its soap web services follow this
thing called the soap specification
what's a specification a specification
is basically a set of rules that dictate
what something should be right so there
is a soap web service specification
which is a set of rules
that dictate what every suburb service
should be it was actually designed by a
committee and it's actually still being
maintained by a committee write the
specification these are all the rules
including the rules that we've just
discussed and much more if a soap web
service does not follow even one of
these rules that's by definition not of
soap web service at all as simple as
that right there are a bunch of rules
which every soap web servers have to
follow and if it doesn't follow any one
of these rules that's it it's not a soap
web service right restful web services
on the other hand do not have any
specification it's a concept it's an
idea there is no specification no
committee to tell you what's right and
what's wrong
the term rest was introduced by a guy
named Roy feeling and has doctoral
theses way back in the year 2000 rest
actually stands for representational
state transfer and actually it's not
about web service at all
representational state transfer is
actually an architecture style let's say
you're working on an architecture of a
new application there are certain
decisions you need to take there's
certain choices you have to make certain
criteria you have to think about rest
consist of a coordinated set of these
criteria and constraints that you can
use to guide you in your application
architecture it's a set of guidelines
that work well together it's a style of
architecture you can use the style of
architecture for any application however
if you apply the style and these
guidelines when architecting our web
service you have drumroll restful web
services and therein lies the difference
and like soap web services where a
committee tells what we should be doing
in the restful web service world you
don't have any strict rule books to
follow right you can actually have a
spectrum it's common to hear some people
say that some web services are
completely restful and some web services
are not fully restful really I'm not
kidding
and the goal when building restful web
services has to make it as restful as
practically possible okay so there are
no strict rules these are guidelines and
we tried to follow as many of these
guidelines as possible but the main
factor you need to think about when
designing the rest api is to make it
easy for your consumers this is a topic
that we're going to revisit again and
again when we're designing an API but
this is really important since we don't
have a specification since we don't have
a rulebook
the idea is to make it easy for the
consumers easy for your clients as well
as easy for you to maintain your web
sellers in the next tutorials we'll
start learning more about these
constraints and understand what good
restful web services look like and why
