environment to create the spring boot
apllication the first thing that you're
going to need is the Java SDK assume
you're all Java developers who are
taking this course you already have some
Java SDK installed on your machine
already but if not you need to have Java
eight installed for this course
so go ahead to the Oracle website and
download the java 8 jdk if you don't
have it already and when you're done you
should be able to open the command
prompt and go a java - version and you
should be able to see the Java version
1.8 it's also helpful to make sure that
the Java home is set so if I were to do
it a cold Dollar Java underscore home it
should print out the Java home path of
course you can verify this on Windows by
going to the environment variables and
making sure to the Java home environment
variable is set to where you install the
JDK the idea of choice for this course
is going to be spring to speed right
that's what I'm going to be using you
can probably follow along with a
different ID but I'm going to be using
spring - sweet spring - oh sweet is a
flavor of Eclipse which has been tweaked
to work with spring applications it has
some spring specific features at this
point of M I'm not sure if you're going
to be using a lot of these spring
specific features in the spring STS but
by default when I'm working on a spring
application I end up choosing this
spring STS ID so that if I were to use
it it's there and available for me in
order to install the spring to suite hit
the spring dot IO website which is the
official website for spring buy pivotal
and scroll down till you see a link
called a spring tool suite learn more
about STS all right so here you have an
option of downloading the STS here since
I'm on a Mac it's giving me an option
for downloading for the Mac but you have
other versions that you can choose from
as well
so download this and install it on your
machine this is very similar to an
Eclipse installation and as you can see
these versions are based off of Eclipse
versions themselves so go ahead and
install it and once you've installed it
of the ID looks like now here we can
create our new projects pretty much like
you can do with Eclipse and this is
where we going to be creating our spring
boot project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
