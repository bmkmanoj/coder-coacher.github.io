advance Jax Alice they've learned a lot
in this course let's quickly recap so we
first started by looking at a container
agnostic way of setting up a jax-rs
application we looked at the application
class and we learned how it's a better
way to bootstrap your jax-rs application
when compared to the Jersey servlet that
can be used for a sublet container
environment we learn why the application
class was better we also looked at the
resource lifecycle we looked at how a
resource is for a request if you also
don't have to make it a singleton so
that it's one instance for the duration
of the applications life we then looked
at writing custom parameters we learned
what param converters are and we wrote
our own custom param converters for
handling a custom data type we also
learn about message party readers and
message body writers we wrote a custom
message body writer to do a conversion
from our custom data type to text output
we also learn how to create our own
custom media type he also wrote our own
custom message body writer for our
custom media type so that the response
gets processed now then we move to the
client side we wrote our own jax-rs
client we made get and post requests we
learnt about the fluent API that the
jax-rs client had we learned some best
practices for making these requests if
you also learn about the tricky generic
type handling on the client we learn how
to handle responses which are generic
types we then implemented filters we
learn what filters were what they are
supposed to do how we can use it we
built a couple of filters we used it to
build REST API authentication we
understood what are the different
options we have for SDP authentication
and we implemented basic art using a
filter then we also learned at a high
level what interceptors are we looked at
the request response flow between the
client and the server
we saw what are the different elements
in place be it filters interceptors
message body readers and message body
writers we looked at what the flow is
and what the order of these different
elements are
and then we also briefly looked at how
EJ B's can work with our jax-rs
resources well that's quite a list but
then again there's so much more to
jax-rs
I encourage you to look at the Java Docs
and also some of the user manuals for
jacksters frameworks for example Jersey
has really could use a guide which
covers a lot of the jax-rs concepts
it also has framework specific concepts
which are Jersey only you should be
careful about learning and implementing
those concepts because if you were to
switch your jax-rs provider to something
that's not Jersey those things would
break but as long as you're restricting
your API usage to Jack service you know
that user guide is pretty good so I
encourage you to do some more research
and learn about a lot of the other
features if you've not covered in this
course but for the topics that we did
cover I hope you found them useful good
luck and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
