the MVC pattern is in this tutorial
we'll create a web application that
implements the MVC pattern the use case
that we have is a simple login
application so we'll have a login page
and we'll ask the user to enter the user
ID in the password once user submits the
user ID and password we will
authenticate the credentials and if the
credentials are authenticated
successfully then we show a greeting
page for the user and if the credentials
are not authenticated successfully then
we redirect back to the login page so
it's a very simple use case but this
will give us an opportunity to use the
MVC pattern to implement this so let's
think of the components we'll have to
write for implementing this use case so
we'll need a controller a business
service model and a view so let's start
with the controller we know that the
controller is actually a servlet in our
case so we will have to implement a
servlet
now when the request for a login is
initiated the user ID and password is
passed on now we need a controller or a
servlet to intercept this request and
collect the user ID and the password so
we will have to implement the login
servlet now this servlet will capture
the user ID and the password and after
that it does not do the authentication
itself it has to pass this on to a
business service remember a waiter does
not know how to cook so the business
service will be an authentication
service it's a simple Java Bean and it
will have a method for authenticating
the user now after the business service
transits method and returns a response
that response has to be contained in
some value it could be a primitive could
be as simple as a boolean yes or no or
it could have more information it could
be a separate Java class so we will
implement a module which will contain
this information that will be the
authentication result
and once we have this authentication
result the controller which is a login
servlet in this case has to direct the
control to the corresponding view now if
the authentication result says that
indication was successful then the
controller has to directly flow to the
success message page and if that
indication result is a failure then the
controller has to redirect to the login
page
so as far as the view is concerned we
see two pages here - the login page and
one is the greetings page so we will be
implementing these two pages so these
are the components that we need to
implement a simple login functionality
as we have planned so let's let's go
ahead and start implementing these so
I'll start off with a new project right
click new project and I will create a
dynamic web project I'll call this the
login app I will leave this as the
default or the generator web dot XML and
finish okay now eclipse has created this
project for us so let's create these
modules in the order in which a user
would actually access them so what would
be the first step the user sees the
login page so let's implement the login
page first so I'll right click new and
I'll create a new JSP file I'll call
this login dot JSP default should do I
have a black template let me change the
title
to login page now the body will be very
simple just have two text boxes one for
the username and one for the password
then submit button of course all these
three will be inside a form tag call
this form I need to have an action here
action equals let me put this is blank
for now we will have to fill this up
with our controller servlet which will
handle this login form now the method
I'll specify it as post if I do not give
a method here it will automatically
default to the get method and the get
method will not do for a login form
because that would mean that whatever
parameters we pass which is the user ID
and the password will be visible in the
URL so since we are doing a login action
we need to have that secured so we'll
have a post method and we'll submit
these parameters using a post method
okay now inside the login form we need
to have two text boxes let's call this
text box user ID I need to give this a
name so that the parameter will be
passed with this name to our servlet
type equals password this is our
password text box if we add a type
equals password then HTML will actually
the generated HTML will actually have a
password text box and it will hide the
entries
name equals password and these are our
two text boxes that also have a simple
submit button and this is our login page
let's save this and let me try running
this just to make sure that it works
fine
okay our login page is working fine in
fact with me add caption here so that
it's more user-friendly
there is much better now we have a login
page so we need to next create a servlet
that captures these parameters and we
need to have a do post method of that
servlet and we need to capture the user
ID and the password in that do post
method so let me create a servlet new
servlet I'll call this class as login
sublet it will of course extend HTTP
servlet class now I don't need to give
any description initialization
parameters we leave this blank for now I
don't want to inch lies anything URL
mappings let me make this something more
easier instead of login sublet I'll just
call this login okay next I don't need
the Constructors I don't need to get I
just need to do post because in our form
we are doing a post so just click that
and finish okay our login sublet is
created and we have a do post now in our
do post we need to capture these values
so first of all these values have to be
submitted to our login sublet we know
that the context the bath for the login
cell that is login so let me set
this form to the action should be login
so that whatever we submit here goes to
the sublet let's save this now we need
to code here move this to do now what do
we do the first thing we do is get the
request parameters so I will declare two
strings request circuit parameter the
value here should be same as the name of
the text box here so this control the
value of that control gets captured here
so I will use the same value similarly
for password
okay now we have the user ID and the
password captured here as two strings
inside the do post method now we need to
have a business service so that this do
post method will pass this user ID and
this password do that business service
and the business service will take care
of authenticating and checking if this
password is correct for this user ID so
let's create a business service here the
business service will just be a simple
Java class say new class and have the
package I will create a new package for
service then inside that I will create a
login service and finish ok now in this
login service we'll implement a method
called authenticate so create a public
boolean authenticate now this will take
two string parameters okay so in a
typical web application what would
happen here is that this authenticate
method would connect to our database
where we have stored the user ID and
passwords of all the users in the of the
application and it will pull up the
password for this user ID or compare the
user ID in the password with what's
stored in the database to make sure that
the authentication is done but in our
example we will not be implementing this
because our focus is on MVC we can have
you know a database table and make a
JDBC connection over here and validate
this but for now just to have this
method working I'll implement a dummy
method so what I'm thinking of doing
here is to check if these are is the
password is null what not okay if the
password is null or if the password
contains only blank spaces and no actual
characters then I will say
authentication is false ID you know it
fails the authentication but as long as
a password is not null in it as some
characters in it then I will make the
authentication successful again this is
just a dummy implementation but it
should serve our purpose of having a
sample business service that we can use
so what I will do here is I will just
compare the password to null now if
password is not equal to null let me
make this password equal to null if the
password is null or
if you trim the password and it ends up
being you know a password with all
spaces without any characters then what
I will do is I will return false if it's
not
then I will return true again this is
just a dummy method that we implementing
we are not bothered about getting this
from the database but we could do that
and if we have the database table they
we have the user ID and the password
this will be the place where you would
actually do the authentication so let me
save this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
