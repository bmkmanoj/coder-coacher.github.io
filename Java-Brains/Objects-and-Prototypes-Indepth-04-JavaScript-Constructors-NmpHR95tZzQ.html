objects using functions is fairly common
in JavaScript so the language provides a
shortcut to let you write functions that
create objects this is a feature in
JavaScript these functions are called
constructor functions you might be
familiar with the concept of
constructors and other programming
languages constructors are basically
functions which let you populate the
object that you need to create every
time you need to create a new object you
use some kind of a new keyword and call
a function and that function prepares
the object gets everything ready and
then returns the provide object to you
right JavaScript has a similar concept
but it's it has its own nuances let's
cover that so think of a function like
this which creates an object right
you've written this function to
initialize an empty object and then
populate everything you need to populate
on that object and then you return the
object that you initialize over here so
if I were to tell you that there are
like a hundred different functions like
this in your code right so there is one
create employee object will create
Department object create accountants
object there's so many objects that you
could create and let's say you're using
this format this kind of a function to
create those objects if I were to ask
you what is the common thing in all
these different functions what would you
say it is what are the common lines of
code that you can be sure exists in all
those different functions that create
objects but if you think about it you
will see that the first line and the
last line are more or less common when
you're creating an object when you're
writing a function that creates an
object the first line would be creating
an empty object and the last line would
be returning the object that you create
so between these two lines there is a
bunch of lines that you would have to
write to populate that object according
to what you're trying to do in this case
is an employee object so you're
populating the employee details if
you're creating a function or enough
accreting and department object then
this would be the department details
right so you would have to populate the
object that you create over here but
essentially the first line which
initializes an empty object and the last
line which returns that object after all
the population has been done so these
two lines are more or less common across
all functions that serve the purpose of
creating objects right so JavaScript has
created
shortcut which lets you not have to
write these lines when you're creating
functions that create objects all right
so these two lines can easily be skipped
it's basically JavaScript saying hey
when you're writing a function that
needs to create objects these two lines
are mandatory you have to write them so
I might as well give you a feature which
skips those lines and hey you developer
if you want you can use it right so
there is a way you can skip those two
lines so the way to do this is by
calling this function in app instructor
mode okay you need to basically tell
JavaScript hey this is not an ordinary
function this is a function that I'm
using to create objects okay so I need
to say hey this is a constructor
function the way to tell JavaScript that
the function that you're calling is of
constructor function is by adding a new
keyword in front of it okay so when you
say new space and then do a function
call you're basically saying hey
JavaScript I am making this function
call because I want it to behave like a
constructor I'm using it to create an
object okay so this new keyword gives an
indication to JavaScript that this
function actually it results in a new
object being created all right so once
you do this javascript is going to say
okay I got it
you are creating an object over here and
I know that these two lines of code are
mandatory so I'm going to take care of
them you don't worry about it don't
write this line and don't write this
line right just populate the object I'm
going to create that object in the
beginning and I'm going to return that
object for you after you are done all
right so this is what JavaScript does so
you basically let me put this back for
now but basically that's what the new
keyword says to JavaScript you're saying
I want to call this function as a
constructor
notice that this new is kind of
different from the way you would
traditionally think of the new keyword
in languages like C++ and Java when you
say new something in some of those
languages the thing that follows the new
keyword is actually the name of the
class all right so you say new employee
in Java you basically mean I want to
create a new instance of a class
called my right the word that follows
the new keyword has to be the name for
class but that's not true in the case of
JavaScript because JavaScript does not
have classes what follows the new
keyword is a function plain and simple
that's all we have in JavaScript think
that the new keyword does is it
basically switches it to a construction
mode and this enables JavaScript to let
you do a shortcut a little a ittle
Nate's the first line and the last line
all right so what JavaScript does is the
interpreter does is it makes this new
object that it created over here
available to you using a variable a
keyword called this okay so you don't
access using new object because
JavaScript doesn't know what new object
is it actually created this object using
this so it's equal into JavaScript
adding this line of code at the very
beginning okay so and then at the end it
returns that this object okay so this is
basically the two lines of code the
JavaScript is going to do for you before
the function executes and after the
function is done all right so this is
what happens when you use the new
keyword now between these two lines is
your chance to populate the object
that's assigned to variable this all you
need to do is rather than use the
variable new object which doesn't exist
anymore I'm just going to use the
variable this which is what JavaScript
created now I'm going to add this to
every assignment all right and now bend
JavaScript returns this you basically
have an object with all these things
populated all right so this neo keyword
saved you two lines of code okay this
doesn't seem like a lot but I will tell
you how this is helpful later the idea
because javascript is taking care of
these two lines and it's also using a
standard variable name called this in
order to create that object and assign
it so that you can access it in your
code now let me clear this out and
reload and run and now if I access a mp3
I'm still going to get back that object
because it's exactly the same as what I
did before right I used I use new edge
over here and this wasn't coming to that
obviously and I was returning it myself
but now since I'm using the new keyword
javascript is doing that for me and it's
using a standard variable so that I can
write code using that variable
so hopefully the difference between
these two approaches makes sense the
thing is these two are very close with
of minor difference so if this is very
confusing don't worry too much about it
in the next video I'm going to give an
example of these two approaches and I'm
going to contrast the two so you just
cannot not get so see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
