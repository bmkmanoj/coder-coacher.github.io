but it doesn't do anything you can give
it any request you want and it just
throws an adder page what we want to do
is be able to handle certain requests
right you can have a specific request
and say ok given this request I want
this piece of code to execute on the
sublet container how do you do that you
do that by adding a controller in spring
a controller is basically a Java class
that has certain annotations marked in
it
this annotations lets spring know what
is the URL that you are mapping it to
and what should happen when the request
comes to that URL so there are two
pieces of information that spring needs
to know and you're providing both of
them in the class itself and the
annotation of that class so this is what
we're going to be doing we're going to
create a class which acts as a
controller right how does it act as a
controller you're going to mark it with
annotations these annotations are going
to mark that as a controller and it also
provides this information about what URL
access needs to trigger that controller
to execute and then secondly we're going
to write the method that needs to
execute when that is triggered right
when URL is called this is the method
that needs to run we can write the
method and we can annotate it so that it
maps to our URL so let's do that next
let's say I have a URL like this
localhost 8080 slash hello when I access
this URL it's going to give me the same
edit page again but what I'm going to do
is have some kind of a valid response
and wanted to say hi and I say hello I
want the app to say hi back to me so
let's build that in this tutorial what
does it was is creating something called
a controller the web layer in a
Springwood application leverages a
spring framework called spring MVC
alright spring MVC is a child project of
the whole Spring Framework umbrella and
what it does is lets you build
server-side code which maps to URLs and
provides responses you can have the
response PRS sleep a response in which
case the sister JSON or it can be a full
HTML page you can have a request map to
a you know a JSP or an FTL response and
have a full HTML page return in our case
you're going to be building a
stay P I so we want the response to be
just a simple JSON in this case actually
just a simple string when I say
localhost:8080 / hello I want the
response to be a simple string it says
hi I'm going to start by creating a new
class in SRC me in Java and I'm going to
call this hello controller and I'm going
to put this in the package called hello
you can explain why I use this package
in a little bit but the controller is
hello controller and the purpose of this
controller is to map to a URL request
add / hello and we're done hi so I'm
going to click finish
and this is going to be an MD Java class
now this is supposed to be a spring
controller and like I told you the way
to make these spring entities have a
particular meaning is by annotating them
so that's the Spring Framework knows
that this is meant to be a controller
and in this particular case we want
hello controller to be a rest controller
so turns out there is an annotation in
this spring framework called add rest
controller and this is the annotation
that you need to put on any class in
order to make the class a rest
controller this annotation is from
spring MVC certified thread to the
import now here you see it says the
importers from arc Spring Framework web
which means that this is a spring MVC
annotation so this annotation marks this
is a rest controller and this is what
you have to do any time you're building
a controller you're building a rest
controller just create a simple java
class and add this annotation called
address controller and this becomes a
rest controller in spring what does it
mean what is a class being a rest
controller mean it means that you can
have methods in here in this class which
map to URL requests right you can have a
request map to a particular method so
that this method executes then the user
makes a request to that URL okay so
let's say I have a simple method here
which is public string say hi
because is what we want to do we want to
have a response which just says hi so I
returned the word hi now this method
needs to be executed when the user makes
a request to slash hello we've already
seen that how do I tell the Spring
Framework that this method needs to be
called when the slash hello URL is
accessed you want to have some kind of a
request mapping to this method when a
request is made and turns out the way to
do this is by another annotation and the
annotation is called at request mapping
now at request mapping is another spring
MVC annotation again from arc Spring
Framework web so you import that now
this request mapping takes in a
parameter which is the URL that this
method needs to map to so in this case
it's slash hello now this line this
annotation tells the Spring Framework
that whenever there is a request an HTTP
request to this application at the URL
slash hello you want this method to be
executed and this return value be
returned back ok there are there's no
HTTP method over here is it applicable
for all HTTP methods what if I make a
get request or a post requests or a put
request well turns out this way of
mapping is only for a get right because
that's the default method if you want to
map other methods then you have to
explicitly mention it but in this case
since we are doing a get request this is
all that it takes okay so you're
basically having two annotations in this
class one is the rest controller to mark
the class itself as a rest controller it
basically says hey spring this is a
class that deals with providing HTTP
responses to HTTP requests which are
rest requests and rest responses and
then the second annotation is this a
trip is mapping which says hey spring
whenever there is a request to slash
hello just execute this method and
whatever either done just return it back
ok so that's what this class does so now
that I have put this class in here how
do I plug this into the spring framework
well
you don't have to do anything because
the very fact of you putting this class
in the class path means that the Spring
Framework scans it and it knows that
this is what needs to happen when the
Spring Framework starts up it basically
does a class path scan I remember I
talked about that so when the class
paths cap happens what it's doing is
basically looking at all these classes
and seeing if there are annotations like
these that finds an annotation it
registers it so in this case spring when
it starts up finds this class and it
finds that this class has two
annotations one is the rest controller
it says okay I got this
the rest controller and then it finds
this annotation which is okay I got it
whenever there's a request I need to
remember to call this method so it
registers it and then the application is
started up when the actual request comes
in say slash hello spring looks at its
notes and says okay this is the method
that I need to call execute it and then
takes the return and returns it back
right so you don't have to do anything
else so I'm going to click the play
button so that the starts up and now if
I access this URL I'm going to get hi
back so what spring does is it executes
the method and puts in the return value
as the response so this is all you had
to do to create a controller
what we did was map a request to a
response in spring boot using the spring
MVC annotations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
