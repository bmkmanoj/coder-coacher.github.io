angular application and we had some
basic dynamic functionality on the
client-side I don't call it dynamic but
basically we did ask angular to do
something on the client-side be asked
angular to hide this paragraph and
angular or even though the paragraph
existed in the page angular was able to
remove it because of this ngf so we use
ng app to declare this as an angular
application and we used ng F to make
this conditional but if you think about
it this is not exactly conditional it's
conditional upon a hard-coded false
value so this is always going to be
false in this paragraph is always going
to not show up what we would like to do
is have this be influenced by a variable
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create a variable called time of day and
we'll initialize it to a hard-coded time
of day for now and then depending on
that time of day I'm gonna either show
good morning are not show good morning
let's look at the other good evenings
and the good afternoons a bit later but
for now this app is going to have an
initialized time of day variable let's
call it R of day right so it will
initialize to a particular R of the day
and if the R of the day is less than 12
it's going to say good morning if it's
more than 12 it's not gonna say good
morning right so that's simple
requirement now I need to do a couple of
things first I need to create a variable
and assign it to a value I'm just going
to hard-code the value from now and then
the second thing is I need to update
this condition to compare that value
with 12 and if it's less than 12 only
then have this paragraph in there so
first step how do I create a new
variable an initializer to a value the
way to initialize any such kind of a
variable there are actually multiple
ways to initialize variables like this
but one way to do it is by using another
directive call ng in it true to its name
ng in it lets you in it something all
right so I'm going to create an NG init
directive and I can put it anywhere over
here a bow but I'll just use the body
tag for it I say ng in it equals and
then within these quotes I
initialize available now I'm going to
initialize our update variable and I'm
going to set the value to 10 so it's
10:00 a.m. all right so I'm hard coding
this value
notice the out of day is always going to
be 10 outputting is fine for now we'll
make it a bit dynamic later but this is
what I'm doing using ng in it I'm
initializing this variable to value 10
you might ask me well have I declared
this variable where is this out of day
coming from and declared this yet
I'm just assigning the value directly
well that turns out is perfectly fine in
angular when you use a variable than
angular like this and assign it a value
angular actually creates that variable
where it creates that I'm going to talk
about a bit later but assume that this
variable is created and the value 10 is
assigned to it all right so this is ng
in it it lets you initialize stuff it
lets you run this kind of arbitrary
logic to initialize something and this
variable can now be used in other places
in the code now the place that I want to
use R of T is inside ng F now I need to
use a condition to check of out of T is
less than 10 so I'm going to say R of T
less than 10 inside this ng F right so
this paragraph shows up if our of days
less than 10 right so this condition
should evaluate to true if let me
actually change this to 12 because
that's what I was looking for alright so
if our F day is less than 12 ng if
evaluates to true and this paragraph tag
is shown if I'd of day is greater than
12 and GF evaluates to false right out
of take less than 12 this expression is
going to turn to false in this paragraph
tag will not be shown because it's
equivalent of saying in DF equals false
so let me save this and execute this I'm
going to refresh it shows good morning
because R of day equals 10 and 10 is
less than 12 if I were to change the
slits as I say change this to 2 p.m. by
changing out of day to 14 and now out of
days 14 here and 40
is less than 12 so ngf is looking at a
false expression and it should not have
good morning in the Dom all right so let
me refresh this and that goes away so
this is a very simple use of a new
directive that you learned in this
tutorial which is ng in it just lets you
initialize a variable you don't have to
declare it just as in a value and you're
going to get that variable and we've
taken that readable and give use this
inside a directive called ng F which
conditionally shows this element right
now the cool thing here is I can have
this R of day use in multiple directives
now let's say I want to have a good
evening message over here so I can
actually duplicate this paragraph tag
and let's here call this good evening
and the condition for this will be R of
T greater than let's say 5:00 p.m. so
that would be 17 so let me go ahead and
save this now if i refresh nothing shows
up because R of T is 14 so this ng if
evaluates to false so good morning is
not shown this ng if also evaluates to
false because 14 is not greater than 17
so good evening is also not add it to
the Dom however if I change this to
let's say 18 now I'm going to get good
evening if this is less than 12 let's
say 9:00 a.m. now it's going to show
good morning right so this is pretty
cool you define a variable just once and
then you can use this in multiple
multiple tags and you have multiple ng
ifs which do different things but then
it's referring to the same variable so
you either show good morning or good
evening depending on the time of the day
you can also add a good afternoon which
covers the time between 12 and 17 but
I'll leave that to you as an exercise so
this is a quick look at a couple of new
features - ng in it and you also learn
how to create and initialize variables
and use them inside another directive
you already
which is ng-if so with this just gotten
started with angular and using some of
the directives and its features in the
next unit we can dive deep into a lot of
angular features that you get out of the
box and see how we can build some fairly
complex applications using some of the
features that already come bundled with
angular</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
