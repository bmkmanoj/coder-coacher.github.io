closed gallop is the block does not
create scopes in JavaScript right that's
not the way to create scopes in
JavaScript now how do you create scopes
in JavaScript scoping is based on
functions ok javascript is supposed to
have function scoping not block scoping
and what do I mean by that let us give
an example of this javascript program
now let's say I create a variable called
name and assign it to a string which
happens to be my name and now I have an
if block here if name is equal to cosec
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create a new variable called Department
and I'm going to assign it to a new
string called engineering right so I'm
creating a new variable inside the if
block now if I were to print console
that log of name what would be the value
that gets printed on the console will
obviously be cached right because the
variable name contains the value Kaushik
but here's a question if I were to print
console that log off department and I do
that outside the safe block what would
be the value that gets printed to the
console well the answer is it would
print engineering ok it's because this
block is not creating a new scope in
JavaScript if this were creating a new
scope this would have been an undefined
variable right probably give an error
say hey I'm not able to find this
variable but this still works the value
of the department variable is still
engineering even outside the if block
that is because JavaScript does not
create scopes for blocks ok javascript
is not block scope what javascript is
this function scope and the only way to
create a scope in JavaScript is by
creating functions that is not entirely
true because there are a few other ways
and there have been a lot of new
additions to the JavaScript programming
language will let you create multiple
you know scopes using other ways but for
the most part you create scopes in
JavaScript using functions so let me
create a function and show you how this
looks like so this time let me start
with name equals cosh again nothing is
changed but now rather than have an if
block as is didn't create a function
here I'm going to create a function call
allocate department okay
and this function is going to have the
if block
and this gradual exactly what I did
before but then do it in line I'm
creating the safe block in a function
and then I'm calling the function now
these lines of code write declaring the
function and then calling it is pretty
much the same as just having the if
block outside the function write at
least as long as this function is not
called an other time it's basically
executing this piece of code it's
executing lines four to six that's what
the declaration and the execution do
okay but the only thing is rather than
have the if block be in line it is now
inside a function called allocate
Department and I am calling that
function over here now if I were to
print the value of Department what would
the value be what will get printed the
answer is you would get a runtime error
because javascript is function scope so
this variable declaration bar Department
equals engineering is inside this
function so it's not available outside
the function the function declaration
over here has created a scope okay so
anything that's declared inside the
function is available inside the
function only okay it's not available
outside so this would give an error
however whatever is declared outside the
function is available inside for
instance you see here i'm using the name
the name here binds to this name okay
now if this function the scope had a
variable called name then when I'm
referring to name it would point to that
inner variable but since it does not
have an inner variable called name what
the interpreter does is it looks up it
looks one level up to see if there is a
variable called name and the outer scope
it finds it and that's what it uses okay
so again think of this as a scope
hierarchy you have a top-level scope and
then you have a child scope under it and
whatever is declared in the gyroscope is
available only in the child's coke
but whatever is declared in the top
scope is also available to the child
coconut vice versa hopefully that makes
sense let's look at a couple more
examples to see how this works in
JavaScript</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
