service and remove this hard-coded list
and actually make this work with the
data layer make it connect to the actual
database and run queries on top of it
and when you make sales like you know
create or an update it actually updates
the database not just the start coded
list how do we do this
we added the JPA support we added the
spring data JPA support in the last
video just by adding this hundred xml
section you could have just taken this
dependency and put it into the old
format XML and that would have been just
as what we have over here right nothing
much has changed so this dependency and
this Apache Derby dependency so those
are the two things we've added to the
classpath now how do I go about actually
using JPA the first thing i need to do
is open the model class this is the
entity class right this is the topic i
need to tell JPA that this is the thing
that needs to be saved to the database
right we need to save topic instances we
need to map this object objects off this
topic class to the relational database
table so I would ideally like it to
create a topic table and each one of
these member variables should go as
columns in that database and each
instance of this topic class should go
as rows in that table all right so how
do I tell JP that again I do this by
using annotations so there is one
annotation called the add entity that I
need to mark to the class itself to tell
JP that this is an entity class so that
I do by going here and saying add entity
now this identity I import from Java
extra persistence
now with this identity GPA knows to
create a table called topic and that
table is going to have three columns
it's going to have an ID column a name
column in a description column and all
them are going to be text columns now I
need to tell JP a one more thing what
the primary key is you remember in a
relational database every table should
have
primary key what's the primary key gonna
be which of these three columns so I
need to give GPA that hit so I need to
tell JPL about this choose this one as a
primary key so I do that by using
another annotation which is a free level
augmentation we'll just call that ID so
whatever member variable corresponds to
the column that I want to be the primary
key column I mark that member variables
in the class with the add ID annotation
again this is from Java X persistence so
with this I actually am done configuring
the entity so this is going to be my
entity and now with this GPA knows
exactly what to do in order to create
the table are to read from it or
whatever right so it can convert a topic
instance to a row in the database table
and it can convert a row in the database
table to a topic instance you can do
both now with just this configuration
because everything else is kind of
implicit right the property name
corresponds to the column name so it
knows exactly what to do it's going to
run queries for you and create topic
instances and vice versa so this is the
first step we have an entity mapping the
second step is to use the topic service
to connect to the database and run those
commands like you need to somehow tell
JP hey I want to save this topic concern
they want to read up against and so you
need some kind of a class a data class a
data service rather which has those
methods so what would you typically do
let's say I create this I'm going to
call this a new I'm going to create a
new class let's say I call this topic
repository all right let's say this is
my data service and I'm going to create
methods to do all the credit ratings
what would I typically do I would have a
method which is get all topics which is
going to get me all the topics and I'm
probably going to have a method which is
get topic given an ID and I'm probably
going to have a method which is update
topic which sticks in a topic and it
kind of makes an update to the database
I probably going to have a delete topic
which is again taking a string ID so if
you look at methods like this let's say
you have filters for topics I don't know
you're gonna do this for a course for
example what do you think the data layer
for a course repository would be like
beefy very similar it will be a get all
courses a get course with an ID update
course given a course and then a delete
course with has a an ID that's passed to
earth so no matter what your entity is
the structure kind of remains the same
you have some standard crud operations
that you have to do graphically you can
have some extra needs right you might
have to get all topic repair the
description contains a particular feed
for instance right that's unique to your
model let's set that aside but as far as
the common things that concerned you are
probably going to be building the same
methods for every entity that you're
going to have to write connecting to the
JPA so what the spring data JPA team has
done is they have actually created an
out-of-the-box solution for building
these kind of standard methods so you
don't have to actually implement it the
framework knows that you have an entity
and you have these fields which map to
Collins and you know that these are the
standard methods so you can have to
write so they say well you don't have to
do this and in fact you don't even need
to create a class what you need to do is
actually make this an interface because
the spring data JP is going to be
providing the class so you're going to
have an interface which uses the
implementation that comes with spring
data JP a since every repository like
this has the same or those same methods
the spring data JP a framework comes
with one common repository called the
crud repository all right so there is an
implementation so this is actually an
interface and they have an
implementation for this which contains
the logic for any entity class it really
doesn't matter because the only thing
that changes that
is the type of the class type of the
entity class but the methods and all are
the same the spring data JPA already has
an interface and implementation the
interface is called crud repository and
you don't have to worry about an
implementation so what you need to do
when you build your custom repository
you just have to extend this all right
so that's what I'm going to do I'm going
to say extends crud repository so this
is something that comes out of the box
and your custom repository will just
extend it and since this has all the
common methods you're going to get all
the common methods yourself and you just
have to add implement the special
methods that you need like I mentioned
if you want to do a search fire topics
which contain a particular text in the
description that would be a custom meme
and only those you would have to
implement but all the common stuff like
getting all the entities selecting a
particular entity updating an entity all
that stuff is already taken care of here
alright so I'm going to import crud
repository from Spring Framework data
repository now if crud repository is
actually a generic type so I need to
provide that generic type information
now this generic type is required
because all the methods the common
methods that I demonstrated earlier how
type information right when you're
getting a list of topics well it needs
to return a list off-topic classes in
order than getting a list of courses you
need to you need to return a list of
topic courses so this has that generic
type information necessary so it needs a
couple of generic types the first
generic type is what is the entity class
that you're working with in this case
its topic so that's going to be the
first one the second generic type is
what's the ID that this entity class has
we know that it's a string so that's
going to be the second generic type to
the string now for this extension just
by having this topic repository extend
from crud repository given a generic
type you're going to get all the methods
that come out of the box with the crud
repository you're going to get the crud
methods like the name says and with this
you should be able to make
any update to a single ID or get all the
entities or all that stuff so we can
actually look at that now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
