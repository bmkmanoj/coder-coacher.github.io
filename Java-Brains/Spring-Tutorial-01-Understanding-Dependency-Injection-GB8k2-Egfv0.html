the Spring Framework these series of
tutorials are going to cover the Spring
Framework and we'll learn how to use the
Spring Framework in our java
applications now what is a Spring
Framework it's actually a lot of things
put into one but the thing that spring
is really popular for is dependency
injection we learn what dependency
injection is in this tutorial and that
will form a good introduction to spring
and as we go on and the further
tutorials we'll look at some of the
other capabilities of spring and the
other roles that spring performs in our
application now what is dependency
injection this is sometimes called as
dependency inversion and the definition
is it's a way in which you decouple the
conventional dependency relationships
between objects say you have two objects
that are related to each other one is
dependent on the other
the idea is to decouple this dependency
so that they are not tied to each other
let's just take an example to explain
what this concept means now let's say I
have a drawing application and I have
code that draws different shapes a
triangle a circle in Square and I'm
using that code in order to draw certain
shapes on the screen now I have a circle
object C and the circle object has a
draw method and I have a triangle object
and the triangle object has a draw
method now I can use these objects in
order to draw a circle or a triangle on
the screen so let's say I have an
application class I can instantiate a
circle object inside this class and I
can draw a circle I can instantiate a
triangle object inside the class and I
can draw a triangle so a code would be
something like this I would say triangle
my triangle equals new triangle so I'm
instantiating a triangle object here and
I am calling the draw method of that
triangle object similarly I'm
instantiating the circle object here and
I'm calling the draw method of the
circle object now let's say I don't want
my application class to be tied
specifically to these objects I want to
use polymorphism now how do i do poly
more
prism here the whole idea of doing
polymorphism is having some kind of an
interface class for a parent class and I
use the parent class in order to execute
the methods of the class and then at
runtime I supply different children of
the bed in class and the methods of the
child gets executed instead let me
clarify that by showing you how I would
modify the piece of code in order to
implement polymorphism so let's say I
have the circle object and I have this
triangle object both have a similar draw
method now what I'll do is I will have a
shape interface or a shape parent class
that has a draw method and I will make
both the circle and the triangle object
inherit from this shape interface or the
shape parent class now what's going to
happen is the circle object is going to
override the draw method of the shape
and the triangle object is going to
override the draw method of the shape
now this draw method of the circle will
contain the code to draw the circle and
this draw method of the triangle will
contain the code to draw the triangle
now if I have to use polymorphism in my
application class what I would do is in
my application class I would write code
like this instead of initiating a
triangle what I would do is I'd say
shape equals new triangle instead of
saying triangle equals new triangle I'm
going to put this inside a shape object
similarly I'm going to instantiate a
circle and put it inside a shape object
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
call the shape dot draw now if shape has
a triangle it's going to call this draw
and if the shape has a circle object
it's going to call this draw so this is
actually polymorphism in action we are
doing something that uses polymorphism
concepts instead of calling the method
of the object itself I have a handle to
this parent object and I'm going to call
the draw off the parent object now this
parent object could be an abstract class
it could be an interface the whole idea
is that
I do not know which object I have then I
am calling this particular shaped or
draw okay so this is a simple
implementation of polymorphism actually
it's not really polymorphism because see
what we are doing here is we are still
tying the code to a triangle or a circle
I am still instantiating a circle object
inside the application class if required
or a triangle object inside an
application class is required so the
application class always knows whether
it's a triangle or a circle so there's
really no point in using the shape
you're not getting any benefit out of it
it's still hard coded to use either a
triangle or a circle so if you take this
a step further so what we'll do next is
instead of having the code hard-coded
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
write a method okay I'm going to have
this method called my draw method and
this is going to take shape as a
parameter now this shape could be
anything it would be a circle or it
could be a triangle
this method does not know all that this
method does is it just calls the shaped
or draw now depending on what object you
pass to this my draw method if you pass
a circle this my draw method is going to
draw a circle because it's going to call
this method now if you pass a triangle
my draw method is going to draw a
triangle because it's going to call this
method but essentially what we're doing
here is the my draw method does not
worry about what shape it is it knows
that whatever object is being passed as
a shape and it will have a draw method
how it's actually implemented in a
circle or a triangle is not the business
of this method it just calls the draw
method and depending on what object is
passed it draws a circle or a triangle
so this is fine we have actually removed
the dependency of the circle or the
triangle from this method but still note
that somebody has to pass this object to
the my draw method right then somewhere
an object is created a shape object is
created via a circular a triangle
somewhere that shape object is created
and this my draw method is called so the
has to be another piece of code in this
class which has the initialization so
somebody has to do this shape equals new
triangle somewhere else in the class
this has to happen and then we need to
call the my draw method by passing this
shape so we are still tied to this new
triangle right we are still not free
from it somewhere else in the class we
need to have this new instantiation and
we still know what's going to happen so
no matter how many ever times you run
this class it's still going to draw a
triangle because we have this new
triangle in place now if you have to
change this you will have to modify the
class of course you don't have to change
the method because this you have
insulated right we do not have to change
this depending on whether you want to
draw a circle or a triangle we have
taken that dependency out of this part
but we have added it in this part so if
you have to change this to a circle I'd
have to change this line of code and the
same class will have to be modified okay
so now we'll take it a step further what
we do is this dependency we'll take it
outside the class okay and the class
will not know what shape it's drawing
the class will just have a shape and
then we will expect some other class to
provide the shape for us so right now
what's happening is in our application
class we have this triangle object right
because we have a new triangle inside
this application object so what we need
to do is we need to have a shape object
here instead of this triangle object and
we will ask somebody else we don't know
who that person is yet but we'll ask
somebody else some other class some
other object to add this triangle or
shape or circle into this application
class object so this is how it's going
to work what I'm going to do is I'm
going to have a drawing class okay this
drawing class will have a class member
variable called shape it's not going to
be a member variable triangle it's not
going to be a member variable of circle
it's going to be a member variable of
type shape now
assume that I have a code like this I
have a class drawing I have a private
shape object now what I'll do is I'll
define a setter here he'll me I'll
define a public setter set shape and I
will take a shape object and I will set
it into this shape
now this can accept a circle this can
accept a triangle tomorrow it can accept
a Pentagon hexagon as long as it's a
shame it will accept this object and
whatever object whatever shape object is
passed it's going to set it inside this
class it's going to set it as a member
variable and then I have a draw shape
method which just draws even it just
calls a draw method of the shape
whichever has been set note that this
does not do an initialization you don't
see a new shape here you don't see a new
triangle or a new circle okay the
drawing class is going to assume that
somebody is going to instantiate that
and provide that object to this class
okay so now what's going to happen is we
are now totally removed the dependency
from a triangle or shape now if you want
to draw a triangle you don't have to
modify the drawing class this is going
to remain the same all you need to do is
pass a triangle to the setter you have a
drawing dot set shape if you pass a
triangle to this setter and then do our
drawing dot draw shape it's going to
draw a triangle if you pass a circle
object to the setter you say drawing dot
set shape when you pass a circle object
and then you do a drawing dot draw shape
it's going to draw a circle so what's
going to happen is in a different class
you will be doing this you will be
having a triangle my triangle equals new
triangle I will instantiate the triangle
and then I will have an object of this
drawing class I will do a set shape and
I will pass the triangle now it's a
triangle it can be any shape it doesn't
matter and then I will do a drawing door
draw shape and then drawing class it
doesn't know what shape it has and it
doesn't really care it just calls the
draw shape method and it's going to call
the draw method of the corresponding
shape you two triangle or a circle okay
so now the advantage here is that in our
drawing class in
of having an instance of a specific
shape as a triangle or a circle instead
of having an instance of a specific
shape it has an instance of the parent
shape object so this can be anything now
what's going to happen is I will have a
different class which has a triangle and
then this class is going to pass the
triangle to this drawing class and then
the drawing class is going to have a
triangle leaving this class passes a
circle to this drawing class this
drawing class is going to have a circle
and then again as I said it's open for
new objects to be instantiated as long
as the object is a shape so you might
draw a new shape you might create a new
shape object which has 100 sides as long
as it's a shape you can pass that object
to this drawing class and all that the
drawing class does is calls to draw off
that shape the whole idea is that you
don't have to modify this drawing class
you just have to pass the corresponding
object in a shape and then the drawing
class is going to draw it but now we
might ask the question again
this will have to be modified right this
different class has to be modified you
will need to have you need to set a
circle for having a circle to be drawn
we need to set a triangle firing a
triangle to be drawn so of course
something has to be changed in order for
a program to change the whole idea is
that you are separating the whole
dependency out of a class the drawing
class doesn't really know what its
dependent on it doesn't really know what
it's drawing and the advantage of this
is that if what it has to draw changes
you don't have to modify the drawing
class because it doesn't really know in
the first place it just draws a shape so
you can make the drawing class draw all
kinds of shapes without even modifying
without even changing a line of code of
the drawing class and the reason it's
happening is because the dependency of
the drawing class to a shape object is
not owned by the drawing class the
drawing class does not own the
relationship the drawing class just has
a shape it does not own the relationship
off the actual shape that it's drawing
is it doesn't own the circle that
doesn't want to triangle just on the
shape and
the dependency that the drawing class
has dependency to the triangle is
actually injected to the drawing class
by something else it's injected by a
completely different class so this is
the principle of dependency injection
here you can inject a dependency of the
drawing class or triangle you can later
inject the dependency of the drawing
class to a circle so the dependency is
not hard-coded in the class it's
actually injected by an entity outside
the class so this is the whole concept
of dependency injection and this is
something that spring makes it very easy
to code actually what happens is that
this different class that we said you
know we are we need still need to write
in this in this scenario we need to
write this different class that
instantiates a new triangle and then
injects the dependency to the drawing
class even this is taken care of by
spring you just tell spring saying here
have this object now inject this
dependency to this object so you don't
have to write this class you just call
the draw shape and then you configure
spring to inject the write dependencies
to the write objects and spring takes
care of that so this is a very
high-level overview of dependency
injection I hope the concepts are clear
in the next tutorial onwards we will use
spring to actually implement this
dependency injection and whatever
questions you have I hope it will get
clearer down the line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
