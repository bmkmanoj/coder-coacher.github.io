working right again it's very
opinionated and then has the behavior of
convention over configuration it lets
you configure very less by taking the
default convention most of the times but
there is always a need for you to
configure the 80 person use case might
not always apply you might have some 20%
scenarios that you might have to just
tweak Springwood a little bit to have it
work the way you want the way to
customize Springwood applications just
by using a property file they're
actually multiple ways to do it one
typical way to Dornan this I think the
easiest way to do it is by using a
property file called application type
properties this is actually a way to
customize your spring application itself
and it's got nothing to do with
springboard so how do you use
application root properties when you
have a spring application one of the
common ways of specifying this kind of
configuration is in a properties file in
the resources folder somewhere in the
class but if you have a dart properties
file you can have a bunch of key value
pairs that affects how spring behaves
the spring boot there are certain
special keys that you can use in the
same property file in order to configure
how spring boot works once example that
I can give you is the server port when
you start your spring application you
access it using localhost colon 8080 by
default because it 80 is the default
port that has been configured for your
spring good application and it's
actually a configuration for the sublet
container that your springboard
application runs in it's a tomcat
configuration what you can do is put a
properties file in your project and
change the default port to something
else that you're comfortable with I'm
going to show you how to do this this is
just one example of the various things
that you can configure in a springboard
application there are a bunch more but
for now let's look at how to configure
the port off here sublet container when
you start your spring good application
what you do is go to the resources
folder and create a new file and I'm
going to call this
application dark properties and here I'm
going to configure the port the way to
configure anything like this in spring
is to first know what the key is I
happen to know that in order to
configure the port I need to change the
key server port and I can put an equals
and I can specify a new port let's say I
do 80 81 so this is going to be the new
port that the servlet container is going
to use so when I start the spring
application now Springwood is going to
look at this and it's going to say okay
now I need to map the board that the
Select container runs into 81 and it's
going to do that now how do you know
that this is the right key to set that
I'm going to come back to that in a
minute
so let me save this and I'm going to
start this spring application now
Springwood has started and I get an
error it says that the address is
already news guess what
the tomcat connector configure to listen
on port 8080 what has failed to start
because the port might already be in use
so let me go ahead and change this to a
different port I'm going to choose the
port 3000 and now let's run start the
application again the application has
started and I can access this
application in localhost 3000 and sure
enough when access the URL localhost
3000 slash hello I get hi back so our
application is now running in port 3000
because of the change we did to
application our properties now the
question is how do you know what to add
to application our properties
added server dot port because I knew
that this was the key that I had to
configure to change it to the new value
in order to affect what port this is and
how do I know that there's a really good
resource on the Springwood website
called a common application properties
you can find this by using a search
engine and searching for Springwood
common application properties I'm also
going to share this link in the
description of the video
but this gives you all the properties
that you can possibly configure in the
spring application or properties file
and also provides you the default values
so here you see something like this
spring cash card space exploration has
the default value of zero but if you
want to change the expiration to
something else you can just put this
line in your application or properties
and you can change it right so let me
scroll further down you have mail
related integrations SendGrid
and here you see our server section you
have server address configures the
network address you have compression
enable context related configuration
whole lot more and here is our server
dot port that we did configure it's set
to 8080 by default which is why when you
started your Springwood application it
was available in 8080 but if you want to
change this just copy this line put it
in your application or properties and
change the value and spring boot is
automatically going to pick it up okay
it looks at the property file
automatically and configure set based on
what you put over here so again refer to
this in order to figure out what are the
things that you can possibly configure
but the purpose of this video is at
least to tell you that this is something
that you can do to configure your
springboard application and this is
something that you typically do when you
have a brand new application there's
probably one or two things that you want
to change well then this is how you do
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
