talk about variables and the JavaScript
type system all right so let's start
with variable declaration we all know
what a variable declaration is in any
language when you need to hold a
variable and then you give it a value
you also have to give it a name and that
name becomes a container for a value
okay so let's say you want to have a
string variable you declare a variable
as a string and then once you've done
that you can assign a string value to it
this is common across a lot of
programming languages so there is this
concept in JavaScript as well you can
have a variable and then you can assign
a value to it
but there is one major difference so
let's see how to create a variable and
then declare it in JavaScript the syntax
is using something like this you see
here there is a bar value equals 42 so
the wire is a keyword which stands do
you want to create a new variable and
then you give it a name the name of the
variable happens to be value here and
then you're assigning a value to it
which is 42 okay so that's what this
line does now you might notice that I
don't have information about the type of
the variable here I'm not saying int
value equals 42
okay I'm not specifying that this is a
number I'm just saying wire value equals
42 if I have to declare a variable for a
string I would say var value equals
hello world okay so JavaScript does not
have the concept of typed variables okay
there is no pretty clear a tional type
required in order to create a variable
we just create a variable and then you
can assign whatever value you want all
you need to do is use the war keyword to
declare the variable now here is another
way of doing this I have two lines here
I have a bar value so it just declares
the variable doesn't allocate a value to
it and then the next line uses that
variables value equals 42 so even in
this case it still works because
javascript does not expect to know what
value you can assign to the variable all
you need to do is just use bar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
