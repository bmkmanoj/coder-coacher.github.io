in this tutorial we'll set up our
development environment to use starts -
so the things that we need to do are to
go to the starts - website and download
the distribution and then setup our
project so that we can have the
distribution included in the build path
so the first thing that I'm going to do
is go to the struts website I have the
website open over here you can just
search online for struts - and you'll be
pointed to the Apache starts website so
here you have a download link click on
this and choose the start - version you
can choose the full distribution just
click on it it's a zip file you can
download and extract the zip file ok so
here I have extracted the starts - zip
file and these are the files and folders
that I have the lib folder as we know
has all the libraries and the source
folder contains the source of struts -
which is really handy if you want to
explore the code or do some debugging
and there's also a Doc's folder which
contains a good set of documentation for
developing starts - web application you
would need the contents of this lib
folder so these are the jars that we'll
have to include in our Eclipse project
so let's go ahead and create one i have
eclipse open over here so i'll create a
new project choose other and for this
example i'll be choosing a web project
because starts - is a web framework and
we need a web application that uses the
starts - framework so I'll choose the
dynamic web project click Next ok now I
can give a name to my project I'll call
this starts - starter I have a target
runtime option over here I've chosen
Apache Tomcat
this is a runtime that you have to
install in your Eclipse environment if
you not familiar with how to do that you
can refer to my service tutorial which
talks about how
download at you know a target runtime in
this case it happens to be dumb cat and
then you can set up the runtime using
the new runtime option over here you can
choose the Tomcat option and point to
the directory where you've downloaded
the Tomcat and then you should be good
to go
so this is the target runtime that you
know it shows up as a result so I've
selected Apache Tomcat 7 which is the
only one that I have on my machine over
here and the rest are fine as the
defaults click next next ok now here it
talks about the web module configuration
what is the context root that you want
and what is the content directory that
you want again if you go through myself
that's tutorial you should have a good
idea about what these are so I will
choose web as the content directory
context root struts to starters fine
I'll choose the option to generate the
web dot XML and I'll click finish now
epic Eclipse is going to generate this
web application for me with all these
options and since we have you know
configured a runtime which is Tomcat I
can once I have done the coding I can
right click on the project and say run
and then it's automatically going to
take care of deploying it and dogcat and
then starting the application ok so here
is my new web application starts to
starter let's open it up and see what it
contains so it has a web directory and
the SRC directory the web directory
contains all the web content and it has
one important directory called web-inf
which contains the web dot XML as well
as the libraries and the source
directory will be where we keep our Java
classes now the library folder is empty
right now but we need to add the struts
to jars over here so that they are
accessible into our code which uses the
starts framework so what we are going to
do is we are going to create our own
user library which uses some of the
common struts to jars that we would need
and then we'll make sure that user
library is getting added to this Lib
folder so what I will do is
right click on the project go to
properties and here I go to the Java
build path now in the Java build path I
click on libraries and choose add
library now here there is an option to
add use a library click Next
of course there are no user libraries
right now because I have not configured
a user library for struts tools I'm
going to do that now so this is the
panel where I manage all my user
libraries I'll create a new one I'll
call it starts to click on OK now I can
add all the jars that I need to this
user library so I'll click on add jars
and I'll navigate to the directory where
we just downloaded and extracted the
starts to zip file and to the Lib folder
inside so these are all the jars that
are required for starts - I could do a
select all and add all of them but not
all of them are required at this point
of time so let's just choose the ones
that are essential to what we're trying
to do now
so the first jar that I'm going to add
is the starts - core so this is the one
so this is the core jar that's required
for the starts to functionality so this
is the one that I'm going to add first
then I will add ex-work and OG and L
we'll talk about what those are in the
subsequent tutorials
but just add them next work is over here
and OG NL is over here make sure you're
pressing ctrl while you click this next
I'm going to add the comments so go to
the comments so here you have a few
comments jars so I'm going to add file
upload Commons are you logging logging
API and this should do it and then
finally I'm going to add two other jars
which is free marker and Java assists
so here open and there is one more
Commons job that I need to add over here
which is the Commons lang I had missed
this out so let me add that as well so
these are the chairs that are required
up minimize all these and expand this so
that you can probably pause the video
and verify if you have all these chairs
so this is it now I will press ok now
you have a user library for starts - so
I click finish over here so this is now
added to my class path now I click OK
now this will have the library here now
we go to project Explorer so here you
can see the Java resources libraries has
the struts - but here's an additional
step that you have to do because this is
a web application not only do we need to
have this library in the class path we
will also need to tell Eclipse to bundle
this into our web ina flip because in
the deployed application in Tomcat this
library has to go sit over here
so this line Lib folder needs to contain
all the jars that we've added in this
starts to library so how do we tell
Eclipse to take that library and add it
to this lid folder when it's deploying
the application so how do we do that is
again right-click on the project and go
to this option here called deployment
assembly so this gives instructions to
Eclipse about how it needs to assemble
all the different files when it is
actually deploying it so I will add a
new rule over here so I will say Java
build path entries which is starts -
needs to go to by buying a flip so now
what's going to happen is Eclipse when
it deploys the start saw application
after it combines it it takes this and
puts it into the web-inf Lib folder so
that it's ready for Tomcat to use so
click apply
and hit okay so now we are all set that
a web application a blank web
application that uses the starts to
libraries and we can now start writing
code that uses the structural framework
which we'll do in the next tutorial
