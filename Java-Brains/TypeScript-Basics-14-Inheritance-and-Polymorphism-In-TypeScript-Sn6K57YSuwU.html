inheritance you can create a class which
is a base class Gordon code base class
and you can have other classes inherit
from it by extending the class and
adding or adding features again remember
none of these are available in
JavaScript when you're doing the class
definitions and extensions and all that
stuff what you're doing is basically
having typescript create workarounds for
it create the simulation of classes
while actually using the concepts of
prototypes and functions underneath some
of these features with classes are
coming up in the new JavaScript
specifications but they're not
universally available but if you're
using typescript you can use it without
worry because you know that that strip
is going to convert it into a format
which is generally supported all right
so let's do some inheritance and see how
it works so I have a class called person
here now the first name and a last name
let's say I have a function called greet
and this basically prints something to
the console sees hey there now this is a
person now I can create another class
which extends the person now let's say I
create a class called programmer and
let's say I want to extend person
because programmers are people after all
so I'm gonna say extends person and now
I have a new class called programmer
which inherits everything that the
person has I'm going to save this and
here I'm going to say were a programmer
equals new programmer and I'm going to
have a programmer do a greet
I'm going to compile this and execute
this TSE classes RTS and note classes
start yes just running this in one step
and sure enough you get here there so
it's basically calling a class a method
of a class which doesn't really exist in
the class itself but which has been
inherited from a parent class which is
person it's calling the greet method on
the person now the traditional concepts
of inheritance apply pretty much the
same way you can extend and you can
override methods for instance there is a
grid and let's say I override the grid
method with a console that log off let's
say hello world because that's how
programmers create not like normal
people I'm gonna save this and execute
this again and you see hello world so
it's basically calling the greet method
which is an extension of this thing and
programmer since it's extending person
it also gets their first name and last
name properties as well so you can
technically do the get full name thing
where you do at this start first name
and this dot last name and call it from
programmer and it's gonna pick up the
write first name and last name for that
instance so this is inheritance which is
pretty straightforward I'm not gonna go
into all the nuances there but one thing
that I should point out is the use of
the keyword super and that's super
important I'll tell you what that is
so let's say you have another method
here taste greet like normal people
because you say hello world somebody who
says hi that's gonna look hard unless
the other person is a programmer so
let's say you want to creat like normal
people so that's how you call
Griet this dart greets i'm basically
calling the method does dart green now
what happens if I say read like normal
people I'm still gonna get hello world
but here's what I want to do for the
programmer class have a method which has
the programmer greeting which is hello
world but I also have discrete like
normal people where I want to call the
greet method of the class that it's
actually inheriting from this person
so it's supposed to call this method of
the superclass the way to do this is by
not using the this keyword like you saw
this keyword just calls to greet method
off that instance itself what you need
to do is you see superdad greet in which
case what it's calling is the method the
implementation of the parent class which
is person so if you do a super dot then
you run this method you see it prints
hey there because it's actually calling
the method of the of the parent class
but otherwise if you just do a
programmer dot greet it just calls this
method and it prints all over again
these are object-oriented programming
concepts which are common with
inheritance this is kind of like a
requirement for this course I'm not
gonna go into the details about how the
implementation works but know that there
are a couple of things you can do first
you can have a class extend another
class and you get to use the features of
that class and then you can call the
super keyword you can use the super
keyword to refer to the parent class for
accessing the methods and member
variables and you can use the this
keyword for accessing methods and member
variables after class instance itself of
the current class whatever is being
implemented
all right before we lined up one last
thing I wanna show you is the concept of
polymorphism this is again prevalent in
object-oriented programming it's the
idea that you can have multiple
instances of multiple classes referred
to using a parent class type when it
comes to typing for example a programmer
here is of type programmer because
implicit typing you're saying new
programmer and it's figured out that
this is the type that you need what you
can also do is have a programmer be of
type person now what happens now a
programmer is of type person so you can
still assign a programmer to this
variable because a programmer is a
person has easier relationship because
it's extensive but when you call methods
on this variable you can only use the
methods and member variables after type
that it belongs to which in this case
this person you cannot use a method
that's specific to the actual instance
which is programmer because you're
losing that information over here you're
making this off type person which is the
parent class so you get to access only
the parent class information which is
great here however when you call this
method what you're gonna get is that the
instance implementation runs so when you
do a dot greet it's gonna call this
start Crede it's gonna say hello but
it's not gonna say hey there because the
instance is still off programmer type
you're just referring to it as a person
again these are object-oriented
programming concepts not going into too
much detail but you know that but you
know polymorphism works just the same
way in typescript as with some of the
other object-oriented programming
languages that you are used to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
