some introduction to how you would do
authentication in your REST API s I'm
going to talk about some of the
challenges we have with authentication
specifically for REST API and some of
the ways we can get around those
challenges and I'm going to highlight
the basic card scenario that we are
actually going to implement in the next
tutorial all right so before we get into
SDP authentication itself let's talk
about how the classic session based
authentication works right assume Anand
REST API application a classic servers
deployed web application how would a
client establish a session how would a
client do a login and authenticate well
what would typically happen is when the
client makes a call to the server the
first thing the client does is
authenticate right it passes in the
username and the password it says hey
server this is who I am and this is the
password to prove it right now once this
call is made the server validates this
username and password if it finds that
the values are right what it does is it
makes a record of it right it says okay
this is a client who has passed my check
now I'm going to save this information
in a session object right in the session
the server maintains this information
about the fact that the client sent the
username and password and they
registered and they can be trusted
so what the server does is it makes it
creates this object in the memory called
the session and the session probably has
some kind of an ID some kind of a token
now the server in its response to the
client sends back that session token now
the client needs to hold on to the
session token and the next time the
client talks to the server it needs to
send this token back it needs to say hey
server remember you had authenticated me
some time back and I have a session
token to prove that I am indeed that
person so the session token needs to be
sent back
so what servers typically do is it sends
the token back as a cookie
so the client has that value in the
cookie so the next time the client makes
a call to the server that value the
session token' gets sent to the server
through the cookie and the server says
okay I know the session token' I have
the session value over here so I know
who you are
the next time decline needs to make a
call it sends the session token again
and so on and when the client is finally
done it says hey server I want to log
off and the server destroys the session
so this is classic session based
authentication I'm sure you're familiar
with this this is all over the place
there are a lot of websites which do
session based authentication like this
well this is nice and simple this is
going to be a problem for REST API is
because REST API is are stateless at
least they're supposed to be stateless
now what do I mean by stateless
stateless essentially means that the
server the obligation running on the
server does not maintain any state does
not maintain information that persists
across multiple requests ideally when a
client makes a request to a REST API the
REST API application does what it needs
to do to serve that request it does all
the processing this required prepares
the response and sense that response to
the client and then completely forgets
about it there is no state that's
maintained there's no information that's
persisted ok this is what REST API
should be right it should not remember a
previous interaction between the client
and the server well if this is to be
true then we have a problem session
based authentication does not work
anymore because you cannot have this guy
you cannot have the session this goes
away now the client cannot vanish is
this kind of an interaction right so the
client has a session token' within the
next time the client sends the session
token' their services ok I have no idea
who you are I have no memory of you ok
this is a problem with REST API ice
so there are a few ways to solve this
problem there are actually a lot of ways
to solve this there have been a bunch of
different authentication mechanisms that
are stateless and that you can use for
rest api s i'm going to give you a list
of some of these authentication
mechanisms and i'm going to talk in
detail about the most basic of them
which is basic auth it's also called
basic access authentication this is how
it works with basic auth the first time
the client needs to make a call to the
server and it needs to authenticate it
sends the username and password the
second time the client needs to make a
call to the server it sends the username
and password again the third time it
sends the username and password so there
is no state being maintained on the
server which is fine because the client
happens to authenticate for every single
request every time the client talks to
the server it is sending the username
and password information well they
weren't kidding when they call this
basic auth well this is the most basic
of authentication mechanisms there are
some nuances about how this username and
password is being sent to the server
though and I'm going to cover that next
the V the username and password is sent
to the server in every request is in the
header of that request now let's say
this is your request in your header you
want to save your username and password
this is done in a specific way in basic
auth but the idea is the same so you
send the request which is what you want
which is what you would typically send
without any authentication but in the
request header you pass in the username
and the password in order to
authenticate yourself to the server the
thing though is you don't just add the
username and password as this there is a
specific protocol to this there's a
specific way in which you got to do this
so the way to do this is you take the
username and the password and you add
them a both separated by the :
symbol all right so it's username :
password so now we have a string you
take that
and you do base64 encoding so you encode
that username : password string and
basics t4 and you get an encoded string
okay you take this end coded string and
in your request in your header you
create a new header key called
authorization and now the value of this
authorization is the string basic but B
caps and separated by a space you add
this encoded string alright so these are
the steps to send username and password
in the request from the client ok so
again to summarize we have user name
colon password write user name string
colon password string you take that
combined string value and you do base64
encoding and you get an encoded string
now you send that encoded string in the
header of your request you say
authorization or just the header name
and the value is basic and the encoded
string okay now how does this work on
the server side the server side it's the
exact opposite now the server gets this
request and it examines the
authorization header it gets the value
right it checks the first word it says
basic so it knows it's basic
authentication now it gets the second
word which is the encoded string now
it's going to do base64 decoding to get
username : password so it's going to
take the string before the colon
character and take that as username it's
going to take the string after the colon
character and it's going to take that as
a password and it checks if the username
and password match okay now I want to
mention something about base64 encoding
and decoding that we do over here you
should remember that this is not
encryption okay this is not a secret
encoding is just a way for you to
convert a string to another string or
something that anybody can do so this
string this encoded string is not
secur anybody who has access to this
encoded string can always decode okay so
even though you encode your user name
and password in the header it is
available for anybody to decode so you
always have to make sure when you send
username and password in a request
header in this basic auth scenario you
always send this request over HTTPS so
that the request is protected people
cannot look at the header and examine
the value because if somebody sees this
base64 encoded string it's child's play
to get the username and password out of
it right anybody can do basics for
decoding and get the actual values so
you always have to send a request with
this encoded string in the header you
always send it over HTTPS but now the
question is if anybody can access this
by encode why not just send the username
colon password as the string the reason
we encode it is so that we encode
non-http compatible characters it's not
for security we don't want to hide this
of course I can look at the string and I
don't know what the username and
password is but it's one step away from
getting the username and password it's
not to hide it it's not to make it
secure the reason we encode it is so
that if there are non HTTP compatible
characters in either the username or the
password we encoded so that we make sure
that the string is HTTP compatible so
this is a snippet from an earlier
version of the Wikipedia page on basic
access authentication I don't know why
it's removed from the current version so
I have this link here which goes to the
old version which has this paragraph I
think this is pretty useful it's a
security is not the intent of the
encoding step rather the intent of the
encoding is to encode non-http
compatible characters that may be used
in the user name or password into those
that are HTTP compatible that's the
whole point of the encoding right if you
if you set that aside
you're basically sending the username
and the password in the request header
it's as simple as that
all right so this is basic God in a
nutshell right the client sends the
username and the password
in the request every time all the whole
encoding thing and putting it in my
header those are details but the idea is
the credentials are send for every
request in the header now let's talk
about some of the advantages and
disadvantages of this approach
well the biggest advantage is it's
simple I can cover this in one lesson in
a tutorial video which is why I happen
to pick this but this is actually pretty
handy when you are just getting into
authentication you want to learn the
most basic stuff before you move on to
some advanced stuff the second advantage
is you have a stateless server which was
the goal all along right the server
doesn't maintain state the server
doesn't hold on to a session because
this information is being sent every
time the third advantage is this is just
a header value right this is supported
by all browsers so you don't have to
worry about some proprietary
authentication you know process that
only certain browser support this is a
header value it's basic stuff all
browser supported now what are the
disadvantages the biggest disadvantage
it's the username and the password out
in the open
even though it's encoded it's for
everybody to see so you have to send
this over HTTP in order to have at least
some kind of protection the other
disadvantage is it is subject to replay
attacks what a replay attack means is
somebody gets hold off a request they
can resend the request as many times as
they want and since the username and the
password is being sent every time that
request goes through all right the
server is bound to authenticate that
successfully so anybody can get hold of
this request especially if it's not over
HTTPS and make the request on behalf of
a valid user and take over the account
or some dire consequence like that
now the third disadvantage is logout is
tricky imagine how you would do a logout
functionality logout usually works in a
class
scenario where a session is maintained a
logout kills that session right the
session no longer is available on the
server but if every request sends this
value and let's say the browser is
cashing that logging out as tricky all
right so this is a the basic cut and
some advantages and disadvantages now
what are some other approaches we can
take there are some better solutions
there is this other authentication
called digest access authentication this
actually does encryption off a secret
key that's being sent in the header the
basic cart just sends to username in the
password without any encryption the
digest access authentication does some
kind of encryption it doesn't have
username and password though it has
something called a secret I have this
Wikipedia link where you can read more
about digest access authentication the
other solution is asymmetric
cryptography this is the public key
cryptography so there's a public key and
a private key that both the client and
the server both have and they share a
public key while they have their own
individual private keys and that's what
they used to encrypt and decrypt the
credentials that get sent over in the
request again I have a Wikipedia link if
you're curious the other solution is
something called OAuth this is actually
gaining in popularity there are actually
two versions there's what one and what
two while they have the same name they
are actually not the same protocol
they're actually very different
what two has very little resemblance to
one but that's something you know this
is a protocol that's been gaining a lot
of popularity again I have the Wikipedia
link if you're interested
another growing trend in REST API
authentication implementation is JSON
web tokens and this is again a Wikipedia
link so all these authentication
mechanisms provide a way for you to send
credential information without having to
maintain state on the server which is
perfect for rest api s-- so hopefully
this gives you a quick
primer a quick introduction to
authentication in restful api s I
obviously cannot cover all of these
mechanisms because that's a course in
itself I'm going to talk about the basic
auth the scenario that we just discussed
where the client sends the username and
the password
but it is base64 encoded we can
implement that using filters in Jack's
