spring auto wiring auto wiring is a
feature provided by the spring framework
that helps us to skip some of the
configuration that we have to do we've
seen that every member variable in your
spring beam has to be configured so if
it's actually a reference to another
beam we have to specify the reference
explicitly now auto wiring helps us in
reducing some of the configuration that
we have to do by intelligently guessing
what the reference is now say for
example let me remove this list that we
had created in our earlier tutorial now
I have a triangle beam okay and in my
triangle beam let's see I have three
points okay I have a private point point
a point B and Point C okay I have three
points let me generate the getters and
setters for this as well okay so now
what would I normally have to do I would
have to mention the dependency you were
here I would have to have three
different property tags and I have to
mention the dependency now there is a
shortcut here by using auto wiring okay
this is editing out again I'll have to
rewrite that
okay so there is a shortcut in order to
do this wiring automatically now one way
to do the shortcut is like this the name
of the beans if it is same as the name
of our member variables over here we
have point a point B and Point C now
let's say the beans have also been
defined as
point A to point B and Point C so the
names of the beans match the names of
the member variables of this bean which
has a dependency in this case we can ask
spring to otto wire beans based on name
so the way to do this is by writing a
tag Auto wire equals by name now what is
auto wire by name do it checks for all
the member variables of the spin now
when you do our get being here right
you're doing context or kidney of
triangle the string is going to look at
this bean and it sees auto wire request
by name so what it does is even though
you do not have any dependencies here
it's going to check each of these member
variables and see if there is any bean
with this name define in the spring dot
XML if it finds a bean like that it's
going to automatically reference this
bean to this member variable so now
what's going to happen is even though
you have not specified any property in
any reference here since these three
member variables have the same name as
the three beans over here it's going to
automatically buy them up now let me
finish this draw method to be the same
as what was there earlier okay so have
to put this draw method back now what
I'm doing is I'm printing out the point
a point B and Point C values which is X
in the right coordinates for each of
these points so now let me save this
again note we are not doing any writing
you just saying or two I are by name and
now this is going to automatically do
the dependencies let's save the triangle
and let's run this so there you can see
the wiring has happened even though we
have not specified any ref and this is
thanks to a while now there are
different ways in which we can auto wire
what we've seen is one of the ways in
which we can Auto wire which is by name
there is
another way to water wire which is by
type and this works if we have only one
member variable and only one being of
each type so say for example there is
only one point object here and there is
only one beam that's defining the XML of
that particular class in that case what
spring does is it looks for type even
though the beam has been defined in a
different name it looks for the type
which is the class for which the beam
has been defined and then if this class
matches the class that the member
variable has been defined as then it
automatically does the wiring so instead
of looking for name it's going to look
for the type it's going to look for the
type of the beam but then the problem
here is that if you have more than one
so say for example consider this
scenario I have three different point
objects now I cannot do a auto wire by
type because spring will not know what
to assign to what but if there was only
one member variable here of point and
only one beam of point then auto wire by
type would work okay there is a third
method in which we can auto wire and
that is called constructor whatever I
have by constructor snowy field type Oh
auto wire by constructor does the same
as Auto wire by type but instead of
doing a setter injection it does a
constructor injection so instead of
doing a you know injecting the values
through the setter say you have a
constructor here which takes in say
three different types and then you have
a single beam for each of those types
over here then Auto buyer by constructor
will work what spring will do is it will
instantiate these types and then
instantiate these beans and pass it to
the right types of the constructor but
then again the condition here is that
you need to have only one beam per type
and if you do not specify any auto wire
who here then the default this auto wire
off so it's not going to do any auto
wiring this is what we have seen before
we need to do a manual wiring for each
of the references okay so just one final
note while auto wire might
looked like a really cool feature well
at least I am NOT a very big fan of it
because in a real world application
where you have a whole lot of beans and
a whole lot of dependencies it's very
hard to find out what's happening if
it's all being auto wired say you have
specified the references in each and
every bean then it's very easy to know
what the dependencies are and say you're
maintaining an application and you want
to debug the dependencies then it's very
easy to find out what the dependencies
are by looking at the reference but if
everything is auto wired then we will
have to guess what spring is doing and
then we will have to analyze the auto
wiring in order to find out what's
happening so while it's very good and
it's a good shortcut for a small amount
of beans if you have a huge system any
of a large amount of beans it's
generally recommended to do explicit
wiring and not go for auto wiring</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
