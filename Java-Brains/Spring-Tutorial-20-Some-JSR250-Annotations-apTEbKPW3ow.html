annotations so far we've seen the
required annotation and I've seen the
auto word annotation in this tutorial
we're going to look at some of the jsr
250 annotations JCR 250 is actually a
it's a standard the Java specification
request that defines all the standard
annotations that would apply across
different technology and different
frameworks spring support some of the
standard J's are 250 annotations we're
going to look at some of them in this
tutorial the first annotation that we
can look at is the add resource
annotation so let me remove this couple
of annotations that we've added in the
earlier tutorial so add resource is
another annotation that we can use to
inject dependencies into a member
variables of class now here I have the
center member variable of the circle
class and I have three point objects
point a point B and Point C now let's
say I want to add Point C a dependency
to the center now the other two divino
beans are not going to be used I'm just
going to use the Point C bean to inject
dependency into my circle class so what
I can do is I can use the add resource
annotation now this address or
sanitation is going to be from Java X or
an addiction because node this is a Java
specification route with jsr standard so
this is going to be from Java extra
annotation this is not specific to
spring now this address shows annotation
can do a dependency injection by name a
standard dependency injection by name so
all I need to do is in order to inject
Point C to this center member variable I
just need to say name equals
fine see it's as simple as that so it's
actually doing injection by names it's
going to look for a beam which has the
name as Point C I just wanna inject that
so I'm not specifying the dependency
here I'm specifying this not using water
wired by using address source and
resource is a jsr 250 annotation so it's
from java extra annotation dot resource
so this is the this is the annotation
that i'm using here and it's going to
just pick it up by name now let me save
and run this to make sure it picks up
point c there you go it's picked up
twenty zero which is Point C now there
are a few intelligent defaults that this
addresses goes for if I do not specify
the name what this is going to do is
it's going to look for a beam with the
same name as the member we built itself
now if I define this as Center let's
save this and let's say this it's going
to pick that up because it has the same
name as the member variable itself I'm
not defined a name so by default it goes
for the name of the member variable
itself now let's run this oops there
isn't it ah this is biggest point C is
used in triangles you have a dependency
to point C and I went ahead and change
this so that's C reason why let me just
come in this for now so that there's no
error so if I run this again there you
go it's picked up the beam which has the
same name as the member variable itself
so resource is the way in which we can
have use annotations to do dependency
injection
by name so you can specify the name and
then add the beam as a dependency or if
you do not specify the name property
here it just takes the name off the
member variable itself that way it's
similar to auto wired by name and it
picks up the beam with
the name as the member variable okay so
response is one of the several
annotations that comes with jsr 250 I'm
going to show you a couple of other
annotations which is related to the in
attend destroy of the lifecycle in the
earlier we used the init method and the
destroy method we use a couple of ways
in which we can run methods when the
beam is being utilized and when the beam
is about to be destroyed so we can do
the same thing using annotations also so
now let's say I have an init method here
let's call it initialize let me give it
a specific name initialize circle okay
so I'm I'm not having any naming
convention for the method itself so I
will use a system through our out dot
println circle okay so I want this
method to be called when this circle
bean itself is being initialized and I
will have a similar method for
destroying destroy Soaker and then put
int for destroy of circle so if I were
configuring this using XML what I would
do is I would have an init method and
destroy method for the circle definition
or I would have to implement the
initializing being and disposable bean
interfaces and specify the right name
for the method now here I have a custom
method name and I'm not even entering
the configuration in the XML I can use
the annotations for the initializing and
destroying the bean so that these
methods get call so the annotations are
at
post construct and at pre destroy so
again the names are self-explanatory
this is something that gets executed
after the beam has been initialized and
this is something that gets executed
just before the beam is destroyed now
notice that the imports are again from
Java external annotations because these
are J's are 250 annotations now this is
all it takes to execute this method when
the beam is about to be initialized and
this when the beam is about to be
destroyed let me save and run this they
go the init is done and drawing of
circle of course the destroy is not
happening here because I'm not I've not
registered the shutdown hook so let me
quickly do that as well
abstract application context and context
start register shutdown hook and that's
it now we should see the destruction
call as well so there you go
destroys happen so to summarize we've
learned three new annotations at
resource which lets specify a beam by
name which has to be injected to this
member variable of ours we have a post
construct and a pre destroy which allows
us to specify initialization and
destruction methods for our beans and
all these three annotations are from the
jsr 250 standard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
