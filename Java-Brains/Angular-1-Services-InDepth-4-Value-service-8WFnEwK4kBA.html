video where we had a list of contacts
which was pulling up hard coded values
and clicking on a list item would show
the details on the details page this is
cool but we weren't looking at services
and in order to illustrate the problem
with sharing data we going to need more
than one controller right now we have
just one controller which is the contact
controller so to simulate this scenario
I'm going to have a hypothetical header
and footer added to this just to kind of
have multiple controllers in here so
let's say I have a div here which is a
header I'm going to have ng-controller
it's going to be a header controller
call the controller as head and I'm
going to have a footer controller as
well at the very end
put a controller as foot now we need to
create these controllers in the apt rjs
so I'm going to have a couple more
controllers here hit a controller and
this is going to be photo controller I'm
going to create those functions over
here let's say this is where the
controller ends header controller footer
controller alright now what do I want to
show in the header and footer
controllers in the header and footer
sections rather let's say I want to show
the name of the application right so
let's say this is the my contact app I'm
going to move this to the header and I'm
going to call this my java brains
contact app okay very simple I'm going
to show the same thing on the footer as
well so here in the footer I'm going to
say
my java brains contact app now I can
refresh the page and it's going to show
me this header and footer right here I
know it looks ugly right now but you
don't care you just want to illustrate a
point here so what are we doing we're
having a message show up in the header
and having the same message show up in
the footer now let's say this is
something a little bit more at what it
is a lot of data here now we want to
have this data in one central place I
don't want this my java prints contact
app to show up in the markup in 100
different places so what I could do is I
could say this is my app cycle alright
so I can keep this in the scope I'm
gonna say footer controller dot app
title so what can you do the same thing
for the header as well let's say head
dot app title now is it a single place
where I can define that title and have
it work well unfortunately no because
those are referring to the scope so what
I'm going to have to do is in the header
scope I'm gonna have to say this app
title equals the style right I'm gonna
have to explicitly set that on the scope
similarly and I have to say the exact
same thing here need to set the scope on
both the header and the footer if I were
to do this it would still work without
any changes because it's actually
pulling from the scope now but look at
what we've done we have repeated this
data in multiple controllers wouldn't it
be nice if we were to have this data in
one central location and have it used in
these different places well turns out we
can and we can do that by using services
now there are different types of
services that you can use with angular
one service is called a value service
you can basically tell angular that
you're looking at a particular value
that you wanted to use in multiple
places the way to create a value
services by using the API app dot value
this takes in two parameters it's the
name of your value service
I'm gonna call this app name and then
the value of your value service which is
going to be my job rings that patient
all right so I'm creating a new value
and I'm giving it a name and I'm
registering it with the angular module
so now I'm angular knows that there is a
specific value that's given a name this
is currently a string this can be an
object it can be a number any value
given a name and now you can use this
value service in multiple controllers
how do you use a service in a controller
can you say angular give me the service
can I say angular dot get service well
no you don't as with other things in
angular you get something by declaring a
dependency there's a dependency
injection right so the way to get this
service I'm going to call this app name
SVC all right so this service is
injected into the controller by doing
this app name is resi and even over here
I'm going to pass in half name as we see
so the same service is injected into
both the header controller and the
footer controller now what I can do is
rather than have it be a hard-coded
string I'm going to assign it to add
name is VC which is a string value right
I've defined it in one place and I can
use it in multiple controllers now if I
were to refresh the page here you see
except the new value right it shows the
same thing in both the header and the
footer now I can change this to
something else now if i refresh it is
going to get that value in both these
places so it is actually a single then
it's just one instance of the string
that gets dependency injected into
multiple controllers if you're not
familiar with what dependency injection
is it's a way in which we can declare a
dependency on something and have angular
supplied to you you might have done this
with a dollar scope to have dollar scope
injected to your controller turns out
you can do the same thing that Services
is value
the value service and then you inject it
and that we can use that value in
multiple places and of course the markup
doesn't have to change it's the
controller where you're declaring the
dependency on the service and how
angular inject it for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
