how to make a post request so we've got
a message instance using a get now we're
going to create a new message using a
post and we going to see how to do that
using the Jackson's client okay so what
do you think would be the web target for
a post request here we know that the
post request for messages should go to
the root context slash messages which is
our messages target here so I'm going to
use this Web target to create a new
message by making a post request so
let's do that I'm going to create a new
message over here as new message and I'm
going to use the convenience constructor
over here to create an ID let's call it
for my new message from jax-rs client
and what do we have here the author I'm
just going to be myself I'll have a new
message over here now I can actually
make a post request with this message
and create it so I'm going to use the
messages target okay so it the way it
works is very similar to this right so
I'm going to use the messages target to
get hold of the web target I don't have
to do a resolve template over here
because there are no variable portions
at least until over here the variable
portion is only in this level we're
using this one so I've got the target
now I can do a request right so I'm
going to do dot request so I provide a
request I don't really care about the
media type over here the accept header
it doesn't matter now I can do a post so
we looked at a get method let's try a
post so you see here there's a post
which takes in an entity as an argument
so I'm going to do a post off new
message now as you can see here we've
got an error the post expects an object
of type entity what we are sending is an
object of type
message so we need to convert this
message instance into an entity instance
so this is the way the jax-rs API is
designed so the way to convert this is
by basically wrapping this instance up
into an entity so if you remember we got
a response object as a wrapper for what
we actually in were interested in then
we made a get request right so we kind
of messaged our class we didn't actually
get message to our class we got a
wrapper and we had to do a response dot
read entity so similarly when you're
sending something you don't actually
send just the message you send a wrapper
around that message so there are some
handy methods in the entity class so if
I do entity dot and let me import this
entity is from Java xws our ask line
entity now here you see there are a
bunch of methods about what kind of
content you want to send you want to
send HTML do you want to send JSON text
XML this is how you convert your message
instance to this JSON wrapper so I'm
going to do a JSON and then I'm going to
pass in what it is that I actually want
to send all right now this is going to
give me let me put it into a new local
variable here this is a post response
okay now I'm like I can actually do let
me remove these other system doubts so
I'm going to do a sawed off post
response alright so what are we doing
here we're doing the same thing that we
did for a get but here since it's a post
we need to send the object to the post
request so we cannot just send the
object itself we need to convert it into
an XML or a JSON or any of those content
types you've already seen that's how it
works right we're using postman you
don't send a Java instance you send a
representation using XML or JSON this is
the way you convert your Java instance
to JSON so entity is the class that we
are using it has a few handy methods for
different content types that we are
sending let's run it you're not going to
get anything useful in the response but
I'm going to show this anyway you see
this we get inbound jax-rs response like
we did before okay you see we get a
status 201 and we got created but we
need to unwrap this response read entity
again we know that we're getting a
message back so I'm going to do message
duck class and I'm going to take this
out actually so that I get more details
about the message and create a new local
variable call it created message created
message dot get message all right let's
run this and there is our newly created
message echoed back all right so this is
how you would make a post request to
create a new message doing a put request
to update an existing messages fairly
similar here rather than doing a
messages target dot request dot post
what you would do as a single message
target dot resolve template off your
message that you want to update dot
request dot but you would still do a
entity dot JSON off the object that you
are trying to update what needs to go in
the request bar
I need to choose the content type for it
right so this is what this thing does
alright so there's one thing that we saw
when we did this that I want to
highlight when you get a response you
notice you got a 201 status right but
when you do a message of you know
response dot read entity off message and
get the actual message you've basically
unwrapped that response object and got
the entity out of it once you get this
you don't have the response status
anymore right so the response wrapper is
there for a reason it has more
information about the response that you
got back from the server the most
important of which in my opinion is the
status code so think about something
like this once you do a post response
right once you get a post response after
you make a request you could actually
examine the response status code and
based on the status you could do a read
entity and get the actual entity our
throw an error for instance you could do
something like this if post response get
status is not equal to 201 then you can
do a this out I'm just going to print an
error here but you can imagine some kind
of an error handling that happens over
here right so this is very important for
checking if what you sent was actually
updated successfully or not right is a
very good way of checking it and if you
see some of the other methods over here
in the post response object you have
access to things like cookies you have
access to things like headers so the
response object is a really cool way of
getting that extra information that you
don't get by just the entity and that's
actually one of the reasons why you
would want to do a get here rather than
a get off the message class if you
remember if I don't send in the class
what you get back is a response and now
once you get one of the response you can
actually examine the status you can
examine the headers the cookies and all
that stuff so that's that's really handy
all right so I'm going to just revert
this back to what it was before but
hopefully that made sense there are
different ways in which you can achieve
a lot of things over here a lot of these
methods have multiple signatures it's
not going to be practical for me to
cover all these different combinations
but hopefully this gives you a good
introduction I encourage you to check
out the documentation for a lot of these
classes they have some really good good
documentation really good method
signatures over there that you can use
in your projects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
