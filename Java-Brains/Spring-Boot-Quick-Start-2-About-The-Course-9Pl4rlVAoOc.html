course first we're gonna be looking at
what spring boot is and why we need to
use it as with any technology that I try
to learn the first thing I'm going to
ask is why was that technology been
created and what is the benefit that I'm
going to get out of it so we're going to
be answering both those questions you
know when we understand what spring boot
is we are then going to be building an
end-to-end application like I mentioned
it's going to be a controller a data
layer or service layer everything we're
going to have an end-to-end flow and
it's going to be a restful api that is
something we're going to build from the
scratch using springboard the EBA we're
going to build is for a course
management system much like Java brains
you have topics and you have courses
that belong to those topics so we're
going to create a bunch of REST API
endpoints for instance we start with
slash topics or when we make a get
request we're going to get a list of all
the topics that are in the system and
now I can make a post request to slash
topics and create a new topic I can make
a put request to slash topics slash the
topic ID in order to update the topic
and I can make a delete request to slash
topic slash ID to delete that particular
topic we also have courses which belong
to topics so for instance you can have a
post request made to slash topics slash
Java slash courses and we make a request
which creates a course in the topic of
Java and now if I were to make a get
request to slash topic slash Java slash
courses we're going to get that
particular course and the topic that it
belongs to and then we can also make the
post put a delete request for the course
resource as well so this is the API
we're going to be building in this
course and why we built our API we're
going to be looking at some Springwood
features what are the things that
springboard helps us with when it comes
to creating that application and then
finally we're going to be looking at
some configuration and customization
options that Springwood provides my goal
for this course is when you're done
watching this you should
have all the necessary knowledge and
information to be able to create a
spring application from the scratch and
I don't mean a simple hello world
application I mean the complete
end-to-end API which has controller all
the way to a data tier connecting to the
database and you will have that
knowledge and you will have the ability
to create that app when you're done
watching this course that's my goal and
hopefully we'll be able to achieve it
together so let's get started that's the
first question what is spring boot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
