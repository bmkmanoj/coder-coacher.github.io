what he wanted to do right we wanted to
pass in the behavior and then execute
that behavior but it kind of does but I
think there is some extra work that
we're doing over here we are not just
passing in a behavior we are passing a
thing that has a behavior you're not
passing in a perform method you're
passing a greeting which has a method
which is the perform wouldn't it be cool
if we had just an action being passed in
rather than a class that implements an
action now here
would it be cool if we just pass that
action in and then this executes the
action well lambdas set out to achieve
just this lambdas lets you create these
entities which are just functions they
are called lambda expressions which are
just functions which do not belong to a
class they're not methods of a class
they're just functions which exist in
isolation and here's the best part those
functions can be treated as values this
is kind of confusing for somebody who's
totally used to object-oriented
programming and they haven't done
functional programming so let me explain
what I mean by that what I mean by
functions has values you know what
inline values are right so you have
let's say you have a string or a double
or an integer you can define them in
line so here is an example of a string
called name being declared and assign
the value of foo foo is a string which I
have written in line and when this
executes it takes this inline value and
assigns it to the variable name so name
contains a value which is the string foo
this should be obvious
similarly 3.14 is a double value which
is assigned to pi so we know that data
acts as values in Java you can assign it
to variables we can assign it to
different types
similarly objects act as you a user in
Java you can assign an instance of an
object to a variable now the question is
can we assign a block of code to a
variable as a value so the value is not
the execution of the block of code
the block of code itself piece of code
becomes a value that gets assigned to a
variable and that wherever the variable
goes a piece of code goes with it is
that possible can we do something like
this have a block of code which is the
value which is the steps that need to be
executed right here you can have lines
of Java code that possible now let's
take a look at this for a minute what is
the standard way in which we write a
block of code in Java before Java 8 of
course well it's the method right you
create a method which contains a block
of code it has input arguments that has
a return it does how we typically do it
imagine if you could take a method and
assign it to a variable and again note
that I'm not saying execute the method
and assign the return to a very pressing
assign the method itself the method
becomes a thing that gets assigned to a
variable can you do that now let's say I
have this perform method this is the one
we just saw right you have a perform
method which is a public returns a wide
and it has system dot out dot print now
what if I were to assign this to a
variable called the block of code this
is possible in Java 8 using lambda you
can write a lambda expression which does
just this and once you do this you can
take that variable a block of code and
pass it around and have different other
pieces of code executed which is really
exciting so let's see how to write this
lambda expression the code that you're
looking at has a lot of extra things
which you don't need for instance let's
take a look at this public public makes
sense when a function is a part of a
class in a method right you need to know
if a method is a public or a private or
a protected because it makes sense in
the context of a class but if a function
exists in isolation doesn't make sense
to call it public the function is
accessible by whoever has that variable
let's get rid of that next let's look at
the name then you assign a string to a
variable what's the name that you refer
that string by it's the name of the
variable you don't have to give it
another name similarly when you assign
this function to available call the
block of code the way you would refer to
this function is using that variable
name you're going to use a block of code
name to access the function which means
that it doesn't need this other name
let's get rid of that too now the
creators of the Java spec could have
rested here and say okay this is how you
create a lambda expression but they
actually went a step further and you see
when you look at this code if I were to
show you this code and say can you tell
me what they returned diapers you don't
need to look at this wide you can
actually look at the code and figure out
what the return type is right it doesn't
return anything so it's a Y so the Java
compiler is now smart enough to do just
that the Java compiler says hey if
you're writing a lambda expression don't
tell me what the return type is I can
look at the code and figure it out if
you have a return 5 over here the
compiler knows yes this is something
that return an integer if you have a
return hello world here it knows this
something that returns a string it's an
object it knows what type it is so the
compiler will know what the return type
is based on the expression itself so
turns out in Java 8 you don't have to
provide the return type over here for
lambda expression so even that goes away
so this is what's left these are the
elements that you need to provide in
order to write a lambda expression so we
took a function that we know we know how
to write that method right we started
out with the per file method so we
removed all the things that we don't
need to specify when that becomes a
lambda expression you don't have to
specify public for a lambda you don't
have to specify the return type you
don't have to specify the name so with
that what's left is this parentheses
which indicate the arguments and then
the block of code ok so the syntax is
pretty much this for a lambda expression
except for one small addition the
addition is you need to put this symbol
over here you need to put that between
the parenthesis and the block of code if
you put this so there you go you've got
your lambda expression so if you know
how to write a method in Java you now
know how to write a lambda expression in
Java you need to convert these steps in
your mind till you get comfortable and
after that you'll be writing these
expressions directly in order to write a
lambda expression take a method remove
the modifiers right you'll need the
public private you don't need the name
of the method and you don't need the
return type now what's left
is a lambda expression except for adding
the symbol blood which kinda looks like
an arrow okay you put this between the
parenthesis and the curly braces you
have got your lambda expression of this
lambda expression can be assigned to a
variable you can actually do this in
Java 8 and this variable contains the
value which is that function right
there's one further shortcut that you
can do if your body of the lambda
expression is just one line here just
one language system dot out dot print so
if that's just one line you can actually
remove the curly braces so it just
becomes this you have the parentheses
the arrow and then that line of coure
but remember this is only if you have
just one line of code in your lambda
expression if you have multiple lines
then you're going to need the curly
braces okay this is how you write lambda
expressions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
