what proxy objects are and how hibernate
provides proxy objects for us
we'll also understand what the eager and
lazy method of fetching is this is a
very important tutorial this is this
addresses the basics the fundamentals of
how hibernate works I wish I could mark
a star or something because this is
really important so okay let me remove
this the generator and collection ID
that we had in the previous tutorial
really you don't need that for this one
okay so we'll go back to the standard JP
annotation nothing hibernate specific
here what we've done is we have defined
a join table with the name and the
primary key ID so again to recap we have
a list of address objects in our user
entity and we're saving that as a
separate table now here is a question
say I have this you know I have this
persisted in the database and now I need
to retrieve this so how do I do that I
use the same thing I use a session
factory to open a new session so I've
closed this the audio session which are
used for saving the user object as
closed now after that I open the new
session and then I do a session dot get
the first parameter is the class name
user details start class and then the
second parameter is the ID the ID is one
because I don't need to define the
session again
now this get I will save in my user
object because I'll initialize it as
null just to make sure that we are
studying this clean slate we this could
be any other object just to prove that
this is what is a sign am I'm assigning
the value is null so here it's asking me
for the cast I assume yeah it's
returning an object I'll have to cast
this okay there you go now I have the
user object here this will fetch the you
know the results and you know it will
assign this there's only one user object
which has the primary key of one
obviously so it's returning that object
I'm casting it as user details and I'm
assigning it to the user object here now
here's a question
this user object has a list inside it
right it has this array list which is
the list of addresses now how would we
normally get you know a list of
addresses inside a user object say we
are not using hibernate okay now how
would we get the user details we would
run a query and we get the user data and
then the second query would be to get
the addresses of this user so I have the
user ID as 1 now what I have do is I had
run a query to get all addresses where
the user ID is 1 simple enough now if I
wanted a particular set of addresses I
could restrict it in the weight class
and aggregate only those addresses and
if I wanted just the user information I
would just go to the user table and get
the user information now when I'm doing
the session dot get here what is
actually getting pulled up we're getting
the user object right now this user
object has an ArrayList of addresses so
the question is does the whole list of
addresses get pulled up if the answer is
yes then another question say I have
hundred addresses for a particular user
ok this add this user has been traveling
all over the world is he or she has
addresses by a huge list and now they're
that user has state and all these
addresses now will have a huge amount of
data now when I'm pulling up this user
information do all those addresses also
get pulled up if it is yes then what is
the cost what is the performance impact
now I move on all those are addresses to
get pulled up if I'm only interested in
say the user name now why would I want
to put up all the addresses as well now
to answer this question
we'll have to look at what is called as
a fetch strategy now hibernate implies a
strategy to solve this problem now if
you want to use just the user
information you can ask hibernate not to
pull up all the you know address
information in fact that is the default
behavior of hibernate unless you
configure it otherwise
now if I do a session dot gait of user
it is not pulling up the list of
addresses as well even though the user
object has this list of addresses here
you know if you just access it you know
if you just look at the state of the
user object here when this gets executed
you will see that the addresses list is
not initiated but however if you use the
getter method here now say I use the
getter method user dot get list of
addresses now the moment I use this
Gator method that's when hibernate goes
and runs another query to the database
and fetches the list of addresses now
why does it do this way and how does it
do this why is fairly simple to answer
like we've already said if you just
interested in the user data say this
user has a few other information inside
the user details itself like our phone
number few other things and you want to
fetch only that there's no point in
fetching the list of addresses so you
fetch the list of addresses only when
you're accessing the list of addresses
so the Gator the first time you use this
Gator it would fetch the data so it is
more efficient it doesn't just pull up
all the data that's there and you know
say my user details has five such lists
like this in each list has 100 objects
inside it let's run it kinetic forever
to get one object while I'm just
interested in the name because it's
going to pull all those lists and all
the data associated with the list and
you know that's all going to be in vain
if you're not using it so the why is
fairly clear you use it only you know
you get it only when you use it so this
kind of strategy is called lazy
initialization and heibon
so what lazy initialization means that
you do not initialize the entire object
you only initialize the first level
variables the first level member
variables of the object and then you
initialize the lists only when you
actually access it so that's lazy and
the opposite of that is Evangelization
you can configure happening to do that
as well when you when you make the you
know the object use eager initialization
then what you're saying is hey hibernate
I don't care how many lists are there I
want you to fetch all the related data
so if there is a list in the users
object get all the values of that list
so this is something that's going to
take a lot of resources it's going to
take a lot of time so you should do this
only if we need the device you have to
stick to the defaults which is lazy
initialization so now that we know the
why we'll have a look at how hibernate
does this and what's going on here you
are here calling a getter of this object
and you're saying that when this Gator
runs hibernate pulls out all the values
how is it possible my Gator here it's
just this return list of addresses is
just returning a value this is the only
line of code that runs when you know I
called the Gator now how can hibernate
get all the values when I'm calling this
Gator well is not really nothing
happening the very hibernate does this
is by using what's called as a proxy
class now what's happening in the proxy
classes hibernate instead of getting the
actual object that you're looking for it
gets you the a proxy the first time it's
it's a dynamic subclass of your actual
object how it works you do a session
target of the user class now what happen
it does is instead of giving you this
user class directly which means pulling
all the values and then packaging into
this into this user class and then
handing it over to you instead of doing
that what hibernate does is it cleverly
creates this proxy user class ok this
proxy user class is a subclass of the
user tales and has the same methods now
with the proxy user class does is
instead of fetching the values and
populating it into the object and
sending it back to the you know as a
result of the gate what it does is it
probably fills in all the first level
values say a list of addresses it does
not get because it's going to be a huge
list now it's going to get this proxy
user class created and then it's going
to hand you the object of proxy user
class not the actual user class you
wouldn't know because it implements the
same methods now a gate ID would
probably have parent gate ID call so
whatever code you would write would
still work on your object that you've
got here but it's not aa pure user class
object it's a proxy use a class object
and same thing forget name gate name
would probably do a parent dot get name
so when you call a gate name actually
your code is getting executed even
though it's through this proxy but since
your code is getting executed you don't
have to worry about it you wouldn't even
have to know that's you get whatever you
call the method gets executed which is
fine now consider this list the one that
we are talking about we have a gate list
of addresses now instead of pulling up
all these values and handing it over to
you hand it up
proxy user class which does not have the
complete list of addresses now let's say
you made a call to this gate list of
addresses obviously since you have the
proxy object you would be making a call
to this one the method of the proxy user
class this this method will have code to
first fetch the values from the database
so that's the first thing it does it
just execute the query to fetch the
records from the database and populate
the list of addresses member variable
after it does that then it does a parent
dot get list of addresses so after it
gets all the values then it calls the
parent method so your Gator will run
fine but then what's actually happening
is before you get a runs it pulls up all
the values from the database so this
ensures two things one you don't have to
worry about what's what object you're
getting your your object that you get is
still a user class you know it fulfills
there is a relationship because you're
having a subclass here but but since
you're having a proxy it makes a call
and gets the records just in time and it
then calls the parent objects method so
that as far as the consumer of the
object is concerned they don't have to
worry about whether the garda proxy
they've got an actual object everything
works fine but as well as understanding
hibernate is concerned this is what's
happening behind the scenes hibernate is
providing a proxy and then it's
returning an instance of the proxy in
order to validate our understanding
let's do a quick check I will get the
size of this list of addresses and I'll
print it this is tuner out okay now this
should return the value of two because
we're saving two addresses so I have
saved the user object initialize it to
null and then doing a session dot get
and I'm calling the dot size so if I run
this what happens is hibernate is
filling up a proxy object here for the
user and I'm calling the get list of
addresses dot size of this proxy object
the proxy object when it you know sees
this get list of addresses which want to
fetch the values from the database and
it's going to print out the size there
you go the value is two which is fine
now in order to identify that this is a
proxy object and not the actual user
object I'll do do a small test here what
I will do is before I get the list of
addresses before the proxy object gets
the list of addresses and saves it as a
member variable I will do a session dot
close so I'll close off the session
before the proxy object gets a chance to
get the list of addresses now what
happens when I access this after the
session is closed now after the session
is closed the proxy object does not have
a session forward to get the list of
addresses so we will end up with an
error let's test that out they execute
this there you go we get an exception
and the exception is called lazy
initialization exception and it says
fail to lazily initialize a collection
of a roll
and no session or session was closed so
our proxy is not able to get the values
because the session is already been
closed so there are two ways to address
this problem if we need the session to
be closed and then we need there's a
possibility that we can access a list
after the session is closed and we want
hibernate to pull up everything is to go
to this you know the element collection
and addiction where we have defined this
to be an element collection I can
configure hibernate to fetch this
collection eagerly instead of a lazy
which is a default I want the fetch type
to be eager in which case whenever I do
a whenever I do a get it's going to
fetch all the values it's not going to
wait for the first access in order to
fetch it so I do
fetch type fetch equals again the plus
control space I come up with two options
eager and lazy both are in immolations
of the fetch type so I make it as eager
and save and when I run this again so
the value shows up as two because even
though the session is closed
the eager configuration that I did that
make sure that it gets the entire object
and even though it's returning with a
proxy now you're not getting the actual
object you are actually getting the
proxy but still you're making the fish
type as eager so that you know it
fetches all the values now why would it
still read on the proxy the fetch type
is eager because there could be another
collection here for which you know you
haven't configured and the fish type is
lazy by default so in that case the
proxy will fetch only that lazily and
this collection it's going to fetch
equally</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
