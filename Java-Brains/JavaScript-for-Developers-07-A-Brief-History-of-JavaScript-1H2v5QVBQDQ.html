about the history of JavaScript the
history of JavaScript is particularly
particularly important because like I
said the reasons why JavaScript was
created affects the way it behaves in
the way it was designed so let's take a
brief look at the history so JavaScript
was created by this guy called Brendan
Eich at Netscape you know this was
during the time of the browser wars in
the mid-90s
the two popular browser vendors were
Netscape with the Netscape Navigator and
Microsoft with Internet Explorer so
Brendan Eich was you know he joined
Netscape and he was tasked with the
effort to create some kind of a
scripting language for Netscape that
runs on the browser so Java was really
really popular in those days and Java
had the concept of applets which let you
build client-side applications so it it
was the rich client application model of
those days you could create applets and
and have this rich client experience on
the browser so Brendan was tasked with
the effort of creating the scripting
language for the browser and he created
this language he called it live script
but people wanted to use the popularity
of Java in those days so they called it
JavaScript that's a whole long story
that I don't want to get into but that
has actually caused a lot of confusion
among developers of JavaScript itself
javascript has nothing to do with Java
this just has the name portion of the
name is Java purely because of marketing
reasons nothing else javascript was
created to complement Java right you use
Java to build server side applications
and you use JavaScript for client-side
applications at least that was the idea
so Brendan rushed to create JavaScript
fun fact JavaScript was created roughly
around 10 days yes you heard that right
it was created in 10 days and it was
rushed to production it was filled with
bugs of course it did not have all the
features that we know of JavaScript
today but it was the first version and
there were some mistakes made some of
them
still live in the language to this day
so that was the origin of JavaScript and
some of the motives behind JavaScript
was to make it easy to use easy for
newcomers that was one of the design
goals of the language contrast that to
Java which was considered the
professional language which advanced
developers would use javascript was
considered an easy scripting language
for anybody to get into right even
people who are new to programming would
just pick up some basic concepts and
then use JavaScript this is an important
important point because this has
affected a lot of the design decisions
in JavaScript JavaScript as it is after
the box is a very forgiving language
okay what I mean by forgiving if you
write code in Java and you make a
mistake the compiler is going to yell at
you right it has the program has to be
perfect before the compiler even
generates the byte code that is
drastically different from JavaScript in
the case of JavaScript the interpreter
it doesn't end the program that right it
makes assumptions right it forgives your
mistakes makes assumptions and proceeds
for the execution this was consciously
decided in the part of the you know the
JavaScript developers because they
wanted the language to be easy to use
they didn't want new developers to get
bogged down by all these rules and have
the program be just perfect they wanted
the language to be forgiving so that
newcomers who possibly would make
mistakes could still have the program
run right this is both good and bad
there are certain things certain
assumptions that the interpreter makes
which can be very surprising and very
unexpected so I'll talk about some of
those assumptions that it makes and some
things to watch out for as we go along
this course so but you know that was
that was the design decision that was
javascript was designed to be easy for
newcomers once javascript was created
there was a rush to make it a standard
again this was due to the competition
between Microsoft and net
Cape I'm not going to go into the
details but Netscape decided to
standardize the language when you say
standardize it means that there is a
specification for the language and once
you follow the specification any browser
that claims to run JavaScript should
work with the language that's built
according to the specification okay so
JavaScript was standardized by a
committee called Atma and the name got
assign hikmah script okay so when you
hear the name ACMA script it's nothing
different from JavaScript and JavaScript
is also sometimes referred to as like
mascot now there are different versions
of Vecna script right now where the
latest version of the specification is
egg mask group 6 so if you hear 8 my
script 6 you know that's what it is
right now egg my script 6 is not fully
supported across browsers the best
chances are fully supported
you know specification is egg my script
5 so a lot of this course is going to
cover ECMO script 5 I am going to
mention a few concepts that's introduced
in ich muss crypt 6 and when that comes
up I'm going to highlight that it is a
new version it may not be supported in
all browsers so if you want to play safe
you should use only the specification
ACMA script 5 as of today as of me
recording this video this could again
change in the future and I'm sure it
will but as of today
ikema script 5 is your safest bet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
