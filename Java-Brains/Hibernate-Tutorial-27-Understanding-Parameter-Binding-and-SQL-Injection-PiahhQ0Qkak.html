what is parameter binding it's a way in
which you can bind specific values to
parameters in your sequel query now we
have this example we know we did this
earlier we did a from user details where
the ID greater than 5 so my intention is
to pull up all the user records whose ID
is greater than the value 5 and just to
recap the code that's happening here is
I'm just pulling up the list of all the
users as per the query here and then I'm
printing out the user name for all those
users ok so now in the scenario like
this you know where I say user ID is
greater than a particular value normally
what would happen is this value would
not be hard-coded this would probably be
a value from a different variable and I
would have to happen the variable over
here so what would happen is normally I
would have a int when user ID say this
would have been set as value Phi
somewhere else in the in the application
and then I'm getting this variable now I
have to create a query where I need to
pull up all the user details for the ID
is greater than this the value of this
variable so what I would do here is I
would say plus then user ID this will
work fine now if I run this it will pull
up the list of users after the 5th user
and you can see here the query is also
getting updated with this but this is
actually a potential security problem
now this leads to what is called as
sequel query injection or sometimes just
called a sequel injection now what this
means is that you can inject some values
into the query and you can get results
which is not the intended result no an
attacker
a hiker of your application can use this
kind of a way of adding values to the
query to manipulate their user inputs so
that you get data which is not really
intended now let's take for example this
mini user ID which gives it the value of
five here let's say this came from user
input now the user entered the value of
five and now we are passing this on and
you are generating the results and
you're displaying it so now let's say
the the attacker the attacker is going
to try a few things to see if you know
the he or she can break into the system
somehow so one thing that the attacker
might try is something like this now
let's say I realize that there is a
chance that the application might be
doing like it's just adding the
parameter to the query so what I do is I
enter a particular value in my user
input now let's say I enter something
like this okay first let me make this as
the string but most of the UI frameworks
at least at least on web applications
most of the UI frameworks have user
inputs being received as strings so it
is uh it is you know it's very easy to
do sequel injection on strings I'm not
able to recollect if you can do this
with an integer datatype but it strings
yes it's fairly easy if you're writing
queries like this to do sequel injection
now let's say I have a string input
where the user is actually entering the
value and say the user can enter a value
from 1 to 10 and then I'm substituting
the value here now let's say the user
enters a value like this let's say it's
5 R 1 equals 1 so now what I am doing
here is I am closing this where Clause
of the where is over here where user ID
is greater than now I'm closing this
where clause by entering a value and
then I'm also adding an R and then I'm
giving a expression that's always going
to be true so no matter whatever is the
result of this first word
the second where Klaus is always going
to be true so it's going to return me
all the records in the table so now
let's run this see what happens and here
you see all the records have been pulled
up so this is the V in which a sequel
injection can happen now
this is not really an ideal example
because we have a user ID greater than
of the user can enter a user ID of min
user ID of zero and still managed to get
all the records but I hope you're
getting the point here the point here is
that irrespective of what where clause
you are actually having here the user
can bypass the where clause and inject
their own where clause and do anything
they want with it they could as well
have a semicolon here so that they end
the query and then try the whole new
query be it a delete from table you know
so that they can delete all the records
in the table so there's a lot of high
work that a user can cause if we are
doing sequel Edition I'd sort of
something else are we going to talk
about if we just do a try you know
concatenation then we are here at risk
of such kind of attacks so the solution
for this problem is to do parameter
substitution so that's what we're going
to look at and look at how hibernate
helps us to do this parameter
substitution or parameter binding as
it's called so let's take this example
itself now I will have string in user ID
as fine say okay so this is the input
that I've got from the user now what
I'll do is instead of adding that value
to this string here what I'm going to do
is I'm going to say this is actually a
parameter and it cannot be a snippet or
the query let me let me just write this
here so that it becomes clear now what
I'll do here is I
have a parameter in this query say
something like this now this question
mark is a placeholder for where the
parameter needs to go so I'm telling
hibernate that I have one parameter here
and this parameter needs to be
substituted with the value that I'm
going to supply now so now that I have
put a placeholder there I need to supply
this value to Happiny the way I'm going
to supply the value is by using query
dot set now in this query dot said you
have a few data types you can see here
you have a set binary you have a set
boolean you have set character set date
so all these are indicative of the data
type that you wanna add over here now in
my case the data type is an int so I
will set integer now the integer set
integer takes two parameters I outside
the first parameter is zero and I will
explain why in a minute
now the second parameter has to be the
integer value that I want to substitute
so since I have a string I will use the
integer percent and I will pass the
value main user ID
so what I'm doing is I am substituting
the value of this parameter into the
query at a placeholder now this works
fine for string placeholders as well now
this were a it's a string comparison say
I had a like operator or something like
that then I would use a query dart set
string and the same thing would work now
let's save and try to run this let's see
what happens so they go it's actually
pulling up the data file now we look at
what the zero means zero is a position
indicator now I could have multiple
parameters here and in order to set
parameter values I need to specify which
placeholder will be substituted with
which parameter now let's have a look at
let's modify this query a but let's see
where user ID greater than question mark
and use the name equals and I will give
a username value here so let me add me
to clear another string use the 10 so I
will need to substitute the value of
this input username over here of course
in this particular scenario these two
are redundant but just go with me here
now this parameter substitution has also
done by using a question mark now how
will you know what needs to be
substituted with what are these how will
hibernate know what needs to be
substituted with what and that's the
reason why we have this position
indicator zero it is the first question
mark so it starts looking from the left
and it sees the first question mark
that's zero now the second question mark
is one so if I need to set this the
first parameter here has to be one and
then the second parameter has to be the
value of course so what I will do here
is ill again do a query Rods query dot
set this time I'll do a string
so again it takes two parameters now
I'll pass the second you know this time
I'm going to pass the first parameters
one because I want this question mark to
be substituted with this value and then
the second parameter is of course the
value that needs to be substituted this
will be use the name which is this one
so now if I run this they go user then
comes up actually that's the only one
that should come up because username as
a more restrictive criteria you can try
out the sequel injection example that I
told you earlier it will not work on
this scenario where you're actually
plugging in the parameters because you
know you're saying I'm going to plug in
a parameter and then you put a where
clause and it happen it detects this and
says hey something is going wrong and
then it will not run the query okay so
this is one way we can do this there is
another way if you're not if you don't
want to be bothered about the positions
and you want to you know just write the
query and then substitute parameters
directly there is another way you can do
this and the way to do that is by using
this colon and the parameter name so
what you can do is instead of putting
random placeholders which do not have
any significant meaning and you're
attaching meaning to it depending on the
position of the placeholders instead
this way you attach a name to the
placeholder and then you substitute the
parameters to the name so I'm going to
put another place folder here called
user name so the way I put a named
placeholder is by using a colon and
giving it a name so now that I have two
named placeholders here I can set these
two parameters to the names without
having to worry about where the clicks
water is actually are and without having
to worry about the position of those
placeholders so now if you look at this
query dot set integer method let's know
this aside okay now if i do a control
space i see that there are two query dot
set integers one it takes an integer
as the first argument and the second
method that takes a string as a second
as the first argument so this is what we
need to look at now the first method is
a positional placeholder substitution
where you specify the position which is
an integer the second method is the name
placeholder substitution where you have
to specify the name so this is a string
so what I'll do is I'll use this option
now the name will be user ID so I need
to give user ID as a string and of
course the second argument will be the
same it will be the value itself so I'm
going to substitute that here okay in
the same way the query dorcette string
has to take this name as the first
argument as a string so a pass use the
name as the first argument so again what
we're doing here is instead of putting a
question mark and then assigning
parameters based on the position of the
question mark we are putting
placeholders with names and then we are
assigning arguments parameters to those
names in the placeholders so we save and
run this there you go the user shows up
because the query is run fine so these
are the two ways in which we can do
parameter substitution and it is highly
recommended that we use parameter
substitution for any queries with
parameters instead of just obtaining
parameters because appending parameters
might lead to sequel injection attacks
so this is a safer way to add parameters
to your queries</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
