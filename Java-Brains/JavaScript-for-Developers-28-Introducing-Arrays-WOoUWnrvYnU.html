arrays is again a common structure in
many programming languages it's when you
have a sequence of values that you want
to access in an indexed based way then
you would use something like arrays so
an array can be defined in JavaScript by
using the syntax you have a VAR variable
name equals and then a list which you
are defining in line you remember I told
you how an object can be defined in line
by using the curly brace open close
curly brace similarly an array can be
defined in line using the open close
square brackets with the individual
values separated by commas and the way
to access these values is using the
square bracket operator which you should
be familiar with so we have a square
bracket and then you give the array
index to access the value at that
location
note that JavaScript arrays as with most
other languages are 0 based so the first
element is index 0 so to access hundred
here I use my array of 0 okay so my
array of 1 gives me 200 my array of 2
gives me 300 and what is my array of 3
gives me in this case there is no fourth
element what happens if I access this
can you guess based on what we have seen
so far can you guess what the value of
an array access where the index is out
of bounds
would give me let's try this out clear
this out again I'm going to say var my
array equals open close square bracket
now let me have an an array of strings I
say hello world j/s okay so this is a
simple array of 3 strings and yeah 3
elements in the array now if I were to
access console.log my array
of zero me reload and run just going to
give me the first element because it's
zero based if ever two acts access my
array of one let me actually do this
here this is another way you can you can
evaluate expressions in the browser
rather than type console that log here
you can just type in the expression here
and we've seen this it's going to
execute it so let's say my array off one
hit enter just going to give me world my
array of two it's going to give me J s
now what happens if I do my array of
three I'm going to get the value
undefined so this is how things work in
JavaScript arrays just like you just
like it worked with objects right so if
you access an object but the property
doesn't exist it would give you
undefined similarly if you access an
array where the array index is out of
bounds it does not exist the value you
get back is undefined you do not get an
error you don't get an array out of
bounds error it just returns undefined
now some of the concepts about arrays
now how do you add a value to an array
now let's say I have three elements in
the array I want to add the fourth
element so I want to add my array of
three so the way to do that is to say my
array of three equals and give it a
value you can give any value one here
but basically it adds to whichever
location you you choose so let's say I
say Java brings here and if we load and
run I'm going to get this back but now
if I were to access my array you see
here it has that fourth element which is
Java brings it is at index 3 so that's
all it takes
all you have to do is to just assume
that that location is available in the
array and put the value at that location</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
