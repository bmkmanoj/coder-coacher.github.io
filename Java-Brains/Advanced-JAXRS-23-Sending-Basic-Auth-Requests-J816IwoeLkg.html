works I'm going to show you how you can
make a basic got authentication request
from a client plugin so we've used
postman browser plugin to make recipe
requests so far postman has this feature
for doing basic authentication in your
less dpi request this process is
different for different plugins and
there are like a bunch of different
browser plugins which let you make REST
API calls I'm going to demonstrate this
with postman once you know how this
works with this plugin should be fairly
simple to translate this information to
the plug-in of your choice on the
browser of your choice so I have postman
open over here the way to send
authentication basic authentication
information you request is using this
tab over here right now we have normal
selected you see here there is this tab
which says basic auth so if you click on
it it gives you an option of entering
the username and the password
so what we've learned in the previous
lesson is you with basic auth you need
to take the username add to it the Kulin
and then following that is the password
and then you do a base64 encoding and
add it to the header right so you don't
have to manually do this this control
lets you do that automatically so here
let's say I have user name as user and
the password as password now all I have
to do is click refresh headers and now
this plug-in has actually done the work
for us you see here it has added the
authorization header and it's added the
value which is basic space and the
base64 encoded value which is the
username colon password right we've
learned this in the previous tutorial
it's doing all that for us right it's
doing the base64 encoding and preparing
this header information now all that's
left to do is enter your request URL
over here and click send the header
value is already prefilled okay so
hopefully this makes sense this is very
simple basic auth being done by a
browser plugin so postman also has a
different version it's a newer version
as of today you see here it says get
postman 3.0 there is a very good chance
that you're going to be using postman
3.0 while you're watching this tutorial
so I'm going to show you how to do that
as well so here is the postman 3.0
window again the concept is the same you
have this authorization section over
here right now it's a it's not
I can choose basic auth over here again
it gives the user name in the password
like an enter the user and the password
and when I click on update request now
we see here that has gone to the header
the authorization header with the value
basic space and the base64 encoded value
so this is what we're going to use to
send base64 authorized request to our
API we're going to implement an API in
the next lesson which does base64
authentication so it's going to look at
this value and then take the username
and password out of it and authenticate
okay so this is what we're going to use
to send that request to our API that we
can develop next and if you can see here
there are a bunch of other
authentication mechanisms in these
plugins you see digest start we kind of
briefly mentioned that in the previous
lesson there's also oauth 1.0 so these
as you can see have a whole lot more
inputs to fill and we're not going to
worry about that in this course we're
just doing basic auth so hopefully the
way to send this request is not here
let's go to the next lesson where we
actually implement an authenticated REST
API</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
