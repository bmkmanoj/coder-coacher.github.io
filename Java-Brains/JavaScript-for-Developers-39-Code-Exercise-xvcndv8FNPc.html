I'm going to give you an exercise to try
out and in the next video I'm gonna
explain the solution the exercise is to
create a person object like this and
have an address object within them I
want you to create a nested address
object so it would look something like
this I'll retain the get full name here
you can probably take this code
pause the video just type out this code
and then I do it I want you to have an
address property which is a a nested
object and this could have something
like street
and then city
and state okay so there is an address
subject with the street city and state
what I want you to do is create a is
from state property on this address
object which takes in a state as an
argument a string state as an argument
and returns true or false as to whether
this person object is from that state or
not okay so let's say I choose the state
as California here let's take this out
but what I would like to do is have that
function there so that I can say person
dot this from state and I pass in
California this should return true
because the state matches the state here
okay
if I pass something else ABC it should
return false because this does not match
this so go ahead and give that exercise
a shot in the next video I'll explain
how that's done and I will outline the
solution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
