objects and prototypes in depth this
course is going to cover concepts
related to object-oriented programming
in JavaScript as you must be aware
javascript is an object-oriented
programming language you can use objects
and the concepts around objects to build
objects in your code and solve problems
using the object-oriented paradigm so
there are multiple ways in which you can
create objects we're going to look at
some of the different ways in this
course we have the concept of
constructors in JavaScript which is
kinda different from the traditional
model of constructors that we might
encounter than C++ or Java languages
you're also going to look at multiple
ways in which you can execute functions
and how it affects the execution of the
function itself including what the
difference points to this reference is
actually a fairly confusing concept in
JavaScript and we're going to look at
the multiple different values possible
values that the dystrophin should have
and hopefully after going through this
course what JavaScript does will make
more sense and then finally we're going
to look at prototypes in JavaScript
which is yet another confusing concept
with a lot of people kind of postponed
learning and try to get their JavaScript
work done without having an
understanding of but knowing and
understanding prototypes is actually
going to significantly enhance the tools
that you have at your disposal when
you're writing JavaScript code so we'll
understand what prototypes are and how
it lets you build objects based on a
particular template javascript does not
have the concept of classes there are
shortcuts which let you build something
that resemble classes but in the core
language itself there's no concept of a
class that you would typically expect
from a language like C++ or Java
however prototypes have features which
let you build things that you could
typically build with classes so we can
understand what prototypes are and how
we can modify a prototype to get the
behavior off a like a blueprint for
classes and then create objects which
follow a particular blueprint but then
finally we're going to write some code
it uses all the concepts that you have
learnt in this course and hopefully that
is cement the understanding of these
concepts in your mind so thanks again
for deciding to take
this course and kasha protocol and this
course is JavaScript objects and
prototypes in depth see you in the next
