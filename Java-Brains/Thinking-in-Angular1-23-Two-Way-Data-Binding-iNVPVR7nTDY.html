we were able to bind data to the view
this kind of finding is actually called
one-way binding in angular it's
basically the direction of binding goes
from the data to the view goes through
one way but the other cool feature of
angular is it can actually do two-way
data binding so let's think about what
the two-way data binding would mean in a
traditional server-side application when
you have to send data from the client to
the server for instance you have the
user for the farm or you know for the
text box or something like that
and you want to send the value of that
text box to the server what you would
need to do is an HTTP request because
the application is on the client side
and your server-side application was
running on a completely different
machine so there has to be this request
from the clients browser to your server
where the data that the user entered in
the text box is transferred to the
server in the case of an angular
application where everything is
happening on the client side there is no
such need there's no server to server
transfer well there is of course some
kind of a server to server transfer that
needs to happen when you want to persist
the data but if you are messing around
with data on the clients browser you can
actually send data from the view to the
controller here what we've done this
from the controller to the view you have
data in the controller and we accessed
it in the view now how about the other
way around the user enters some data in
the view you want to update it in the
controller you want to get that value in
the controller well that can be done and
that's two-way data-binding then the
next demonstrate that by having some
kind of a user input I want to enter I
want to have the user enter some value
and this anticipate to have the user
enter anything is by adding a textbox so
I'm going to add a textbox over here I'm
going to use the input tag say type
equals text even though that's not
really required so default and I'm going
to close the input tag and let's say I
have a caption here please enter your
name
now refresh the page well now I have a
text box with the caption now this text
box doesn't do anything I can type in
stuff here and nothing happens what I'm
going to do is get the users input in
this text box and what will the user
types I'm going to update the scope it's
basically the reverse of what we did
earlier earlier we updated the scope
object in the world in the controller
and we displayed it in the view now we
want to do it the other way around we're
gonna update the view when the user
updates the view when the user types in
something you want to update the scope
object so let's say I have a scope a
variable called user name right so that
you have this I'm going to do dollar
scope dot user name this is my variable
that I want to have to match the value
that the user enters in the textbox now
I want to say hey angular whenever the
user types in something over here update
scope dot username that that value the
way to do this is you guessed it another
directive and the name of the director
was called ng - model ng - model takes
in an expression which is the scope
expression in this case it's user name
I'm not doing scope that user name again
remember anything you do in the HTML is
automatically prefixed with a scope dot
so exist a user name angular knows
you're referring the scope that user
name ok so now I have the user name
string refer to an NG model and this is
actually all that we need to tell
angular to say hey when the user enter
something in this text box just bind it
to user name but this once is the
reverse binding right it's going the
other way it's going from the view from
the text box to the model object which
is store which is on the scope now I say
i refresh this and then type in
something well I can tell you that
angular is doing this thing angular is
updating it and it's binding it but it's
hard to tell because you're not really
using it anywhere else so in order to
verify that angular is doing this so I'm
gonna have a paragraph tag your name is
and then just like a bound time string
I'm going to bind
user name and now see the magic happened
right now there is nothing in the user
name because let's just initialize with
an empty string now let's say I start
typing over here you notice what's
happening the value in this angular
expression is not automatically being
updated as I do a key press right the
minute I press a key it's actually
getting updated so this value is being
bound on each key press there's the
first thing the second thing is we
already learned that when the scope
object gets updated the view
automatically gets updated so this is
also happening right just like we
updated the time string in the time
string or displayed username updated and
the user name gets a you know displayed
in the interview and this is all
happening thanks to angular watching for
these changes and automatically updating
the view and of course this is the model
ng model which is watching any key
presses and automatically updating the
model the angular started getting
popular this was connected there more
which people showed to kind of showcase
what angular could do and this is
actually a little bit tricky to
implement in jQuery it's not as simple
as just putting a couple of directives
here but we were able to do this in
angular with very little effort if you
look at some of the angular tutorials
they kind of start off over here and you
won't really know what's happening but
if you've been following along this
course you kind of know what the scope
is and you're going to know what data
binding is now hopefully you will be
able to appreciate what's happening here
and how this thing works so this is
two-way data-binding
in angular we'll be doing this a lot
when you're you know building a web
application using angular and this kind
of fundamental to how angular separates
the view from the model you just have to
hook in these connectors between the
view and the model and then angular
takes care of updating one when the
other updates so this is very handy when
you want to have that separation of
concerns</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
