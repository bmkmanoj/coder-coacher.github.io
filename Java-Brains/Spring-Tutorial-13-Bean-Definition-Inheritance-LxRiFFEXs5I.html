beam definition inheritance there's not
been inheritance it's mean definition
inheritance what this means is say you
have a lot of beam definitions in your
spring XML like 100 beam then you have a
definitions for all of them and let's
say you have some things which you do
common across a whole lot of beings
there is a common set of values that
you'll have to initialize across
multiple beans then beam definition
inheritance can be handy what you can do
is you can have one beam which contains
all these common definitions inside it
and then you can inherit all the beam
definitions across your other beans now
this parent beam which has all the
common definitions that can be a beam in
itself or it can be an abstract beam
definition which means that there are no
beans created for it all it does is it
sells as a publisher purpose of
templating your beam definitions so it's
a handy feature if you have a lot of
beans and you have common things that
you had you know initialize across
different beans so we're going to have a
look at that now I have this triangle
beam which has initializations
of three point objects in order to
demonstrate beam definitions what I'll
do is I'll create a parent beam
definition which contains the
configuration for point a and then I'm
going to create a child beam definitions
which inherits from the parent which
inherits the point a configuration and
it adds point B and Point C
configurations to that inherited
definition so let's call this as ID
equals a call this parent triangle and
the class is going to be the same well
in fact let me copy this and double
close the beam definition here okay so I
have a parent triangle definition which
defines the value the reference for only
one of the three points inside
triangle objects with the triangular
object has three points all the three
have to be defined but in my parent
triangle beam definition I'm defining
only one of those points now I can have
as many number of triangle beans as I
want which inherit from this parent
triangle and since I inherit from the
parent triangle I don't have to
configure the point a property because
it's already configured to point a of
course if I want it to be different than
this bean which is actually referring to
over here if I want a different bean to
be reference then yes I'll have to
configure point a as well but if I am
okay with this point being configured
over here then I do not have to make a
configuration for point a as long as I
inherit from this parent triangle so to
demonstrate that what I lose I'll define
triangle one and here I'm not going to
specify the point a configuration it's
just going to be point B and Point C
okay and I'm going to have triangle too
that's again where a configure point B
I'm not going to come to the point C
here just to show you how it can be done
okay so I have triangle one which
inherits from the parent triangle in
order to inherit the beam definition
what I do is I say parent equals and I
give it this name which is a parent
triangle okay so this beam definition
the beam ID triangle one has a
definition that inherits a definition
from the parent parent triangle so all
the configurations of this beam are
going to apply to triangle one now I can
do two things here I can add additional
configuration over here say here I'm
adding point B and Point C or I can
actually overwrite some of the
configuration so you have a huge list of
configurations over here and I want one
of them to change I can specify the
property here and then that is a
property that's going to get considered
and then that will override the property
over here since I have only one property
here there's really no point in
were idling I'm going to leave it as it
is and this in essence is inheriting the
definition of the parent triangle
now again triangle two is going to
inherit parent equals parent triangle so
this is again inheriting from this and
point a is something that inherits I
don't have to configure it I'm
configuring only point B now if I run
this let's say I'm going to do a get bin
for triangle one alone so let me do a
kid bin for triangle one save and fire
on this you can see that triangle one
has all the three points can figure
inside it even though the spring XML has
only point B and Point C configured this
is happening because the inheritance is
happening here it's inheriting the point
a configuration from the parent triangle
now let's initialize point I'm in
triangle too so say I do a get beam for
triangle to save and run so note here
that point A and point B are there Point
C gives a nullpointerexception that's
because Point C has not been configured
in triangle two but even though point E
is not configured in triangle two it has
the value zero zero because it's
inheriting from the parent triangle so
this is a handy feature if you have a
whole lot of configurations and you have
some common configurations across
different beans one additional feature
of being definition inheritance is let's
say you have a list here so instead of
three different point member variables
let's say I have a list of points okay
and let's say I call this points you
won't be having this so we've seen how
this works before we could initialize a
list of references so instead of having
a single property in a single reference
would have as a list here okay you can
have as many references that I want
let's say I have where F P equals point
a okay so I'm creating a list in the
parent object now the the advantages you
can inherit the list as well not only
can you inherit the list you can add to
the list if required so what we need to
do is let's say I'm let me remove these
two here so what I can do is copy and
paste this okay so here let's say I
define a point B okay so I'm I have one
element in my list so this property
member variable is a list okay so I have
one element to find in the parent bean
and I have one element defined in the
child bean now what would happen is
since I'm defining the element for the
same member variable point B would
overwrite point a so triangle one would
have just point B reference just one
element in the list now let's say I want
to merge point B with whatever has been
configured in the parent bean now say I
have ten elements in the parent bean I
just want to add one element to that
parent in my child bean so I can do that
I can actually merge collections this
works not need for list but also the
other collection elements here in the
lists tag all I need to do is say merge
equals true so this is going to merge
the elements that are defined on the
child color in the child bean to the
elements that I define in the pen and B
so this is a special condition here
normally what happens is we define a
bean property and you define the same
property in the child being this is
going to all right okay the old value is
going to go and the new value is going
to all right but in the case of
collections
if there is an option where you would
want to merge the connections so say you
have a collection property here in in
the child beam if you have the same
collection property and you have merge
equals true it's not going to overwrite
this just going to add whatever elements
are there in this child collection and
finally there is one more point say you
have a parent being here which you do
not want to be in CH alized you just
want it as a template so you can have a
property here called abstract equals
true so in that case what spring is
going to do is it's not going to create
a beam off this particular ID it's just
going to use it as a template and all
the child beam definitions can use the
beam definition of this one but it's not
going to create a beam off pane and
triangle this is handy if you're using a
beam just as a reference as a place
where you consolidate all the common
configuration you don't want the beam to
actually be initialized</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
