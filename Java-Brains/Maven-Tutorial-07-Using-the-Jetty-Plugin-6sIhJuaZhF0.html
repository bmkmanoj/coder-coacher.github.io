earlier tutorial which was the compiler
plugin there are a few other plugins
that are available that are very helpful
when you're developing applications one
common thing that you do when you're
developing web applications is to build
and deploy in a server and I can out a
container so there are a few servers and
servlet containers available in maven
has plugins that you can use in order to
you know deploy the web application that
you are developing and the advantage
here is that it you know integrates with
the workflow and you can do a whole lot
of things automatically now we have
plugins for Tomcat and we have plugins
for jetty which is a lightweight sublet
container I'm going to use jetty in this
tutorial and you know you can use Tomcat
plug-in also in a similar vein so the
first step in order to use any plug-in
is to declare the plug-in in our pom dot
XML so here's my pom dot XML I'm going
to open it with an editor now here in
order to mention what plug-in I need to
use again I need to use the standard
maven coordinates the group ID artifact
ID and the version but the difference
here is that here dependencies are
required for the code
these are dependencies for the code but
when I'm using plugins that is something
that I want maven to use when we are
actually building so this is something
that we need to configure in a different
node so at the end of the dependencies
node here what I'll do is I'll use the
build node inside this all my plugins
are going to go
okay so build plugins will contain all
the plugins that I'm going to use so the
plugin that I want to use now is the
jetty plugin so I'll have a plug-in node
here and here what I'll do is I will
provide the group ID artifact ID and the
version for this plugin you just copy
this to save some time so the group ID
for the jetty plug-in I know is Marg mod
beta jetty again this is something that
you can look up online if you're not
sure then the artefact ID for the jetty
plugin is maven - jetty I plug it and
the version that I'm going to use with
this is 6.1.2 okay so I have defined
this plug-in here in the bill to again
build plugins and add all the plugins
you want every plug-in is identified by
a plug-in node and it has the group ID
artifact and the version of that plug-in
now let's save this and close okay so
now what I've done is I've defined the
plugin so that I can use it in my build
commands and now I will run the command
so that maven can execute that I'll say
mvn of course first mixture the river in
the territory we have the pound or XML
now I will run mvn JT : run
so here the part of the comment before
the : tells me when what is the plugin
that needs to handle this command and
the second part of the command after the
golden tells what plugin should do so
now if I hit enter maven will detect
that there is this plugin that I have
defined in my palm dot XML now it's
going to go and download all the
required components from the central
repository I don't have it in my local
repository because it's the first time
I'm running this so it's going to go
talk to the central repository and it's
going to download the runtimes so it's
going to take a while so I will just
resume the video
after the download is complete okay so
here you see a message it says started
jetty server
so let's access this server open up a
browser and I will type localhost colon
8080 because this is the default for a
jetty now here it says that there is no
page to handle the root but it tells you
that there is the slash my web app which
is the application that we have
developed so I will type my web app and
there you go our application our code
has been deployed in this jetty
container so what this je : run has done
us first
it has read this poem dot XML and it is
identified that this is the plugin that
needs to run and then what it's done is
it has compiled built the application
that is denoted by the spawn Road XML
and it has deployed this inside the GD
container so I can access the
application directly in Dom CAD what
would happen is if I just enter
localhost colon 8080 we would get a
welcome page jetty doesn't have a
welcome page so that's the reason why we
getting a 404 but it has also printed
out the call at the web application
context that it knows and that is our
application which we were able to access
by specifying the URL so this should
give you an idea about how easy it is to
develop
web applications you just have to run
the article and generate command and you
have the whole source code structure
ready and then you just have to run they
know mvn Jerry : run after mentioning
the plugin in the pound or eczema and it
automatically takes care of building the
application and then deploying it for
you there's one thing to note here now
let me go to the sir source code folder
and in my web app I have this index dot
JSP now what I'll do is I'll make a
change here into this JSP page and I
will save it now if i refresh this it
automatically gets updated but say what
if it was a it is a class which needed
to be compiled so in that case what we
can do is we can go to this bomb dot XML
and I can configure this jetty plug-in
to listen to class changes and if there
is a change in any of the Java files I
can ask the you know ask for the
compilation of those plugins and then
deploying them automatically so this is
a configuration that we can do so this
is a sample configuration I'm going to
show you here as we saw in the compiler
example in the Palm D'Or XML wherever I
am declaring the plug-in I can also
mention what is the configuration that I
need so what I do is I enter
configuration node here and here I can
enter all the configurations that I want
to make here I'm going to use the
example of the auto check for any
changes to our class files so I use the
configuration scan interval seconds so
this is a configuration that jetty has
and it checks for any changes in a given
scan interval by default the scan
interval in seconds value is zero so
jetty is not going to make the
but you can specify a value here so
let's say I use a value of five it's
going to check every five seconds for
any changes any updates to our Java
files and then if there is an update
jetty automatically packages and deploys
it so you will always have the latest
version when you're accessing that so
this takes care of you know the whole
intermediate set of steps that we need
to do when we are developing web
applications whenever you make a change
we need to build and deploy and all that
stuff so that has completely avoided
here in this case jetty is going to take
care of that as long as you mention the
scan interval here so this is a this is
one of the useful ways in which we can
we can speed up our development and by
looking at this we've also seen how to
configure plugins and we've also seen
how plugins can not only change the way
the core maven works we can also add an
extra functionality like a whole servlet
container just by defining the plugin in
the pound or XML and then configuring it
to suit our needs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
