looking at dollar HTTP and more
importantly we're going to be looking at
the implications of using dollar HTTP
which is actually a little bit more
involved than the service itself now
definitely be like I've already
mentioned the service that comes out of
the box with angular you're going to be
able to use the dollar HTTP service just
by declaring it as an argument in your
service and dependency injection is
going to happen an angular is going to
send you an instance after HTTP service
and once you've got the dollar HTTP
service you can use the methods on that
service to make a REST API calls and the
process of making the calls is as simple
as it can be let's take the example of
making a get request you have an
endpoint which is a JSON endpoint you
need to make a get request how do you do
that with dollar HTTP it's very simple
all you need to do is say dollar HTTP
dot get and it's going to accept an
argument which is your URL and if you
pass that an HTTP service is going to
make a get request to that URL it's as
simple as that now how about a post
request well there is a dot post started
HTTP dot post this is going to take two
arguments the first argument is the URL
to which you want to post the second
argument is the JSON body that goes as a
request body in your post request when
you make a post you usually have a post
body that gets sent so this lets you
send any JSON object in the payload in
the post body by using the second
argument so this is fairly
straightforward so the challenge here is
not with the HTTP service itself the
challenge is in answering this question
now when you make these requests what do
these methods return let's say I make a
get request here so I have this API
published and later returns a JSON which
is user data or something like that I
say down HTTP GET event this method
executes so I'm going to get a return
value now what is that value going to be
do I get the value in that API is let's
say this is returning a payload am I
going to get that object so turns out I
do not get the actual value and that's
because of the asynchronous nature of
JavaScript</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
