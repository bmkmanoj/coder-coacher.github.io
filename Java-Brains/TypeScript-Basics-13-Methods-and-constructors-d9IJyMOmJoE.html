have member variables you can also have
methods of a class now let's say I want
to create a method called get full name
which adds up the first name and last
name and gives me a string which is a
concatenation of the two so the way to
create a method is something like this
you just give the method name then the
open closed parenthesis and then the
curly braces and inside the curly braces
use your method body so here I wanna
return first name plus last name but
here's the thing your first name and
last names that you're accessing are the
first name and last name properties off
the class on which you're running this
method right it's the instance of the
class on which you're running this
method so how do you get that variable
apparently first name and last name will
not do you cannot just access the
variable name in order to indicate to
JavaScript that you are referring to the
instance of that class on which this
method is being executed you use a
keyword called this this dot first name
and the stock last name so this lets
JavaScript know that you are referring
to that instance in order to learn more
about this again recommend you look at
the objects and prototypes and depth of
course on Java brains that covered this
in a lot of detail so this is how you
create method in a class you can have a
bunch more methods like this now one
thing you might have noticed is I don't
have any modifiers your you commonly do
something like a private or a public or
whatever right so that's how you
indicate what the scope of your remember
variables in member methods are whether
they are accessible only inside the
class or they're accessible outside
there are ways in which you can
encapsulate and make private or member
variables and methods but I'm gonna talk
about that a bit later for now just
assume that all methods are public and
all member variables are public ok so
now I have created this method I can
call this
method on an instance let me actually
add a space over here so that it looks
nice now let us call this I'm gonna say
a person dot I'm gonna give my name here
and let's do a consult a log a person
that get full name all right now I'm
gonna compile and run at the same time
so that do wait for it alright so here
you see it's printed out the full name
which is the execution of this method
which in turn is referring to the
instance member variables and printing
out the full name right
so this is how you can create methods in
typescript you also have the special
method called a constructor typically in
other programming languages a
constructor is a method which has the
same name as the class but in typescript
and in JavaScript actually that's not
the case a constructor is a special
function with the named constructor and
it can take in arguments if you like but
what this does is it constructs the
object before it gets assigned for the
very first time so let's say you're
doing this new person and you want to do
some stuff to that object you want to
initialize something before it gets
assigned while it's being constructed so
you do this in the constructor method so
let's say I'm gonna initialize the
first-name and lastname to a single
space so that there are not empty
strings I can do that in the constructor
and say this dot first-name equals a
single space and then this dot last name
goes a single space and now this
constructor works every time you call a
new on the class so every time you say
new person it's
call this constructor and it's going to
execute this so you can do any
initialization that you want and then
the object that you're gonna get after
the constructor is called there's going
to be this prepared object after
initialization right so you can also
accept parameters now let's say when ax
you're gonna create a constructor that
Dickson first name and last name and it
initializes it so that I don't have to
do this stuff so I can say first name
which is going to be a string and then a
last name which is gonna be another
string and then here I'm gonna do this
dot first name equals first name and
this third lastname equals last name you
notice all these red squigglies over
here that's because we've got multiple
constructors which are not allowed so if
you move your mouse over to if multiple
constructor implementations are not
allowed so if you have this you need to
get rid of the no argument constructor
this is different from again other
languages like C++ in C++ you can do
overloaded constructor of limitations
but in typescript
you can have only one constructor you
cannot overload it why because you
cannot have overloaded functions in
typescript either so you have to have
only one constructor now that I have a
constructor which has two input
arguments you notice that this is not
wearing out I cannot create a new person
open/close it expects two arguments so
that's what I'm gonna do now and I pass
in my first name and last name and we
get rid of these two initializations
and now what I get back into this a
person
variable should be a fully initialized
person object with these two member
variable values and now if I print the
full name it should still work the same
way so let's verify that and it does so
in this tutorial we looked at a couple
of things we looked at methods we looked
at methods for classes in typescript how
you can create methods of you can
type them how we can refer to the
instance member variables using the this
reference to have you do this you also
learn how to create constructors an or
constructor and a constructor with
arguments which again lets you
initialize the object that's been
created using the this reference again
so that you get hold off the instance
that's been created and initialize it
when the construct when the object is
being created in the next video we'll
look at another important feature of
object-oriented programming when you
think about classes and object-oriented
programming the first thing that comes
to mind is extending classes and
inheritance is that possible in
typescript it is and we'll find out how
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
