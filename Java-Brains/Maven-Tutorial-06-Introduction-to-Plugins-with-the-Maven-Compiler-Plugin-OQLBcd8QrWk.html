maven plugins plugins are away in which
we can extend the functionality of maven
actually the maven architecture itself
is you know an assembly of
different plugins so it has a very
modular architecture and this is
something that we saw earlier the maven
compiler is actually a plug-in inside
the maven system so all the core
components act as plugins so it makes it
a very modular architecture and the
benefit of this you know the plug-in
architecture is that you can add plugins
and then configure it the way you want
so that you can fine tune the way maven
works specifically to your needs in this
tutorial we're going to look at the
compiler plug-in which we saw earlier
this was this is the actual web app
project that we saw in our earlier
tutorial if you open the bomb door XML
here you can see that there is a
configuration for the mean even compiler
plugin and it says that the source and
the target are 1.4 with what's actually
saying here is that the JVM version for
the source as well as the target runtime
this version 1.4 this is there because
when I was downloading the archetype and
I was choosing the ad type I chose the
Java EE 1.4 version if I chose in the
Java EE 5 version then this would have
been 1.5 or Java EE 5 so this is a
configuration for the maven compiler
plugin what used to happen was in maven
version to the default source and target
for the maven compiler actually was 1.4
so if you had to write something
specific to Java EE 5 say for example
generics if your code had genrich's
without specifying the configuration it
would not work because the compiler by
default was set for the 1.4 version in
order to use Java EE 5 what you had to
do was we had to add this configuration
the same configuration area seen here
but you have to specify the Java EE 5
version here because that is something
that you wanted overwrite you didn't
want the default 1.4 if you had to run
genrich's we had to write code which add
this
Gendron are the capabilities of java e5
you had to do that over right here and
you have to specify Java e5 version over
here but since maven version 3 Java e5
is the standard version that's going to
get compiled so if you want to enforce a
previous version so you want to have
version 1.4 you don't want Java EE
version 5 then you have to specify this
configuration here because 5 is a
default you have to configure if you
need 4 so anyway we have 1.4 configured
here so what I'm going to do now is I'm
going to write some code which uses some
of the features of Java EE 5 I'm going
to have a single line of code which has
gender expand is going to give an error
so we'll have a look at that now what
I'll do is I'll go to the source folder
inside each other I will create a simple
class here let's create something called
as my class dot Java okay so I just have
a simple main method here what I will do
is I will write a line of code that uses
genrich's so I'll say I have a list of
strings new ArrayList of strings
okay simple enough I let the import
java.util just import everything here
okay simple it's not doing anything but
the only thing is that I want to have a
line of code here which uses gender X so
now since I have this class in the in
the source folder when I run the Indian
compile maven is going to compile it but
here's the problem in my pom dot XML I
have mentioned that the compiler version
is 1.4 so because of this it's going to
look at this gender ik code and it's
going to say this is not a compatible
version you'll have to compile using
Java version 5 and onwards so let's try
that out
let's make sure you're in the directory
where the bomb dot XML is now do mb in
compile so here you go this is the error
here it says my cluster Java generics
are not supported in source 1.4 now
compiler has this flag which has been
configured so that it compiles with this
over 1.4 where is this flag coming from
this is coming from our bomb dot XML
setting so this is how you use the
compliance and you can configure how the
plug-in behaves by specifying that in
the bound or XML now let's say I make
this 1.5 save and compile again the
quids build successfully and now
interestingly now if I remove this whole
build block okay I have not specified
any override for the compiler plug-in
but since the compiler plugin is a
default for compile it's going to use
the plug-in anyway we are not having the
configuration settings so if we run the
compiled it's still going to compile ok
it says there's nothing to compile so
let's just clean and run the compiled
so it's going to delete the folder and
then compile it again yes it has
compiled and it's successful so this
last case where you have not specified
the plug-in in the boundary XML and
you're compiling a piece of code that
uses Java EE 5 features this does not
work in me even to because 1.4 is a
default compiler version in maven 2 but
since we are using maven 3 here this
works by default because Java EE 5 is
the default for maven 3 and onwards so
this is uh this is the way in which we
use plugins so all you need to do is we
need to mention the name of the plug-in
here and configuration details and then
maven is going to use that plug-in in
order to add functionality to our build
cycle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
