at slash topics slash some ID and we're
going to have the API tour done only the
topic that is requested so how do we do
this in spring MVC first we need to
write a method which you need to execute
then that URL is accessed and secondly
you need to put the request mapping
annotation on that method all right now
how do I do that first let me create the
method let's say public this is
something that returns one topic and
this is going to be a method called get
topic and this accepts an ID because we
are looking up one ID only right so
there is a request that comes in say say
get me the topic spring and you're going
to get just that one topic so you
basically have some kind of an input
parameter which is a string which is
that topic ID how do we get this from
the request we'll look at that in a
little bit but the idea is this method
can accept that argument that you can
get from that URL and then what you do
is you call a method on the business
service and pull up that particular
topic
now we don't have that method in the
business service so let's implement that
first I'm going to have a public topic
get topic which again takes in a string
ID and then it returns the item from
this list which has the topic that
matches this so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to go to the topic topics list
give the stream so that I can filter by
the ID so what I'm going to get is given
in topic I'm gonna write a lambda
expression here which is that given a
topic I want to compare the ID of that
topic to the ID that's passed in right
so this is going to be the filter lambda
expression and for each topic I'm going
to check if d dot get ID equals the ID
that pass 10 and then what I'm going to
do is I'm going to go for the find first
option so that I can get the very first
topic element and then I'm
to a target so that I get the topic
instance and now I can just do a shirt
done if you're not familiar with lambdas
and this way of handling streams don't
worry too much about it just think of
this as a way for you to get rid over
this list of topics and match the ID
that's passed in with that and then just
return the topic this is just you know a
more elegant way of doing this using
streams and lambda expressions alright
so that's the topic service and now here
I can just store it on topic service
target topic of ID well this all that
this controller has to do but now the
question is how do you map this method
to be called then the slash topics slash
ID is accessed and then how do you map
the ID part to this ID that needs to be
passed into this method for example if
the out slash topic slash Java is passed
in you want spring to pass that Java
portion to this ID parameter all right
now let's say I just do this ad request
mapping slash topics slash Java well
this would not work because this is
going to map only Java I can change this
to spring and it is going to match only
spring what I want is to somehow tell
the spring MVC framework that this is a
variable part the way to tell that it's
a variable part is by using the syntax
which is the curly braces and then you
can give a token here which is ID all
right I can give any name over here it
doesn't matter now just by doing this
I'm telling spring that this is a
variable portion so if I were to make
slash topic slash Java EE spring is
going to match it slash topic /foo it's
gonna match it because it knows that
this is a variable portion what I now
need to tell spring is when it matches
this whatever the variable portion is I
want spring to send that do this method
argument when it calls the gate topic
when the request is accessed when this
URL is access now how do I tell spring
that this is what this is in order to do
that I use another annotation and that
annotation is path
beautiful I'm basically telling spring
that this whatever I'm expecting is an
argument here is actually a variable in
the path right this is the pad and I
told you this is the variable portion
get that thing and pass it to me that's
basically what the step spring so again
I can import this from a blind
annotation and this maps this do this
and the reason this works in this case
is because the name is the same now
let's say I call this as foo
then the name is not the same well how
would spring know there's a way you can
pass this as an argument in the
annotation I were to say foo is what I
need so basically whatever is the path
variable at foo pass this in the ID
parameter right so this maps this do
this but this is usually not recommended
when I when you can it's recommended to
just have the same name so that spring
doesn't need that extra help and it
automatically figures that out so here's
what's going to happen I'm going to run
this I'm going to access slash topics
slash spring for example the spring MVC
framework is going to match this
variable which is spring to this ID and
it's going to call this method gate
topic and now that spring string is
going to get into this method you're
going to call get topic with that value
being passed in and now this is going to
run the filter on this array and it's
going to pick that one topic object and
return that now the controller is going
to return that one topic object back
because that's what it returns and
spring MVC framework is going to convert
that JSON and return it in the response
let's verify that so I'm going to access
topics slash spring another you go you
get the actual record only and I can
change it to Java for instance and I'm
going to get the Java object back so
basically this is the parameter which is
being sent to the spring boot-up
Legation and it's handling that unique
object that's alone returned when the
response is sent back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
