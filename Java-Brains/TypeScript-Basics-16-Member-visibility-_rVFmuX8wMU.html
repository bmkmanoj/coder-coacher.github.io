a person class where you have two member
variables first name and last name and
they are accessible by using the dot
notations I can say for any instance of
the class I can do a dot I can access
first name and I can access last name so
the dot notation lets you both read and
write into member variables this is the
default behavior in typescript and this
kind of simulates the JavaScript
behavior of having every member variable
be accessible outside right so there's
no concept of a private in JavaScript
but typescript does have a concept of
private it lets you restrict the member
variables to be accessible only within a
particular class which is very handy
when you want to encapsulate certain
features of a class only to within the
class so by default if you don't specify
any visibility the member variable is
assumed to be of public type so this is
equivalent to saying public first name
it's accessible outside there are no
access restrictions for the member
readable but it will not restrict it you
can mark a member variable as private
you see here and I'll have a private
first name and I have a private last
names now you see here I get a squiggly
property first name is private and only
accessible to attend the class person so
what I can do is use the get full name
method over here or so let's say I do a
return this dot first name plus this dot
last name so this works fine because I
am accessing the first name and the last
name inside the class person but I
cannot access it outside the class
person because this is a private than
the variable I can of course do a get
full name and have this method return me
the values that are inside the class so
these are essentially encapsulated I can
only access them
through this method so this translates
well to Gators and setters if you're
familiar with some other languages you
have this concept of getters and setters
which are basically functions which wrap
around private member variables so
rather than have first name itself be
public you make it private and you
create a getter like so just something
like this get first name which basically
just returns this done first name so
with this
you've encapsulated first name but
you're still making it accessible
through our public method can be some
common patterns you can't do that
because you have the concept of private
member variables in typescript the
private key word works for methods too
so you can say this is private so in
this case both the member variable and
the getter is private so you really
cannot access first-name outside the
class and as you go through another
method like this so I'm gonna complete
the picture with a set first name which
takes in name which is a string and I'm
going to say this dot first name equals
first name should call it first name
here all right so this is a guitar and
this is a sitter so this allows us to
encapsulate first name I'm gonna change
this to include getters and setters for
the last name as well name to capitalize
this so we have getters and setters for
the first name getters and setters for
the last name
now first name and last name are
encapsulated all right now how about
constructors let's say you want to
create a constructor which accepts first
name and last name and it creates an
instance from that so you can do
something like this constructor
first name as a string last name as a
string and I say this dot first name
equals first name and the stuff last
name equals last name right so this is
possible this is a pretty common pattern
you create member variables which are
private and you have a constructor which
takes in those arguments and it sets the
corresponding values we have first name
taking and taken from the first name
argument and the last name taken from
the last name argument this is all great
but the type script there is a shortcut
for doing something like this creating
the member variable which is private and
then using a constructor with all the
values that you need and setting the
value to the member variable seems like
a lot of work so what you can do instead
let's create a constructor which is
empty instead of declaring private first
name string and private last name string
over here and then first name string
last name string over here what I'm
going to do is get rid of this stuff and
just mark these as private so private
first name
privates last name now what this is
going to let typescript know is that you
want these arguments to the constructor
actually be member variables of the
class so it's doing a couple of things
at the same time it's accepting
arguments to the constructor it's
telling typescript that the arguments
correspond to member variables in the
constructor and that you want it
assigned to those member variables so
what happens is when typescript looks at
this class definition it's going to say
okay these two need to be member
variables of person you don't have to
declare it over here like it is before
just by having private and the
constructor argument means it's going to
automatically treat these to us when the
variables with the corresponding type
the second thing it's going to do is
it's going to take these values that are
passed to the constructor and assign
them to the member variables
automatically so you don't have to do
the dis start first name equals first
name this starts last name it goes last
name you can skip that entirely this is
a pretty quick shortcut to doing all
that stuff because like I said it's a
common pattern you have member variables
and have a constructor which takes all
those as arguments and then assigns them
to the member variable well that's you
do that so many times you might as well
use the shortcut for you just put it as
private over here and it's gonna be done
automatically for you if you want public
member variables you remember you didn't
have to do the modifier and it used to
work fine but in this case if you remove
the modifier it's gonna look like any
other constructor so how do you tell
typescript that you want this to be
assigned to a member variable well you
do that by using public in say public
first name and public last name so it's
again the same shortcut so the class
definition has first name and last name
as two public member variables so that's
what the public and private modifiers do
the arguments of the constructor do and
the final visibility modifier is
protected of the very protected works is
that the member variable is accessible
inside the type and inside anything that
extends to type but it's not available
outside
so let's say I mark these two as
protected first-name and lastname are
both protected they are accessible
inside the class person so I can do with
the start first name getter sitters all
that stuff they are accessible inside a
class which extends person so somewhere
over here I can do this start first name
and that works fine it's accessible over
here because this is a class which
extends person so the protected member
variables are accessible but it's not
accessible outside the class so let's
say a programmer dot you see that first
name doesn't show up first name is
protected it's not accessible outside</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
