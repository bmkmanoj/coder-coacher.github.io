Springwood application we have all the
functionality ready and you're all set
to deploy it this unit you're going to
be looking at some of the things you
would need to do to get your application
deployment ready the things you can do
in a production deployed application and
some quick tips to help you along the
way we're gonna start that getting a jar
file out of your application that can be
started on any machine I mentioned
earlier that one of the goals of
springboard is to have independently
deployable unitaf application you don't
need a sublet container because you just
take one jar file and you run it right
it makes it very flexible for you to run
your application deployed anywhere all
you need is basically a Java runtime and
you can just run your application
anywhere that's because the application
also bundles in the servlet container
and the related configurations you don't
have to get a southern container
configure it and then deploy a war file
that's all taken care of for you now how
do you get the jar file and how do you
run it now Here I am at the project
location oh I see yeah this is the main
project so I have the SRC and the target
folder when you're running it in an IDE
the body handles running the maven build
cycles compiling the classes and all
that but not leastly wanna run this in
the command line and generate the jar
file now since it's a maven project the
best way to generate the jar file is
actually doing em en install what I
typically do is M en clean install to
make sure that the target directory is
deleted first thanks to the clean and
then it doesn't install in which case
it's going to download any necessary
dependencies compile run the unit tests
and then create a jar file and make that
available in the project directory slash
target slash the jar name now that I
have a jar it's very simple to run it so
I'll first need to make sure that my ID
is does not have a process running so
that the port is open I'm going to kill
all the other Springwood processes and
I'm going to do a Java
chair target / course API data snapshot
which basically the chair names it's the
command this Java dash jar the jar name
so if I hit enter this is going to run
spring boot it's as simple as that again
even if you're outside the context of
your ID you can still run your
application just by that one command and
that's handle for you because spring
would buns and all the things that's
required for you to run your application
into one jar file and again the goal
here is that it's easy for you to start
your application this is very hard even
you have like a micro service based
environment we have a bunch of stateless
servers which need to be able to start
up really quick so we might be doing
some kind of a scaling mechanism where
depending on the load you're going to
provision more service to run your
application now if you have Tomcat as a
servlet container there you need to set
up a script make sure that the
deployment happens in any new container
is well here it's actually fairly simple
just give it a jar and run one command
and you can run your application on as
many servers as you want and you can
scale them as much as you want so that's
really handy
however this jar is not the only way in
which you can run your Springwood
application it also supports the
traditional war deployment model now if
you need a war let's say you have your
tomcat instance already and you want to
deploy your Springville application into
Tomcat as a bar fine what you need to do
is open the Palm D'Or eczema and here
you see the packaging line which says
jar well just change it to a war and now
if I were to do a maven clean install
I'm just going to run the same processes
but instead of a jar file now I get a
war file in the same path so this can be
taken and applied to any traditional
servlet container like you would
typically do in another framework for
example so these are a couple of ways in
which you can get your prior
checked into an executable format and
deployed and Van Etten a in any
environment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
