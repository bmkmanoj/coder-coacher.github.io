and setup GlassFish for in our
development environment in this tutorial
we're going to configure Eclipse and
create our first web application first
of all make sure you have the latest
version of Eclipse which is Eclipse
Kepler I have put the download link in
the blog post so make sure you get the
latest version and install it so once
you have Eclipse running setting a
glassfish in Eclipse is pretty much the
same as any other application server so
what we do is first go to the service
tab so I go to the window show view and
service so here it tells me that there
are no servers available so I click on
this to create a new server so the idea
here is to have a GlassFish server
configured in the service tab so that we
can actually deploy our application
directly from eclipse if you've seen the
previous storm-cat tutorials this is
very similar to that so basically we are
trying to setup the GlassFish server
over here but if you notice you don't
have the GlassFish server type listed by
default that's because all these things
that you see here are server adapters so
you know that eclipse is basically you
know built upon the concept of plugins
so every feature apart from the core
runtime is all built using plugins that
you can add to Eclipse so the same way
you need to set up the GlassFish server
adapter which is actually a plugin so
since you don't see that here you click
on this link here which is download
additional server adapters so it's going
to look at all the available server
adapters and show us the list and here
you see GlassFish tools so GlassFish
tools comes with the GlassFish server
adapter that lets us configure the
server in Eclipse so I click on that and
hit next accept the license agreement
and finish so support for GlassFish
tools will now be downloaded and
installed very good
so I'll need to restart eclipse for the
changes to take effect so I restarted
now and I'm back to the workbench now it
still says no servers are available
that's because we have installed the
adapter but we haven't created a server
yet so click on it again and this time
you see you have the GlassFish entry so
ideally you should have a glassfish 4.0
entry available here so you click on
that hit next now it asks me for the
GlassFish server directory which is the
same directory in which we install class
efficient a previous tutorial so I
browse to that directory ahead browse
with the Java GlassFish 4 and here you
see the GlassFish 4 directory has a
whole lot but there is one folder called
GlassFish inside so that's the main
application server directory there are a
whole lot of other stuff that comes with
glass which we're going to take a look
at that later but it is GlassFish 4
slash GlassFish and I hit OK now it says
it's found GlassFish server 4 and I can
also choose the JRE I'm going to choose
the jdk 1.7 which has been installed in
my machine and hit next now it asks for
the domain directory the domain
directory is basically the directory
where the domain is set up so like we've
seen there is a domain 1 that's set up
by default and that's going to be the
domain that I'll choose so the
administrator ID is admin and I believe
the password is blank by default so I'm
going to choose I'm not gonna enter any
password here and there is a checkbox
here which says preserve sessions across
redeployment what's really cool about
this is say you have a session that's
built up by your application when you're
testing it and you want to read apply
the application again you can actually
redeploy it and still maintain the
session across three deployments which
is really handy when we are developing
so I'm going to check this and I don't
have any applications here so I'll just
click finish so I have GlassFish set up
in my Eclipse so I can right click here
and
hit start and it should start class fish
this is this is basically the same as
the ace admin command that we have seen
earlier but we're going to do it in
Eclipse itself so once the server is
started up I can right click here go to
the class fish menu and view admin
console so this is basically the same as
opening the browser and typing in this
address localhost colon for 8 for 8
which is e admin console URL which we
already seen it basically loads the same
thing up in Eclipse so it's kind of you
know you get an integrated workflow you
don't have to juggle between programs
you can do everything in Eclipse so we
see that the class fish server is up and
running ok so now that we have GlassFish
setup in Eclipse we can actually start
writing our own web service ok so the
goal here is to create a web service
project write a jax-ws web service
project so when you right click here and
say new project depending on your setup
depending on the plugins that you have
you might see an option for new jax-ws
web service project so don't go for that
one because if you go for that Eclipse
provides you a template for web services
which has a lot of things which is
already dead we don't want to do that we
want to learn how to write it on our own
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
go for a dynamic web project right it's
a simple web application so it's not a
web service yet it's just a web
application so I'm going to call this
project as test smart so I'm creating an
online e-commerce application
write a simple bare-bones online
e-commerce application and I'm going to
have logic to get product categories and
products in those categories and we're
going to create a web service out of it
which does the same thing but through
jax-ws so I'm going to choose it by
default it's GlassFish for is a target
runtime and I hit finish so I've created
this simple web application called test
Mart you might see this jax-ws Web
Services entry over here but this is
this
it does not have any web services we are
not going to use this we're going to
create the web service ourselves so the
web content does not have any web pages
so I'm going to create a simple JSP page
new file dot JSP is fine so I'm going to
create a web page that says welcome to
test smart write it's just for testing
so that we can find out if the
application is deployed fine it'll be
handy later so I'm just going to run as
and run on server GlassFish will be the
default for this project and I hit
finish so there you go the application
has been deployed on GlassFish and it is
working fine okay so now let's start
writing the logic so I'm going to create
a new Java Bean right it's going to be a
simple web service we're not going to
have a database and all that it's just
for testing so I'm going to create a new
class off Kaushik the java brains and
I'm going to call this class as product
catalog ok so I'm going to write a test
method here which returns information
about the catalog right and then we're
going to see how to make a web service
out of this ok so the first method that
I have in mind is to retrieve the
product categories that are available in
this test Mart so I'm going to create a
public method returns a list of product
categories
okay I'm going to import list and I'm
going to have some simple hard-coded
categories over here something like this
I'm going to create a categories as an
ArrayList and I'm going to add three
sample categories I'm going to add books
music and movies right I'm going to
return these three as a simple ArrayList
of string and save so this is very
simple it's not really accessing
anything from the database it's just
hard coded but this should serve our
purpose so now this should work fine I
mean if there's nothing really to it
it's just a simple method now the
question is how do I create a web
service out of it so my goal is to have
a web service that has an operation
called get product categories and people
can send soap requests to get product
categories and then this application
will return a soap response with these
categories right so we're going to learn
how to do that in the next tutorial
