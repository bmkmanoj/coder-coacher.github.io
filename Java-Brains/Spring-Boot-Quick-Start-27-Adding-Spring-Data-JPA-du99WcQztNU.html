a few changes to my project I have this
is if we open the bounder XML this is
just a web project right now what I need
to do is add a few more dependencies in
order to be able to connect to the
database and you know with the last unit
we talked about how we can know what the
dependencies are right you can go to
start spring dot IO can figure all the
dependencies you need and you're going
to get a perm rod XML that the you know
maven dependencies added in it so that's
what actually I'm going to be doing so
I'm going to have this as a separate
copy which is the end of the state of
the code at the end of unit two what I'm
going to do instead is create a new
project a new spring starter project
that we learnt in unit in the last unit
and I'm going to provide the values for
our course API which connects to the
database so I'm going to call this
course API data or the same typical
values here so it's IO dot Java brains
and the artifact is also going to be
course API data
and the package is going to be I ordered
our brains as well click Next and here
is where I can choose my dependencies
now let's there is this frequently used
tab where I can choose what I had it
recently used but if you're not going to
use that because this may not show up on
your SDS set what I'm going to scroll
down to is to the web tab and I'm going
to choose web so this is what we did
before and that's not changing so I'm
going to select that but now what I'm
also going to add is the data part of it
so if you see here there's a sequel
section so I'm gonna expand that and I
will choose JPA this brings in not just
JPA but it brings in spring data JPA you
see here if I hover the mouse over it
says Java persistence API including
spring data JP which is what we need all
right the next thing we're gonna need is
some kind of a database to work with now
you see there is a section here widget
which says Apache Derby this is an
embedded database so you see here it
says Apache Derby database with embedded
support what this does is actually
download a jar into your class path
which is the Apache Derby database and
it actually starts a database for you
when you start your application this is
typically not used in a production
scenario but when you're just building
an application for development this is
perfect right you just need some kind of
a test database what this does is
download a test database and make it
available in your class path and it just
starts that server so you have it you
have it working out for the duration of
your application server so I'm going to
choose this for now and we'll also look
at how to connect to an external
database later but for now this is this
should do you just have something to
connect to and run queries against I'm
going to choose that and with this we
should be done so I'm going to click
Next and this is our project
finish so that it downloads it and I
have a project open here so I want to
close this partner XML and expand this
project here you open upon their XML in
this project you can see all the
dependencies that it's added so it has
spring boot starter data JPA
just like you saw we had spring boot
starter web for our web needs
we now have spring boot starter data GPA
for our spring boot GPA needs so this
these two are all we need to be able to
do a web application that connects to
the database if you just need an
application which connects to the
database that it's not a web but this is
the only dependency you need so hope
this makes sense now we also have this
extra dependency which is the Apache
Derby which is the database which lives
in our class path all right and then we
have the spring boots start a test that
we saw earlier you're not going to be
writing test cases for now but it's good
to have that there all right so this is
our application now if I expand source
main Java here you see course data core
CPI data application now what's missing
those all the work we did in the in unit
2 we had a topic API in unit if I were
to run the course API data application
now it's not going to have any endpoints
so what I'm going to do is go to my
topic package you see here this topic
package had the topic model the
controller and the service so I'm just
going to copy this from here and I'm
going to paste this in the source main
Java and now I have the topic package
this is actually all I need I don't need
any configuration because you notice
that when we add classes to the class
path that's all is the configuration
that we need right so you have the
annotation and since class path scan is
happening we don't have to configure
anything to say hey this is the package
that you need to consider just dropping
this package in the class path is good
enough so now let's run this and make
sure thing
still work like we've seen in the
previous unit
all right the application is started now
I can make a get request to slash topics
and it's going to give me the list of
topics likely you would expect it to so
this is working fine so we now have a
separate project which has all the work
that we've done so far but now it also
has spring data JPA
support so in this union in this
tutorial we can understood what spring
data JPA is and we created a project
that we can actually start working on so
we'll do just that in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
