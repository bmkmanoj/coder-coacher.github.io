the course let's quickly recap what we
learned in this course we started out
talking about angular 1 services we
looked at vive even need services then
how do you use them look at multiple
types of services we looked at constant
value factory and service two of the
more common services that you're going
to be using in your angularjs
programming would be the factory and the
service now we also looked at how to
choose between the two when would you
want to use a factory versus a service
service then we moved on to the dollar
HTTP service which is around to the Box
service that comes with angular 1 it
lets you make REST API calls and it
returns what's called promises we then
learned what promises are and how we can
use them to make asynchronous
programming work in JavaScript and in
this particular case angular we looked
at how other HTTP returns a promise
which can have a den method where you
pass in a function and access the value
that the service returns and then
finally we put all those things to
practice by building our contact app
which lets us manage a bunch of contacts
and also interacted with the server by
getting the data from a REST API
endpoint and also persisting data to
that REST API endpoint so hopefully this
gives you a fair idea of how to use
services in angular and how you can
create services as well as use the
out-of-the-box services and as I say at
the end of almost all of my courses this
isn't at the end there's still a lot to
learn and explore definitely check out
the angularjs documentation about
services there are a lot of new answers
to these things and you know writing
code and trying out all these things is
definitely helping your understanding so
good luck in your learning journey and
thanks for watching this course
