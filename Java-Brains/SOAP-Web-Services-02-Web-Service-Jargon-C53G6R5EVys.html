some of the terminologies and some of
the concepts associated with the web
service technology let's start with an
example of let's start with the scenario
let's say I'm writing the Java
implementation class right I have a MPO
and I want to share this implementation
with other developers of the project so
how would I share it so let's say you
have a consumer class
I want to share this I'm filled with
this consumer class how would I do it
the best way to share such
implementation classes the contract of
the implementation class would be as an
interface
right now create an interface for this
I'm bill and any consumer would consume
this I appeal through this interface
right in the interface they would
actually call an implementation through
the interface so they get the contract
they get to know what are the methods
what are they may know the arguments
what are the return types through this
interface and then they actually call
the methods of the impr right so an
interface is a standard way in which you
can share any contract like this to a
consumer right so now think about how
this would work in the case of a web
service now let's say I have a web
service implementation and I want to
share the details off this web service
to the consumer
I have a consumer here then I want to
share the details of this web service to
that consumer now would an interface
work
let's say I create the Interfaith and
share it with the consumer would it work
well it probably might not work because
as we discussed in the previous tutorial
you don't know what technology this
consumer is I mean it could be a C++
application or it could be a dotnet
application right you never really know
and let's say you have a java web
service right a web service is written
in Java you might want to give some kind
of an interface that a consumer
irrespective of the technology can
actually consume right so let's say this
consumer is a C++ application now if I
give the C++ developer a Java interface
they'll probably have some interesting
things to say to me so that would
probably not work right so this contract
that I'm going to share with a web
service consumer has to be technology
independent right it should be something
that any any application any technology
can understand right so an interface
would probably not work now when the
developers of the you know when the
creators of the web service
specification thought about this problem
what they came up with was a format that
would be understood by all the
technology and all the consumers any
guesses what this format is well it's
actually eczema
all right so what do you do is when you
create a web service and you want to
share the contract of the web service
you actually share that contract as an
XML document right this XML document is
actually what's called as WS DN or it's
pronounced as wisdom stands for web
service description language or web
service definition language so what this
visible document contains is the
contract to your web service right so
that's one thing you would have to do
when you create a web service you share
the Vistal document off that web service
to the consumers right so there's not
something you would have to do manually
you can do it manually if you want but
then there are tools which generate the
wisdom for our web cells right but this
is something that you need to share with
your consumers it's an XML document so
irrespective of whether the application
is C++ or dotnet they can all pass this
XML and get to know what the web
services and typically the contents of
this Vistal is kind of similar to what
an interface - right it has the methods
it's called as operations in the
webservice world so it has what are the
methods that can be called right what
are the arguments
what is return time
I think this is this is typically what
an interface contains as well so at a
very high level this information is
present in the pistol now of course we
will take a you know more detailed look
at it later but these information will
be available in the pistol and then the
consumer application knows what to call
ok all right so now let's say you are
you're writing your own application I do
have a client application
and you are in a mode to call some web
services right so how do you know what
web services to call right we know that
one way to get information about the web
service is the mr. it whistle is the
interface to the web service but how do
you get hold of the Vista well there are
these these directories of web services
kind of like the yellow pages of web
services where you can actually query
and get information about web services
and these directories are called
UD d I uddi stands for universal
description discovery and integration
some people pronounce it as UD I don't
know I knew a guy who used to call jndi
as Jin D and I thought that was bad
enough but yeah this is this is uddi and
this is like the Yellow Pages of web
services
it's a registry where little your new
business creating a web service can
actually register your web service over
here and anybody who wants to consume
that web service can actually query this
directory and they can use the web
service right they can find the web
service first of all and then they can
get the visitors and they can use it so
uddi is not a very popular concept at
least it didn't get the kind of adoption
that was originally intended but you
might get to use it so it's good to know
okay so now we've learned to web service
jargons so far we learnt what a visited
us and you learned what you DT is okay
let's move on now let's say you've
queried uddi and you've got the Vistal
and now you are writing your client
application that calls the web service
right - this is your client app again
right and you're writing a job
application that calls this web service
you have a web service here and you've
got the visible document
and you want to call this web service so
anything you write in your client
application is playing Java classes
right so you have Java code inside
methods now think for a minute about how
this exchange happens right now we've
got the wisdom and you know what
information needs to be sent and what is
the return type right but the question
is how do you actually send this
information now let's say the input
argument to the string right so you have
a Java string with you and you need to
send it to the web service how do you
send it let's say the output the return
type is a list right how do you get that
information because this could be a C++
application and a string in Java is
obviously different from a string in C++
now how do you exchange this data
between the client application and the
web service well again when you're
exchanging any information be it the
input argument or the return type you
need to exchange it in the format that
all these different technologies can
understand irrespective of the actual
implementation technology it should be
able to understand what you're passing
and it should be able to send a return
type back in a language that all these
different technologies can understand
any guesses what this format is yes it's
XML again so whenever you're sending any
information across the network from a
client to the web service and then the
return type back to the client it has to
be in an XML format right so you cannot
really send a string or a list or
anything like that
you cannot serialize Java objects and
send them across because if this is a
C++ application what will it do with the
serialize Java object doesn't really
have any idea so it has to be in a
language neutral format which is XML
again right so there is the
specification about how you need to send
all these different input types and
output arguments basically any data type
needs to be sent in a specific XML
format it's a protocol really it's it's
a way in which both the you know the
sender and the receiver understands and
this protocol this XML product
this called soap right it's called
simple object access protocol make sense
it's a very in which these different
technologies can access objects can
access data right and it is supposedly
simple so that's a part of the name it's
called simple object access protocol
right it's kind of an understanding so
that all these different technologies
written in different languages can kind
of understand what they're all talking
about okay
so this is the third terminology that
you need to understand right it's so now
you know what is the web service right
you know what needs to be sent and you
know how to send it which is using the
soap protocol now who does this
conversion right so you have your string
object you have your own complex object
and datatypes now how do you do the
conversion from a Java object to a soap
message so the conversion is actually
done by an intermediary class over here
right so this class takes care of
converting all your objects into a soap
message right the whole method call
itself needs to be converted to a soap
message right because the message itself
is interpreted with the other end so
this conversion is actually done by
what's called as a s e aÃ­ and it stands
for service endpoint interface so what
the service endpoint interface does is
it acts as an interface to your web
service endpoint right so this is your
web service endpoint this is what
actually does provide you the service so
you have an interface at your client
application to the service endpoint
which translates the whole web service
call to a soap message and then it makes
sure that the other thing is able to
understand this message right it follows
the protocol so this
is called as the service endpoint
interface and we don't actually have to
write this class and write all the
conversions ourselves we can have this
automatically generated for us but then
this is something that you need to
understand and then when you are making
a web service call you don't worry about
where the web server is and where you
need to call all you need to do is have
this service endpoint interface created
generated and then you call a method of
this service endpoint interface and the
good thing about the service endpoint
interface is that you can actually have
an interface that's specific to what you
are developing right see this is a java
application you can have a service
endpoint interface that is specific to a
java application so it knows to convert
java objects to a soap message right now
let's say you're writing a c++
application calling the same web service
and it's calling the exact same web
service so you will have a service
endpoint interface here for c++
that knows how to convert C++ objects to
soap message how to convert a C++ access
to web service to a soap message right
so it takes care of handling all this
web service and soap complexity so that
you can actually write C++ code which
calls a method it's as simple as that
and then this takes care of all the web
service complexity and you don't have to
deal with it so we have learned four
different terminologies so far we have
learned what a WSDL is a visitor stands
for web service description language
document which describes what a web
services in an XML format the different
technologies can understand and then
we've learnt what you DD is it is a
directory where any publisher can
publish their web services and consumer
can query this directory and get access
to all the different web services third
we've learned what Sobers it's basically
a protocol it's a language it's a format
again an XML format that is used to
encode and decode different messages
you're making a call to web service it
ends up as a soap message that gets
transmitted over the network so that the
you know the web service itself
irrespective of the technology can
understand it therefore we've learned
what a service endpoint interfaces it's
an interface to the service endpoint
it's an interface to the web service
that provides a way for your client
application irrespective the technology
to call the web service so depending on
the technology you get a service
endpoint interface for that technology
so a java application has a java service
endpoint interface and a darknet
application as a dotnet service endpoint
interface and this is something you can
actually generate out of the web service
itself out to the visitor can actually
generate a service endpoint interface
and you can your code can actually use
it all right so these are some of the
important concepts about web services
that you need to understand we're going
to go into more detail in the next
