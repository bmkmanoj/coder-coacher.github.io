single table inheritance strategy
provided by have innate and we learn
that that's the default strategy that
hibernate goes for if you do not specify
any inheritance configuration in this
tutorial we're going to look at another
type of inheritance strategy that we can
configure and this strategy is called
the table per class strategy so what
we're going to do is we're going to have
a separate table for each of the classes
that we need to persist so here a
vehicle is going to be a separate table
two-wheeler is going to be a separate
table and the 4-wheeler is going to be a
separate table um it does not as
straightforward as it seems there are a
few things that we need to consider so
let's let's try to implement this let me
remove this discriminator column we
don't need the discriminator column if
you are implementing our table per class
strategy the whole reason why the
discriminator column existed in the
single table strategy is because all the
all the objects of three different
classes were being dumped into the same
table so if three different objects are
in the same table we need a way to
isolate different objects say for
example I need to get only the
two-wheeler objects from the table what
would I do I would just use the
discriminator column to differentiate
the two wheeler objects from the other
object so what I would do is if I have
you know a discriminator value as bike
for tubular objects so I would say
select everything from this vehicle
table where they discriminate a column
vehicle type equals bike so that's the
way in which I can pull up the data for
the particular class slab in mine and
that's reason why the discriminator
column was there in order to identify or
your records which are there because of
a particular object or a particular
class now if I have separate tables for
each of these classes I will no longer
need the discriminator because it's
fairly straightforward if I need a
two-wheeler object I would go to the
tabular table if I need a 4-wheeler
object or go to the 4-wheeler table so
there's no need for a discriminator if
we have a table per class strategy so
let's change this inheritance type to
our table per class strategy okay so
this is all that's needed actually a let
me remove the discriminator from these
two entities as well and save so let me
save this pattern class as well now this
is all that's required again happen if
there's a lot of things you know it does
a lot of default actions we don't have
to configure each and everything so
let's run this and see what's happening
so again what we have done this we have
marked the parent class as an entity and
we have defined the inheritance strategy
as stable per class and then of course
we have marked the child classes also as
entities so both of these have been
marked as entities
now in my main method I have a vehicle
object I have a two-wheeler object and I
have a four-wheeler object and I'm
saving all the three of them now let's
see how hibernate persist at this time
whether table per class strategy so
let's run this so here you can see it is
inserting three records here one is it's
doing an insert to Vega it's doing an
insert to two-wheeler just doing an
insert into four-wheeler
let's query the database and see how the
tables look like now in the vehicle it
just has the vehicle ID and the vehicle
name which is simple enough we have we
only have these two properties for the
vehicle class so you have the vehicle ID
you have to make the name so it's saving
only those values because our vehicle
object that we have created has just the
ID and the name so it's saving only
those two values now let's try querying
the other table here
two-wheeler again it's the name of the
class itself so let's strike waiting the
to be table okay so here we have the
vehicle ID the vehicle name and the
steering handle note that the two
wheeler class has only the steering
handle declared in the class the ID and
the name are things that it gets due to
its inheritance now see here we have the
ID in the name and here we have a
generated value for the ID so not only
does the two wheeler Class inherit the
ID and the name properties it also
inherits this generated value annotation
it's almost as if you have the ID and
the name properties here and you also
have the generated value annotation here
so hibernate has generated the ID it has
the vehicle ID and the vehicle names
it's generated this ID as well and the
property off the class the steering
handle has also been added so the two
wheeler has these three columns now
let's have a look at the four wheeler
it's again similar even this inherits
the ID and the name and of course it
also inherits the generated value
annotation so hibernate is generating
the key for this class as well and then
it has the property of the class itself
so the points here to note are this
first of all it's having a separate
table for each of the classes so no
matter how many inheritance levels are
there each class has its own table
secondly the parent classes properties
are inherited and they form separate
columns even in the child tables so
since it's in Herring inheriting the
properties and since it might have
values in those properties what
hibernate does is it creates columns for
the parent member variables as well in
the child tables the third thing is the
annotation for the ID see here we have a
vehicle ID and you're marking it as a
generator
value so this generated value of the
parent class is also inherited to the
child classes so even the child classes
will have an ID which is generated by a
Bennett and those IDs are being
populated in the tables as well so the
advantage of this method is that you
don't need a discriminator to identify
what type of object it is or two wheeler
table has only two wheeler objects and a
four wheeler table has only four wheeler
objects so it's easier to identify what
is the source of the data what object it
came from and the second thing is it is
in a normalized form you don't have
extra columns which do not have data say
in the single table strategy I have you
know I have inherited the vehicle class
into a two wheeler and a four wheeler
say but I only have two objects in the
two wheeler and four wheeler class and
all my objects are from the vehicle
class in that case you have two columns
that are null for most of the records in
the table so this is actually not very
efficient when it comes to database
design and it is not in a normalized
format so this is avoided if you have
the separate table table per class
strategy so each table has from a
different class each inherited class has
its own table and its it you don't have
any records where the columns have null
values just because it's not it's not
applicable to that particular class
every table has only the properties that
it needs and it does not inherit any
blank columns because some other child
has implemented some of the columns so
that way it's more efficient when it
comes to word you know it's a more
elegant way of designing tables and this
is something that you would normally do
if you were designing tables for these
objects were you not using hibernate
this is how you do what you would
normally not do the single table
strategy if you are not using hibernate
because it's not really very efficient
but you know the single table strategy
is a default and the table per class
there's something that we can implement
if you want this kind of a design so the
next tutorial we're going to look at the
third way in which we can implement
inheritance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
