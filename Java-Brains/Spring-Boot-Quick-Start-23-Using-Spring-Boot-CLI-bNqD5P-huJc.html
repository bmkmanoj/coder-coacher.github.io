interface which lets you create spring
applications so let's look at that in
this video you can search for the term
spring boots CLI in a search engine are
you can follow the link that I provided
in the video description to get to this
page where this is like it tells you
what spring boots CLI is and how to use
it so it's basically a command line tool
that can be used if you want to quickly
prototype with spring as the description
says it lets you Brun groovy scripts so
that's probably the best use case for
spring boots CLI it lets you create
simple groovy scripts that you can run
and those become close pretty good
applications this is not something that
you typically use if you're managing an
application you know all the way from
development to production and you want
to apply it at a particular place but as
for quick prototyping this is really
useful
the vid install it goes by either
downloading these zip files and
extracting it locally and then he can
run the jar with the Java dash jar
command R you have a couple of other
options you can use SDK man or you can
use homebrew on OS X to install this
program but the idea is you're gonna
have to download it and install it
either as a zip file or by using any of
these package managers and you're going
to have a command-line utility that you
can use in this tutorial I'm going to do
the manual installation because this is
something that will work for any
operating system so that's what I'm
going to do so what you do is follow the
link in the description of this video
are or you can just you know using the
search engine you can search for spring
boots CLI you're going to get this page
and click on this dot zip file to
download and extract it
so once you've downloaded and extracted
the zip file go to that directory and
then here you can see there are a couple
of executables so one is the spring
executable for Linux and Mac and then
you have the spring that bad for the
windows so I can execute this by running
it here and here you see it gives you a
bunch of
commands does you water the commands and
a little bit of a description about what
you need to use it for the one thing
that I'm going to try now is to use this
thing called spring run it lets you run
a spring groovy script now what is a
spring groovy script it's a script which
you can use to actually bootstrap a
complete spring wood application yes
you're not even creating a project you
have a complete spring application just
by this one script file I'm going to
demonstrate that in this in this video
but again like I said I wouldn't imagine
you using it a lot in the real world
scenario it's more for demonstration and
frankly it's a little bit gimmicky but
it is what it is and I'll just
demonstrate once which use for it so
let's say I want to create a simple
hello world REST API so right now if you
were to create a spring boot project you
would have to create a maven project and
then download it or you have to go to
spring initializer download the zip file
extract it and then build on top of it
but here's a shorter way for quick
prototyping I can create a simple groovy
file so I'll create a simple groovy
files using nano dot groovy any editor
should do up here what I'm going to do
is create that controller class that's
all I need to do I don't have to create
an application class here there's going
to be a groovy script which is going to
be just the controller class so I'm
going to have the annotation addressed
controller and then there's going to be
a class so a class in groovy has the
keyword class and then followed by the
name so I'm going to see ETR ll apt ctrl
and here I can create a method so I can
have a method with the add request
mapping and I'm going to map this to the
root URL and this method I'm going to
call string up
and then this is going to just do a
return off hello earth I don't have to
have a return because groovy does not
need a return keyword I just have to
specify the string and that gets
returned so this is a simple groovy
script now I can save this and I have a
groovy file in my directory now I can
run this by using the spring command
that we already saw bus and run and then
I pass in the name of the file which is
after groovy and I do this what spring
boot is going to do is it's going to
create a complete spring boot
application just based off of that one
groovy class so this has declared that
as controllers figured out it it's a
controller and it has published the
slash mapping to that root URL so that
when I access this I'm going to get the
hollow wall back
so let's verify that accessing localhost
8080 and here you see halliwell return
so this is a very good way to prototype
simple spring applications using Ruby
scripts spring CLI also has a bunch of
other options you can actually create a
project using command-line arguments and
it actually leverages what we already
seen in spring initializer so it kind of
has the same framework underneath just
multiple ways of kind of leveraging that
framework to create projects so
definitely check out Springs your life
if you're interested in this kind of a
thing and look at some of the other
command-line arguments that you can pass
to Springs you like to do a bunch more
stuff with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
