in theory the previous unit was mainly
about tearing and not really specific to
Jax IRAs are really about Java dot right
it was about ray CPI what a good design
for a recipe is and we actually designed
the REST API far an application we
called messenger like a social media
application where people can post
messages and comment on it and have
profiles and all that stuff so in this
unit we're going to switch gears we can
actually start writing some code and
it's obvious we're going to use Java and
jax-rs
to implement these REST API so before we
start writing the code but talk a little
bit about what jax-rs
is so in Java we have libraries for
everything right so we have a library to
read a file we have libraries to handle
collections we have libraries which
write XML JSON and all that stuff so
pretty much anything you want to do this
is very likely going to be a library for
it now considering that REST API is are
so popular you would guess that there is
a library for writing REST API in Java
and you would be right there are
actually several REST API libraries and
you have libraries like rest easy
wristlet and there is Jersey of course
which is what we're going to be using in
this course so there are a whole lot of
libraries which let you write REST API
applications I'm so mentioned that you
don't really need a library to write
REST API applications right so you can
write simple servlet applications which
can do a REST API request response but
the library kind of makes things simple
so you don't have to do everything
yourself so considering that there are
all these different libraries now the
next question is which library do you
choose to learn right so you want to
learn rest let do you want to learn rest
easy because it's got easy in the name
why would you want to learn just Jersey
and you know if you make a choice how
much effort does it take to learn
another library but the good news is if
you learn one of these libraries you've
pretty much learned them
because what has happened is all these
different libraries follow a common
interface they follow a common API the
implement a common API so the API that
you learn is common across all these
different libraries which we learn in
Jersey you've learned them on or you've
learned rest let you learn them on
because they all follow the common API
and once you've written code which
others to that API you can kind of you
know let's say you're implementing in
Jersey you can actually take Jersey out
and put rest easy in and it should still
work seamlessly so the API is the same
so this common API is called jax-rs
and that's actually what we're going to
be learning in this course that's why
the title of this course is not the link
restful api swith Jersey it's building
restful api swith jax-rs and what you've
learned jax-rs
all these different libraries which
implement jax-rs are at your disposal
you can actually use any of those
libraries and again like I said you can
plug in play you write an application
using one you can take that library out
and use another library which implements
jax-rs and your application should still
work the way it works is something like
this the jax-rs API that we will learn
and use in this course is a bunch of
interfaces and annotations you will use
a lot of these annotations in the
subsequent tutorials and this is what
we'll learn in this course this is the
core of learning how to write REST API
is with jax-rs because this is jax-rs
in this course we'll be writing code
which uses a lot of classes from here
then how does Jersey fit into the
picture the thing is while this has all
the jax-rs
interfaces and annotations it doesn't
have any functionality you need classes
that implement these interfaces and read
these annotations
that's where libraries come in these
libraries they look at your code and see
where you've coil the jax-rs api's and
then they do the actual work ok so
you've built your application
you need to deploy it on a server like
Tomcat you need to you need to include
one of these libraries with the
application so that there is some
library in the Tomcat instance that does
the actual work that the API promises to
do so what you would typically do is one
you write your application using Jack's
Alice using the api's using those
interfaces and annotations and all that
and two you deploy your application to
Tomcat along with the jax-rs AP classes
and library of your choice the API
classes is because you're using those
classes and the library of your choice
because that's the library that's what
does the actual work the good news here
is you don't have to include these two
different things
every jax-rs library comes with a copy
of these API classes already so you just
include the library of your choice with
your application and you can just plug
this thing into Tomcat and it'll work so
that's the advantage of Jack Cyrus you
can seamlessly replace one library with
the other like I've already told you
because your application depends on just
the API classes interfaces and
annotations right there's the first
thing and second thing because every
Jack Cyrus implementation has a copy of
those API classes this works seamlessly
okay so now to address the other
question about which library to learn
but we've established that the choice of
library doesn't matter you can choose
rest easy you can choose Apache link or
Jersey or whatever but why did I choose
Jersey for this course
I chose Jersey because it's what's
called a reference implementation this
really is what it sounds like it's like
a model implementation for the API and
this implementation is built by a lot of
the same people who designed the API
specification itself so if you have to
pick one library at least for the
purpose of learning you cannot go wrong
by picking the reference implementation
so that's a brief overview of what jack
services are we're going to be using
jersey in this course but again
that shouldn't scare you you want to use
another library you can actually do so
and actually follow along in this course
I tend to use Jersey a lot when I'm
talking about jax-rs
but note that they are interchangeable
so in the rest of your course whenever
you hear me say ok Jersey does this or
Jersey does that I'm basically meaning
it's jax-rs which doesn't you can
actually take Jersey out from my
sentences and plug in your favorite
library and you should still be good
so that's jax-rs in a nutshell in the
next tutorial we can actually set up our
project to write code using jax-rs and
Jersey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
