at a couple of quick topics and we'll
wrap up that I'm going to talk about
some of the next steps you can take from
here so we'll start with some of the
inbuilt
objects for JavaScript so javascript
language comes with some inbuilt objects
out of the box the first subject we
already looked at this arrays arrays are
objects right under the hood every array
is actually a JavaScript object now we
looked at the length property of an
array and we said that JavaScript kind
of maintains that length property it
always keeps it up to date with whatever
is the the greatest index plus one
javascript also has a few methods that
come out of the box that arrays now that
we have looked at functions and you
understood how functions can be a part
of an object you can look at this and
kind of get an idea of how these
functions work with the D array object
so some of the functions that we
typically use with arrays are you know
push is a common function so when you
want to add an element to an array you
can use the push function that comes in
the theory every time you use an array
the array object comes with this push
function out of the box the push
function takes an argument and then adds
that argument as an element of the array
at the last location so let's say I have
a my array variable which points to an
array and let's say it has five five
elements right then you do a my array
dot push or 500 it's going to add a
sixth element to that array at the last
position and it's going to add the value
500 to it okay it's going to append it
there's also the pop which takes that
last element out from the array and we
have a couple more shift a none shift
which are the equivalence of push and
pop on the front right adding and
removing elements from the front of the
array
let me quickly demonstrate this with an
example let's say I have an array for
my array is 10 20 hello an empty object
mixture of values now I can add actually
let me do this in the console that's
easier all right
now I can add an element to the array by
using the push method so I can say my
array to push and I push the value then
all right now notice what happens the
push method returns the updated length
of the array now if I were to print my
array I would get that value 10 add it
to it if I were to remove it I can use
the pop method so my array dot pop is
going to remove it and it's going to
return the value that it removed now if
I were to access my array again it's
gone I do my array dot pop I get back
the object and the axis my array again
that object is gone I can also do use
shift and unshift to work at the front
of the array so I can do a my array
touch shift takes that first element out
with just n now that element is gone
runs 20 and hello I can also do my array
dot unchipped now sorry about that it's
or small letter it's not s caps if I
were to do a run shift and print my
array again you notice that that's added
to the front of the array and it pushes
kind of pushes every other element to
the side so these are some common
functions available in arrays</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
