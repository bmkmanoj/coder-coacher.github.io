previous set of tutorials we have done
dependency injection for primitives and
string member variables of classes in
this tutorial we're going to do some
quote unquote real dependency injection
we are going to have another object
which our object is dependent on and
we're going to inject that object to the
object that we need so I'm going to take
an example of the triangle the this is
the same class that we had used earlier
I'm going to remove some stuff here I
don't need all these options here really
have we had all these constructors and a
lot of things we don't need all of that
now the draw method as well I will
rewrite for this tutorial so the object
that I have in mind is a point object a
triangle consists of three points so my
triangle object will have three
different points so let me first create
a point object so go here to my package
say new and class call this point and
finish now a point consists of two
values one is an int X and in Y I'll
mark them both as private and I'll
generate getters and setters for them
okay let's save this so here what I want
to do is you want to have three
different point objects so I will say
private point point a and the same way
I'll have a point B and a point C so let
me generate the getters and setters for
these as well
which generate getters and setters for
all of them okay so now the intention
here is to use the spring dependency
injection to pre populate these point
values now what would we normally do if
we were not using spring what would we
do we would initialize three point
objects here all right we would say new
point a new point B a new point C we
would set the values it's a pointed or x
equals point eight or y equals again
point B wrote x equals point B road
vehicles would initialize all the values
for these three points a b and c then we
would say new triangle and then we would
assign the points to this triangle
object so this there's a whole lot of
initialization that we need to do here
you're not using spring you would have
to do all of them manually either we'd
have to draw in the drawing app or we'd
have to do the initialization in the
triangle class if we do the
initialization in the triangle class
that means that this triangle will have
a fixed coordinates so you will have a
fixed set of coordinates it will have
only one point a one point B and one
point C of course you can use the
setters to change it but you would have
a fixed starting point and if you do it
over here then the code would be over
here then we can have multiple triangle
objects with different points but the
thing here is that we would have to do
all the initialization ourselves so in
this example what we're going to do is
we're going to use spring to initialize
these three points for us so let's say
for this example just remove this is
again the remnant of our previous
tutorial okay so this is the basic
triangle beam definition so let's say
for our example I'll create three points
one is the zero point zero comma zero
and I'll create two more points
I'll have a - straining comma zero and
zero comma 20 so these are the three
coordinates that I want this triangle to
have so I need to define this in my
spring dot XML so how do I do that so
the first thing I do is I define three
different beans for these three points
you see here we need three point objects
so all the three point objects I will
define over here so let's say bean ID
equals I call this zero point class
equals org dot cosh v dot Java brains
dot point so I have my point being
definition here so this is equal into
calling a new point so what I lose here
I will preset the value so just like I
used to do for the others the other
example you know in our previous
tutorial I'll use a property tag in
order to initialize this zero point with
x and y values a zero comma zero so have
property name equals x value equals zero
stag the same way I'll have a property
name equals y and value equal zero so I
have defined zero point so this creates
an object of this point class with the x
and y set as zero okay so this is the
first step now note that the strangle
does not know about that point yet we
need to reference that point here but as
of now it just created a point object
the same way what I'll do is I'll create
two other point objects okay I'll call
this put this point to call this point
three so the values that I'm going to
pass this one it's going to be minus 20
and for this it's plus twini okay so now
we have three point objects that we have
told spring to create now spring needs a
trigger to create this right so let's
say for example I want to initialize
these three point objects I could do
this in the drawing app I could say
context start get beam let's say zero
point and it would give me a point
object with X&amp;amp;Y set to zero to be an
object of this class set x and y a zero
and it would return me a point object so
the same way in my drawing app if I say
is get beam of 0.2 it would return me an
object of this point class again but
with x and y values set like this so I
can get these objects over here right I
can get the objects over here just like
I could do a get beam I can get a zero
point I can get point - and I can get
point three and I can say triangle dot
set point a triangle dot set point be
triangle at set point see that work in
that case this triangle will have these
three points set as the three points
that we've defined here but there is a
better way to do this so just like in
our triangle we did a property right we
had a property tag and we had name
equals the name of the variable and
value equals the value that we needed to
set so if this were
a string we would have the name and then
we would pass the string itself in this
case think about it
the remember variable is actually an
object now since we have referenced the
object over here since we have specified
the object over here what I can do is I
can ask spring to get me this object and
set this property so what I will do is
say I have point a here right I would
say name equals point a and the value
that I need to set for this is actually
a reference to another beam in this XML
so in this case what I would do is I
would not specify a value tag let's
specify a reference tag and I would say
the value of this should be this beam
that I am referring from this bring dot
XML so I'll pass this as zero point okay
now I will do the same thing for the
other two points as well so I will have
point B which refers to this point
object I'll have Point C which refers to
the Third Point object and sink okay so
now what's going to happen this the
spring framework is going to first
encounter this treatment car next art
get beam and the context art get beam it
looks up the spring rod XML it says okay
I need to return this beam now this beam
has three property value set so it has
to satisfy these property assignments
before spring hands over the object back
to our application so what are the
properties that we need to be assigned
so we have a point D which is an object
over here that we have define that's a
point object and we ask spring to give a
reference to a beam so this looks up
over here so there is another beam here
which is off point okay and it has these
two values of the property set so it's
going to create this beam
first this is similar to what we saw
earlier it's going to create the beam
that's going to set the properties and
then instead of returning the beam what
it does is it assigns it to this
property of the main beam that it's
actually working on so next it's going
to look at point B it's actually a
reference to point two and it's going to
create an instance of point two it's
going to set the values and it's going
to assign this point of reference to a
property of this beam that it's actually
working on same way point three it's
going to create this point three beam
and it's going to assign it to the Point
C member variable of this triangle
object and then once the strangle object
is all created it's going to return back
to this drawing app class that's
actually making a reference to the gate
beam so spring does all these things
automatically for us okay we don't have
to do a gate beam of each and every
object that we are looking at we just
have to do all the first level okay the
first level object that we need we need
to get it by a gate beam but then after
that you can have as many nested objects
as we want now say for example the point
here has another object as a member
variable you can actually create another
beam which is actually an instance of
that object and then do a reference I
can have a property I can do a ref
instead of an actual value here and then
so it's going to be this beam inside
this beam inside this beam so you can go
as deep as you want spring is going to
make sure it creates all the beans in
order and it's going to make sure all
the properties of this main beam are
assigned and satisfied before it hands
over the beam back to us so let's test
this out in my triangle draw I'm going
to print out these three points so I'm
going to say system dot out println
let's say pouring a equals and get
point A plus get I'm sorry this is get
find a dot get X and this is get point a
doctor kit why okay so I'm just printing
out all the coordinates it's not
anything special here and then close
those parentheses okay I'll do the same
thing for the other two points so point
B is again get for envy dot get X and
get point B dot get Y point see there's
get point C dot get X and get point Z
dot get Y ok now let's run this and see
what it prints there you can see all the
three points have been prefilled so
things that you are seeing here these
are not actually values off the triangle
object this is actually an object inside
the triangle object and that object has
it these values that you are seeing over
here so spring does this recursively and
it's going to make create all these
objects assign the object to my object
that I'm trying to get and then it's
going to return the object so this is
dependency injection that spring
provides for us and this is very handy
because we have a full map of the object
that we need we don't have to do a new
do a set point and then do a set X set Y
all these things have been room there's
one consolidated place where you have
the map of the objects and the values
that you need and we just initialize
everything just by doing one call to the
gate beam method</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
