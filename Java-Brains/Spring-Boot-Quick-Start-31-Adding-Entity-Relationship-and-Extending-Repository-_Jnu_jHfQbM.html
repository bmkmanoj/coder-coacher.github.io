problems that we wanted to solve the
first problem was how do we let the
spring data JPA know that the stopping
is basically a foreign key to the
primary key of the topic table first
question the second question is how do
we give the course service to be able to
get all the courses for a particular
topic we have get all courses where it
gets everything and then we want to add
a topic related filter here so how do we
do those so let's start with the course
class for both these problems there are
shortcuts in the spring data JPA
framework which lets you do these things
pretty easily now let's look at that
what do we have to do the first thing is
a topic how do we establish a mapping
between the course and the topic this
mapping is what's referred to as a mini
to one relationship from the course
right if you look at a course there
could be many courses which are
associated with the topic so this
relationship between the course and the
topic is a mini to one relationship so
turns out in order to establish this
kind of a mini to one relationship you
use another annotation which is a JPA
annotation and that annotation is at
Mini 2 one I'm going to import mini two
one from Java X dot persistence like
you've seen with the other two
annotations all the GPI annotations are
in the package Java X dot persistence it
has nothing to do with spring boot or
spring data GPA it's basically JPA
itself you can use many other frameworks
which 2rm which have GPA support like
for example hibernate can just read this
annotation and know exactly what to do
now let's look at the course service the
course service is making a call to the
find all method this is not good enough
anymore you want to be able to create a
new method on the course repository
which finds courses by topic ID and that
doesn't exist right now because the crud
repository has just the basic crud
operations it doesn't have these kind of
filters what we going to do is go to the
course repository
and add a new method over here you
remember I told you that the course
repository is basically inheriting all
the methods that come from the crud
repository what the spring data JPA
frame would let you do is define methods
in your course repository which are just
method declarations there's an interface
right so you just do method declarations
and what the spring data JPA framework
is going to do is it's going to look at
your method name and figure out what's
the implementation that you need based
on that it is which is kind of crazy so
let me explain what I mean by that now
what is the method that we need we need
a method which takes in a topic ID and
returns a list of courses now let's say
I make this method here a public list
off courses get courses by topic and
then I'm going to pass in a topic ID all
right now this is a method that we need
now if you define a method like this you
will also need to define an
implementation however if you define a
method in a particular way if you have a
particular name for your methods in your
repository class you can provide a hint
for spring data GPA about what it is
that you need filtered by because the
crud repository already knows how to get
records right it knows how to get all
the course data what you need is an
extra filter so that it gets only the
records which match a particular
condition so here's how you name your
methods so that the implementation
becomes automatic let's start with a
simple use case let's ignore topic for a
minute because that's a little bit more
complicated let's start with a simple
use case where you want to get all the
courses given a particular name we see
here course has a string property called
name and now this is going to result in
a name column in the course table now
what if you wanted a method in your
repository which gets all the courses
based on the name let's say this is get
courses
by name right and let's call this name
now let's say you want this method now
there is a particular way in which you
can call this method so that the spring
data API provides the implementation
automatically now what is that name
syntax the name of the method should
follow this particular structure first
it should start with find if you look at
the service you see here that all these
fine methods start with the word fine
see there is find one and there was find
all so when you create your custom fine
method it should start with the word
fine now if I wanted all the courses I
do a fine dog if I'm doing this I don't
really need to provide the method
because it's already there as a part of
culture plus tree this is not what I
want I want to filter by a particular
condition so the next portion of this
name will be a body and then what is the
property based on which we want to
filter by in this case its name and then
the method argument will contain the
name and with this I'm done defining a
method which gets all the courses based
on the name right so this is a method
which takes in the name any arbitrary
string and does a search in the database
in the course table for all the courses
that have the name property as what you
are passing over here right now this is
all you have to do now in your service
or anywhere else if you want to filter
courses based on name that's all you
have to do we have to say course
repository dot find by name then you
assign whatever name you want and this
method is going to be implemented by the
spring data JP and you're going to get
only the courses which have the name as
what you have pasture right that's
pretty cool you don't have to do the
presentation yourself you just have to
define your method with that particular
structure and it's going to work now
let's say you want to create a method
which returns all the courses which have
a particular description as a string how
do you
do that again it's fairly simple exactly
like this you have a list of courses
instead of name you say fine by
description and now what's going to
happen is the spring data GP is going to
say it's fine by and it's going to split
this portion of the method name and see
if it matches a field here it matches
this one so what it's going to do is
it's going to run a filter and whatever
you're the string you're going to pass
it in call this it doesn't matter so
what are we going to pass it's going to
match that to the description column in
your database and then return only the
courses that match that so it's it's
actually super easy you can create
multiple methods like this and have it
be available anywhere else in your in
your project but this is not what we
need what do we need we need to filter
by topic Heidi so this work well find by
topic would have word if the topic
property on the course was a string now
let's say this was a string I could have
done this I could have said find by
topic and bust in the topic name which
is a string that would have work but
unfortunately this is not a string this
is a class of its own
so not only do I have to specify this
property I also have to specify the
property off the class that is which is
the ID I have to add that also to the
method name so when I'm referring to a
property which is a string I just say
fine bye and the property name but I'm
referring to a property which is not a
string but it's an object and I'm
looking at a field in that object in
that class and I'm going to have to
specify that field name as well in this
case it's topic ID all right I'm going
to pass in the topic ID now what this is
going to do is it's going to let spring
data JPA know that what you're looking
for is the topic property on the course
but then that's not all you're looking
at the ID property off that topic
property and that's what you need to
find and that ID is provided over here
alright so now what I'm going to do is
in my course service I'm going to get
all courses given a topic
Heidi and here what I'm gonna do is
rather than do a find all I'm gonna say
fine by topic ID and I'm going to pass
in the topic ID and then I get the
course I'm going to do the same thing as
I did before I'm going to add it to the
courses list but here what I'm doing is
I'm filtering by this particular ID and
thanks to this interface declaration the
method declaration and the interface
it's going to work seamlessly so I'm
going to save this and now in my course
controller or now I have the topic /id
slash courses and now here I'm taking
that ID and passing it to get all
courses off ID and now I'm passing this
to the repository and which is this new
thing that I've implemented and of
course the many to one mapping just
worth maps it to the topic table all
right now let me save this and execute
it when I do a get of all topics I'm not
going to get anything but what I'm going
to do is make a post well I'm going to
post JavaScript and I'm gonna post Java
so now I have a bunch of topics here
JavaScript and Java now what I'm going
to do is create a course gonna take Java
here topics slash Java if I were to
query the courses here if I were to do a
get of stopping slash are slash courses
I'm not gonna get anything because it
doesn't exist what I'm going to do is
make a post to topic slash our slash
gorgeous and in the body and paste this
payload well the ID is Java streams and
then the name is Java streams just an
example course and if I were to make a
post request to the courses not going to
get anything back but now let's do a get
to topic slash Java slash courses and
I'm going to get the Java streams course
and if you notice
there is a topic payload added to this
now what I'm doing is I'm getting the
job the course content I'm also getting
the topic that it is associated with and
the reason this is showing up this big
is in my entity class I have this topic
what I can do to prevent this from
happening is to lazily load this I'm not
going to go into the details of that
because that's very much a GPA concept
and we are in a spring boot course I
don't want to overwhelm you guys with
talking a lot about GPA but that is
something that you can do to potentially
avoid the topic object from being
fetched but right now it's fetching
everything so you get the topic as well
now what I can also do is I can go to
the courses slash Java - streams so I'm
basically accessing the ID directly if I
were to do a get I'm going to get just
that one thing let me go ahead and
update this I'm going to do a put
request here and in my body I don't have
to specify the topic here because like I
said that's something I'm going to
figure out automatically from the URL so
here I'm going to the URL Java
certificate that I automatically so I'm
going to say this is Java eight streams
which is the name of the course and Java
eight streams description which is the
description I'm gonna put again nothing
in the response if I were to do a get to
again Java slash courses let's end so
you see the updated value shows up right
so this is a quick introduction to JPA
the focus here is to see how spring boot
kind of helps you build these entity
classes and map them into relationships
the first thing that you had to do was
establish the relationship using the
right annotation test which establishes
the dependency whether it's a
one-to-many or a mini two one
and then in your course repository in
whatever repository you have you need to
define these extra methods so you can
define a bunch of fine methods which
provide you the functionality without
you having to write it for simple crud
you don't have to do anything you don't
have to define even this however when
you're finding records if you need to
filter by a particular field what you
need to do is create a method in that
course repository interface you don't
have to implement it just have to
declare it and the key is the name of
the method the name should be fine by
and then the property if the property is
basically an object then you need to
narrow it down further to the property
of that object which is a property so in
this case topic was a property now I'm
filtering by the ID of the topic so I
need to specify that as well there is a
one more step that I mentioned in the
beginning of this unit which is the
lessons API so not only do we have a
courses API you also have a lessons so
let's say I have this courses slash Java
- streams now let's say I want to get
all the lessons here I want to be able
to make a get request here and get all
the lessons that belong to this so this
involves creating a new package which is
the spring would start at lesson
creating a model object for it the
controller repository in this surface
I'm not going to do this because most of
the things that you would learn there
I've already covered with these lessons
so if you want to give it a shot
definitely do take that up as an
exercise and create those api's
controllers services and repository but
at this point of time this is where I
wrap up the JPA integration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
