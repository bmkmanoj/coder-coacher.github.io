have been following along the previous
tutorials you now know how to specify
beam definitions in the spring dot XML
and we also know how we can reference
beans as properties of other beans
by using the property tag and using the
ref' element of the tag in this tutorial
we're going to talk about a few points
relating to bean names and this is
something that you might encounter in
real world applications and it's a handy
thing to know first thing I'm going to
talk about is inner beans I like this
example that we used in our previous
tutorial what I did was I define a
triangle object and in my triangle
object
I had three point objects the point
objects are coordinates for the triangle
so a triangle has three different
coordinates now I define the three point
objects as separate bean definition so I
had a bean ID 0 point which was the
coordinate 0 0 I had a point 2 and a
point 3 object which was a different
values now here's the thing now zero
point is a common point that might be
accessed across different objects in my
drawing application but the other points
that I see here have specific values
that do not really have any meaning and
let's say I know for a fact that I
wouldn't be using point two object or
point three object anywhere else and
this would be used only for the triangle
then what I can do is I do not need to
specify these mean definitions
separately and give it a name instead
what I can do is I can define something
called as an inner beam so the whole
concept of the inner being is that I
remove this definition and I put it
inside the definition of the triangle
since we know that this is not going to
be used anywhere else I can completely
consolidate and put all the required
information inside this triangle Beall
beam itself and then only when I have a
particular value that I know might be
accessed by a different shape only then
I will use a separate beam definition so
in this case a zero point is a common
point that is used by many shapes so
what I'll do is I'll keep this as
separate external beam with an ID but
these two beans have specific values
that pertain only to the strai angles
and I'm going to move this definition
inside
thus triangle definition itself so in
order to specify the inner beam what we
need to do is in this property tag I'm
going to remove this re F of course I'm
going to leave the zero point as it
doesn't want to change for point B and
Point C so in this property tag I will
remove the reference here because
there's not going to be an external beam
and I will close the tag over here and
inside this property tag I can have this
beam definition so I'll just cut this
and fix it here
okay so inside the point-b property I'm
defining a beam so this is an inner beam
now the advantage of the inner beam is
that you have isolated the beam only
where it's required since this beam is
required only inside the triangle it
does not come up as a separate beam and
then the second thing is you do not need
to specify an ID for this one because an
ID is required only when you are
referencing the beam from somewhere else
either by using our EF like here where
you have to give the ID or by using the
gate beam where you have to give the ID
again so if you're not doing any of
those then you can actually do away with
the ID so here what's happening is since
the beam is inside the property tag it
knows that this beam has to be assigned
to this property and since this beam is
an inner beam it's not going to be
referenced anywhere else so there's
really no point in giving an ID tag here
so we can do away with the ID tag and
then the properties will remain the same
I will have to set these two values and
then the beam that gets created here
first of all gets assigned to this
property of the triangle object and
secondly since it's an inner beam it
does not have a separate ID as such and
it's not accessible by other objects it
is specifically only for the triangle
object similarly let's do the same thing
for Point C so I will add another
closing tag and I will move the point
three definition over here
okay and I'll save this so this triangle
object has two points that are specific
only for the triangle the other point
it's actually using is the the zero
point which is common and it can be used
by other objects as well so let's test
and make sure that it's working fine yes
it is so all the three points have been
populated and two of the points are
being populated by using inner beans and
again there's no really significant
performance or any other advantage by
using inner beans the only thing that
we're gaining here is that you
consolidate all the required values
configuration values inside a single
bean definition and if it's not needed
anywhere else it's always better to
specify the definition inside the bean
where it's actually needed you don't
need to specify the ID for the inner
bean of course you can have an ID as
I've demonstrated by forgetting to
remove this but there's really no point
in having an ID because you cannot
really refer it anywhere else so it is
not required okay so now that we've seen
the inner bean we look at one other one
of the naming facility that spring
provides and it's called
aliases so alias is a way in which we
can give different names to the same
bean and the reason why I would want to
do it there is you know it's actually
dependent on your coding practice depend
on the conventions but there are a
different names that you can give for
the same bean and then you can reference
using aliases anywhere in the order
spring application so the way to give a
li SS is by using an alias tag it's easy
it shows up over here so the earliest
tag has this very simple signature you
need to give a name and you need to give
an alias so the name is something that
you've already defined let's say for
example I take this triangle bean so I
is here okay and I call this triangle
alias so what I am doing this I am
giving a different name to the triangle
bean and then I can use this alias
anywhere in my application I can use
this as a
for some other bean or I can use this to
do a get bean so I can use a triangle
alias and still execute this it's still
going to create the same triangle that's
because as per spring this name also
refers to this beam so you can give as
many aliases as you want and then you
can refer using aliases you can also
give le s in the bean definition itself
so say for example I can give a name
property here triangle name so this is
again going to be another reference to
the same bean so you can have as many
names as we want for beans you can have
the ID you can have the name and you can
have aliases as many aliases as you want
but then a good practice is to use IDs
because you can have XML validation you
can have only one particular ID in all
the beans so you can if you define
another bean with the ID s triangle the
xml validator can catch the error so
it's better to use IDs in order to
reference being then you want to use a
different name for that particular
purpose you would use aliases okay one
final thing before we wind up we have
all these names and aliases and a whole
lot of different strings in which you
can refer to one beam if you want to
somehow restrict this and you want to
validate this say for this R if tag this
ref tag can point to a name it can point
to a bean ID and can point to an alias
so if you want to restrict it to only
IDs you have something called as an ID
ref and this will have to be nested
inside the property tag
so I open the property tag and instead
of a ref I add an ID ref now what the
IDF does is it makes sure that there is
a beam with the ID zero point in spring
dot XML if it's not there it's going to
throw an exception so this is one way
you can actually have a foolproof
reference and you make sure that the
reference is already there and this is a
kind of an extra validation that you can
have for your spring XML</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
