language true to its name there is
script in the name so javascript is a
scripting language so what is a
scripting language scripting language is
basically a language where instructions
are written for a runtime environment
the best example I can give for a
scripting language is something like a
shell script if you're if you've done
Linux programming or UNIX programming or
using shell scripts or even Windows
programming with the PowerShell you'll
be familiar with this idea so you have
commands that you can run on a runtime
environment and in this case the runtime
environment is your operating system
your shell but you can what you can also
do is you can take those commands bundle
them into a file and then execute that
file and that becomes a script that the
shell likes cute right
you could have executed those commands
one after another okay so let's say you
have a list directory command you can
execute the list directory command type
in LS or dir and show and see the list
of contents in the directory but if you
put that into a file
make it a script file and executed you
give it to the runtime and say hey
runtime these are my commands this is my
set of instructions code and execute it
the runtime interprets that and executes
it right so this is what scripting
language is usually do right so
javascript is a scripting language these
are basically when you write JavaScript
a basically writing instructions for a
runtime environment ok the question is
what is that runtime environment there
could be multiple different runtime
environments there are a lot of
different ways in which you can run
JavaScript but the most common in the
most popular runtime environment is your
web browser okay you must be familiar
with the fact that JavaScript runs on a
web browser okay so in a web browser you
have HTML CSS and JavaScript and then
the browser renders the HTML and runs
the JavaScript this is something you
should know if you are not familiar with
this please come out of the rock that
you're under javascript is kind of
ubiquitous today right you have so many
web applications that run complex pieces
of functionality on the clients browser
and all of that
courtesy of JavaScript so how does this
work how is this runtime environment
used in a web application so what
usually happens is when you have a web
browser and you're making a call to a
website right you type in a URL on the
web browser
what happens is the browser makes a
request to the server and say hey server
give me this page now the server
responds with some HTML content HTML as
we get from the server as it travels
over HTTP is basically a bunch of text
right it's a piece of string there is
yes less than HTML greater than so there
are a bunch of tags in it but
essentially it is a strength piece of
text now what the browser does is it
looks at that text and examines those
tags right if there's an HTML tag and a
body tag div tag a paragraph tag so it
takes all those tags and converts them
into objects each tag becomes an object
and let's say you have a div and a
paragraph inside the div so the div
becomes one object in a paragraph
becomes a child object right so it
basically constructs a tree of objects
this tree of objects is what's referred
to as the Dom tree a document object
model tree okay it's taking the HTML
document and creating an object model
out of it hence the name document object
model and that's the tree so the browser
gets HTML the browser interprets the
HTML and builds a tree now HTML is
essentially a static language if you
have just HTML and you have the browser
loaded you get a particular Dom tree
right and the browser builds the tree
and then renders the view based on it
right so the view is tied to this down
tree this object tree now if you load
the HTML again you get the same Dom tree
and get the same view load the HTML a
third time we get the same Dom tree in
the same view right so the HTML is is
essentially static it doesn't change by
repeated renderings
however the HTML could also come with
some JavaScript okay
javascript is a dynamic language so what
happens is when the browser gets the
HTML with the JavaScript it goes ahead
and does the exact same thing right
so Dom tree but then it executes the
JavaScript now in JavaScript you have an
opportunity to use the Dom tree nodes
and then modify it right you can change
the Dom tree you can get new nodes added
to the tree you can remove nodes from
the tree you can edit existing nodes can
do all kinds of modifications and what
ends up happening is the browser
reflects the view based on those changes
right you change the Dom tree you're
essentially changing the view because
the browser keeps the view always in
sync with the document object model tree
so javascript is a way for you to
execute dynamic functionality on browser
okay so this is how javascript is
typically used it's one of the most
popular uses of javascript as of today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
