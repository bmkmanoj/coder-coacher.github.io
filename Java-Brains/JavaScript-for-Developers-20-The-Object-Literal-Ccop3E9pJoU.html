by using something called an object
literal we have kind of used this but
there's another way you can use it so
you see here I have an empty object by
having this open closed curly braces so
said basically have an empty object and
then add stuff to it but if you know
that there are things you want in that
object rather than initialize it to an
empty object you can actually initialize
it with the properties in place so just
like you have a string value hello
initialized I can have a complete object
value initialized
up front and I will show you how to do
this so rather than have an empty object
and add properties to it what I'm going
to do is clear these things out and I'm
going to initialize both prop and prop
to in this literal so let me break this
up and I'm going to define the
properties here so I'm going to say prop
is hello comma prop 1 which is 1 2 3 all
right so notice what I'm doing here I'm
defining an object in line with two
properties one is called prop which has
a string value hello now there's prop 1
which is a number value 1 2 3 this is
exactly what we did before it's just a
different way of doing it right rather
than initializing an empty object and
then adding properties on top of it
I can initialize a fully prepared object
in line ok and this applies to all
different data types that you know
primitive data types that we already
covered so I can do a you know prop 3
which is true so this is a boolean the
value or true okay now if I were to
execute this and print the value of the
number here which is prop 1 in this case
I still get one two three okay so it
works exactly the same way as we've seen
before but instead of having them
initialized to multiple properties in
individual steps and defining the whole
object in line and I can do a
combination of these things as well so I
can define an initial set up front in
line and then I can add a my object drop
ten and you know hide on to it okay now
there are a couple of things which
should strike you as different if you
come from the classical background of
you know object-oriented programming
languages one you don't have the
structure you can add things and remove
things on the fly we covered it you
think of it more like a map the second
thing is there is no accessor
limitations in C++ or Java you would
have to define a property as public in
order to be accessible directly and you
rarely do that when you write code what
you would do is have the property be
private and then define up the getters
and setters
so you access a property only by using
the getters method and you are you know
update the property by using the setter
method you don't see that here and you
don't have an option to control if a
property as a private or a public any
property is always accessible given an
object I can always say an object dot
property and access it there are ways to
make that behavior happen in JavaScript
you know the private properties and the
public accessors but for the most part
all properties are accessible by anybody
so it's a it's a free-for-all even here
another thing that's different when it
comes to JavaScript objects versus C++
Java is if you access a property which
does not exist okay so in the case of a
C++ or Java there is this compliation
step that happens which checks if the
property that you're accessing is a prop
is a part of the class because a class
has a predefined structure so the
compiler can check if you're doing
something which doesn't even belong to
the class which case the compiler says
hey there is an error
since this is free farm and there is no
compliation step so to speak in the case
of JavaScript you don't get that that
level of protection however what ends up
happening is if you are accessing a
property which does not exist doesn't
throw an error just gives you undefined
so notice that I have a prop prop 1 and
property I don't have prop 2 and what
happens if I access prop 2 and shoulder
log accessing property that doesn't
exist gives and I will access my obj dot
prop - if I were to access this what I'm
going to get is undefined so if I reload
and run we see here when i'm accessing a
property that doesn't exist there's not
going to be an error there's going to be
undefined okay so this is a behavior off
javascript finish jumps to when it comes
to objects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
