bunch of constants that you want to
manage in your code and you wanted to be
readable in your code you can use a
feature called enumerations enumerations
are enums as it's commonly called is
it's pretty common in a lot of
programming languages and typescript has
it too let me give you an example so
let's say you want to track days of the
week right Monday to Sunday
you have values in your code which
represent those days of the week and you
want to compare it with say something
else if they equals Monday or something
like that but you can technically do
this by a bunch of strings right you can
say were day equals Monday and let's say
you won another day which is another
variable you can do comparisons which is
just like string comparisons and all
that stuff but but enumerations you get
a slightly more elegant and slightly
more readable code the way to create an
enumeration is by creating the keyword
enum and then days of the week so it's
almost like creating a class but it's
not technically a class inside this what
you do is you list out all the values so
let's say I have my days of the week
Sunday Monday
all right so these are the days of the
week now let's say I want a variable
which contains a value which is Monday
right I want to say the certain day is
Monday I will let t equals you know the
string there's a bad option right you
don't want to do this this doesn't
really convey that it's a day of a week
here's what I can do I can create this
day variable which contains one of these
days I can assign it to be I can declare
it to be one of the days of the week so
the day V is of type days of the week
right so when I'm creating this
enumeration here I'm creating a type and
the value of those types there's one of
these values that's declared in
enumerations now now they can contain
any of these values
the ones the salmon values you're seeing
over here I can do something like this
they equals these are the week dot
Monday you see this when I do days of
the week and do a dot the autocomplete
suggests these values right so these are
the values that are possible for the
days of the week enumeration and those
are the values that this variable can
possibly take because this readable has
been declared of type days with the week
all right now another thing I can do is
compare values now let's say I have a
day coming from somewhere else and now I
can compare it if they is equal to days
of the week dot Monday gotta go to work
all right now let me run this genome the
TS and no enum that is you see it says
it's gotta go to work so what I'm doing
here is I'm treating it just like any
other value I'm doing the comparison
which is their triple equals so I'm
comparing this to a value which is
directly got from the enumeration so it
acts like any other value but then you
have the advantage of looking at the
code and figuring out what the variable
is all about and also figuring out what
you're comparing it to when there are
comparisons right now the value part of
it is interesting because when you do
this when you do something like this
what you're doing is actually implicitly
assigning values to each of these
individual constants because JavaScript
doesn't have a constant concept of
enumeration so when you compile this to
TS c what's what's actually happening
what does javascript seeing this as if
you look at in Emmaus if here you can
see that it's actually creating an array
actually have an array with each value
being if the key being the name of the
constant and the value being just
numbers you see the 0 to 6 which
represents the seven days so what are
you doing here
you're actually creating a bunch of
constant values bunch of numbers which
is why an assignment and you know a
comparison like this works which is why
an assignment like this works so
javascript just thinks of it as numbers
but when you look at it at the cord at
the typescript level it makes more sense
and it has meaning which is kind of what
we want now let's say you're you're not
happy with these numbers that are
backing the values right it right now
sandy is assigned to zero monday is
assigned to one and so on all the way to
six but you don't like those numbers you
wanna have a different bunch of values
for this and the way you can do that is
by putting value right here so I have
sunday is equal to 100 so what this does
is it starts off these values with 100
so Monday becomes 101 Tuesday becomes 1
or 2 Wednesday is 103 you see this as I
hover my mouse over it tells me all the
new values so you can assign a value to
each of these things each of these
constants or you can just assign it to
one and then the rest of the constants
are basically that value incremented by
1 each time so Monday is whatever your
sign here plus 1
Tuesday is whatever you sign here plus 2
and so on this will still work because
this part would not affect the code
that's happening below because you're
not referring to those values directly
you're referring it through the
enumeration dot value so it really
doesn't matter what this is you'd
probably use this when you're trying to
work with other code which has a certain
values and it's you're dealing with code
which has sunday is 100 right so you're
gonna have to initialize this so that
when you do comparisons like this it'll
still work right so let me compile this
again and it still works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
