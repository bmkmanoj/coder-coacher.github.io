convenient class the JDBC template is so
in this tutorial we're going to cover
some of the other methods of the JDBC
template so if you look at methods that
we've already implemented they're all
fetch methods so you're getting data
from the database so in this tutorial
we're going to look at some methods
which allow us to write data to the
database speed insert updates or delete
before we start I'd just like to clean
up some code in this myth you know in
this class so if you notice here first
of all we have a new JDBC template which
we've added over here which is actually
useless because we have implemented a
new in the datasource setter so I'll go
ahead and remove this we don't need this
okay so the getters and setters are fine
and here we have a method that we
implemented using JDBC without the JDBC
template so I'm going to just comment
this out and of course collapse this
okay so now we are all set so now here
we have four methods one is to get the
circle count one is to get the circle
name given an ID one is to get the
circle object itself given an ID and one
is to get all the circles in the table
and we also have a circle mapper so this
is as simple as it gets for a JDBC do
now we'll implement a method that
inserts records so let's say I want to
insert a circle object into the database
so how would I do that
now I would write a method here public I
can return a true or false depending on
whether the insert been successfully or
not for this example just to avoid
insert circa and I'll take a parameter
circle which has to be inserted now as
with all the other methods I'll write a
string
sequel and this will have the insert
query okay so this is our simple insert
query which is parameterized now I need
to pass this sequel query to a JDBC
template method now the question is
which method should I use the method
that I use is JDBC template dot update
now the JDBC template dot update has
again as with a lot of other methods in
the JDBC template you have multiple
signatures I'm going to use this one the
one which takes in a string sequel and
object array so you notice here you have
two signatures over here to pass in the
arguments one is as val RX and one is as
an object array so this is something
that was newly introduced in spring 3.2
so that you can have multiple arguments
as a tree because of the wire Parag
support in java but this is the you know
one where you have a constant number of
arguments the middle argument the second
argument is an object array where you
can pass any number of arguments so I'll
use this one for now
so the first parameter is this equal the
second parameter will be a new object
array
and the elements of the array have to be
the properties off the circle object
that I'm taking over here so I will add
so go that gate ID and circle that gate
name and that's it
so I'm inserting a record into the table
so I'm using the JDBC templates update
method and passing in the query itself
and I'm using an object array to pass in
the the actual values which will get
substituted for the placeholders in the
query so the values happens to be the
properties of the of the object that I'm
receiving as the argument to the method
okay so now let's save this and of
course since I'm using a wide I don't
have to insert anything but I can use
some kind of a check to make sure that
this has gone through successfully
probably have a catch block when I
return the false but for now this we do
now let me call that method over here so
use the do dot insert circle I will use
a new circle notice that we have a
circle constructor that takes in the
values of all the member variables so
I'm going to use that I'm going to pass
too and let's say second circle okay and
I'm going to leave this as it is which
prints out the size now let's save and
run this and there you see you have a
count of two now because it's inserted
the second circle so when you can do a
get all circles it's going to return me
a list but and it's printing the size
which is now two and now let's just a
test it one more time I'll pass
three and third circle make sure that
the gun goes to three now yep and s so
the insert is working fine now we've
used the update method for an insert
query so this update method works for
even update queries as well as delete
queries in fact you can even use the
update method to run stored procedures
so you can have a sequel that's a scroll
and the stored procedure name and you
can use the update method to run that
stored procedure also so now before we
wind up this tutorial there is one other
method of the JDBC template that I would
like to discuss and that is the execute
method the execute method is kind of a
generate method where you can pass and
some sequel statement to be executed and
this is actually a good fit for running
sequel statements like a create table
for example you would normally not have
create table statements or any such data
definition language statements or DDL
statements as it's called inside your
code but you could you probably have
some kind of a module to create all
these tables that's required for your
application up front and in that module
might have classes that run these DDL
statements so all the statements that
you see over here are DML statements so
you are manipulating the data but if you
are writing statements that actually
construct the tables and the data
structure in your database then execute
is a good fit for running those queries
so I will just show a simple example of
that and I will have a public void and
I'm going to write a method here that
creates a triangle table so I'll say
create triangle table and again as I
said these kind of methods are - you
would normally have data manipulation
language siku queries running in your
code and these would just be some kind
of an initialization code which would
just get everything set up and running
so let's say I have a string
that creates a table okay simple table
creation query now I can use the JDBC
template dot execute so this is the
query that I can this is the method I
can use to run this query so this is
going to create the table for me so
let's test this out recommend these two
out and I will call do dot create I'm
trying table save and run this okay
obviously will not have any output over
here but let's try checking if the table
has been created so have one terminal
window here which has the database
running and now I'll open another
terminal window with my shadow connect
using haiji now I'll paste the
connection string within quotes here and
then the semicolon now I'm connected to
the database so now I can do a select
star from triangle it should return me
yes so a triangle is being created a
triangle table has been created with the
definition that we have specified so
this is how you can actually create new
tables and write some DML statements
sorry DDL statements in your code and
you can use the execute method of the
gtb/c template to run them
so these are some of the common JDBC
template methods that you would normally
use there are a lot of methods available
actually and you know there are many
that might be handy in certain
situations I haven't covered all of them
so you know it's a it's actually a good
idea to go through the Java Docs and
pick something that is ideal for the job
that you have on hand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
