tutorial we looked at transferring data
from a business service to an action
class and then from there to a JSP and I
promised you I'd take you behind the
scenes and we'll try to understand how
the data flow happens between the action
class and the JSP so if this is a
high-level picture of our application
the way it is right now this is the
transfer that we are interested in so we
have a business service result going to
an action class and then that is
displayed in the JSP of course by using
the starts 2 tags so actually it's the
arrow should be over here but I think
you know what I mean so we are trying to
understand this data transfer how it
happens why it happens and all that
stuff so before we start here or if
you're familiar with servlets are even
with structs one you would be a bit
surprised at what I did in the previous
tutorial which was taking this data and
keeping it as a member of a rebirth the
action class if you remember we call the
business service and then we took the
output of that business ever since saved
it as a member variable of this action
class and the reason why would be
surprised if you were familiar with so
that's a stretch one is that the VAE the
sublet are the structural action works
was very different in this scenario so
let's take the example of so let's say
you have a sublet object that's the
sublet is to plot in a tomcat container
you have an object here and you have a
JSP that's deployed and the sublet
redirects to the JSP kind of the same
set up but not using starts to that
we're using its servlets and jsps so
let's say you have two different clients
making a request and that requests are
served by the sublet so what does Tom
get do over here Tomcat does not create
two different instances of the servlet
it creates two different threads so each
thread over here is going to address the
requests that has come separately so
both
threads are the same servlet thread one
addresses request one and thread two
addresses request two so this is how so
let's work they are threads and then
each thread addresses a particular
request that comes in so the thing with
the thread based execution is that
there's one thing that you have to focus
on now when you're creating servlets you
have to make sure that your servlets our
thread safe know what is thread safe
mean xxx means that if you have any any
data or any states inside this object
that could cause problems when there are
multiple threads trying to access the
same object you should make sure that
that does not happen like for example
let's say you have a member variable
over here and you're saving something to
the member variable this is obviously a
problem and you have different threads
because both these threads are going to
access the same member variable it's one
single object remember there are
different threads but the same object so
this is a problem you cannot have data
as member variables because it's going
to lead to problems say thread one calls
the business service save some data over
here and then by the time it is trying
to render the JSP there is another
thread thread two that saves something
else to the member variable so that's
that's a problem
it is not thread say if you want so
that's to be thread safe so what this
means is that your sublet methods will
obviously have all the data inside it
you would not have member variables as
such and that's how you make the data
isolated to the threads so having said
this now how does actually detect it
transmit it to the JSP so in this in the
scenario I have thread one calling a
business service thread two calling a
business service it might be two
different outputs now how do I transfer
the write data to the JSP if I cannot
save this has been the variables the way
the servlet API works around this is by
having a separate storage space for your
data so you would not have member
variables let's stick that away so what
the sub-array pair does is
creates separate storage spaces so we
have request objects and we also have
session objects which I'll come to in a
minute but what these request objects
lures whenever there is a request there
is a new request object that gets
created and you can use these request
objects to store your data so when
thread one calls the business service it
says request start set attribute thread
to call sequestered set attribute since
they're two different request objects
for the two different requests you don't
really have this kind of race condition
between threads one thread cannot
overwrite another thread because there
are two different request objects and
then the request object is accessible in
the JSP as well and then you know you
can get that data using some smart tags
or expression language and then you get
the data and you can render it so this
is pretty much how you would manage this
data transfer if you're working on
sublets and jsps so you would typically
have two different objects which you
would use to transfer the data one is
the request and one is the session and
what you store where depends on the
nature of the data see you have some
data that you want to just pass on to
the JSP just for that particular request
and then when it's done you're done with
it you don't need the data anymore and
such an areas you would use the request
object and then there are some some data
that you would need to save for the
length of the user session like the
users logged in information so such
things you wouldn't want to keep it in
the request because the skids created
for every new request so you would save
such data in a user session so these are
the two objects that you would use when
you were transferring data from
sublets to J's B so you put this in one
and then you retrieve it in the other so
you're not we are given the objects to
use but we need to do this push and pull
of theta ourselves via this not
automatic we need to have you need to
give names for these attributes you need
to save it in the servlet and then
access it in the JSP
and this has to be done for every sublet
which is be communication that needs
data transfer okay so now that we know
this now how is starts two actions
different so what we've done in our
action is we have saved the data of the
business service in a member variable
which is something that we learnt we
should not do in the case of sublet and
the way this works is because starts to
actions do not have this threaded model
so in the case of struts to actions we
have new action objects that are created
for each and every request so this is
how it's different from servlet so that
objects are not created for each and
every request but in the case of struts
to actions you get a new action object
that gets created whenever there is a
new request so let's say you have four
different requests you won't really have
four threads of the same object you have
four different instances of your action
class so whatever actions let's be
written we have the written the tutorial
action right so whenever there is a
request there is a new instance of that
action that's created so what are the
implications of this this of course
changes the way we work with action and
a one indication that's very
straightforward is we can have data as
member variables you don't need separate
request objects because there is already
a unique object that gets created for
each circus which happens to be the
action object itself so you don't need a
separate request object you can actually
have member variables that contain the
data that we get from the business
service and that needs to be transmitted
to the JSP so here the action class kind
of doubles up as a model object you
don't really need a separate model
object of course you can choose to use
one and in many cases we do but we don't
really need a separate dto or a separate
model object you can actually have an
action class that contains all the data
and that behaves as a model object
okay so now we know how this works you
know how we can save data as member
variables and then carry that over to
the JSP now the last piece of the puzzle
is to identify how this data is actually
accessed in the JSP because again the
question remains in order to get the
data which is stored in a member
variable you need to have an instance of
that of that object naturally so since
we do not have that instance how does
the JSP are in this case the starts to
tag get a hold of this data in the case
of struts - it happens by using what's
called as a value stack so what is a
value stack value stack is actually one
of the really important objects in
struts - it's kind of used in a lot of
different areas in the framework a lot
of things access the value stack to get
the work done so we're not going to
cover all the details with the value
stack but we'll have a look at a quick
introduction and see how it affects what
we're discussing here so a value stack
is not really a stack in a traditional
sense that we use for data structures so
you have a stack data structure where
you push objects and pop objects so even
though it kind of behaves like that it's
not really a stack in a traditional
sense and this value stack is used by
the struts to framework to save a lot of
important objects and as I said
different different components of the
framework use this value stack to get
those objects and also to save objects
and one of the things that the starts to
framework does is since we have now an
action object which also behaves as a
model object we've seen the starts to
frame were actually saves this action
object on to the value stack so we have
a new action object gets created for
each and every request and that new
action object is actually saved inside
the value stack
and then in our JSP we using the struts
to tag now this tag accesses this value
stack and gets this data so this is
actually how these member variables
information is going to the JSP so the
action object with all the data as
member variables is getting saved in
what is called as a value stack and then
the JSP tags accesses this value stack
okay so there are a few tricks that
value stack performs it kind of helps
ease the way the code but then it's
important that we understand it so that
we know what's happening so one of the
things that the value stack does is it
behaves as a virtual object now what do
I mean by a virtual object well here
let's say you have three different
objects inside the value stack if you're
not worried about what these objects are
we know that an action object saves
itself in the value stack but we don't
still understand what the other objects
are but I'll just go with me here say
you have three different objects and
each of those objects have a few member
variables now what the value stack does
is it kind of eases the way in which we
access these objects let's take the
example of our action object which has
some data in the member variables it's
very unlikely that we would be
interested in the action object in order
to execute code we are actually
interested in it because of the data it
contains the code execution which is the
execute method of the action object is
already taken care of it's the
controller which executes it when it
request comes we have seen all that
stuff now we are worried about the data
that the execute is executed we have
data as member variables of the action
from now on we would very likely be
interested only in this data we're not
really interested in the execute method
so the member variable is all we are
interested in now in order to access the
members
we need to get the object and then get
the member variables but since this is a
common thing that we would do so what
the value stack does is it kind of
isolates out all these member variables
and it behaves like a virtual object
which has these member variables so
imagine these member variables are all
taken out and then they become part of
this value stack object itself so they
are not member variables of the objects
that are in the value stack they act as
if they are member variables of the
value stack itself now let's say this
object had a member variable called best
tutorial website as a string so we would
need to have some way of traversing this
object graph in order to get that string
so we would have to have a value stack
dot get this object dot get this
tutorial website string right so that's
the way you would reach the string data
but instead what the value stack does is
it isolates out these and acts as if
these member variables are part of the
value stack object itself so that way
it's very easy to access this data you
don't have to worry about doing a get
tutorial action object dot get best
tutorial website string you can actually
say get tutorial website string off the
value stack and then it gets this data
directly you don't have to worry about
traversing the stuff
so the advantageous obvious you get you
get access to the data very easily and
since the data is all we are worried
about in the value stack it's a very
handy thing to do so so again to
summarize it's not really a stack in the
traditional sense it does stack up
objects one below the other and then it
behaves as a virtual object that
contains all the member variables off
the object that it has stack so you
don't have to go to the object and then
to the member variable you can directly
say value stack dot member variable and
you get those member variables so it
makes it very easy
to access those member variables well
there is actually one catch here how
about if you have two objects in the
value stack that contain the same and
believable name how does how does the
register handle that because that's a
problem right we have we have different
objects which can have many variables
and then the value stack kind of
assimilates all those many variables
now what if both of them have a common
name how does the value stack handle
conflicts the conflicts are handled this
way it's a stack actually even though
it's not a traditional stock it has
objects stacked up one below the other
so what the value stack does is it kind
of looks from the top down and whatever
is the first member variable that
matches the request you just hand it
over it's it's as simple as that so what
I mean by that is let's take this
example so I have an object that has an
int count and a string file name have
one more object below it in the value
stack which has an in count and I have
another object below it which has a
string file name and an int list size so
again let's say I want to access the
count of this object so what I do is I
do a instead of doing a value side dot
first object dot count I just do a value
SATCOM so what this does is it just goes
from the top down take this object see
if it has a count yes it has a count it
returns this value okay now let's say I
access value stack dot list size so it
again goes from the top down looks at
this object list size you know this
object does not have it looks at this
one no this one yes it has the size so
it returns this this data and same way
for file name again even though this has
a file name does not return this because
it looks from the top down if you do a
value stack get filename it gets this
okay
now the question is how do we access
this okay if it's looking from the top
down and getting the file name how
however can we access this particular
string well we can access that by again
doing theta
object dot filename and we're going to
look at this in much more detail in the
subsequent tutorials
you can actually go through this object
graph there are sophisticated tools and
tags for that but for now think of it
like this a value stack again is a place
struts to stores some important objects
and once the object that it stores is
our action object we learn that there is
a new action object that gets created
for every request and we've learned that
that action object is pushed on to the
value stack and the reason it's done is
because we need those member variables
to be accessed in the JSP so the action
object with the data gets stored on the
value stack and then those data are
accessed in the JSP now since this data
access is a very common operation for
the value stack we need to access these
member variables of these objects on the
value stack very frequently so what the
values type does is it makes it easy to
access these member variables you don't
actually have to go to the object and
then to the member variables you can
access the member variables as if it
were a part of the value stack what the
value stack does is it kind of takes the
role of a virtual object that has all
the member variables of all the objects
that it has so it kind of isolates out
all these member variables and treats it
as its own member variables so whenever
there is a request for a member variable
it passes through a minute goes through
all these objects in the order and then
the first one that it finds it returns
the data so you don't have to worry
about getting the object and then then
when the variable you can just access it
directly and then of course it does name
resolution in case conflicts and then
you know it gets the first member
variable in the stack that matches the
name that you are requesting and if you
need to access anything else something
else that's below you can actually
traverse the object graph and access it
you're not going to worry about how to
traverse it for now we're going to look
at that in subsequent tutorial but this
is kind of an overall picture of how a
value stack
caves we are going to leave this here
for now if you're going to come visit
the value stack and all these concepts
in much more detail in the subsequent
tutorials but for now this should be
enough to get us going and in the
subsequent tutorials we're going to look
at a few more tags that make use of the
value stack to get the data in the
action object that we have saved thanks
