difference between undefined and null
both seem to be non values right they're
not values that they indicate an absence
of a value so what's the difference
between the two and when do you use what
so the best analogy that I can give for
undefined versus null is when you're
filling a paper form in select so you're
filling a paper form has a bunch of
fields and a bunch of text areas for you
to write on now if you if you get a
paper form that somebody else will
already fit right and you look at a
field which is blank how do you know if
that field is not something that the
user saw and wrote something on or if
that field is something that's not
applicable to the user okay so let's say
somebody has filled the farm and they're
giving it to you and the field is empty
does it mean that they've actually read
the question and they don't have an
answer or did they not read the question
at all right in order to differentiate
between these two categories what people
typically do is when they have when they
read a question and they don't have it
you know it's something that doesn't
apply to them the question doesn't make
sense to them or it doesn't fit their
particular situation what they do is
they write not applicable right so they
write n slash a or n/a or not applicable
or something like that so the not
applicable value is something that
indicates that the user is actually
provided some answers there and the
answer is a non value okay this is when
compared to an empty field where the
value hasn't been provided okay so keep
that analogy in mind when you think
about the difference between undefined
and null when a variable is undefined
that means that the value has not been
entered it's an empty farm field right
nothing has been put into the variable
and this is what happens by default in
JavaScript the minute you declare a
variable and you don't assign it a value
it gets the value of undefined that
means of the variable has a mean -
hasn't been allocated with a value
however if you want to assign a value
which is a non value let's say you want
to say this is not an untouched variable
I am allocating a value to it but the
value happens to be MD the value is a
non value that's when you explicitly
assign the value null do it okay so
let's say you have a variable lithium
you know assume for instance that I
don't have a middle name okay and let's
say I'm creating a bunch of fields for
my first name middle name and last name
in the case of my middle name it is a
non value so rather than have wire
middle name and then have it be
undefined in which case if I were to
give that variable to somebody else they
wouldn't know if you know I forgot to
put the middle name in there or if I
don't have a middle name so you're not
explicitly make it very clear to the
other person that I do not have a middle
name I assign the value invalid to it
okay so I say middle name equals null so
when I hand over the middle name to some
other piece of code they will look at it
and go okay it's not an undefined
variable so they have actually put a
value in there call now so this person
does not have a middle name okay
hopefully that makes sense this is one
of those confusing topics and there's a
lot of questions asked about when to use
what so hopefully this was this was
clear and I do happen to have a middle
name by the way
just to clarify all right so moving on
these are some of the primitive data
types these are the complete list of
primitive data types actually in the
Egmore script five version of the
specification however like I told you
before the latest version is it must
group six and ikema script six comes
with one other primitive type there is a
new primitive type added to the
JavaScript language and that type is
symbol I'm not going to go into the
details off this because like I said I'm
going to keep this course restricted I'm
going to restrict it to ACMA script five
because that's the most supported
version across browsers as of today but
I should just mention this so that you
know you know that it's there this is
something that's coming in ACMA script
six symbol is kind of like an
enumeration in languages like C++ and
Java it's a bunch of values a bunch of
constants then and the variable can be
one of those values right so that's the
symbol data
so if you're interested look it up I'm
not sure about the browser support for
this one I think there are some browsers
which don't fully support it or it's not
reliable but yes feel free to explore it
this is one of the new data types
primitive types that's coming up in the
newer version of JavaScript</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
