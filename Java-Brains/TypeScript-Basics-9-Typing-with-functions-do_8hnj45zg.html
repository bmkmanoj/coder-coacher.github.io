for variables explorations now let's
look at typing for functions let's say
create a function called add which takes
in two numbers a and B and it returns a
plus B and let's say I have a variable
sum which adds one and two then just log
of some compile this and execute the
JavaScript file gonna get three the most
elaborate way to add one and two anyway
so we've got this function now and we're
passing in two numbers we don't have to
pass in numbers you can pass in a string
here right what happens when you pass in
a string compilers can compile and
execute it you're gonna get string
concatenation because that's what
JavaScript does when it's asked to add a
string in a number but let's say you
want to prevent people from doing this
so you wanna statically type this as a
function that adds two numbers and you
don't want to accept a string being
passed we can do this by declaring types
for these parameters and it works
exactly the same way as declaring types
for variable declarations so what you
need to do to declare a and B as numbers
just say colon number and then B colon
number right now notice what happens foo
gives an error this argument of type
string is not assignable to the
parameter of type number because this is
now a number I can change this to a
number and it's gonna work again but
again like we've discussed earlier you
can leave this as a string you run the
compiler the compiler is going to give
an error to say matter that we've seen
in the editor but then it does compile
it does result in the code being
generated
all right so I'm gonna put this back to
our number so that the this is valid
typescript I've noticed the rendered
JavaScript file again the ratio of all
the types of features there is no
declaration of types over here so the
only advantage you are getting is the
compile type advantage which is what we
need for typescript the other really
wonky think about functions in
JavaScript is the variable argument
thing we've talked about that in the
first unit you can have a function which
takes in two arguments a and B and you
can call that function let's say add you
can pass in three arguments to this
JavaScript wouldn't mind or you can pass
in one argument to it JavaScript
wouldn't mind can pass in zero arguments
to it I was put in mind it would still
call that function and if you pass in
extra arguments it would ignore it if
you pass lesser than what's required the
rest of the arguments would be undefined
right so this is the typical JavaScript
behavior when it comes to functions but
things are a bit different with
typescript you notice what happens when
I call add with just one number I get an
error this is expected to arguments but
got one this would have worked in
JavaScript but it doesn't work in
typescript the default behavior of
functions in typescript is that the
number of arguments have to match even
if you're not adding any type
information let's say I don't do this I
don't specify a number as the type that
needs to be passed in so typescript is
okay with you passing in strings right
that's fine but even then the number of
arguments have to match typescript by
default requires two the number of
arguments match and if it doesn't you're
gonna get an error right so this is the
same even if there are more than the
required number of arguments and against
a is expected to put got three now what
if you want the number of arguments to
be flexible there is a lot of JavaScript
code today which kind of makes use of
that you have variable arguments that
can be passed into a function and then
the function checks if the arguments are
passed and if not
it does different things right so it
might have like a default value
it might just ignore it it might do
different logic flows depending on how
many arguments are passed and there's a
lot of code out there in JavaScript
which does this and with this kind of
strict checking you're giving up on that
flexibility in typescript aren't you but
not really
typescript has a feature which lets you
add variable arguments now we have add
as a function here let's say you want to
enhance this function to add either two
numbers are three numbers so the third
number is optional if somebody passes it
in it's going to add that to the result
if it's not past 10 well it just doesn't
consider it alright so how do I do that
I do that by specifying the third
argument as optional I do that by
following the argument with the question
mark now what happens when you follow an
argument with a question like this
typescript considers this argument as
optional if it's passed in its gonna
take it but if it's not passed in it's
not gonna complain all right so now
let's say I do out of one and two this
is valid now what if I pass in the third
argument this is still valid the third
argument is this optional argument but
then again if I pass in the fourth one
it's gonna complain because we had
configured the add function for just
three arguments right so this is how you
specify an optional argument though
think about the option argument is it
has to be at the end you cannot have an
argument be optional followed by an
argument that's required let's consider
this let's say I make B is optional and
C is required this wouldn't work because
if I pass in one and two
how does the typescript compiler know if
2 is supposed to be the mandate we see
our B it doesn't know so this will not
work you need to have the optional
argument at the very end so if you can
have multiple optional arguments let's
say I have D as optional as
so they have to follow all the option
arguments have to follow the required
arguments now let's wrap up our
discussion of functions with the default
value for the optional arguments
remember I told you that there are a lot
of JavaScript functions today written
out there which accept optional
arguments and what they also do is if an
argument isn't specified if a parameter
isn't specified they have a default
value the way they do that is by writing
an if condition here and saying if C is
undefined then make C as 0 for example
the typescript has a shortcut for it the
way you do this is by following the
optional argument with the equals and
then the value and I can get rid of the
question mark here so by assigning value
to an argument in a function a parameter
and a function what I'm doing is I'm
telling typescript that this is actually
not required it's optional because if
the consumer of this function does not
send the value this is the default value
that needs to be used all right so now
what I can do is I can add C over here
let me get rid of T you can do the same
thing with T as well you can have this
be optional that the value specified as
t as 0 now what's gonna happen is when I
pass two numbers to add the third
argument to the function that is
optional but it has the value of 0 so if
nobody passes C assume to be 0 and it
still adds up a and B all right now
let's execute this I'm gonna compile and
run and I get 3 however if I pass in the
third argument C is gonna be that value
and it's not gonna take 0 as the value
and when the sum is returned it's gonna
be an addition of all the three values
so I'm gonna compile and run this again
you know here you see it's a sum off one
two and three all right so in this
tutorial we looked at a bunch of
different things related to functions we
looked at how function parameters
function arguments can be tagged we
looked at how typescript enforces the
number of arguments to match by default
and we looked at how we can override
that by using the concept of optional
arguments provided by a question mark
next to the parameter in the function
declaration fourth we looked at how we
can specify default values by which you
are doing two things you're making that
argument is optional and if somebody
does not pass in a value they're taking
up on your optional promise and they are
not passing in a value you are assigning
a default value to this so you know in
your function that the value of that
optional argument is either going to be
whatever the user passed in our it's
gonna be this value which is default
value this optional arguments that I
mentioned also can be typed let's say I
mean number D is a number but it's
optional this is how it works all right
so D has a question mark following it so
it's optional and it also has a type
declaration following it so this is a
number all right you can do this too I'm
making a deal also as I need to get rid
of the question mark if I'm specifying a
default value because the default value
implicitly means that the argument is
optional so D is a number which takes in
a value 0 I can say that C is a number
which takes in a value 0 and so on this
is how you specify for arguments which
are numbers to arguments which are
optional that have the value of 0 the
default value of 0 of course these two
are not required like we'll see in the
next video before we go to the next
video
last thing that I'm going to show you is
that the return type of a function can
also be specified this is ad takes in a
bunch of numbers but it's I'm on a
strictly specify that it returns a
number while
the way to do that is by following the
closing parentheses over here with colon
number so what I'm specifying here is
that the add function always returns a
number so now we have type safety in
both the input arguments to the function
as well as the return type so we know
that odd
the return of odd can be assigned to any
number variable so you have that kind of
type safety there so but this let's move
on to the next video where we're going
to talk about implicit typing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
