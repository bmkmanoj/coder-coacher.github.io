covered some of the concepts of aspect
oriented programming in this tutorial
and in the next we will implement those
concepts and we'll write our own aspect
oriented programming code this tutorial
is dedicated to setting up our
development environment to write a opie
code we have previously created our own
spring user library and we have added
all the dependencies so that we can
write code that uses the spring
framework but in the case of aspect
oriented programming we have to include
a few other dependencies we'll quickly
have a look at that in this tutorial so
that we can get the our user libraries
ready to actually start writing code so
the first thing I'll do is create a new
Java project I'll call this spring AOP
and leave everything else as the
defaults so my default Java project has
the JRE system library so now let me add
the spring user library that we have
already created in the earlier tutorial
so I click on add library choose user
library we have spring here so I choose
that and click finish so now I spring
libraries added so for the the concepts
and the tutorials that we have covered
so far which includes the core spring
and the dependency injection this
library should suffice it has all the
jars that are required but in the case
of aspect oriented programming and the
concepts that we are covering in the
subsequent tutorials
we need to have a few more dependencies
covered so in order to do that what I'll
do is I'll create and you use a library
so again to the libraries tab say add
library user library now we need to
create and you want so I'll select new
and then I'll say I'll call this a spic
G and press ok so now for aspect J I
need to add the jars that are required
in the description of this video I have
listed a few links so they are
corresponding to the you know the Josh
that we need to add to a spec G so the
first thing that we need to do is add
Josh off the core aspect G distribution
so if you go to the link in the
description you will be redirected to a
site that has the download for aspect
Jake so go to the download and then once
you install the jar that you download
you will have a folder like this a spic
Jing and you will have a bin dark
Eclipse and a Lib folder so just open
the Lib folder here you will see aspect
jrt touch AR and aspect j we were not
charged so you select these two and then
click open
so these two jars are added to this
library so again this is from the
aspectj link in the description just
head over there and click on the
Downloads link over there you will be
you will see a jar to download if you
double-click on the jury will have to
install it and then once you are
installing the jar you have to select a
path and these two jars will be
available in that path after the
installation is complete so collapse
these two so that's the first dependency
second dependency is UB Elaine's jar
again if you have to go to the jail you
know the link that's provided you will
get the EOP aliens website download a
jar here no installation is required you
just get a jar that you've downloaded so
it should have a name like this ao PLA
in store jar so just open that so you
are adding that to the library as well
so dependency number three a CGI lip so
again go to the link in the description
for CGI Lib when you download it you
will get a jar so this is the CTI lib
version or jar so you add that to the
class path and actually to the user
library here the fourth one is
again if you go to the link in the
description for a sim you will get you
know a zip file you extract it you will
get this folder and inside the lib
folder you will have a SIM version dot
jar so you add this to the user library
so these are the four dependencies for
aspectj
actually five jars but four links that
you have to go to and download so you
have expand this so you have two jars
from the aspect J distribution this is
the jar that you download and install
and you have the EOP aliens it's just a
jar that you download cgi lib it's a jar
that you download an ASM which is a job
that you download we'll have a look at
what these jars are and what are the
rules that each one of these performs
later but for now just note that these
are the jars that should be available in
your class path I recommend putting them
inside a user library I call it as
picture here but you can use your user
library and have all these jars added
and when you press ok you will have that
jar added to your class path in the
project so now this project spring AOP
is all set we have the spring
distribution and the aspectj related
dependencies and so now we can actually
start writing you picot so we'll do just
that in the next tutorial thanks for
