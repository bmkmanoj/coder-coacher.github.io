you to the object function I know that
this is a confusing name if you're going
is this an object or a function then the
answer is yes
it's both let me explain in JavaScript
runtime environments just like you have
a global window object you also have
some global functions and one of those
global functions is called object write
the name of the function
there's object but the type is function
okay so this is something that's
available globally and anyway since
functions are just objects in JavaScript
this global function which is called
object is actually an object as well all
right so I could have titled this
tutorial the global function object but
I know that would be even more confusing
so I didn't but the idea is that there
is this global function that's available
to you call the object
let me demonstrate that okay so have my
Firefox console open over here with an
empty tab and now I can access this
global function called object by just
typing its name so the name is object so
I just type that and the concert is
going to echo it back so see here it's a
function I can call this function by
just doing object open close okay and
guess what it returns it returns an
object alright so this is different from
this object because this is actually an
object like you know it it has the open
closed curly brace but let's not go
there yet before we cover what this
global function does let me give you a
quick refresher on something that we've
already learned in the last couple of
videos so here is a picture that should
look very familiar
anytime you have an object that's a
function right any time you create a
function I told you that the JavaScript
engine creates an object called
prototype and it creates these two
properties on these two objects that win
to each other so the function is going
to have a property called prototype
which point through the prototype object
and the prototype is going to have a
property called constructor which points
back to the function now if you were to
create an object by calling this
function in constructor mode by saying
new of that function
what this object is going to have is
this underscore proto property the dando
proto property which points to the
prototype this should be all newest now
we've already seen this the reason why
I'm bringing this up is there is a
certain way in which you can traverse
these properties to figure out who
creates a particular object now let's
say I have this object right and
somebody gave me this object I need to
figure out what was the function that
was called in constructor mode for me to
get this object so I know that I call
this function constructor mode to get it
but let's say I want to trace it how do
I figure out what the function is the
one way to figure that out is to get the
dunder proto property of the object and
then I give this object and I call the
constructor property of that object to
get the function which constructed this
object I can do this for any object
right so given an object if I have to
figure out what is the constructor
function for that object I can just say
object dot down the proto dot
constructor and it's going to give me
that function okay keep this in the back
of your mind while we talk about this
object function so this link is going to
come in handy in a little while all
right now let me switch back to the
Firefox console then we're going to try
and understand what this object function
does and why it's required we clear the
console over here let me ask you a basic
question how do you create an object in
JavaScript if you remember this is how
we started this course we started
looking at how you can create an object
in JavaScript the simplest way to create
an object in JavaScript and that's by
using the open source curly brace right
so let's say I have a bar simple equals
the open closed curly brace this is like
the simplest way to create an object
right we've seen this already turns out
there is another way to create an object
and that's where this object function is
going to come in another way to create
an MD object is by calling this object
function in constructor mode by gluing
something like this new object open
close okay let me hold on to this in a
variable
now turns out this is another way to
create an object and forever to echo
simple I'm going to get back an empty
object if I were to echo obj I'm also
going to get back an empty object right
so these two are two different ways to
create an object so if you're probably
going who in the right mind would use
something like this isn't this simpler
just open closed curly brace why would
want to do new object and also there are
two different ways to do something when
do you use what when do you use this
approach and when you use this approach
the turns out they're actually one and
the same what you're doing over here is
exactly the same as what you're doing
over here
so this open closed curly brace is just
kind of like a shortcut for doing new
object now how can I prove a statement
like this how do you know for sure that
this is actually the same as this but
does that the end result is the same but
how do you know that they are actually
doing the exact same thing how is this a
shortcut for this in order to figure
that out let's use the tip that we just
 which is talked about there is a
way in which you can figure out what is
the function that constructed an object
it was by doing the dando proto dot
constructor all right so let's figure
that out for obj first let's make sure
we have that process working for obj now
obj has done the proto property it
should and this obj dot done two proto
property is going to point to the
prototype property of the object okay
like I said every function has a
prototype property so object has a
prototype property so it's first
verified that so if I were to say object
dot prototype I'm going to get back
another object so when the JavaScript
engine created this object function it
also created this prototype object like
we expect it to so if I were to do obj
dot dunder proto it should point to
object or prototype because obj was
created using new object so if I were to
do this I'm going to get back the object
prototype so things make sense now
what would the dunder proto property for
simple be if you're not calling any
function in constructor mode in order to
get simple
so would simple even have a delta proto
property first of all and if it does
what would it point to let's verify that
if I were to access simple that gender
proto well turns out that's an object
too well how did it happen well let's
figure out if simple the dunder protons
to obj dot then the proto because if it
does then it means that these two are
same simple is also called using new
object so let's verify that if simpler
than the proto the same as obj dot under
proto turns out it's true which means
that simple has it under proto which
points to object or prototype okay this
is the same so this also means that
simple was actually called using new
object so that proves that this is
actually the same as this and here's a
picture which explains it so object is
this global function which is available
across the board and it has a prototype
property which points to this prototype
object for the object function now if I
were to create an object using new
object it's going to have a done the
product property which one a point to
the prototype and even if I were to do
an open flow as curly brace it is
equivalent to calling a new object so
even that objects standard protocol T is
going to point to the objects prototype
object so there are a couple of things
that I want you to take away from this
tutorial one is the existence of this
global object which has a prototype
property and also that whenever you
creating an object if you're not using a
specific constructor function you are
automatically using a new on the object
function so this is happening behind the
scenes whether you are explicitly doing
it are you just using the double curly
braces</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
