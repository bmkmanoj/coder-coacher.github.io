web application using maven the couple
of reasons why I am doing this first of
all to see how easy it is to use maven
and set up a whole web application
project the second thing is the web
application gives us an opportunity to
explore a couple of concepts one of them
being the scope that we had discussed
earlier and of course we would also see
a few concepts down the line and a web
application is useful to see how those
concepts come into play so let's get
started the first thing that I need to
do as with any in even project in order
to set up the code base is to call the
archetype pose and generate command so
I'll do that MV in our tag column
generate and it's going to give me this
huge list of art types that I can choose
from I will choose the web application I
see here see there are a few web
application art types I'm going to
choose the j2ee one for which is the
java enterprise 1.4 version this is a
tie to 69 so just enter the value here
to 69 now I can choose a version version
for us fine again the group ID and the
artefact ID version can be 1.0 snapshot
just fine package will be the same as
group ID by default I can change it if I
want but I'm going to leave it as it is
yes everything is fine now I have my web
app set up okay here's the my web app
folder that maven is created and inside
this is the bomb load XML and the source
folder so if I open the bomb Road XML
here you can see this is again the
inputs what we have the Kuban but note
here that the packaging is a word this
time the
suspicous we have a web application
selected earlier we had a simple
application which was which is a jar but
now since we have a web application it's
a wall these other inputs are the same
way it is just taken our inputs and
entered the corresponding values now the
name and URL can be changed now the
dependencies just have a look at the
dependencies here they it has
dependencies on the Java X dot servlet
values so one is the servlet and one is
for the JSP so these two are the
dependencies so if I'm you if I'm you
know trying to write servlets in my
application so this is the dependency
that will help and if I'm planning to
write J's piece this is the dependency
that will help and of course we have J
unit again this is helpful for running
test cases now note that there is one
other entry here which is called the
build plugins so you have a build node
inside that you have a plugins node and
one plug-in has been defined here which
is the group ID is ordered apache dot
maven dirt plugins and the neighbors may
even compile a plugin note that we saw
in our earlier tutorial that when the
compiler showed an error it actually
said an error from the maven compiler
plugin so the thing to note here is that
compiler in maven is actually a plugin
and what is happening here is we have
configuring how the compiler plug-in
should behave so in we have shell we are
telling that the compiler plug-in
version is - - and then we have a
configuration node for this plug-in
where we have some configuration values
we can have a look at this later but
again just make a mental note of this
and this is where we have specified
configuration for out of the maven
compiler plugin now the question you
might ask is where was this plug-in in
our earlier earlier project even that
used to maven compiler but we had not
specified the plugin the the thing here
is that maven takes this compiler
plug-in as a default since you're
developing Java applications you would
need a compiler and by default maven
assumes
you want to use the compiler plugin and
when you use the immune compile command
the compiler plugin is the one that's
doing the job the only reason why you
would want to specifically mention this
this if you want to change the
configuration that's what's happening
over here we are specifying some
configuration values here and that's the
only reason why you would want to add
the compiler plug-in mentioned in the
pom dot XML if you had not entered this
the compiler plug-in would still be in
play but it would take the defaults so
there's no way you can configure it in
order to configure it just make an entry
in the pound or XML so but again this is
something that we're going to look at
later just make note that it's there now
this is our web application bomb dot XML
so we have two dependencies for the
servlet and the JSP we have one
dependency for g-unit and we have the
compiler plug-in configuration so now if
I compile this I'll just run MV in let
me package this because it's going to
run the other phases anyway ok the error
here says that I'm not in the folder
with a bound or eczema this as you can
see I'm one level up so let me go to the
folder where the bomb rod XML is now I
need to run the command here
so here it's downloading all the
dependencies that we have mentioned in
the Pomodoro eczema and it's going to
finish the compilation so now I will
package okay after downloading all the
related components the packaging is done
and it is built a watch and the war is
over here again in the target folder so
if I open the target folder here you can
see my water is ready now all I need to
do is drop this into a you know
container I can drop this into Tomcat
and then access it it should work now
let's have a look at what is the
contents of this my web app we haven't
written any code here if just issued the
archetype : generate command and this is
the default that's there now if you look
at the Java folder you will see that
there are no classes here but if you
look at the web app folder this is where
the web content is you see an index dot
JSP now if you open this
it's a HelloWorld JSP page so now the
web by an F has the web dot XML and the
web dot XML has again just the basics it
has a session timeout and the welcome
file list which will point to the only
JSP that's there in the folder right now
now let's deploy this war file in Tomcat
to make sure that everything works fine
I have to have Tomcat running here so
I'll deploy using the admin console here
target and this is the world that we
need to add to ply it and let's try
accessing that well there you go hello
world is printed so our web application
is working fine it doesn't really have
much but this just goes to show that
configuration is fine and we are set to
write code on top of this there are a
few things that we will will learn in
the later tutorials but I just like to
show you that there there here if you
look at the bond or XML you see this for
the Java extra servlet and the Java X
dot servlet or JSP there is scope called
provided and it's there for both these
dependencies j-unit still has a test
scope so this is a new scope that we
have seen in this in this kind of a web
application we'll have a look at what
scopes are but so far rifts encountered
three scopes one is the test cope which
J unit always seems to have one is a
compile scope that we wrote and that's
what we use when we are having a
dependency and we want the dependency to
be considered during compile time and we
are seeing the third type of scope here
which is the provided scope so we'll
have a look at what the scopes are in
subsequent tutorials</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
