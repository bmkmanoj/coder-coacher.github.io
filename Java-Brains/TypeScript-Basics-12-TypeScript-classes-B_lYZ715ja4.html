going to be looking at some of the
object oriented programming concepts of
type script classes interfaces
inheritance polymorphism all that good
stuff I'm going to create a new file
called classes 30s and this is the file
that we're going to be trying out all
the different class related concepts how
do I create a class let's say I wanna
create a class called person the way to
do this is by using the class keyword
and then the name of the class open
curly brace and close curly brace and
with this we have a class definition
class doesn't contain anything that this
is how you define a class in type strip
this is very similar to how you would
define classes and some other
programming languages as well so now
that you have this class you can create
an instance of this class and assign it
to a variable like this is a VAR a
person equals new person so it's the new
keyword followed by the name of the
class again very similar to a whole lot
of other programming languages so this
calls the constructor of the class and
it creates a new class and assigns the
instance to this variable called a
person now we don't have any
constructors we don't have anything in
this class so this a person is gonna be
empty instance right so we could add
stuff to this with an empty class let's
add a member variable to this the way to
add a member variable is like this so
let's say you want to create two member
variables first name and last name for
the person so to create a member
variable called first name you just give
the name of the member variable and then
a semicolon that's it we now have a
member variable called first name in the
class person so let's say you want to
create one more last name
and now with this we have to member
variables first name and last name in
the class person and now when there is a
new instance of the class created and
assigned to available now this video
contains an object with two properties
first name and last name and you can
access those by using the dot notation
again like a whole lot of other
programming languages so I do a dot and
then you get the member variable names I
say first as you noticed and visual
studio code you've got type completion I
do a dot and then I get the options I
can choose from very convenient now I
can do our console dot log off this
variable in which case it's gonna print
the value I can also assign a value to
this so I say a person dot first-name
equals Kaushik so this variable has the
value which is the string and that's
what's gonna get printed when I'm
accessing this it's quickly verify this
tse 550's which is gonna compile this to
our gs5 and then i do an old classes
start j yes and I'm gonna get the first
name that's a sign back there is also a
good two string for implementation by
default so if I were to just print the
object itself I'm gonna get the class
name and then the object in a little
format so I have the property name and
the value I had assigned the last name
it would have printed that too okay this
is good and I'll but there is the
additional benefit you get with
typescript remember the type
declarations we did for variables with
the primitive types you declared a
variable as a number of boolean and so
on well guess what you can do that with
classes too if you're a restrict
thus a person variable to only contain
instances of the person class you can
declare this variable to be a person
type the way to do that is very similar
to what we did for the primitive types I
can say :
person now what I'm doing is I'm
declaring this retailer to be off person
type so by declaring a class over here
I'm basically extending the types that
are available to me in my code I've
created a new type that can be used for
variables across the board in typescript
also note that since you're assigning a
person instance to this a person
variable during the declaration during
the war well the implicit typing of
typescript can do the job it can you can
actually remove this declaration and
this is implicitly typed to be of type
person if you mouse over this variable
you can see variable a person is of type
person implicitly because you're
assigning a value of an instance of this
person while it's being declared again
the same concepts of implicit typing
work for your custom classes as well you
can also do type declarations for member
variables since you haven't specified
what the types of the member variables
are these can hold any time so I can
have first-name equals 10 here and it's
gonna be fine but what if you want to
restrict it to be just a type string
well the type declarations work here too
I can say this is a type string and this
is a type string too so in this case
type soup is going to do the type
checking
so whenever the property that's being
assigned to is not matching the type
then it's gonna complain so all the
things that you've learned before work
just the same way but not you have
created a custom type that fits well
with the type scripts declaration and
type checking features before we wrap up
there's the thing that I want to show
you you compile the class
today this or I didn't see if this
compiled the class and we look at the
transpiler javascript file do you notice
here that you don't have a class concept
in native JavaScript you see here there
you see this odd annotation like thing
but what JavaScript actually gets
rendered is a function you remember I
told you how before the introduction of
classes in JavaScript all we had was
functions and prototypes and we had to
figure out a way to create these classes
using just functions and closures and
prototypes so this is what's happening
over here behind the scenes the
JavaScript that's actually run is the
same way we used to create classes for
many many years in JavaScript it's just
the syntactic sugar that we get by using
the class concept so just wanna
highlight that what's happening behind
the scenes is just good old JavaScript
