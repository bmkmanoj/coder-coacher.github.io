of what JavaScript airs as a language
I'm going to talk about viola and
JavaScript this day and age what are we
gaining by learning Java so what are the
different things you can do with the
language well there are two aspects to
learning JavaScript one is to do
client-side web development
like I said javascript is very often
used on the browser so if you want to
build a rich client-side applications on
the user's browser you can learn
JavaScript and build that functionality
on the browser okay so there are
different ways in which you can do this
you can do this in native JavaScript
in which case you have pure JavaScript
no frameworks you access a Dom tree and
then you modify the page you had you get
rich functionality on the client side
you can do some basic stuff but if you
need something of a decent amount of
complexity this is really a hard thing
to do which is why there are frameworks
that have come up one of the most
popular frameworks is jQuery jQuery is
again a framework that lets you modify
the Dom tree on the client-side so that
you can build rich functionality on the
client so this is another reason why
you'd want to learn JavaScript
because you need to know good JavaScript
in order to write good jQuery or you can
use one of these advanced flying side
application frameworks there are a lot
of them today there is angularjs there's
a react ember backbone we're going to
build really advanced web applications
on the client you can use one of these
frameworks and you can build them and
again this uses JavaScript so learning
JavaScript would be the first step to
learning one of these frameworks so this
is client-side web development you can
also do suicide development this point
wouldn't have shown up on the slide if I
was giving this course say five years
back because server-side JavaScript is a
fairly recent development you must have
heard of node.js this is one of the most
popular server-side frameworks you know
it's what it's gaining in popularity
recently so you can build server-side
applications just like you can build a
Java e application
be on Rails application or a c-sharp
application on the server so you
essentially listen to user requests and
generate webpages or generate a REST API
response and this happens on the server
right you're using javascript to write
server-side applications Express is
another framework which works with node
and you can build server-side
applications using that there's also
browser extensions that you can build
with JavaScript a lot of these browsers
like Firefox and Chrome they have these
concept plugins or add-ons you can
download this add-on to your browser and
extend the functionality of the browser
a lot of those add-ons are built using
JavaScript can also build desktop
applications with this so there are some
frameworks which let you build both
desktop as well as mobile applications
and javascript is actually gaining in
popularity with the iot applications
this is not something which is really
kind of matured at this point of time as
I'm recording this video but there are
applications of JavaScript for you know
these kind of devices so this is you
know in a nutshell some of the reasons
why you would want to learn JavaScript
and this is also a list of the things
you can do after learning JavaScript
these are some of the things you can
learn and you know whatever you're
interested in
that would be the next step in your
learning journey of Java's room</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
