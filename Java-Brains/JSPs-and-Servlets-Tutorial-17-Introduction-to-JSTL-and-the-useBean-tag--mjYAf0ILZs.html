about jst this is a page that we wrote
in our previous tutorial to all that the
space does is get an object from the
request and the object is of type user
and then it prints the user name not
there is another way in which we can
write this code in a JSP and that's by
using J Steele before I explain what J's
TL is I'd like to tell you some of the
you know the reasons why J Steele was
introduced now we started out with
writing jsps because it was a pain to
write all the HTML code inside a servlet
and put each HTML code inside a println
method and you know that is it that is
reason why we actually started writing
JSP so that we can have HTML based page
and we can have java code in between now
it works well for simple HTML and simple
J's piece but as your code increases see
I have a lot of script blocks here in my
JSP for example and let's say I also
have HTML tags in between those script
blocks now if it increases beyond a
particular limit it becomes very hard to
maintain this as well maintenance is one
of the problems and then the second
problem is that the code here in this
page is not pure XML so these are all
XML tags but then you know all the code
inside the script block are not XML
format so in order to have a proper XML
format and in order to make this a bit
more maintainable we have something
called as Jay Steele that you can use
JCR helps to write all this java code as
xml's
and of course they are actually Java
code which are executing but the way we
actually represent that Java code is by
using xml's
so first of all the whole document the
will be proper XML and then the second
advantage is that it's easier to
maintain the reason why maintenance is
an important criteria here is take any
JSP there is a lot of view logic
involved there it'll probably have some
style sheets it will have
view controls will have alignment data
and all that stuff so it has data about
how to present the page to the user now
presentation is something that is
normally taken care of by a different
team or a people with different skill
set now these people are usually
designers they come up with HTML
templates they come up with style sheets
and things like that
so most of the times designers would not
know how to code in Java and similarly
most of the Java developers would not
know how to implement different designs
and you know implement different style
sheets in order to have a present of the
web page so what I'm saying is that
again I'm making a generalization here
but most of the times it is common to
see that the role of a designer and a
role of a Java developer are two
separate roles and it's very rare that
you would have a single person who'll do
both now this presents a problem in your
page if you have java code as well as
HTML code so there are actually two
people working on the same page and this
might lead to problems about who is
going to use the page was going to
develop the page first how are we going
to integrate both the changes both by
the developer and the java coder so
because of all these things we have a
solution that attempts to solve the
problem in a way and that solution is by
using J steals and J steals nothing but
Java tag libraries that you can use and
you can have all these tags here instead
of having the script block and writing
Java code and J steal has become so
common now that it's actually considered
bad practice to have script blocks
inside J's piece so with that in mind
let's try to learn how to use J steal so
again what we're doing here is getting
the user attribute from the request
object and printing out the user name so
let's let's take the step by step let's
try to replace this script block with J
steal J's TL stands for JSP standard tag
libraries so we have a set of tags
that serves the same purpose as the
script blogs so the tag for getting
objects from different scopes like the
request session and the application is
called the use bean tag in order to
write any J style tag we need to prefix
the tag with a JSP :
and once you write this JSP code an
eclipse actually comes up with a list of
all the you know the available tags so
these are all the JCL tags so the one
that we are going to use right now is
this one use bean okay so it has
prompted an ID here and what is the ID
that I give the ID here has to match the
attribute that I'm trying to pull up
here I'm trying to pull out the
attribute user because this is what we
have said in our login subject we have
said the attribute for this user and we
have passed the actual object so this is
what we need to use whatever is the gate
attribute parameter that needs to be the
ID here so what this does is it should
we are telling gstl we are telling this
tag to pull up the object of this
particular attribute now we can add a
few more parameters here the next
parameter that I want to add if you do a
control space you will see all the list
of available parameters
it's a again Eclipse doing the
suggestion now here we have something
called as a class the class is something
that we can specify to tell Jase TL what
is the type of object that we get we are
getting from this particular attribute
now how does it work in a script let
block we actually import this class and
then we take this object and be casted
so instead of casting it here we are
actually telling the tag that this is
the object that we're going to get out
of this so that the tag automatically
casts it for us so I have to give the
complete the full qualifying name here
okay
so this has the complete package name
and the class name so this tells J's
together that whatever object that I'm
going to get for this particular
attribute is going to be of this class
okay now this is done the last thing we
need to do is to get is to tell J STL
what is the scope where we need to pull
the value from here we have done a
request dot gate attribute so this
information needs to be sent to gstl
there's this user attribute available in
the request or the session or the
application of the page we need to tell
it that so there is this attribute here
scope as you can see it's set to page
which is the default if you do not enter
anything here but in our case we need to
get the value from the request so enter
request here that's it so now what we
have done in this J STL tag is
equivalent to this okay so I can remove
this and now let me save this now if I
run this I note that I'm not making a
change here I'm still using this script
tag here to print out the value I'm just
using this J style tag to actually get
the object from the request and we are
printing the user name using a script
block so let's run this I will run the
login page we need to log in so that we
have you know on the attribute in the
request
okay now it's working just fine so we
have successfully replaced this
particular script block this particular
script block with this je steel tag but
note one thing here let's look at all
the things that we have done in the
script block we have got the attribute
we have passed what is the attribute we
have mentioned what is the scope of that
attribute we have mentioned what is the
object which we get from that attribute
and we have mentioned what is a variable
that will hold that object now let's
look at what we have done in our tag we
have passed the attribute which is fine
we have passed the scope which is here
and we have passed what object to cast
this as which is fine but we have not
passed the variable name here now how is
the variable name being figured out here
the variable name here is same as the
attribute name so J STL automatically
takes this attribute name to be the same
as the variable name now say for example
I have this user attribute in the
request and say I have another user
attribute in the session for example
this would not work in J steel because
JCL is doing this assumption for us it's
a it's taking this attribute name n data
setting the variable name also to be the
same as the attribute name which is why
what about this which is why this works
this is actually doing a user dot get
user name now what is this user object
the user object is this object that we
have declared here so even though we
have not defined the name of this object
it's taken the name to be the same as
the attribute name that we have declared
here now so now that we have replaced
the first script block with J steel
let's try to replace this script output
block with J stl as well
now I've in order to print any property
of
the objects that we have caught from
this you know from the use beam we need
to use another gstl
tag then we remove this let me leave
this here I'll add a new line
okay so again JS p : and the tag that
we're going to use is this one get
property the get property is used to get
the property values of the beans that
you have defined using the use bean tag
it takes two parameters one is the
property and one is the name so name you
know it tells the stag what is the bean
that it needs to look at and the
property tells the tag what is the
property that you know that needs to be
pulled out so the name here is same as
the name that we have defined here which
is user and the property is the property
that we need to print off this user
object and the property is actually the
gate username so user name I'm
specifying the property itself I'm not
specifying the Gator it actually calls
the Gator but all this needs as input is
the property name and since I'm using
since I specified user name here it's
actually going to do a get user name
it's going to call the Gator internally
of this object that we have defined here
so let me remove this and save this
suppon this again and here we see the
new hello message okay just a quick note
about the use bean tag before we wind up
here in this case we have used the use
bean tag in order to get an object from
the scope that we have mentioned here
but use bean tag interestingly works to
set objects as well how this works is
say for example I have this user and I'm
getting the attribute from the request
object now in case we had not you know
mentioned this set attribute here let's
say that the user attribute was not
available in the request object so in
that case the US bean tag here actually
sets the object so first it checks if
the object is available with this
particular attribute and this particular
scope if it's there it's going to get
this but if it's not there it actually
creates a new bean with the scope and it
calls the bean with this name and that
bean belongs to this class and when it
comes to creating a new object another
handy feature that they use bean that
provides us let's say I have I don't
have this user in the request scope now
it's creating for the first time now
what happens is whatever code you enter
in between these in this tag will be
executed then the object is being
created now if the object is already
there whatever code you write here will
be ignored but if this if it's not there
if you don't have a user attribute of
this request scope then whatever you
write here will be executed after
creating the object of the user
attribute in the crisco so I can have a
JSP colon set property the signature of
the set property similar to the gate
property but are the only new thing that
we need to add here is the value that we
are setting so I can have the same thing
here
and I can set value is new user so
what's going to happen is if the use
beam finds this object then it's going
to retrieve that only if it does not
find the object it's going to create a
new object of user and it's going to
create I'm just going to set the value
of the username as new user this time so
it will not have the value that we have
passed successor JSP now there you can
see the scope did not have the user
object so it actually created a new user
object and it gave the name as new user
and we see a new user displayed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
