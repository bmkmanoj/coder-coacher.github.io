the problems in object-oriented
programming and the kind of constructs
you can learn available in Java 7 and
let's look at how functional programming
tries to solve those problems how the
new features in Java 8 tries to solve
those problems in object-oriented
programming pretty much everything is an
object you cannot have like a piece of
logic a piece of functionality that
exists in isolation it has to be a part
of a class a part of an object has to be
associated with it right this is most of
the times not a problem but it can be a
problem sometimes because for a Java
developer when you're designing your
system when you're trying to solve a
problem at creating you know writing
your code you tend to think in terms of
things and nouns rather than actual and
verbs right it's always a theme for
instance let's say you want to write a
method that greets somebody you notice
it writes to the console hello world
right you cannot just put a function in
there in isolation on its own you have
to make it a part of a class right you
have to create a greeter class which
contains that one function you cannot
have a function just be in isolation
now what if somebody was to say ok I
don't need a class I just need this one
piece of logic one piece of code you
cannot do that in Java 7 let me
illustrate this with an example so let's
say I'm going to create a new class I'm
going to call this greeter and I'm going
to create this in the package I owe the
Java brains let's say one the main
method as well
now this greeter I'm gonna have like a
greet method so let's say I do a public
while greet which just prints something
to the console system dot
all over the simple enough program now
I'm going to say greeter there's a new
greeter and I'm going to call that
method greeter dot creat fairly simple
if I execute this I should get hello
world printed in the console now look at
what this method is doing it is always
printing hello world to the console and
what I want this greet method to do is
not just print hello world to the
console all the time I wanted to take
input and do different things based on
the input and input argument right how
do I do that in Java I want to accept an
argument and that argument lets the grid
method know what to do right one way to
do this is how the greet method contain
all possible combinations of all it can
do and have the input argument be a
switch it says okay do this thing versus
do that thing and then everything is
available in the greet method and based
on that switch it knows exactly what to
do but it's not elegant design what we
want to do is have the behavior itself
be passed as an argument and the greet
method doesn't really contain any
behavior it just takes the behavior and
then it performs it it executes it
okay one way to do this in Java 7 and
we're talking about Java 8 now one way
to do this in the earlier versions of
Java is by creating a class or an
interface called greeting okay you
create an interface called greeting
which has a perform method and then you
pass to the grid method an instance of
this creating interface where you create
a implementation of the greeting
interface which as a particular
implementation of the perform method so
let me create this interface and this is
going to have a single method public oh
it perform now that I have this
interface I can send different kind of
implementations to this thing
to the Greek method and have this to
that instead I'm going to say greeting
dot or fun of course this will not work
me comment this out for a bit now what
am I doing here
I'm having the grid method accept the
behavior and then perform that thing so
let me actually create an implementation
of the greeting let's say hello was
greeting and this implements greeting
and now this has a perform method that
just prints all over to the console so
now in my greeter I can call this greet
by creating an implementation of the
screeding which is the Halliwell
greeting so I'm going to do that now I'm
going to say hello while greeting new
HelloWorld greeting and I'm going to
pass a lower greeting to the greet
method now if I run this I should get
pretty much the same output but notice
what I'm doing here I am passing in a
behavior to the greet method I can
easily create a new implementation of
the greeting interface and have this do
something else and if I were to pass
that this greet method is going to do
that thing this is classic
object-oriented programming
this is polymorphism in action right
