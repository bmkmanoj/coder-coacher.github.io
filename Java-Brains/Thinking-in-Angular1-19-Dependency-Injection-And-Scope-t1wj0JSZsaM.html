tutorial and we realized that in order
to create a controller there were a
bunch of different steps we need to do
the thing about a controller is you
basically use it to set up data for the
view so you prepare the data in the
controller and access it in the view so
ideally what we'd like to do is access
the scope in the controller so that you
can put things on it and then use it in
the view you already know how to access
data from the scope you have the ng bind
we have the double curlies you can also
use the ng if to get data from the scope
so what if you want to do is use a
controller to put data into the scope
what we did with ng in it we created a
variable called out of T right create a
property of the scope and assign the
value nine to it what we'd like to do is
to do the same thing but not in the in
gene it need to do it in the controller
now can I remove this let's say take
this out let remove ng in it I don't
want to do this anymore right it's just
the body and I want to add this logic
over here can I do this so this will not
work can you guess why the reason is
when you're accessing our update here
like I've already mentioned we are not
just accessing any R of the variable we
are accessing the variable of the scope
so when we are setting the value over
here what we should also do is set the
property of the scope object not just
any bar R of the day that will not work
what we need to do is be able to say
scope dot R update we need to get the
scope object somehow and then set the
property on it now how do you get the
scope object from a controller method
you know that we can run any arbitrary
method and then have angular executed
right we executed a console log
statement but now we want to execute
other logic which actually puts data on
the scope how do we get that scope
object could we do something with this
bar scope equals angular that get scope
right we did angular dot module to
create a new module can we ask our
friendly angular object say hey angular
get me the scope get the scope object
and then now you do scope guard RFD with
this work
well if this method existed it would
definitely work but fortunately or
unfortunately you do not align Euler
that let's go play the angular object
does not have a get scoped method this
is not how you get the scope object the
reason this doesn't exist is because
what we're doing here is a lookup what
does it look up look up is basically
using an API to actually fetch something
you're basically looking up the scope
from a angular API so this API does not
exist because lookups are bad what we
should do instead there's a common
pattern called dependency injection
dependency injection is a way in which
you can have the things that you need
given to you rather than you manually
looking it up it's a pretty popular
concept in a lot of suicide programming
frameworks and it's kind of making its
way into client-side programming
frameworks as well I'll give you an
example to can illustrate the concept of
dependency injection if you're already
familiar with dependency injection using
any of these other frameworks you might
wanna skip a couple of minutes in this
video but we just want to try and exam
explain dependency injection with a very
simple example so I attended this dev
conference a few a couple of years back
and this was a fairly popular
development conference and I was one of
the thousands of attendees who went
there and they we had like a day-long
set of sessions and they provided lunch
and breakfast and all that stuff so the
mail lunch work was you know during
lunch time the talk would end and then
people would make their way to the
cafeteria
where different lunches were provided I
happen to be a vegetarian so I I was
seeking vegetarian food so they had
different sets of boxes there were some
vegetarian boxes there were some that
need their you know all kinds of food
was available there so I actually sought
the vegetarian boxes and it was there
were different lines for all of them so
what ended up happening was since they
couldn't really plan out you know how
many people needed for different types
of food some of the food
either the vegetarian boxes would run
out are the non-vegetarian boxes would
run out so people weren't really getting
what they wanted all the time most of
the time juice but not all the time
so what they did the next day was they
kind of sent out a survey where we had
to fill what our dietary requirements
were I had to just open the web page and
then choose my data to prevent that I
chose which Italian other people chose
different dietary preferences so what
they did in the next day during lunch
time was they didn't really have people
go and get their food that they needed
they already knew what each person
wanted so they actually came to our
tables you know where we were sitting
and then they actually provided the box
as far right they already had the
information
everybody had told them what they wanted
so they had the ability to kind of plan
ahead of time make sure everybody got
what they wanted and rather than the
conference attendees looking up for the
food the food was actually supplied to
the conference attendees right so that
way they're the organizers were able to
plan better and the people who are
attending got the food that they wanted
this is dependency injection in practice
all right so look at what happened the
first day people who are actually doing
the lookups people were looking for the
food that they wanted they wanted
vegetarian food they wanted vegan food
so they were actually looking for things
that they needed
that was not efficient because there's
no way the conference organizers could
know what each individual person wanted
however in day two the look up did not
happen the individual conference
attendees had to declare what they
wanted right they didn't look it up they
just declared the need for the food
right the vegetarian would declare that
they are there which didn't they needed
this Chilean food right a meat-eater
would say okay I need non mystery for so
each person could declare what they
wanted and the conference organisers got
that information they planned ahead and
they supplied what each individual
person either right so the dependency
was injected the dependency was provided
it was the other way around right it's
kind of like the
principals don't call us people call you
it's kind of like that so the conference
attendees weren't looking for food
they were supplied it right so let's
apply that kind of a concept in this in
this situation so what we're doing here
by saying hey angular get me the scope
is basically doing a lookup right it's
like we are having to go get the scope
instead what we're going to do is we're
going to say to our scope and we have
some kind of an indicator which says hey
angular get me the scope object here
right some kind of a declaration to
angular and say hey populate the scope
over here I'm going to use this right
the way to do this will of course you
cannot have a water here and expect it
to automatically be filled what you do
instead is define it as a method
argument defender is a method argument
whose calling this method angular is
calling a method so you're basically
saying hey angular when you're calling
this method pass it has a method
argument get the scope and pass it here
so that I can use it to populate
anything I want and angular is going to
do this the way to tell angular to pass
this in is by having a special token in
the method argument to somehow tell
angular that this is what you need you
want to tell it that it needs the scope
the scope object not any you know this
is not an ordinary variable called scope
it is the scope that comes with angular
in order to do this you have a special
convention which is the dollar scope
right as long as you have this token the
dollar scope as an argument of this
method angular is going to automatically
inject this value when it's calling me
right M&amp;amp;G controller this main
controller angular is going to look this
up look up this function now it sees the
function and it says this function has a
dollar scope as the argument what is
going to do is before calling this
function it's going to go fetch the
scope and pass it to this method
execution now that angular is passed at
all I need to do is to take this dollar
scope which is going to contain the
scope object and then use it to populate
whatever I need here it happens
we are of day so I'm going to set the
value of nine do this thing and now the
dish we are pretty much we have pretty
much done the exact same thing that the
ng in it did with ng in it you didn't
have to do a scope dot because that's
the default when you're doing things in
the template legacy here you don't have
to a scope directly however when you're
doing something similar in the
controller this is all JavaScript so
you're gonna have to be a bit more
explicit in what the object is going to
be so you need to specify the scope or
do you give the scope it is declare it
as dollar scope in your controller and
then angular is going to pass that in
then it executes the controller and of
you populate it alright let's save this
and make sure this works let me reload
well it still works now let me change
this to hitting and make sure this say
is good evening
reload well good evening the hour of the
day is 18 I didn't have to change any of
these because they were still referring
to the scope all I had to do is change
the place that it was getting added to
this coconut that's in the controller
right
so hopefully this made sense this is
dependency injection and how to accept
the model in your controller so that you
can use it later in the view</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
