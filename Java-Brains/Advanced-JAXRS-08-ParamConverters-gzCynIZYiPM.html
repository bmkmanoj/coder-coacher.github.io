converters what is the parameter think
about passing a query paramore a path
param which is an integer now in your
resource you can have an ADD path
paramore add query parameter any of that
parameter tation for that matter which
capture the value and assign it to an
integer variable right it could be an
integer method argument it could be a
member variable like we've seen now how
does the conversion happen from a string
to an integer think about this when
something gets sent over HTTP be it the
query parameter path param what you're
actually dealing with are strings right
it's if you know you don't know what the
data type is it's always sent a string
so we talked about this in the previous
course there's something on jax-rs that
takes that value and then examines the
method argument or whatever that you've
annotated with add path parameters okay
this thing is an integer though so the
developer expects it to be an integer
now Jersey does that conversion right it
takes that path param converts it to an
integer if it's a query paramedics that
and converts it to an integer so the
destination of that conversion really
depends on what the datatype of your
field that's annotated is right so if
you've annotated a double then it takes
that param value and converts it to a
double right if it's a string it just
takes it as a string so there is this
implicit conversion that happens behind
the scenes and we don't even know about
it so this is actually happening thanks
to the parameters Jersey comes with a
set of bundled param converters that
know how to convert from a string to the
right data type now this works fine for
some of the native data types but let's
say you have your own data type that you
need to convert from a string to so
Georgiy wouldn't be able to do it right
it says hey I have no idea have to
convert from a string to your custom
data type so this is we're creating
param converters helps so you can create
your own parameters that handles that
conversion so let's take a look at how
you can write your own Brown converter
so for implementing a parameter we need
our custom type that the parameter
converts from string to so I'm going to
create this custom type
which is a class called my date it's my
own custom implementation of the date
class kind of a contrived example but
this will work for exploring what the
parameter can do so in this class I have
three fields have a date month and year
and these are integers and I'm storing
the date in these three fields now I
want to convert from a string to a
instance of this class and here's my API
that I want to build I have a date slash
path param now this path param could be
something like today tomorrow or
yesterday and what I want to do is
convert from the string today to a my
date instance that's that holds the
values for the current date and if the
path param is tomorrow I wanted to
convert to a my date instance with the
date being tomorrow's date right and if
it's esterday yesterday's date
so this is a string which needs to be
converted to an instance of my date with
the date month and year values being the
corresponding values for today tomorrow
or yesterday so that's the idea so let
me go ahead and create this my date
class first I'm going to say new class
and I'll name the class my date this is
going to be just a simple POJO it has
three integer fields private they are
date month in here
now I'm going to create getters and
setters for each of them
and this is it a simple poacher which is
our custom type now I'm going to go
ahead and create a new resource which is
the date resource so this is what hand
is the slash date slash you know today
tomorrow yesterday all those all those
API calls now I'm going to annotate this
with add path and the path is going to
be date slash in the date prime so I'm
going to call this date string so the
date string could be those date
qualifiers like today tomorrow yesterday
now I can write a method here I'm going
to make it a get because I'm making a
get request to this URL let's say this
produces media type dot text plane okay
so I'm going to create a simple method
here which returns a string I'm going to
call this get requested date I have to
exit the pad / am I am going to use the
add path Prime annotation I need to pass
in a value which is the date string so
this is the value in the platform for
the add path annotation the class level
I'm going to accept a string called date
string now this gives me the actual
value of the string that's passed so if
I do a slash date slash tomorrow date
string is going to be tomorrow
so I'm just going to return got the date
string now if I access web API slash
date slash today it's going to pick that
today from the path param pass it to the
method argument and it prints today
similarly tomorrow gets printed as well
now this is fine this is nothing new
right we've seen this but now what I
want to do is not accept this as a
string I want to accept this as my
custom data type I want my date over
here now if I were to change this to my
date without doing anything else right
I'm using my custom data type here let's
say I print my date dot to string
let me save this and wait for the
application to read apply notice what
happens here I'm going to switch to the
console you see there's an exception to
the exception say is that no injection
source was found for a parameter off
type my date so what Jersey's trying to
do is it's trying to see well it first
sees that there is a path param
annotation on a type by date now it sees
if there is a way it can convert from a
string to my date and it realizes that
it cannot there is really no converter
that's available to Jersey at this time
which can convert from string to my date
so it doesn't even load the application
it just throws an error up front this is
the second time you've seen something
like this happening with Jersey that is
an error and Jersey gives you an
exception up front and it doesn't even
start the application because it knows
that there is this path param annotation
on a custom data type and at some point
of time it has to do the conversion from
string to this data type and it doesn't
know how okay now how do we set up this
conversion to happen and how do we let
Jersey know how to do this conversion
there is a couple of classes that we
need to learn about the first class is
called per am converting and the second
class is param converter
let me start talking about the second
class first whenever you need to convert
any of these parameters from string to a
custom data type you need to implement a
param converter a param converters an
interface that has methods to convert
from a string to your custom data type
so that's the first thing you have to do
you have to write the logic to convert
from string to your custom data type in
this case I have to write the logic to
convert from today to my my date
instance by just getting the current
date and setting the date month and year
values if it's tomorrow I increment the
current date by one and set the same
values if it's yesterday I decrement by
one you get the idea so there has to be
this logic that's written to convert
from string
do your data type and that's your
parameter once you've implemented the
parameter you need to implement another
interface called param converter
provider which is a provider we've seen
what providers are in jax-rs
so it's a it's a provider class which
tells Jersey to you is this parameter
inverter given the type Nevada Jersey
given exception when we try to use the
path param for my date because it was
not able to find anything that did the
conversion from string to my date now
what the paramotor provider does is it
tells Jersey hey whenever you see any
param annotation on this data type
called my date use this parameter that
the developer has already implemented so
these are the two classes the one is the
param inverter that has a from string
method which takes in a string and
returns the type that you want which is
which does the actual conversion right
and then there is a param converter
provider that takes in the type and
returns a param converter so when the
application starts up you can imagine
there are a bunch of these parameter
providers that are registered with Jerzy
Neyman jersey finds a type that it
doesn't know how to convert it's going
to ask each of those parameter providers
and say hey param converter provided
i've got this type can you give me a
converter now if the provider says no I
cannot give you a converter it's going
to move on to the next provider and it's
going to keep asking all these providers
till it finds a provider that can say ok
for this type I've got a converter for
you and if it returns a converter
jerzees happy and it knows how to do the
conversion and if none of these
providers can give a converter
successfully then Jersey is going to say
ok I don't know how to convert the
string to this data type and it's going
to give the error that we've already
seen ok so we can implement these two
classes now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
