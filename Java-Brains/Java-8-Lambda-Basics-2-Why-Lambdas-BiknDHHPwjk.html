advantages that lambda is bringing to
the table I cannot go into the detail of
all these advantage just because really
understanding the benefits of lambda it
requires an understanding of lambda
itself so I'm going to just list these
points and you're going to have to trust
me on this as we learn more about land
there's a lot of what I've talked about
in this slide kind of makes sense so the
first biggest advantage of lambdas is
that it enables functional programming
this is the paradigm shift that I was
talking about we are used to writing
object-oriented programs in Java lambdas
enable us to write functional
programming in Chavez I'll cover what
the difference is and why do we even
need to do it in a little bit there are
second advantages you get some readable
and concise code when you use lambdas
and certain situations of course our
lambdas really kind of eliminates some
of the boilerplate code that we would
have to write in certain scenarios and
again this is something that we're going
to look at later it also enables to us
write better
api's and libraries which are easier to
use and it also enables support for
parallel processing which is a big thing
in this day and age pretty much every
other processor is a multi-core
processor in this in this current time
so having support for paddle processing
being able to write better code that
runs on parallel processors is a big
deal and you can actually have that
happen easily using lambda expressions
there are much more advantageous to
learn this but these are some of the
important ones and again I know that I
haven't covered any of these in detail
you will understand how these are
actually an advantage once you learn
what lambdas are and how they even look
like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
