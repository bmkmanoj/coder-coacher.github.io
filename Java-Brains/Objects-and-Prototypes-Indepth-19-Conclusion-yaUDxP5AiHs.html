javascript objects and prototypes in
depth if they can an in-depth look at
objects in JavaScript we've learned what
constructor functions do in Java so to
call a function in a constructor mode
and we also learn how what are the
different ways in which you can call
functions in JavaScript we learned four
different ways and how that affects that
this reference in all those different
approaches and then we took a look at
prototypes in JavaScript how you can
create prototypes and affect the
functionality of various objects so that
you don't essentially have to build
behaviors into each object which would
essentially be a waste when you're
having multiple copies of functions so
we learn how the prototype chain works
and have each property reference on
objects is influenced by the concept of
a prototype lookup
so hopefully this course was helpful in
your understanding of objects and
prototypes I highly recommend as
reference the series of books called you
don't know Jas written by Kyle Simpson I
will provide the link to those books in
the description these books are actually
available in electronic form on github
for free and on the github page you also
have links to purchase these books in
paper form I have referenced these books
multiple times and I highly recommend
you go through them as a follow up for
this course and hopefully this course
with those books will significantly help
in your JavaScript journey so thanks
again for taking this course this was
JavaScript objects and prototypes in
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
