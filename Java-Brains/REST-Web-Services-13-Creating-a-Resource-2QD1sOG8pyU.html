how this messenger REST API application
is a standard servlet application and
there being a sublet from the Jersey
package which handles your input
requests and it's mapped to certain URLs
now the question is what happens when
the request comes in Jersey has
identified the URL up to the resource
name now what does it do after that
how does Jersey know what to do with
that request the thing is Jersey doesn't
really know what to do with that request
the sublet that is configured in the web
guard XML is kind of like the starting
point after that to handle a resource
request Jersey kind of expects there to
be some code that you've written so that
it hangs over the responsibility of
handling that request do you write to
your code so think about this for a
minute
so this is like the URL for the API
right this is what we saw so this is the
URL for the API anything onwards there's
going to be resources so let's say let's
take our messenger application so you
would have a resource called messages
slash something right the message ID so
this is one valid resource URL and
there's also comments slash the comment
ID which is another resource your and
then you have profiles which is a
collection resource and then you have
the profile ID which is another URL so
all these are different URLs and all the
thing that all of these have in common
is this particular thing which you've
already seen but now each one of these
URLs point to a particular resource and
that resource has specific logic that
you would need right so this cannot be
abstracted out this is not something
common it is application specific what
happens when somebody does it get
requests to slash profiles slash Kaushik
well that depends on the implementation
you would want to write that code so
that's what Jersey does is fill so any
resource request that comes in is
actually handled by a class that you
write right so to handle a resource
what you write are classes called
resources okay
so if you expand the SRC main Java you
have in the arc Kaushik Java brains
package you have something called my
resource store Java this is the standard
class that came bundled with the project
template that we used right so you
remember when we did my resource we got
this response cutted right so this was a
resource that was bundled in the project
itself and we made a get request to it
we got a text response this is the class
which is handling that request right so
Jersey servlet looks for classes like
this to handle a request there's only
one resource in this project right now
so let's open that up now I could talk
about what this class actually does and
what's going on here but that's not all
that exciting it's actually much more
fun to write code than to read somebody
else's code and I hope you agree so I'm
going to set this class aside and we're
going to create a new class we're going
to create our own resource Handler and
we'll have a test method and we'll
handle a request and we'll learn what it
takes to create a resource from the
scratch so what this does is this you
know pre-built my resource resource URL
right so we're going to create our own
resource URL called messages you know we
talked about the API for our messenger
application and one of the first
resources would be messages so let's
build a class which hand is that right
now if I access messages I get nothing
right I get a 404 because there's
nothing to handle
this resource URL so let's create a
simple resource handler which just
returned some static text just like the
my resource does and will enhance it as
we go so how do we create this how do we
create a new message resource URL and a
handler for it so the first step would
be to create a new class
okay so the way to do that is I'm going
to go to my project Explorer right click
here and see new class and I'm going to
call this class message resource okay
so this is a class which handles wave
API slash messages resource URL so I'm
going to call this message resource and
I don't want it I don't want this to be
in the root package so I'm going to
create a package called resources okay
so a new package called resources a new
class called message resource that's the
first step now this is what you need to
build upon right so you need to add code
in this class to do something when Web
API slash messages is accessed right so
let's say our in our simplistic example
when somebody says slash messages you
want to return some static text right
like hello world or something like that
so we need some functionality in this
class to return that right so we need
some functionality that returns hello
world so let's go ahead and build that
right so I'm going to do a public string
and return a string get messages the
method name really doesn't matter I'm
just calling it get messages because we
are getting messages and just going to
return the string hello world and I'm
going to save this class right it's a
simple method which returns a string now
what I want to do is tell Jersey to
execute this method of this class then
this URL is called and take the return
type take the return value of that
method and send that back as a response
right so you wind
Jezzie to delegate the execution to this
method take the return value and that's
what should show up when this URL is
accessed now we do that the first thing
is we need to tell jersey that there is
a class like this available over here
for it to look up right so it's just
another class line in the class path
how does usually know that it's
something that it needs to consider
so the way to do that is well right you
don't actually have to do anything here
and I'll tell you the reason why you
open web dot XML this is the sublet
class that Jersey bootstraps the
application button right there is the
section call init param listen it bottom
takes a parameter Z config server
provider packages very long name but
basically what it's looking for is the
name of the package where you want
Jersey to look up for such things right
so right now the param valuers are
Kaushik the java brain start messenger
so it's basically this package
she basically telling is Jersey hey when
somebody makes a request and you're not
sure which class needs to handle it you
just look up this package and see what
are the classes inside that package and
see if there's any one class which can
potentially handle that request so this
is basically the package that Jersey
needs to you know focus on this is what
Jersey looks up now there could be a
hundred different classes in this
package it doesn't matter we're going to
talk about how Jersey narrows down which
class it picks later but the fact is
Jersey just starts looking at this
package it's going to look at all the
classes in this package right so that's
what you need Paramus now thanks to
inner paradigm and since we have our
class inside this package may not be in
the route but it's in a sub package so
it is in this package right so you don't
have to do anything else
Jersey it looks at this as a possible
contender now since there could be
multiple classes you need to tell Jersey
hey this is a class which handles /
messages the beta map that is by
actually using an annotation right so
you annotate this class to map to this
URL path right and the way to do that is
using the path annotations you just say
add that and then you use the pads /
messages now the ad path annotation is
from Java extra WS to Aris package and
you scream board that and now this class
is annotated with AD path and this path
so whenever there is a slash messages
that's called or jersey does is it looks
up for all the classes in this package
which has the ad path annotation off
slash messages which is the path that
it's trying to match and as long as it
finds that it says here got the class
okay so it's narrowed down to the class
but now how do you make it execute this
particular method because honestly there
could be a whole lot of methods in this
single class now how do you narrow it
down to one method and that's not the
only problem right so even here this URL
of course we map the URL but then there
could be a get request to this URL there
could be a post request to this URL
there so there are multiple HTTP methods
that could be send to this URL and there
could be multiple class methods over
here
so what Jersey provides is a v2 map an
HTTP method if it's a get or a post or
whatever do a java method in this class
right so we've now mapped a URL to a
class now we're going to map an HTTP
method to a job or method I hope that
makes sense so now what we're mapping is
a get request writer when a get request
is made to this URL you want one
particular method Java method to get
call so the way to map a get request to
this method is to simply use another
annotation call get this is GT all-caps
again this is from the same package just
going to import that so now we have the
second level of mapping rights the URL
maps to the class and they should be be
method that's used on this URL maps to
the Java method right you could easily
do a I post for another method right so
there could be one more method public
whatever and
then there's a post method executed on
this URL that's the method that gets
called as a Java method that gets called
so that's the mapping that you're going
to do to help Jersey find the right
method to execute so now Jersey knows
now you you do a get request to slash
messages Jersey knows all slash messages
this is the class and oh it's a get
request so this is the method it
executes this method and it says okay
I've got the return value it is hello
world now how does Jersey send that
value back right so it needs to send
that in the response how does it send it
back it needs one other piece of
information it wants to know what's the
format that it needs to send this value
in okay needs to know the return format
and for that this is the third and final
annotation that's required to get this
to work
it is the ad produces annotation now
this annotation basically tells Jersey
what's the return content type what's
the written format of that request and
there's a handy enumeration that lets us
specify the different values and that's
called media type
now media type is an enumeration that
contains a lot of the standard content
types that an HTTP response would return
to one of the content types that it has
is text underscore thing now let me
import media type now text underscore
plain is basically an indicator that the
response is plain text we have other
content types as well like application
XML application JSON a whole lot of
stuff but what we are interested in this
explains since we're returning just
simple text now this is the third
annotation with this we are finally done
now we have a message resource class
which has three annotations the first
one is a path the second one is the HTTP
method here it's a get the third one is
produces with this three we are finally
ready and now when the reserve
to slash messages this should return
hello world in plaintext response so
let's test that out okay so have my
browser open and I'm going to access the
URL localhost 8080 messenger Web API
messages now if I hit enter there you
see hello world being printed so there
you go you've created your first
resource called message resource which
accepts a request for a particular
resource URL and returns plain text now
if you happen to look at the existing my
resource class well things should look
very familiar now you do see the same
path at annotation you have the get
annotation and then the produces
annotation even this one has annotated
with
the media type that takes plane to
return plain text so for this we have a
basic resource handler ready and in the
next tutorial we're going to enhance
this a bit right now it's written in
plain text we're going to enhance it to
return an actual list of messages see
you in the next tutorial and thanks for
