the develop an environment fire writing
JavaScript core we're going to write
some JavaScript code in this course so
we need a development environment right
what is the development environment that
we need to choose for our for our code
typically when it comes to languages
like Java or C sharp there's a bunch of
installations that you will have to do
right so you need to download the JVM or
some runtime environment set it up set
up the path and all that stuff
thankfully you don't have to do that in
this course I can guarantee almost
guarantee that your machine your desktop
or your laptop already has the
JavaScript development environment
installed can you guess what it is well
it's the web browser like I told you the
web browser is the runtime which you can
use for JavaScript so any web browser
should do I will however asked you to
use Firefox for this course or at least
that's what I will use you can probably
follow along using a different browser
but I'm going to choose Firefox because
Firefox has certain tools that is very
handy when it comes to writing these you
know scripts and having them execute so
let me demonstrate how to do that first
step download and install Firefox you
can go to the Mozilla website or just
google the Firefox get the Installer
download it and install it once you've
installed it open the application and
click on this menu icon over here and
you should see an option called
developer should you click on it and
click on toggle tools and this is going
to open the developer tools for Firefox
most of the modern browsers today come
with some sort of developer tools
installed so there will be an option for
you to open the developer tools in the
browser itself
it's present in almost all browsers what
developer tools lets you do is look at
the page that's being rendered you can
look at the HTML that caused the page to
render and also look at some of the
JavaScript associated with it you can
debug the JavaScript and also add new
Java
commands right you can write new
JavaScript commands that work on that
page so what we are going to do is we're
going to use Firefox as our development
environment right so we're going to use
Firefox to write our JavaScript code and
are we going to run it using this so
there's not going to be a page that
we're going to write okay there's no
HTML page that we're going to start with
this blank page whatever Firefox starts
with but we're going to write JavaScript
if we're going to execute it and Firefox
has features to execute arbitrary
JavaScript statements so the first way
to run javascript in firefox is by using
the console okay so there is this
console tab in the developer tools you
have a bunch of tabs here you see
inspector console debugger and so on
click on the console tab okay so when
you click on the console tab you'll get
this window over here and you have this
prompt like thing okay so you can type
in commands here and it is going to
execute that all right so I'm going to
type in a simple command called console
that logout let me type this in Alex
plain what that does so I'm going to
type console dot log and it's an it's an
implied sub method and then it takes in
an argument which is a string and a pass
in a string hello world
then I end it with a semicolon like hit
enter you see here what happens there is
this thing here called hello world that
gets printed on the console okay and
there is this thing called undefined
ignore that for a bit I'll tell you what
that means but what you've done is you
executed JavaScript by this one
statement so console is a global object
that's available to you and log is a
method off that object so if you're
familiar with C++ or Java this thing
should be familiar to you right so it's
object dot method and the method takes
in an argument which is a string and the
string happens to be HelloWorld and what
this method does is it prints whatever
you send is an argument to the console
okay and that's the reason why hello
world was printed over here all right so
this is one way of running JavaScript
in Firefox there is another way of doing
this and this is by using something
called scratch pad okay so open the menu
here developer again you see here
there's this entry called scratch pad in
the menu so click on that and you get a
new window that opens up okay you see
here this is the scratch pad window now
look at the comments here so you must be
familiar with the comments right this is
how comments are written in C++ or Java
or C sharp so the comment says this is a
JavaScript scratch pad enter some
JavaScript and then right click or
choose execute from the choose from the
execute menu right you can execute
JavaScript by typing it over here so let
me clear out these comments and I'm
going to type the same code that I
entered before I want to print something
to the console so I'm going to say
console dot log hello world again and
now here I have a button called run I'm
going to click on that there you go
hello world again is printed on the
console so what I did here is no
different from what I did over here in
this prompt but the difference is in the
kind of code that I can execute if I'm
typing in JavaScript code in the prompt
here I'm basically executing commands
one after another okay whereas if I
typed code over here I have a bunch of
code that gets executed all at once so I
can actually make a copy of this thing
and I can say hello JavaScript and then
I click run
so hello world again got printed twice
one was from the first run and the
second was from the second run and then
hello JavaScript gets printed if I have
to do that I'm going to have to enter
multiple commands in the console in
order to get that to work so these are
the two ways in which you can run
JavaScript and try things out in Firefox
and this is what we're going to use I am
a big fan of the scratch pad view
because it lets you enter a bunch of
mine's a bunch of lines of JavaScript
code and then execute it in one go we're
going to need something like that when
we write some advanced stuff in
JavaScript so this is what we're going
to use most of the time in this course
and one thing that I want to highlight
is the difference between the two ways
of executing JavaScript code remember I
told you javascript is a scripting
language and I gave a parallel to the
scripting that you do on an operating
system like a batch file or a shell file
so this is very similar you can either
enter commands on the console or you can
create a bunch of commands in a file and
then execute it at once so I hope you
see the parallel there right so this is
very similar to running shell script
commands only things we are doing
JavaScript in this case so make sure you
have your scratch pad open when you
follow along the lessons in this course
I'm going to be writing code using the
scratch pad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
