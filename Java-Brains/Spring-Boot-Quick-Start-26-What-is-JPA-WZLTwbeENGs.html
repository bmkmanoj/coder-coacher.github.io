working with data sources we have an
application that works on its own but it
does not connect to the database yet
we're going to change that we're going
to have our Springwood application
connect to a database run queries on the
database return results and also make
updates to the database so it's the
whole crud operations we're going to try
that out in this unit and we'll also
learn what are the configuration steps
that we're going to have to do to
connect to one such database so what
spring data JPA
there are a couple of terms that you
need to be aware of to understand what
spring the other JB it is first is what
JPA actually means JPA stands for java
persistence api it's basically a
specification that lets you do Oh RM
when you're connecting to a relational
database which is object relational
mapping most of the databases we work
within an enterprise situation are
sequel databases of course this is
changing in a lot of no sequel databases
are popping up but for the most part
it's still a lot of sequel so a sequel
database is what's typically referred to
as a relational database you have tables
and keys foreign keys primary keys which
are relational so when you need to
connect from your java application to a
relational database you need to be able
to use something like JDBC and run
queries Saku queries that could be named
queries which run on that relational
database and then you get the results
and convert it into object instances
right here in your java application you
have classes and objects what
RM does is let you map your entity
classes into sequel tables so that when
you connect to the database you provide
some kind of metadata on your entity
classes so you don't have to do the
query and then the mapping yourself the
framework kind of handles it for you
right so that's our M and GPA is a way
for you to use or GPA is the API it's
the spec which lets you configure your
entity classes and give it to a
framework so that the framework does the
rest
right it handles the conversion from
your you know sequel read queries to
object instances which is pretty handy
so this is JPA
only now spring data JP is a separate
project which lets you make working with
all these water tools even easier and
that's what we're going to be doing in
this unit we're going to be looking at
how spring data JPA lets you connect to
a relational database and that you
provide this JPA configuration on your
entity classes but then have the
framework handle a lot of work for you
and it's amazing how much work it
handles you don't really have to do a
whole lot it's very minimal and you can
get a simple crud operation going so
that's what we're going to be doing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
