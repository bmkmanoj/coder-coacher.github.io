exercise we're going to try out some of
the concepts we've learned in this unit
and we're going to be doing this by
using a list of person objects it's
going to be a custom object custom class
called person you're going to create a
list of those objects and you're going
to try out a few operations on that list
using the Java 7 way and the new Java 8
lambda way so I'm going to create this
class here this is a new class we call
this unit 1 exercise so there's going to
be a starting point for you to work on I
have a main method here and this is
where I'm going to be adding some stuff
and that will expect you to implement
some of these steps using lambdas so I'm
going to create a person class first
because we'll be using that to create
our list so this person class is going
to contain a bunch of private variables
and public getters and setters so let's
say I want to have something like a name
a first name last name and an age I'm
going to spare you all the typing I've
just copy pasted this stuff so it's
basically three member variables the
first name the last name and the age
that is a constructor here which takes
in those three member variables then
sets it so we can create these person
objects easily we have getters and
setters for all those three member
variables and then we have a two string
method which prints out the person
object in a nice format if this is what
you're going to be using in our exercise
so I'm going to create a list of person
objects people and now what I'm going to
do is I'm going to initialize this list
that the array is dot for list method so
the earliest or farlis takes in a list
of an importer is just going to take in
a list of person objects and is going to
give me a list that I can assign to this
people variable so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to create I'm going to call
this person object constructor with a
bunch of values of copy-paste with these
constructors again in the interest of
time so I have like a bunch of
and objects being created with first
name and last name and an age so that it
calls that constructor here and it
creates those objects and this is oops
this is already start as list which is
the method which takes an inline
elements and it creates an object sorry
about that okay now I have this list
here and what I want to do is I want to
first sard this list by last name that's
the first step right so step one start a
list by last name and then step 2 create
a method that prints all elements in the
list and then step 3 create a method
that French that have last name
beginning with C so these are the three
things that we should do that's this
exercise why do you have a list of
people here first started by the last
name and then create a method that
prints all those elements you can
actually call this here as a part of
step 2 and then step 3 create a method
that prints all the people who just same
as step 2 but with the condition are the
last name beginning with the letter C so
in this case this would just be Lewis
Carroll and Thomas Carlyle now how do
you implement this that it really
depends on what approach you choose you
can either choose the Java 7 approach
and you can have in-line implementations
of objects are you can do the Java 8 way
and create lambdas so what I'm going to
do in the next tutorial is try both of
them out right now I'm going to have the
Java 7 implementation and then I'm going
to have the Java 8 implementation so
that you can compare and contrast so
this is exercise give it a shot and I'll
see you in the next tutorial that I'll
walk through the solution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
