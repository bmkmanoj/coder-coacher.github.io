explain some more links that the
JavaScript engine creates when it
creates all these objects so we've
looked at the prototype property and the
underscore underscore proto property so
there are a few more properties that the
JavaScript engine creates in order to
navigate our way through all these
different objects let's look at that
first so when we create a function let's
say I create a function foo and
immediately after creating a function I
can access the prototype property by
using food or prototype you've already
seen this this is what's called the
prototype property but now let's say I
create an object out of this for a
equals new foo
now a is going to get a property called
underscore underscore proto which is
going to point to the prototype again
this is something we've already seen so
this property underscore underscore
proto underscore underscore this is not
the easiest property name to pronounce
is way too many underscores in there so
this property has an alternative name
just call dunder proto okay this is
something that's usually referred to as
dunder proto and somebody C is done -
proto they're actually referring to this
underscore underscore proto underscore
underscore so what are the property
names you've seen so far
the function has a property called
prototype which points to the prototype
object the objects created from the
function has a property called than the
proto which points to the prototype
object now here is another thing that
you need to remember the prototype
object has a property which binds to the
function okay just like the function has
a property called prototype which points
to the prototype object the prototype
object has a property called constructor
which points back to the function so
let's say I get the prototype object for
proto equals food art prototype now I
can save proto dot constructor and
that's going to point to the function
foo okay so in the diagram you have the
function having a property which points
to the prototype and the prototype has a
property which points to the function
again these are not copies they are just
references as with objects so you don't
have multiple copies
these things they find to each other as
a property so this can come in handy
when you want to figure out what was the
function that created a particular
object now let's say I give you this
object a and you don't know what created
it now the way to figure out what was
the function that created the object is
to do the a dot dunder proto which is
going to give the prototype and now I
told you that the prototype has a
property called constructor so I can say
constructor and this is going to get me
the function that created it in this
case it's full this is actually very
flexible and you can actually go crazy
with this let's say I want to create
another object similar to a what I can
do is I can get this function which is
the constructor function and I can call
this with a new keyword and assign this
to B so basically what I'm doing is I'm
saying B is going to be a new object
which is going to get called using the
function which was the same function
that created a ok and believe it or not
this works fine so when I access P B is
also an object was created using new foo
but I was not using the foo reference
here I actually went through the proto
and back to the constructor to access
that function do you really need to do
all this well actually no it's actually
recommended to not use this done the
proto property this is there and most of
the browser's support this but it's not
really recommended to use it what's
recommended is to use the prototype
property the typical use case is when
you have a bunch of objects and you want
to create behavior for those objects you
go to the function that actually
constructs those objects and then get
the prototype object off of it using the
prototype property and then set things
on it just like we did with the employee
object right so we created a function
call play pranks on the employee object
and all the different employees were
able to share that because of the
prototype lookup that is the recommended
way of using it and it's not really
recommended to use the dunder proto
property in order to access the
prototype it's there and you can use it
if you want and you can also use the
constructor if you want but remember
that they are not recommended the other
thing that you need to remember is that
these are actually just references there
is nothing stopping a developer from
changing these so let's say I can change
the a dot
done the proto dot constructor and I can
change this to a new function bar and
now when I do this right whatever I did
over here this is not going to be the
constructor function that created a now
I have taken this reference and I've
changed it right I've changed the
constructor reference to a new function
so when I do this when I say SC now when
access see this is going to be an object
that was created using new off bar okay
and when I say C dot done the proto dot
constructor guess what you're going to
get you're going to get bar okay so a
has fundamentally changed so if I were
to access this for here as well you're
going to get bar so that doesn't work
anymore even though a was constructed
using foo I've not changed it to point
to bar so it's not very reliable but
take it for what it is these are just
references that the JavaScript engine
creates when the object gets created and
they're always free to modify so don't
count on it too much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
