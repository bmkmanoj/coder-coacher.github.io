assign to available once you've declared
it let's say I have a wire ABC ok what
are the values that you can add to it
there are some primitive types that come
with the language as with any language
there are certain primitive types that
come out of the box some of the standard
types are number right number is a very
common type in most programming
languages there's also string which is
fairly common it's for text and then
there is a boolean which has the values
true and false again these are common
you know primitive types that exist in a
lot of different languages so let's
cover some of the differences in those
types versus those other languages let's
start with number number is a JavaScript
type for storing numbers and numbers in
JavaScript are double precision 64-bit
format I Triple E 754 values what this
means is you don't have integers as such
okay so this is all floating-point
double precision 64-bit numbers so in
languages like Java for instance you
have int you have double you have float
you have a whole lot of different types
depending on the precision off the
number that you want to hold that in
JavaScript you don't have that option
every number you declare even if you
want to declare the number with the
value of one it is not an integer one
it's a double precision 64-bit value
containing the value of one okay so let
me give you a quick demo about this so
I'm going to open a scratch pad here and
declare a variable var a equals 10 and
now I do console
dot log okay so what I'm doing here is
I'm creating a variable assigning it a
value and then printing it on the
console all right so let me clear this
out and then if I click run there you go
the value 10 is printed notice the color
that the Firefox console prints this
value in the color is actually green
right now it the console prints
different types in different colors so
when we talk about the next type which
is string I'm going to highlight the
difference in the color but it's a tiny
indicator to know what type you're
printing all right so let's say I do bar
b equals 20 and then now I can say
console dot log of B I'm going to clear
this out again before I run this and I
click run there you go 10 and 20 to
print it you can also do some basic math
and see I do a bar C equals a plus B and
I do a console log of C clear the
console again and I'm going to click run
go ten twenty thirty is printed all
right so these are numbers in JavaScript
what's not very obvious when you look at
these numbers is that it's actually a
floating-point number which is behind
these values that you see over here it
does look like integer here but there
are some math calculations where the
precision is a bit off when you do
JavaScript again this depends on the
interpreter that you use but you can in
some interpreters you can do something
like zero point four plus zero point six
and what you should ideally get this one
but what you do end up getting is one
point zero zero zero
0:01 right some value like that and
that's where the true nature of these
values kind of you know come to surface
that they're actually floating point
numbers but for the most part when
you're working with numbers you wouldn't
have to deal with it but remember that
these are actually floating point
numbers 64-bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
