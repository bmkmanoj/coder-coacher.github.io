for our web services so far with the
styles and the input and output namings
as well as all these other stuff which
configure how the vessel is going to
turn out there are a few things that I
want to do in this tutorial before
moving on and let me just remove all
these excludes that we had used before
we kind of excluded these methods to
understand the wisdom I'm going to
remove it and bring our web service back
to its former glory and now I'm going to
make a few more changes here let me
start by improving this method the get
products so right now the get products
method takes in the category and then
returns a list of string so the list of
product names but I want something more
I want a bit more information about the
product right now I just get a name so
I'm going to create a new model object
called product and create a new module
class called product which has a bit
more information about the product like
the price and all that stuff and this
method is going to return a list of the
product objects instead of a list of
strings so I'm going to create a new
Java class first and call this product
and I'll create this in
a package called model
okay so in this product class I'm going
to have three member variables a name a
SKU and price right so I have a string
name a string SKU and a price and I have
a constructor which takes in these three
parameters and then sets it so I don't
have to create a new product and
initialize it it's going to help us when
we are hard coding these values and then
I have the getters and setters nothing
too fancy just a bozo with three member
variables so I'm going to save this and
this is the product that I'm going to
return from my kit products right just
going to go down the list off these
product objects now before I change this
think about this for a minute now let's
say I have this web service deployed in
production and there are a whole lot of
clients who are using it now if I change
this value here if to a list of products
instead of a list of string what that
means is the Vistal is going to change
and all the clients have to make changes
right they have to coordinate their
changes with my deployment right if they
happen to use the old version of their
code when I deploy my new version of the
code it's going to break so we looked at
all these different annotations which
kind of make sure that the Vistal does
not change when we change our code but
something like changing the signature is
obviously going to change the vista
right there's no way around it so what
we typically do when we have these kind
of changes we create a new version so
people who want to migrate to the new
version want to take advantage of the
changes can make a you know can point to
the new version so this is something
that you have to keep in mind when you
think about making changes to a web
service that's already being applied so
I'm going to create a new version here I
don't want to make changes to this
existing code and break all the clients
code so I'm going to copy paste this and
I'm going to create a method and call v2
so it's a new version version two and
this is going to return a list of
products
and I'm going to fix the import at this
one's a business service which obviously
needs to have a new version too
so I'm going to call this v2 and I will
create this method
okay so this is my product serve example
I'm going to create a new method here
and I'm just going to create a new
ArrayList
you
and I'm just going to add a couple of
products here I don't want to make the
whole list here just for illustration
I'm going to add a couple of products so
I'm going to add
product list of dot add new product
let's say I write my Java brains book
and the SKU is say 1 2 3 4 and I set the
price to be this whatever that is yes
that's how expensive my job means book
is but anyway so now I let me set
another product here
call it an
book and this is skew ABC and the prices
of 50
and I'm going to return
the product list okay so it's
complaining that the visibility of the
constructor should be public had
forgotten to do that so let's do that
now this should work
okay I save this and now I'm just going
to return a list of products here so
what do you think happens in the Vistal
what do you think happens in the request
and the response we knew that all along
we were used we were just using strings
right so we had a string category and
even the inputs were all strings in the
output was a string so it just listed
the strings in an XML format but now I'm
actually using a custom object right I'm
using a custom data type which I have
defined now how is this going to get
translated to the XML now let me just
republish this without making any
changes right and we'll see how the
whistle turns out okay so I'm going to
access the test Mart catalog service
because this is the name that we've
given now it has created this new
message with get products we do I'm sure
it will have a new operation yes there's
a new operation get products v2 but what
happens if we actually make a call to
this now let's use the tester
and we'll call this gay products veto so
irrespective of what I send I'm just
returning a the same list so let's pass
this now notice that the input is this R
0 which is books but not as what's
happening in the output now the output
is returning this XML structure which is
actually representative off my class so
my class has 3 member variables and it's
actually providing that information over
here so it has an XML element called
name which has the value of the name it
has an XML element called price which
has the price and this cue and it's the
same thing for the other book as well so
it's actually doing a conversion of my
product class into XML so the response
is actually doing the conversion so
what's actually happening behind the
scenes is something we're going to come
to a bit later we'll just keep this in
mind so you have a complex type and you
go at this XML conversion for free you
didn't have to do anything ok so this is
one change that I want to do and the
next change is let me go back to the
product catalog now I have this service
as a class right this is a simple poggio
class and i put all these annotations on
top of this class now if I was doing
this say two years or three years back
this would probably not have worked what
was the actual specification in the
earlier version twas a webservice class
cannot just have these annotations on
top of it you could just not take any
class any pojo and then put all these
annotations and you know it just
magically turns into web service what
you actually had to do is to implement
an interface and then the interface had
to had all these annotations now let's
do that now I'm going to create an
interface out of this go to refactor and
extract interface so I'm going to create
an interface I'm going to call this
product catalog interface which is a
very bad name you should not really have
an interface here but I'm going to do
this because I'd have to change the name
of the class to impel otherwise so I
have this interface and I'm going to
create an interface out of all these
different methods hit ok now our product
catalog implements this product catalog
interface and then the interface has all
these methods defined so what you would
have had to do in the earlier versions
is do this create an interface and then
annotate the interface so the class
itself will not have any annotations so
let me just move this to the interface
it's going to be all this cut and paste
works I'm going to speed this up a bit
you
okay so I've removed all the annotations
from this class so it's not it doesn't
have any web service annotations anymore
it is just the class which implements an
interface now the interface has all
these annotations so the interface has a
web service it has a web method and of
course I can put web methods here as
well
okay so now you just taken the interface
out okay so this was actually the
standard way to do stuff before right
before the you know the spec got changed
and said hey now you can actually use
the annotations in your main class and
just one class should be enough you
don't have to implement any interface
but before that this was the practice
and it is actually recommended to use
this kind of an interface for your web
service the reason is again you can
achieve a kind of a decoupling you don't
have to worry about making changes here
to this web service because you have
isolated it out it's similar to the
concept of using interfaces in Java code
right you create an interface and then
you lock it down so it's pretty similar
to this just like we've used all these
different annotations to lock down
what's going to show up in our whistle
we have actually created an interface
and we are locking down the interface so
we are going to change the
implementation of these methods without
having to worry about whether there is
you know the visible changes or not
right there is one more way of
decoupling the visible from our actual
implementation so this interface over
here that you've created and you've
annotated with that web service is
called the service endpoint interface
does that name sound familiar yes we had
the same name for the interface that we
use for the client right you remember
when we implemented the client we did a
WS import and the WS import created
stubs for us and it also created an
interface that we call the service
endpoint interface and we said that is
called service endpoint interface
because it is an interface to the
service endpoint but this one is also
called
the service endpoint interface because
it's an interface which is at the
service endpoint now might be wondering
why those two are called the same name
we're going to talk about why it's the
same name later but then now here is a
hint yes they're actually the same
interface but that's for later for now
what we've done is we've created an
interface with these annotations and we
have an implementation that is web
service annotation free it just it's
just a simple class which implements an
interface but it has all the
implementation for our
webservice there is however one
annotation that we need to add to this
class so we learned that this product
catalog interface is the server's end
point interface so we need to have one
annotation in the actual implementation
class to tell the framework what the end
point interface is so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to add this at web
service
annotation over here which was there by
default but I'm not going to add any of
the previous annotations that we had
right so we import this now the only
property that I'm going to add here is
this one the end point interface we
hadn't looked at this property so far
but I'm going to use this now so the end
point interface is actually going to
tell the framework what the end point
interface is so we know that this is our
service endpoint interface because this
is the one that we have annotated with
all the things that we need the wisdom
to have so I'm just going to tell the
framework that this is actually
implementing all the things that this
endpoint interface specifies so I'm
going to give the class name with the
complete package so the endpoint
interface is actually a string property
so it takes a string value which is the
package dot the end point interface name
ok so this is the only annotation that
should be in the implementation the rest
of the annotations could be over here in
the interface and then we can have the
implementation over here if we're using
just one class without the endpoint
interface then we hide and show methods
that the exclude is equal to true option
for that method that we've seen before
are make it a private because we know
that if it's a public method it is going
to get exposed as a web method but in
the case of an interface it's only these
methods that are in the interface which
is going to get exposed as a web
operation there could be other public
methods over here which are not exposed
to the web server the operation so that
makes sense this is this is the only
annotation which is required in the in
the implementation itself and the rest
of the stuff is moved to this endpoint
interface so in this tutorial we learned
a couple of things we learned how we can
actually use complex data types in our
web service and what did we have to do
for it we had to do nothing it just
happened by default right we created a
product class and we sent a list of
products as a response instead of a list
of string and the web service framework
handle it very neatly it just
used the member variables as named and
it created all these nice XML elements
for us in the slope response and
secondly we created the service endpoint
interface and we had our web service
class implement the interface and the
interface had the web service
annotations not the class itself
so the advantage of doing it is you can
of course in the couple the interface
from the implementation and let's say
you want to try out multiple
implementations you want to try out a
radically different implementation you
don't have to port over all these
different annotations to that class you
have consolidated it in one interface
and then whatever implementation you
want to use just implement this
interface and you're done okay so these
are some of the advantages there are a
few more advantages that we'll learn
down the line
I hope these advantages are clear and
it's a good idea to use them thanks for
