and give you some of my tides on
learning JavaScript so Douglas Crockford
one of the really influential people in
the JavaScript landscape has said the
javascript is one of the most
misunderstood programming languages in
the world today and the reason he says
that is really interesting so there was
the survey about programming languages
and the server was trying to find out
what is the which is the most loved
beloved programming language and which
is the most hated programming language
yeah apparently somebody thought there
was a really important thing to figure
out so they had a survey for it and it
turns out there's one language which
held among the top positions in both the
most loved language list and the most
hated language list can you guess which
language it is well I wasn't actually
surprised when I when I saw that because
my reaction to JavaScript when I was
learning it kind of mirrors that there
have been times when I've totally loved
the language in the Rabine times would
have totally hated the language and a
lot of it had to do with some of my
background and I think a lot of people
share this background I'm gonna relate
to my personal experience in my personal
journey in learning JavaScript so I come
from a server-side background right I
was I started out programming with
visual basic.net and I moved to Java and
written a lot of Java applications of
the server-side and there were times
when I had to do some client-side
application development because there is
some things you can do on the server
side and there are some things which are
better done on the client side so there
were times when I had to go there and
write some JavaScript code write some
HTML and JavaScript code using some
JavaScript plugins like jQuery or dojo
or Yui so one of the first reactions
that I had was since JavaScript is very
similar to Java when it comes to the
syntax I was like yeah this is a piece
of cake I already know the language I'm
already familiar with it so I can just
go in and write some code and have it
work and that actually happened I was
able to get in there
very little knowledge of JavaScript that
was geht I was able to get something
working and I was happy it was like okay
I made this thing it works and I'm done
okay and that worked for a while and
then I had to make some changes and
eventually I would encounter in a lot of
my projects with JavaScript eventually I
would encounter a point where what I
wanted to do was not working and it was
not the way I expected the language to
behave of like okay this part works but
this part doesn't work what is going on
here why is JavaScript so weird and it
eventually came to my lack of
understanding of JavaScript as a
language itself
the thing is javascript is so similar to
Java in the syntax that it led me to a
false sense of complacency and it led me
to a belief that I knew the language
while I did not I mean think about it
how often do you write code in the
language without learning about it there
is always this learning step that needs
to happen before you write code in the
language down hard since JavaScript has
a syntax which is familiar to Java
somehow a portion of my thinking went
hey I know the language I don't have to
learn it and that was actually the
result of some of my frustration I think
it's a very important step or to learn
the language understand what the
language is and what are the constructs
the concepts in the language before you
actually write serious JavaScript code I
hope that going through this course is
going to make you feel better about
saying that you know JavaScript and make
you comfortable when you're actually
writing code using javascript</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
