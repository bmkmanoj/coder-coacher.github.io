the previous tutorial we wrote a simple
starts to application we had an action
class and what we did was we configured
that starts to frame work in such a way
that when a user makes a request HTTP
requests we were able to execute a
method of a class by default so we used
the execute method of this action class
and we you know printed a simple static
message and we were able to execute this
method when a particular page TTP
request was made and we were also able
to redirect the flow of control to a JSP
which was either the success or the
error of JSP depending on the condition
that we returned now we had one
particular problem when we run this
application you do a run as run on
server you notice here there was an
error message that we saw as soon as we
ran the application and that was because
we were using the root context URL so we
were using the URL localhost colon 8080
starts to starter we did not have
anything that executes when this
particular request was made you notice
in the web direction we had a list of
welcome files right so this these are
the files that could potentially get
executed when you access this root
context but unfortunately none of these
files are available right now so there
are different ways in which we can have
something that picks up the root context
over here like you know the URL slash
application name so when then this URL
is called you need something to handle
this it's most probably going to be the
home page so we could have a simple JSP
or a simple HTML to address it or we
could have another action class that
addresses it just like this action class
addresses this URL which is which is
this one get tutorial so instead of a
particular URL you could have an action
class that addresses a URL with the root
context so let's look at having a simple
JSP this is
nothing specific to stretch this is the
simple servlet and JSP concept
so I'll create a new JSP over here and
I'll call it index dot JSP and then I
have this in Dexter JC I'll just say
index over here so that we know it's
this JSP now if I access this URL it's
going to display the index dot JSP
because this is the JSP that is
configured to be accessed when the root
context is accessed okay now I'm going
to talk to you about a concept called
namespaces let's look at the URL to
action class mapping that we have done
in a previous tutorial so notice that I
have specified the URL by means of
specifying the action name which is get
tutorial now if I have to access this
URL what I need to do is I need to say
get tutorial that action and I get the
action executed so this is the URL for
which I'm mapping tutorial action which
is the action class now notice how I've
configured the URL it does get tutorial
and notice how I've configured the
action I've specified the full package
name and the action class name because
obviously I have to pinpoint one
particular action to handle the request
so thus the class that in hand is the
request is various you know detailed
configuration but look at the URL that
I've configured I've just given a name
get tutorial and everything else is
assumed and deduced by default so out of
this entire URL the only thing that I'm
configuring is this get tutorial part
everything else is taken as the defaults
of course you cannot really change
localhost colon 8080 because that's
where Tomcat is running and this is the
web application name and this is the
dart action is the default extension
that I have mentioned in the earlier
tutorial now apart from this particular
thing everything else is happening by
default now what if I want to configure
this URL now what if I want to add
something else to the bath now let's say
I have an application there is a web
application that gets all the list of
tutorials it gets list of books and so
on and I do not want all the URLs to
start from the root context I don't want
stretch to start or slash the name of
the action and what I'm going to have a
nested URL say I want to have tutorials
slash get tutorial redaction and I'm
going to put all my tutorial related
action in this URL
you know application name slash
tutorials slash and then the name of the
action dot
action so and the reason I'm going to do
this is I can classify my actions
properly so let's say I'm dealing with
books as well then I could have a you
know the application name slash books
slash and then I would have all the
action paths related to books so this is
a common thing you know in in a web
application or all the resources and all
the action URLs would start from the
default web application context slash
onwards you would have a nested URL so
how do we achieve this kind of a nesting
if always specifying is only this part
to get tutorial in the start section how
do we achieve the nested URL over here
the way to do that is by using
namespaces so notice that this mapping
between the action the name the URL and
the action class is inside a tag called
package so there is a package stack
inside which I've actually made the
mapping between the URL part and the
action class now this package is where I
can specify something called as a
namespace now notice the package has
something called as a name and an
extends we're not gonna worry about
either of these two in this tutorial
what I'm going to do is I'm going to add
a new property called namespace now the
namespace lets me add this kind of a
nested URL over here so that all the
mappings inside a package which has a
namespace
is going to come inside that name so I
can have a slash tutorials here so now
it's going to happen is instead of
calling a gate tutorial reduction
directly after the application context
ends what it's going to do is it's going
to put it inside this slash tutorials
namespace so it's going to be slash
tutorials slash and then the action
named redaction so this let me save this
now it's going to happen is when I
access this without the namespace now
let's say I hit enter what's going to
happen is I get an error of course I'll
have to restart it because it's a XML
change when we're doing an XML change
like in a start start externally will
have to restart the server so okay now
restarted it and let's access this URL
the one that we used to access before
okay before we did the namespace change
here now if I access this now look
what's the error it gets displayed now
this error should make sense the error
says there is no action mapped for the
namespace slash and the action name get
tutorial associated with the context
path starts to starter so what this
means is when this URL is being sent a
stretch framework is going to look at
the URL it says this is the context path
starts to start there so this is the
application that's going to take this up
now the URL itself is slash get tutorial
dot action so what this means is that
there is no namespace here the namespace
is just slash so for the namespace slash
for the default blank namespace it's
going to look at the stretch XML to see
if there is any mapping for this get
tutorial action name now we're going to
look at the start section uh it sees
there's just one package with one
namespace it sees tutorials okay this
will not do because it's a namespace
slash that it's looking at it does not
find anything so it prints a message
saying there is no action mapped however
if I do not use the default namespace
slash
and I use the tutorials namespace then I
hit enter now what's going to happen is
it's again going to look at the
namespace here which is slash tutorials
I just go and check the start start XML
to find this particular package mapped
with the namespace slash tutorials ok
now it finds this package and then it's
going to look at the action name which
is get to toriel dot action now it does
have a get tutorial action mapped now
we're going to look for this class and
it's going to execute it and that's how
our action gets executed so this is the
concept of namespaces it's very handy if
you want to organize your URLs into
nested paths and if you do not specify a
namespace like we did before this stagg
was not there before so if we do not
specify this that means that is the
default namespace which means there is
no namespace here it is just slash as
the namespace so this action is picked
up at the root application context okay
and before we wind up this is a picture
that should be helpful so this is the
URL that we've been seeing and this is
the format for the URL so you have the
server cooling port the beginning of the
URL this is not changeable really
because this is the server in which your
application is running
next is the web application context root
this again depends on the application
itself but then the action itself is
dependent on two portions one is the
namespace and one is the name of the
action the name of the action is
actually the action mapping that we've
performed earlier in the previous
tutorial but the namespace is what gives
a level of nesting for the actions the
namespace itself is taken next in the
URL and then it's the namespace slash
and then the action name dot action so
this is how a starts to URL is
constructed and we can use this to
classify related action names into a
particular namespace so that you have an
organized URL now this is one of the
advantages of using the package you know
the namespace is specified in a package
tag
and then there are several other reasons
why you would want to bundle multiple
actions into a single package but the
namespace is just one of the advantages
of using a package to group related
action mappings we're going to look at
some more advantages of using packages
in the subsequent tutorials but for now
I hope the concept of namespace is clear
see you in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
