course Springwood quick stat they've
covered a lot of ground so far so here's
what we did we started the course by
understanding what spring waters and we
set up a simple spring boot application
that was unit 1 and unit 2 we looked at
the view tier specifically the spring
MVC tier we saw how spring MVC lets us
create these rest API endpoints and map
it to business logic we created a simple
API for the topic service and we were
able to map it to hard coded hard coded
logic and hard coded data on the server
side in unit 3 we kind of took a slight
detour from our application and we
looked at as native ways for us to
create Springwood applications we saw
one main unit one we saw a few more in
unit 3 in unit 4 we use what we learn in
unit 3 to create a new project which
included the spring data GP and the
examined spring data JPA in much more
detail we looked at how we could connect
to the database using spring data JPA
helped map the objects and classes to
database tables using object relational
mapping including GPA annotations and
having it work that the spring data GPA
framework in unit 5 these are how to
package and execute our Springwood
application as well as looked at a tool
which lets you create manage metrics and
observe the state of your application
that's deployed in production which was
the spring actuator which is a
sub-project off spring boot the source
code that we've been working on all
along is available on the tutorial page
on java brains or java brain Co
definitely check that out and feel free
to play around with it the original
promise that I made when I started this
course was by the time you're done you
will have enough knowledge and
information to comfortably create a
spring application using spring boot
from the scratch I really hope we are
there now definitely play around with
Springwood a little bit more and try out
all the different possibilities that it
brings to the table you've been watching
the course spring boot QuickStart on
shower Prince thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
