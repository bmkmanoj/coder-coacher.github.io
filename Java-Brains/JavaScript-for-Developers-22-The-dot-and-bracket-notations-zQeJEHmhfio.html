about the dot notation a dot notation is
something we've just used to access
properties of objects that's what we did
just now we did object dot property and
we were able to access the property of
the object so that is what's referred to
as the dot notation the dot notation is
not however the only way to access
properties of objects there is another
way which is the square bracket notation
let me demonstrate that now you see here
the way the dot notation works is by
using the variable name which is what
the object is and then I'm doing a dot
and then giving the property name let me
remove this undefined thing now I can
also access the property using the
square bracket notation so the way to do
that is by using until the log let's see
is accessing using square bracket
notation and here's how we do it we say
my object just like you do a prop one
you instead use this in square brackets
and then you give the name as a string
okay so this works exactly the same way
as how this would work
now let me reload and run and I can
prove that it works exactly the same but
let's I missed a space here so don't let
that confuse you it's still showing one
two three okay so there are two ways in
which you can access properties of
objects one is using the dot notation
one is using the square bracket notation
now what's the difference between the
two when would you use one versus
another when would you use a square
bracket notation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
