fetched an object from the database and
I have used this to say render some a
page or screen to the user if the user
is going to look at the screen and then
react to it and enter some inputs now
what I need to do is I need to take the
user inputs and then update the you know
the record back to the database it's a
very common scenario it happens most of
the times so what I'm doing is I'm
getting the data displaying it to the
user and then updating the data with the
user inputs and sending it back now the
problem with this scenario is that there
is going to be a thing time when it
comes to the user now when I render this
you know the display to the user the
user is going to take some time it might
be 5 seconds it might be 10 seconds it
might even be a minute now the problem
here is that I will have to wait for
that duration here and I don't know how
long I need to wait and then I need to
make an update so I I it's not a good
idea to have all of these inside a
single transaction so what I will do is
I'll have once one transaction I'll open
a session where I open a transaction and
get the data here how to close a
transaction close the session and then I
will let the user take his or her time
when it comes to making the input and
then once I get the users input I'm
going to make I'm going to open another
session where I'm going to do the update
now the problem is that once I've got
this err once I've got the entity object
here it is persistent now I cannot wait
I need to close the session here the
moment I close the session it's going to
be detached and now I wait for the user
input here now the user makes an input
now I have the update here I have the
updated value and now I need to save it
back to the session which means that I
need to have this object back to a bus
its persistent state again now how do I
move an object from the detach state to
a persistent state now once I do that
you know once I make this object back to
a persistent state of the user input I
know updation is as simple as hitting
the properties of this object of the
persistent object but now how do I move
it from detach to persistent so that's
something the trigger
at naam okay you can see here I'm doing
a session dot get of the user object
with the primary key of one now this is
the first first part of the process now
I have an object that I'm getting from
the database and once I got the object
I'm closing the transaction on and
closing the session now I have displayed
this object related information to the
user and I'm waiting for the user input
now now I cannot open the transaction
for long I'll close this now I can wait
for the user input as long as I want now
it's probably they'll be another method
with a handle to this to this method to
this object so I'll let me place this
inside an object okay so what I'll do is
now I have this user object which I'm
going to use to render the view to the
user and I wait for the user input and
then there will be another method or
another class which will run to update
this user object once we get the input
from the you know from the user now
there has to be a way in which I can you
know make this user object become
persistent once again so what I'll do is
let me let me open a new session here
okay again this code will probably be in
a different method or in a different
class but for simplicity I'm going to
put this in the same class and the idea
is to see how we can attach the user
object back to the session with a by
opening a new session so what I'll do
here is I'll again do a session dot
begin transaction now I will I will have
the updated value here so probably what
I will do is user dot set user name now
I'll set the user name as updated user
name
session closed okay since I'm updating
this after the session closed it's not
going to get updated in the database now
I'll have to somehow find a way to
update this user in the database I'll
call the session dot update the session
dot update takes an object as argument I
will pass the user object here so what
I'm telling hibernate is to update this
user by finding out which record it is
that needs to be updated now I'm not
going to give more details all the
information is already available in the
user object it knows what's the primary
key the primary key has not changed here
as you can see I'm using the same object
so as long as I have a handle to the
object even though it's in a detach
state I can again merge it back to a
persistent state so once I do this it's
going to update it's going to send out
an update query and then it's going to
update the corresponding record in the
database and the value will be the
updated user name after session close so
let's test this out I will close this
transaction as well the second
transaction and I'll come into
transaction I'll close this now let's
have a look at what is the value now of
course I will change the HBM to detail
or auto to update because I don't want
this to go away I have already have a
user with ID 1 ok so now let's run this
so here you can see it does a select and
it does an update on the select this
fault the get record this object from
the setting the from the first session
and we close the session and then now I
change this property and now I'm doing
an update and this update is triggering
the update query so now if you can look
at the data record here you can see that
the change that I have made after the
close of the first session has been
reflected in the database in the second
session have inators figure out what is
the row that
spawns to this user even though it's
removed from the session and then it
automatically attaches back to the
session now the couple of things to note
here the first thing is that if I make
any changes to the user object here you
know after I do an update it is
automatically gonna persist it so I can
do a user dot set username and I can say
change after update this will be updated
as well so it's not going to run more
than one update query because it knows
that only one is required so here you
can see it updates that as well so what
it's actually doing is not only it is
updating the value it is also making
this the user object has a persistent
object so whatever changes you make here
will be persistent okay so that's the
first thing the second thing to note
here is that let's say I do not make any
changes to the user object I'm just
getting the object here and I'm
detaching it and then in the second
session I am attaching it I am doing an
update and attaching it back to the back
to the session the second session now if
I run this notice what happens now even
though I have not made any changes to
the user object it is going to run the
update query it's going to do a update
user details why is it doing that
the reason it's doing that is hibernate
does not know if anything has changed in
the user object now as long as user
object is in the session as long as user
object is persistent hibernate keeps
track of changes okay you're making a
change in a property have any noise okay
this has to be updated it marks this
property as dirty and it knows that an
update query has to be triggered but now
since this object is coming from another
session hibernate does not know what is
the value that's saved in the database
so unless it does an update it cannot be
sure that the value the current value of
the user gets reflected to the record in
the table so you know to be on the safe
aside hibernate does the update query so
that any further changes you make can
also be persisted and
is no data inconsistencies there is a
way to avoid the store say you want to
make sure the object has changed before
doing an update so what you do is you
ask hibernate to first do a select and
see if the user object that you're
trying to trying to update is any
different from what's already there in
the table now you will tell hibernate
you can tell hibernate to make an update
query to fire an update query only if
something is changed in the user object
and if nothing is changed in the user
object don't run any update queries just
attach this pack you know make this back
to a persistent state so in order to do
that what we need to do is we need to go
to the entity entity class itself and
you have to have an entity annotation
now this annotation is specific to
hibernate it's not a Java you know JP
annotation so we need to use the
hibernate entity annotation in order to
specify this so the way I do this is
below the you know the Java X dot
persistence or entity annotation I also
use the hibernate entity annotation so
that is all got hibernate dot
annotations dot entity so I need to give
the fully qualified name because I
already have an entity annotation here
so this entity annotation of hibernate
has a property called select before
update and this you can set it to true
now
what am i doing by setting this to true
I'm saying hey hibernate make sure you
do a select first before you do any
updates and make update queries only if
there is something that needs to be
updated so this is applicable for the
whole entity it's not just the dot
update so we're going to look at a
couple of other scenarios where this is
applicable for now when you do a session
or update of any entity not only does it
attach itself to
the you know the persistent state it
also in instead of instead of firing an
update query directly what it does is it
just does a select first and if the
select comes up with a different set of
data in the table which is different
from what is there in this user object
right now then it also fires an update
query but if it is the same it does not
fire the update query so let's test that
out one more time now again I'm not
making any changes to the to the user
object here so now when I run this here
you can see there are two selects that
are happening so the first select this
for this session dot get I'm getting the
user object and I'm saving it into this
user details object now I'm doing the
session not close now in the new session
I'm doing a session dot update normally
what would happen is it would just to be
on the safe side we'll just file an
update query but now since I've done a
select before update what it does is it
it executes another select and it gets
the current state of the data in the
table now it figures out that this you
know this state is the same I haven't
made any changes here so it is not gonna
fire the update query but however if I
make a change here set user name then
change the name here now what will
happen is hibernate will before doing an
update it transit select and then it
figures out that something has changed
and then it runs another update query so
let's test that out so here you see the
first select is to get the object and
now in the second session when I do a
you know user dot session or update of
user it first as I select sees that okay
something has changed now it's going to
update the data in the DNR in the
database now the Select before update
this is useful if most of the times you
wouldn't change anything you just want
to attach the you know the object back
to the session but if there is a chance
that the you know the object might have
been changed it's a good chance then
it's better not to do a select
you know select different because it's
going to run another select query and
then after that it's not an update video
on top of that so you can save an update
query if you know that the session I
mean if they are object might not be
changed but if there's a chance if there
is a good chance of the object might be
changed it's a good idea to not do a
select before update</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
