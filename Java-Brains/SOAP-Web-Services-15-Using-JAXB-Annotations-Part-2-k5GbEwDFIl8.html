what are the inputs that we need to give
to Jack's B to help it to convert this
to an XML format well think about what
we've done so far we haven't given any
such specific inputs to Jack's B to help
it in the conversion but we have seen an
XML structure with this thing so like I
told you before a simple module like
this it's kind of pretty intuitive what
needs to be the XML structure every
member variable will be an XML element
and then the value will be the value of
that XML element so it's fairly
straightforward so in this case I would
be using custom Jack's P input in order
to override some of the default behavior
so if you notice the XML so there are
certain things that I want to change in
this XML I want to change the name of
the root node I want to change some of
the names of these values so I'm going
to use some overrides to change the
default behavior so the very high
profile information to Jack's be in this
class is by using specific Jack's P add
notations so I have one annotation at
the very top called at XML
root element which tells jxp that this
is actually the root element of the xml
so I can import from Java X XML bind
annotations so notice the word bind in
the package that gives the indication
that this is actually a Jack's B
annotation because it's actually a
binding API so I import this and now
this has been declared as a root element
so the advantage of declaring a root
element is I can actually customize some
of the things so if i do a control space
here
you see i can specify a name and i can
specify a name space so these are going
to be the names and namespaces off the
xml that gets generated so let's say I
choose a name and I call this
product okay and now this XML has a root
element as product it's as simple as
that
okay now I'm going to add one more
annotation at XML type and if I check
the import again from XML bind
annotation now what is the difference
between an XML type and an XML root
element now the root element indicates
as the name say is the root element so
the product is kind of like the root of
the old XML structure but this root
element could contain some other class
as the member variable right right now
it's just basic parameters like you know
just have string and double but now this
had a member variable with another class
then that class would not be the root
element that class would just be the XML
type but this one is a root element okay
but now why am i annotating the same
class with both the root element and the
xml type the reason I'm doing that is by
using the XML type I get a few other
things to customize now I'm going to
take this one the prop order now the
prop order gives me a way to customize
the order in which these properties are
getting displayed in the XML so we have
name skew and the price let's say I have
a specific order that I want in the XML
so for this example let's say I want the
price first and then this queue and then
the name okay so I can actually
customize that by mentioning that order
over here and the way I mentioned the
order is by opening up an array over
here so I'm going to open up a curly
brace and I have an array of strings so
I'm going to say I want the price
element first and then
the skew and then the name then one
close the curly brace so I am
specifically defining a property order I
want the XML to have this order for the
elements so I want the price to come
first then the SKU and then the name so
I can actually specify the order in
which the XML is created so that's why
I'm using this XML type if I was not
specific about the order I would not
really need the XML type in this at
least in this scenario now how about if
I want to customize the name of these as
well right now the name of these
properties are the name of the XML
element so now I want to change that I
want to have a custom name for my XML
element I don't want it to take the name
of the member variable itself so I can
actually do that by providing one more
annotation so I'm going to go to the
gaiter here now let's say I want a name
I want to change the name of the name
attribute to a product name so I go to
the Gator and then on top of the Gator I
use the annotation XML element now XML
element is again from XML by an
annotation like all the other
annotations in this tutorial and here
you can choose a lot of things here you
have you can choose the name you can
choose the default value which is again
interesting if you don't have a specific
value you can choose the default you can
choose nillable whether it's whether it
can be null or not it's not nullable in
the XML voice it's called nillable but
it actually means the same thing whether
you want to allow the element to be null
or not and whether he wanted to be
required the type of the XML element all
that stuff so I'm going to just
customize the name here I'm going to
call this product name and save I don't
need to customize all the other stuff
this is just for illustration I'm just
customizing this name and now before I
publish this there's one last thing I
need to do when you annotate any class
with these XML or rights with these
Jack's P annotations you need to make
sure that it has a public no I'll
construct
you notice here that I have a
constructor which takes certain
arguments so we need to have a know our
constructor why do we need that we need
that because we need a way for Jack's B
to initialize our a new instance of this
class and if you have only one
constructor with some arguments Jack's B
doesn't know what arguments to pass to
these things we want Jack's B to be able
to create a new product and if you have
a constructor with arguments if you
don't have a know ax constructor Jack's
B will not be able to create a new
instance of product so in order to let
that happen we are going to create a new
constructor
which is a no ax constructor and now we
are all set to republish
and if I opened the tester page and test
the get products version do you can see
that the XML has the order the price SKU
and the product name and of course the
name has been changed to product me one
thing you would have noticed is that the
type name hasn't changed it's still
seeing returned any guesses on what we
need to do to fix this we have already
covered this before well it is the web
result annotation so it's not over here
you need to go to the method itself
where you're annotating with add web
method and see this has to have a
specific web result name so I'm going to
do that here I'm going to annotate it
with at
web result and fixed import and I'm
going to give a name as
product and republish
and now if I call the same method
you see the header is now product okay
so in this tutorial we looked at ways to
customize the XML that gets generated
when we have a custom class or a custom
object that we are returning as a web
service return type and we looked at a
brief introduction to Jack's B and we
looked at a few annotations which let us
customize the way the XML turns out in
the next tutorial we'll examine one part
of the visible and the Swope response
here that has been hiding from us so far
we haven't examined yet and that's got
to do with the fault message so see you
in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
