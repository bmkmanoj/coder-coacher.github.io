in the past few tutorials we've learned
some theory about MVC and about starts
too and we also set up a project using a
starts to library so in this tutorial we
are all set to develop a bare-bones
starts to application so just to quickly
recap what we have seen so far a stretch
to MVC framework and an application that
uses the struts - MVC framework would
consist of some important components one
is the struts XML and the interceptors
we have action classes and we have jsps
that use tag libraries and of course
action classes called certain business
service methods to do the actual work
this is an overall high-level picture of
a stretch - MVC web application but
since we're developing a small
bare-bones starts - application in this
tutorial we're going to stick to the
essentials we'll try to remove some of
the elements over here initially and
we'll learn what they are and bolide
them later so the first thing that I'm
going to remove now is the business
service classes in the business service
methods ideally what would happen is
here starts two classes and the you know
the action classes would be like a view
layer in front of your business service
layer so you say you have a business
service layer that perform certain
actions the view layer which is
comprised of the starts - MVC layer
would be talking to the business service
to get the actual work done so that is
an ideal situation but in this scenario
in this application we are not going to
be having any business of us classes the
action class will just say you know
it'll print a hard coded message this is
just a start and then we'll see how to
integrate with business service methods
later on and let's stick the JSP so
we're not going to use any tag libraries
for now let's just have a simple JSP
that again prints a simple static
message so we have a simple message
static message printed in the action
class we have a simple static message
printed in the JSP so we don't need any
of this and the third thing I'm going to
need are the interceptors
we're not really eliminating because
interceptors are included in our starts
application by default and if we don't
do anything they're going to be
integrated in a default setting we can
configure and overwrite the default
setting and we're going to look at what
interceptors are and how to override the
defaults later on but for now we're just
going to ignore this but it is going to
be there by default so we don't have to
worry about that at this point of time
so having eliminated all these
components we are left with three main
components the action class JSP and the
starts XML so the main components are
the action class JSP and this starts to
XML so these are the three components
that we are going to write in our simple
start slow application and we're going
to see how they interact with each other
and they talk to each other so this is
going to be a high-level overview of our
simple web applications we're going to
develop these three components now so
most of the interaction between these
three components is primarily carried
out by the controller and we can
reconfigure how the interactions happen
by using the struts XML so we're going
to look at that first we're going to
learn what the start stoixima does the
stretch to XML is concerned with taking
a client's request and then finding out
which this is the action class that
needs to execute so this is similar to
what we've seen in servlets in servlets
you have the web.xml and what the web
dot XML does is it has configuration
about a particular URL and a particular
servlet so if there is a particular URL
request coming from the client then the
web dot XML will know which servlet
needs to be called to address that
particular request so depending on the
URL the write servlet is an Android
method of that so let us call so starts
- XML does something similar but here we
do not have servlets we actually have
action classes so it starts to axilla it
controls the execution flow of the
request and what it does is it Maps or
URL I input URL to action classes so
we'll look at what the methods of the
action classes
you know in a little while but the
primary goal of this mapping is to take
the input URL of the client the client
makes a URL request and then it maps it
to a particular action class and a
method of their action class executes to
serve that client request the second
thing that the structure of XML does is
it also maps to jsps and this is
something that we going to look at in a
few minutes but let's focus on the
mapping between the URL and the action
class Falak let's say I want to write an
application that you know that fetches
tutorial website so you want to get a
list of tutorial websites and I'm
writing a web application for that so I
can have a URL to an action class
mapping like this so let's say I have
published a URL in my web application
called gate tutorial so it's going to be
history TP my web app calm or whatever /
get tutorial now what I'm going to do is
in my starts - XML I'm going to map it
to a tutorial action class so I'm going
to write an action class called tutorial
action and then I'm going to say
whenever any client whenever any user
submits this URL request for this URL
key tutorial execute a method of this
action class so this is the URL to
action class mapping that I'm going to
specify in my stops XML and of course
this does not have to be one you can
have multiple mappings like this say I
have a couple more URLs I have a kid
books which fetches all the books that a
user is interested in and I have a book
action that takes care of getting that
response and I have a kid seminars URL
and then I have a seminar action that
addresses that URL request so I can have
multiple URLs mapped to multiple action
classes and this is the information that
I will store in my struts - XML again
it's analogous to a web dot XML mapping
URLs - servlets but there are a few
differences that we are going to look at
in a little while so again this a little
picture about this concept short line
makes a request now what the struts XML
will have is the URL which the client is
requested and it's going
look up which action class needs to
execute and then it's going to call a
method of that action class so this is
the first configuration that we're going
to make in our start 6mm now the
question is which method of the actual
class needs to execute in the servlets
example what would happen is you have
HTTP methods you have a HTTP GET or a
HTTP POST and then based on that you
would have different methods in yourself
that would say is you know method like
do get or a method like do post and then
you know the sublet container has its
job very simple you know depending on
the request if it's a get request called
a do get if it's a post request called a
do post but in this case we have
something slightly different we have
action classes and they are not actually
tied to the get or the post methods
directly so how does the struts
framework know which method to call well
there are a couple of configuration
items over here again but by default
there is a method called execute so if
you're writing an action class if you
have a method called execute then that
is the method that is called when you do
the mapping so we can have other methods
configured when we look at them later
but right now we're going to stick to
the default execute method so what's
going to happen is whenever a client
makes a request same our my client is
making requests for get tutorial it's
going to look at the action class which
action class should I call its tutorial
action then it's going to execute the
method called execute so this is the
default method that starts framework
calls whenever there is a request so now
with this configuration in strategy ml
and with this action class we have an
initial flow established from the client
request to or method execution this is
not sufficient to have a complete
request response cycle to do execute but
this is something we can get started on
so let's open up our Eclipse initely
scored the first path that we understand
so
ok so I have my clips open here with the
default web project of course we
included our starts to library in the
previous tutorial and it has a web
directory which has the important web
dot XML and I think that's what other
thing else the web dot XML has a few
welcome file lists index default all
combinations unfortunately none of them
are there in this project at this time
but let's not worry about that what
we'll do is we'll focus on the stretch
XML and the action class so those are
the two things that I would like to
create in this project so let's start by
creating the start XML I will create the
stretch XML inside the SRC folder it has
to be inside the class path and I can
create it in the SRC folder let me do
that now
I'll choose new other I want an XML file
choose XML file here call this start
start XML and finish now this is the
blank XML file of course with the header
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
copy a small snippet off the starts XML
from somewhere else I'm going to paste
it over here so this as the doctype and
the DTD so this is a good starting point
for us what I'm going to do now is I'm
going to introduce the struts tags so
every starts XML will have the starting
and closing struts tag so all our
configuration is going to be in between
these two tags so between these two
starts tags will specify the mapping
between URL and an action class so let
me go ahead and create an action class
also so I'll click on source new yes a
class
I'm going to use the same use case I'll
get tutorial URL calling a tutorial
action so I'm going to create this
action class then my usual package and I
will append action to it so all the
action classes are going to go into our
cashing Java brains action I'll call
this tutorial action and finish ok so in
my tutorial action we need to have a
default method called execute you
already discussed about that that's the
method that is going to get called when
starts reads that editorial action is to
get triggered based on the user requests
so I'm going to create this execute
method over here but what I'm going to
do is I'm going to call this a public
and I'm going to put a return type as
string we look at why this is string
another a while but this is going to be
my signature for the execute so this has
to be the signature for the default
execute that the stretch framework
triggers so you have to have a public
string execute and again as I said we're
going to look at the reason why it's a
string in a little while so I'm not
going to do anything much over here I'm
just going to you know to us this out
and I'm going to say hello from execute
so that we know that the execute method
has been called and of course I have to
return something I'm going to return o
blank value as of now because we still
haven't covered the significance of this
string return type we're going to look
at that in a little while but this is
good for for starting so I have an
execute method which returns the string
and I'm just printing out something so
that I can know from the logs if this
method has been called then we come to a
point where we execute this project so
now in my starts XML
what I'm going to do is I'm going to try
you know I'm going to map or URL to this
tutorial action so there are a couple of
tags that I will add to my starts XML
now the first tag that I'm going to add
is called the package I have a package
name is default and it has an extends in
it extends struts default this is again
something that we're going to look at in
a little while so let's not worry about
that now so I'll just close the package
tag here okay
so inside the package tag is where I'm
going to be doing the mapping and again
we're going to look at the significance
of this package tag in the next well
maybe not an expert in the subsequent
tutorials
so here now let me specify the mapping I
want to map get tutorial to tutorial
action this mapping is called action
mapping in the struts to language so
this is done by using an action tag I'm
an action tag has something called is
name which is the name of the action the
name of the request that a client makes
in the browser so I will call this get
tutorial so this is a request the client
makes at the browser of course there it
has to be a full URL for the client but
here the route context off the web
application is already decided so I'm
just going to use this name to specify
the rest of the URL after the context so
get you toriel is going to be the URL
and then what I will do is I will use
the class property of this action to
specify the class name which is tutorial
action over here so I'll specify the
name
tutorial action so this is class to
which a URL gate tutorial is mapped and
of course the default method that
executes with this execute so now we
have mapped the URL to the action that
we have seen oh now if I run this
project I'm probably going to get a
million errors because there is a lot of
things that we have to do yet so this is
just a first step and this covers what
we have seen so far in this picture we
have a URL to the action class mapping
so this is happening fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
