tutorial I'm going to talk about
aspect-oriented programming AOP for
short
aspect-oriented programming is one of
the features that spring provides we
covered dependency injection in
considerable detail in the first part of
this course in this part we're going to
look at aspect-oriented programming AOP
is not just a feature that spring
provides it's actually a model of
programming itself
so before we side with aspect oriented
programming I like to take a quick
detour and talk about functional
programming if you've written code in
some of the older programming languages
like C you would know exactly what this
is when you're writing code in such
languages you think of a problem and
then you break it down into different
functions each function accomplishes a
particular unit of work and then a
function can call other functions and
that's how they talk to each other and a
single program consists of all these
different functions and then you know
they all call each other and then when
the last function ends that's when the
program is complete so this is the way
you would think if you were to write
code in a functional programming
language you think of them as different
functions the problem here is that if
the complex design is involved then you
would have a whole lot of function the
whole lot of interdependencies between
functions this graph could get really
messy and for some situations you would
get a better design if you'd use
object-oriented programming so that's
the second programming model in
object-oriented programming you wouldn't
think of functions when you are trying
to solve a problem by writing code you
would think of individual entities as
objects and you would write objects that
mirror different entities in your
problem space so you would have object a
B and C and each object would contain
the member variables as well as the
methods so you have encapsulated
entities and you can design more complex
code because you have a cleaner design
and separation of concerns well this is
fine but then
here's a problem not all of the tasks
that you would want your program to do
can be classified into objects now let's
take for example you have a common
procedure across different objects I've
taken example of the log message here so
I want a log message method to be run
and to be included in three different
objects now what does a log message
method do it prints out a message it's
as simple as that
and you want the functionality to be
there in all the objects that you are
designing in your code so what would you
do you would have a log message method
in your object a object B object C so no
matter how many objects need the log
message functionality you would add the
log message method in each of those
objects this is not really a good design
because you're repeating yourself by
including the same method in different
objects so how would you two find this
code one way to do this is to take that
method out and create a separate object
for it of course you cannot just leave a
method floating on its own you would
have to include it inside an object so
you would have a log message method
inside a new object called the logger
object and then object a B and C would
not have that log message method anymore
instead what will happen is whenever a
log message need to be called it would
reference this logger object and then do
a logger object dot log message it would
either have a dependency so it would
create a new logger and then call the
method or this might be a static method
and then it would call the method
directly they could also be a parent
class and then you could inherit the log
message functionality into each of your
objects that need this method so this is
good but then a couple of problems here
the first problem now let's say you're
doing the design and you want to write a
diagram that depicts the relationship
between different objects and you want
to know which object is the really
important ones and you know how
depending on how they're connected to
other objects you want to know which
are the objects that are connected to
other objects the maximum now if you
write this diagram for a design like
this it's very likely that the most
important object in the most connected
objects would probably not be your
business object will probably be this
logger object because every object that
needs a logger has a dependency on this
logger object so it is not really a good
idea to have this kind of a dependency
to something that is not really a part
of your business problem so you have too
many dependencies to this logger object
and the logger object is not really
adding business value it's adding
something else it's just doing a support
role so that would be problem one you
have too many relationships to these
cross-cutting objects when I say
cross-cutting objects I mean objects
that concern different other objects in
your problem domain the second problem
you still need to have code inside all
your methods to make the call you have
removed the log message functionality
for example and you have put it into a
longer object but then you'd still need
each of the methods in your business
objects to make a call to this logger
objects log message method so you have
removed the method but you actually
haven't removed the code that makes the
call and you cannot remove that because
it has to be done it has to be called
and the method has to execute the third
problem is that let's say you want to
change in bulk say you want to have a
different log message method and you
need to make a change in all these
different business objects to call that
method instead of course you can solve
this problem using some more intelligent
design you can have an interface class
and then you can plug-in the different
log implementations but then if that is
not the case and if you cannot solve the
problem by using a common interface for
example you would need to go to each of
those classes and you need to make the
code change now why are these
significant problems these are
significant because this whole concept
of having a cross-cutting object is very
common in
the software design so you can have this
in lot of situations where you have
cross-cutting concerns you have some
functionalities that need to be used by
different objects and they may not be a
part of your problem domain it could be
infrastructure related it could be
security related so these are some of
the common cross-cutting concerns that
you would see in a normal real world
application almost every major
application that's some kind of logging
or the other transaction and security I
would say are necessary evils you will
have to implement them depending on your
business problem and the number of users
so since this is a common problem there
are ways to deal with it and we can use
aspect-oriented programming as one of
the really elegant ways to solve this
problem okay so let's see how things
change with aspect-oriented programming
so you would have what are called as
aspects so you have removed the common
functionality in objects a b and c
instead what you do is you do not create
a new class for logging you create a new
aspect for logging so it's actually a
class a special class I would say the
look at what how aspect is different
from an ordinary class down the line but
for now think of it as a class with
special privileges so you have a logging
aspect class defined separately from
your normal classes and objects so
similarly you can have many aspects you
can have a transaction as when to go and
implement transaction related
cross-cutting concerns now you might ask
how is this different from having a
separate object you would have an object
for logging instead you're having an
aspect for logging now how is it
different the difference is in the
second point here in after creating
these separate aspects what you do is
you do not reference these aspects in
your code say you want to have some
methods in object a B and C to use the
logging aspect in the transaction aspect
if it were an ordinary class what you
would do is you would have to
instantiate an object of the class and
then call the methods you wouldn't do
that for aspects what you would do
instead is
you would define a configuration the
aspect configuration which tells which
objects in which methods these aspects
should apply to so this is what is
different from the traditional
object-oriented programming where you
would take these common functionality is
create a separate class have objects and
then reference those objects inside your
objects which actually need those
functionality instead what you do is you
have a specs and then you write
configuration which tells which aspect
applies to which methods of which
classes so this is something that spring
helps us with you know spring helps us
with dependency injection you say okay
my object is dependent on these objects
and then you tell spring to inject these
dependencies so spring also helps us
here spring says here already provide
your dependencies for you you tell me
what aspects are needed for which
methods and I will make sure that those
methods are also called so what would
happen is now let's say for example I
have a particular set of methods in all
these objects and I want a logging
aspect method say I have a logging
method over here
I want this method to be called just
before each of these methods I'm
concerned about runs so say I have five
methods here I have two methods here and
have one method here for which I want
the logging method to run just before
those methods execute so what I would do
is I'd write the configuration over here
and say for all these methods make sure
the logging method runs whenever those
methods are called so this is something
that I can tell spring to do and spring
will make sure that the logging method
is called just before those methods that
have configured here are executed so
before is just one of the ways in which
you can apply aspects this is similar to
let's say for example you have sublet
filters you can configure filters to run
before each and every call to yourself
let execute you have similar examples
like this those are not aspects but you
can think of it in this model let's say
for example straw
interceptors are for example triggers in
databases say you want to do an insert
you write trigger so that whenever that
insert happens there is also this other
functionality that gets executed so
aspects are kind of similar to that you
can have methods inside aspects that get
executed just before particular methods
in your objects run so you can have
different levels of configuration we'll
have a look at that later but think of
it that way you have separate pieces of
functionality that are configured to run
before some other pieces of
functionality run and they are not
configured in the code they are actually
separate configuration files and since
they're all running inside the spring
container spring makes it easy for that
to happen spring reads this
configuration and whenever it senses
that those methods are called and those
are executed just before those
executions happen these configure
configured aspects are executed first by
spring so that your configuration is
achieved so with this model some of the
advantages are obvious now let's say I
want method ABC here to have logging and
I want method DF not to have logging
here so what I can do is I can configure
ABC and I can say for method ABC when
the logging method and for DF I don't
have any configuration here now down the
line I want to change this configuration
I want to say you know I want to have
the locking method run for method DF
also so in that case I don't have to go
to this object and change so code I
don't have to write the call to the
logging method here instead what I do is
go to the log aspect configuration and
say logging aspect needs to run for
method DF also so in that case whenever
the method DF executes logging method is
also executed just before the method
runs so this makes it very easy for us
to add and remove and make any changes
as such without making changes to the
code you can make changes to the aspect
configuration and have these aspects
apply to different points in the code
and this solves some of the problems
that we have we've noted earlier if you
want to make bulk changes you can do
that as well just with a few lines of a
spec configuration you can have
a particular aspect apply to a whole lot
of methods and a whole lot of places in
your application code and aspects get
their true power by wrapping around your
target methods so let's say you have an
execution of the target method you can
configure an aspect to run before or an
aspect to run after your target method
so that if you can figure it this way
this code will get executed and then
your target method gets executed and
then another piece of aspect wood gets
executed so you have a lot of
flexibility here we will have a look at
all the different configurations you can
achieve with aspects in the next set of
tutorials so this is something that you
can keep in mind you can have different
flows of control and you can configure
them using aspects so what are the steps
we need to take in order to write
aspect-oriented programs so the first
step is to write the aspects we need to
identify what are these cross-cutting
concerns and we need to write them as
aspects and the second step configure
where these aspects apply so we talked
about logging we can select particular
methods for which the logging method
runs just before with those methods
executes so that's the configuration
that I'm talking about here so these
have you only two steps you need to do
first write the aspect itself and then
configure to what places in Europe you
know in your code these aspects apply ok
now that we have covered the concepts of
aspect oriented programming in the next
tutorial we are going to actually write
some aspects and we are going to
configure them and we're going to make
spring execute those aspects so I hope
the concepts here are clear I'll see you
in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
