Eclipse plug-in in order to create and
develop and also deploy a web
application we have done all these
things using maven in the command line
in the previous set of tutorials we
specified an archetype download you know
source code structure we made some
changes we added dependencies and we
built and run our web application all
using the command line and this time
we're going to do the whole thing in m2
eclipse and we'll also realize how easy
it is when compared to using command
line if you're using maven and if you're
using Eclipse then employ Clips will
save you a lot of time and another thing
to note here is that there are a few
things that we can do differently in my
clips like searching for a particular
artifact or searching for an archetype
so these things are something that will
come in very handy so we'll have a look
at how we can do all those things in
Eclipse using the m2 Eclipse plugin so I
will start by creating a web application
inside of Eclipse so the way I do that
is by using right-click new and I will
choose other now since I've installed
them to eclipse plug-in here I get this
option here for maven so I can choose a
maven project here so I'm going to
create a new maven project let's say
next
now there's this checkbox here which
says you know if you want to create a
simple project and you don't want to
choose from an archetype selection then
you can check this but I want to choose
from a list of archetype so I'm going to
leave that unchecked and I'm press Next
now what happens is we get a list of our
types this is similar to the list that
we get in the archetype : generate
command it may even give us a huge list
of our types and each one had a number
and we had to choose the number since we
are using a GUI here we can just click
on an archetype and say next we can also
do a filter and this is something that
comes in handy we don't have to scroll
through the whole list and see which are
type that we need since I'm going to
create a web app what
lose all this time we're back here now
the list is automatically filtered by
web apps so here I can choose what art
type I want I will choose the same thing
that we did in a you know command line
example I will choose the j2ee one for
and I will press next now here I can
choose what group ID artifact ID version
and package I need again this is similar
to what the you know article in generate
command line would ask us you use the
same values that I used in that example
and for the version I will choose 1.0
snapshot now this this other option here
we can add properties which are
available in the archetype we haven't
covered archetype properties yet so
we'll just skip this for now let's say
finish so here we have all the files
ready inside of Eclipse as a project you
see there is also the target folder
that's been created Miglin has
automatically run build and it has
created the target folder so well
so now let's let's open up the bomb dot
XML so this is another thing handy with
the m2 Eclipse this feature of giving
you a GUI for editing the boundary XML
so you have all these different tabs
here where you can you can modify the
bomb load XML using this GUI somehow I
tend to be comfortable with the direct
XML editor so you can choose these three
wise if you want now what I will do is
now I have the whole format XML setup
just the way it should be have all the
dependencies to the sublet API is we
have j-unit dependency and we have the
maven compiler plug-in configured for
1.4 so now what I will do is I will
why don't I remove the siren I don't
need this right now I'll remove this
plug-in here and what I will do is
instead of this plugin I will add the
jetty plugin which is
something that we configured in the
command line example so in our pond or
XML here we added the jetty plug-in
configuration where we wanted the scan
interval to be 5 seconds so that
whatever changes we make will be built
and published to jetty in a five-second
interval so I will paste this here ok so
have my jetty configuration in this
bound or XML I'll save the pomerode XML
here ok so now we have updated the
pomerode XML we can run maven commands
by right-clicking choosing run as and
choosing the maven commands here so
there is this maven command for package
I will choose the package I don't need
to compile because there are no Java
classes we've already seen that but we
can verify that again so all that our
source code contains right now is a Java
folder which does not have anything in
it it just has a folder structure for my
package but it does not really have any
classes and I have the web app folder
with an index dot JSP and a web INF
which contains the simple web dot XML
and the Reptoid XML has a welcome file
entry for the index dot JSP which is
over here so this is fine so I can
actually deploy this even though it
doesn't do much so in order to deploy I
can run the maven command to package
this which is right click run as maven
package this is equal into calling the
MV in package command now it has
actually completed the build and then it
has generated the package over here in
my home folder my web app target and
then the war name ok so now what we can
do is we can use the jetty colon run
command to actually deploy this war file
and then you know we have the
application ready to execute you
order to do that what I need to do is I
need to right-click here and then when
you have this run as menu you see this
maven build with three dots next to it
so this is the configurable option so I
can click on this and then here what I
can do is I can choose what the goals I
need to run what commands I need to run
so I will use the jetty : run command
over here now I can choose the base
directory here make sure that the base
directory is where the bomb load XML
exists so this is similar to you know
what we did in our command line we went
to the directory where the prompted XML
was and then we ran the maven commands
so we do something similar here just
make sure that the base directory is the
place where you have your palm read XML
now I specify the school which this
command here jet equal and run and then
I can choose run the few go jetty has
started and it has activated the scanner
interval of 5 seconds now let me open up
my browser and try accessing this okay
so I will access localhost colon 8080
slash my wrists a JSP file but this has
been deployed automatically and then of
course we also have jetty that scanning
our code for change so if I add stuff
here if I add classes if I add if I make
changes to my workspace over here it
automatically gets deployed in jetty so
that I can use my firefox and access it
and it's going to be done and a
five-second interval so that's you know
it's almost seamless I don't have to do
this build make changes deploy and
access you don't have to do that every
time it gets done automatically</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
