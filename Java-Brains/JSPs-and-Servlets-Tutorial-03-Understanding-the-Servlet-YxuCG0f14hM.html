previous tutorial we developed a simple
web application and we wrote the simple
servlet in the web app and we were able
to execute that servlet on Tomcat we
didn't do a whole lot of coding it was
mainly using the Eclipse wizards and
using the pre-built code that Eclipse
generated for us so in this tutorial we
are going to go a bit behind the scenes
we're going to see what exactly Eclipse
did for us so that we can understand
what it takes to write a servlet it will
also understand how Tomcat listens to
incoming requests and maps it to a you
know a request to the servlet itself so
I have the project open here let us open
up the servlet itself okay now before we
start let's execute this one more time
so I'm going to right click on this run
as run on server ok Tomcat comes up I
will select this here this check box
there is a clips that you know I need to
run this project always in Tomcat so I
don't have to answer this every time I
say finish now again it builds de plies
and I opens up the browser tab executing
that sublet ok if you can see here the
URL that has been opened for us as
localhost colon 8080 which means it's
trying to access this term get instance
we've configured and after that comes a
simple servlet project which is the
context root for this web application
and after that this word simple servlet
here so this is actually how Tomcat
refers to the servlet that we wrote here
simple servlet or Java it is not related
to the name of the class even though the
name of the class here a simple servlet
to not war tell Strom get that this
needs to run what else Tomcat that this
server needs to run is this particular
annotation here called URL patterns so
what we are telling here with the
annotation is that whenever anybody
accesses the URL slash simple servlet
then executes this Java class so that's
one of the things that is mentioned in
this particular annotation we're at web
serve that so in order to write a
servlet the first thing that we need to
do is of course extend HTTP servlet
class which we did when we you know use
the wizard to generate the servlet but
then after that you need to have this
web server let ant ation this website
annotation takes a lot of properties but
the one that we need to remember is this
URL patterns description is just you
know it just makes it easier to document
what this does you can you can write a
nice any descriptive value here URL
patterns is the key this del storm-cat
that whenever an axis of slash simple
servlet comes to this application then
executes this class so basically this is
how it works you type HTTP localhost
colon 8080 then you get the tomcat
instance and then you see the tomcat
welcome page and after that you enter
the web application name which is simple
servlet project
you see the welcome page remember in the
previous tutorial we configured the
welcome file which is basically if you
don't have any particular resource which
is accessed in the web the call then
what is the resource that Tomcat needs
to display so that's what we're doing
here we are not we are not mentioning
any particular resource or Tom gate goes
to the Welcome file list and finds one
that's available and it just renders
that so that is this one so we are
actually rendering index dot HTML here
now after this if I call this servlet
then Tomcat knows that this is the
servlet that needs to get generated
I mean executed and the default method
is the du gate so this method runs and
this is what gets printed in the
response of course you also have another
line of code here which prints to the
log files which we have already seen so
this is at a very high level you're
going to go a bit in depth and see how
you know the whole process goes again
we're going to go you're not going to go
into a complete depth but at a little
bit more detail
okay this is this is at a very high
level you have a browser here which you
are you know the client is using to
access the web application you have the
Tomcat instance and you have many web
applications deployed in this tomcat
instance now let's say the browser makes
a call with the particular URL the URL
tells Tomcat what needs to be done first
of all the name of the URL which is
localhost colon 8080 in our case you
know makes Tomcat to run pick up that
URL and execute now what happens is
Tomcat then creates two objects one is a
request object and one is a response
object the request object contains
details about the requests that the
browser made it could have query
parameters it could have post variables
so if there's there's a whole lot of
data that can go along with the HTTP
request well we'll get into the details
later but all that information gets
stored in this request object the
response object will currently not have
anything of significance this is meant
for the web application to process and
put the response back here so the Tomcat
can feed this response back to the
browser
now if Tomcat examines this request
object and of course it examines the URL
and based on the URL it identifies that
this particular web application needs to
run the simple sublet project again this
is based on the context root now once it
identifies the simple servlet project
then it goes to the web dot XML in this
simple servlet project or it looks at
the annotations that have been
configured in this simple servlet
project and it identifies which servlet
needs to be run this is something that
we've already seen based on the you know
the the part of the URL after the web
application so that part is going to
give Tomcat a clue as to which sublet
needs to be run it it references this
with the web dot XML or the annotations
and it identifies the servlet now in
this case it is a simple servlet now it
executes this simple servlet now in
order to execute this what it does is it
these two objects to the simple servlet
now simple servlet takes a request
object and it gets the input parameters
in our example it's a well it's a simple
servlet it doesn't do much so it doesn't
really look at the request object but
it's there if you want when you're
writing the servlet code you can pick up
this request object and examine the
contents to see more details about the
request itself now the simple servlet
objects picks up this data does the
processing and then publishes its result
to the response object so if you're if
you're generating HTML code then the
HTML code goes to the response object it
you can pretty much write anything you
want and it will get generated in the
response now this is something that we
have done in our simple servlet we have
taken the response object we've got the
print writer from the response object by
using the get writer method and then in
the get writer method we have entered
some text now this text will sit in the
response object and now what Tomcat does
is it takes the response object and
renders it as HTML back to the browser
and that's how the browser sees what the
simple servlet had rendered so well
we'll go back to the do get method here
so the do gate method takes two
parameters one is a request and one is a
response as we have seen so the request
is actually a httpservletrequest object
and the response is actually a HTTP
httpservletresponse object now we are
printing into the response objects right
printwriter method and this is the text
that gets rendered now let's say I want
I want to change the way this is
accessed now I don't want this to be
simple servlet I want this to be called
advanced serve let's see
now if I execute this Tomcat does not
find a servlet in this application which
has this particular annotation we have
only one servlet which has annotation of
URL pattern a simple servlet so it does
not find anything with advance of let
now view and access this you obviously
get a four not four which means that
Tomcat doesn't know what to do doesn't
find a simple advance servlet it says
requested resource is not available so
in order to make this work and in order
to make simple servlet get executed when
you call the advanced sublet URL all you
need to do is change this particular URL
pattern I'm going to call this advanced
sublet and save now it's going to reload
the servlet we have done in order to
reload number if I access this the same
method the Duquette is getting executed
but the URL is different so by simply
changing the annotation you can you can
trap different requests so you can say
what is the exact name of the URL that
should trigger the execution of the
servlet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
