factory function this is a service
function does I have to create a factory
in angular and this is how you create a
service in angular the question is which
one do you use they are more or less the
same how do you make that decision over
the period of the last couple of years I
think the pendulum is gonna run to and
fro between factory and services some
people have recommended factories some
people have recommended services but at
this point of time with angular 2
released my recommendation for angular 1
development would be to always use this
service pattern because this kind of
ties in closely with the new class model
that angular 2 is using right so if
you're writing angular 1 code with the
intention of migrating to angular 2 it
makes it a little bit more easier to
have the constructor functions rather
than have factory functions so if you
can't do away with it better to create a
service and notice that I'm not really
saying this because you save two lines
of code because this is pretty
insignificant the difference though is
that having this be a constructor means
that you can create classes in the
future to plugin do this service api and
classes are a new javascript construct a
newer version of javascript and also if
you're using typescript or anything like
that and they are going to be mainstream
in the future you know using a lot of
classes in the future in javascript so
this kind of paves the way for using
classes and you know if you know that
either of them work you should use the
service second question was the
difference that we already covered the
difference Factory is a simple function
execution service is function execution
and constructor mode so the way you
write those functions differ in the case
of a factory you initialize the object
populated and you return and in the case
of the service you don't initialize the
object you are given it by using the
this reference so you populated this
reference and then finally you don't
return it as well the this reference is
returned for you okay now the final
question when would we need to use a
factory versus a service I told you that
services have recommended approach right
you should always use services when you
care
what are the scenarios where you cannot
use a service and you have to rely on
the factory can we just forget about the
factory well not entirely there are
certain scenarios where you would need
the factory and the service would not do
now what are those scenarios think about
you look at these two functions it is a
factory function and this is the service
function think about which function you
have more control over which function
which approach gives you more control
let me make this remove this comment
because this doesn't actually exist are
you looking at these two functions which
functioned you have more control then
you actually have more control in this
one right because you are utilizing the
object and you are returning it here in
the case of the service function since
it's causing constructor mode you have
no option but they use the distance and
the distance is what's it return right
you don't have an option of returning an
object you are not expected to return an
object rather and this is it this
reference it gets returned so there are
things you can return in the factory
function that you cannot return in the
service function let's say I want to
return the value five what's gonna
happen when the factory gets executed
angular is gonna execute this it's gonna
do all this stuff which is really in
vain and I'm returning the number five
so AppData factory service is gonna be
five right to value Phi the number can I
do something like this with the
constructor service I need a service
function I cannot because the assumption
is that this always returns an object
because it is returning that this
reference so you would want to use the
service approach when you're returning
an object but if you need to return
something like a primitive or something
that's not an object service will not do
right is this always returns an object
so this is really the reason why you
would want to use a factory over a
service you can use the factory to
return a number you can return a
function you can do it on anything you
want right you have complete control
over what you initialize and what you
return however in the case of a service
service you are forced to return an
object and you have to use the
dystrophies to populate the object
so if you need to return an object use a
constructor if you need to return
anything other than an object like maybe
a function or primitive you use the
factory approach so hopefully that made
sense but for the most part again the
recommendation and the best practice is
to use a service because most of the
times you would be returning an object
and other primitive or a function</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
