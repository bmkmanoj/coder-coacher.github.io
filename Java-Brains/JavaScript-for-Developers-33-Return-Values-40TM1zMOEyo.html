that's something common any function
that does some calculations would
probably have a value that the caller is
interested in so you have to send it
back the way to send back a value is
using the return keyword okay so return
can send any value it can send a string
can send the number an object would be
anything so let's say I returned back
the string rather than just print it in
the console I'm going to remove the
console that log and then I'd return the
string instead all right now I can
assign the return value to a variable
again this shouldn't be a surprise a lot
of languages do this or return value
equals say hello okay I'm going to get
rid of 42 because it's not required all
right so now what's going to happen is
when the JavaScript interpreter runs it
goes through these lines says okay I got
the function registered it's going to
move on to line seven line seven it's
going to say okay the right hand side is
a function execution so it pulls up the
function that was registered and then it
executes it so the execution says hey
return this value so it's going to hold
on to that value and assign it to the
left hand side which is the return value
so if I were to run this nothing happens
because well nothing is printed of the
console but something does happen which
is the value gets assigned to the return
value variable okay but we are not
printing it now if I were to examine the
return value variable you see the value
gets printed return can have multiple
data types like I said can have string
or object or whatever could be assigned
to a variable you can also have an empty
return if I were to do this and don't
return anything then the return value
will be can guess to be undefined yes so
if I don't return anything from a
function but I'm calling a function and
assigning the return value to a variable
that
is going to be undefined because a
function which does not explicitly
return a value is going to return an
undefined value okay so if you have
something like this just return without
specifying the value or you don't have
anything here it was kind of like the
console data log that I had before right
so the first thing that we did was we
did a console that log of something this
function doesn't have an explicit return
statement but even this returns
undefined so you either return an
explicit value in which case that but
that's what gets returned our it returns
undefined</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
