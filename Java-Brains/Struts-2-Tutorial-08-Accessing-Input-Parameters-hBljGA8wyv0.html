stretch to what we learned so far we've
learned about the value stack and how we
can transfer data from an action class
through the JSP we have learned how the
action object gets stored on the value
stack and how the value stack behaves as
a virtual object that exposes all the
member variables of the action object
and we've also learned how the struts
tags accesses those member variables and
that's the way you can display those
member variables in the JSP so what
we're going to learn in this session is
the data transfer between the input
request and the action class we want to
understand how the input parameters work
so how can a client pass input
parameters into the action class and
that's going to be the focus of this
tutorial well take a look at our
application that we wrote in the
previous few tutorials we wrote a
tutorial finder that has a tutorial
action and we have a get best tutorial
let me open up the start eczema so we
have a get tutorial that gives us the
best tutorial and we call a business
service over here get best tutorial side
and then that business service is
actually returning a hard-coded string
and this scenario which is Java brings
now here's the thing no matter who makes
this request we get a standard response
right we get the same business service
that gets executed it does not really
take any parameters it just returns a
standard response so this response is
fine for somebody who is a Java
programmer but let's say a dartnet
program or a Ruby programmer comes in
access to this website we are still
going to return Java brains and that's
of no help to them they want to see what
is the best tutorial website for their
you know area of expertise their
language that they are interested in so
how do we accept an input parameter
and have a different response based on
the input parameter how would it work in
the case of savage we have get requests
and post requests right we have
parameters for the get request and
parameters for the post request that's
how a parameter gets into an a sublet
method and then we can tap into those
parameters and act accordingly now how
would we do that in the case of an
action notice here that the the
equivalent of a do gate or do post in
the struts to world is this executes
right we have the business of a scales
made over here so this is where you
write code to handle requests notice
that this does not really take any
parameters so there has to be another
way of transferring input parameters to
the action class this method
specifically needs to have access to the
input parameters that get executed that
get passed so let me run this thing over
here I'll say run as run on server
because this default URL does not work
okay so this is the this is the URL that
we have mapped and then we get a
standard response what I want to do is
have a parameter so I can have a
language equals Java and then it returns
me a Java tutorial website and I can
have a language equals dotnet and it
returns me a dotnet tutorial website so
this is the intention so how do I
capture this value inside this execute
method that's the question so the way we
can do that in struts is to again expose
a member variable of the action and
expose getters and setters for that so
let's say you want a parameter coil
bang I can have a member variable for
this action that accepts that input
value so I will have a private string
language and I can generate getters and
setters for language okay so I have
exposed this value over here now I need
to find a way to pass that value
this.value into this language well guess
what we don't really have to find a way
because this is automatically done we'll
just see how it works and then we'll get
back to how you know who and what and
when that's happening so I'll just
change this to language so that the
input parameter matches the member
variable and guess what it automatically
gets the value we can test that out by
just doing a this out over here gate
language and that should get printed
save this let this do a read apply and
now let me access this again guess what
darknet is printed so this parameter
that I'm passing over here is actually
accessible in the action class just by
having a member variable in the action
class of that same name now how does
this work
well the secret is actually in one
component that we saw but we really
didn't provide too much about let me go
back to the high-level picture of our
starts to application ok so this is the
picture of a stretch to application we
saw in our initial tutorial it was like
the second tutorial so in this picture
we have we have seen the stretch XML
we've seen the action classes the
business server is the JSP and the tags
but we haven't really talked about the
interceptors so the interceptors is what
is doing this work of transferring the
input parameters to the action member
variables
and the way dessert is very similar to
how the tag library's accessed the
member variables in the action which was
through the value stack so if you
recollect the action instance with the
member variables are saved on the value
stack for every request and the action
does its processing and it stores the
member variables over here the output
over here and then the JSP would access
those member variables by referring to
the value stack directly we learned this
in a previous tutorial and this is how
data transfers from the action to the
JSP the input parameter transfer is also
in a very similar fashion so what's
happening is the Interceptor does the
same thing but then it does that before
the action processing is started so what
happens is whenever there is a new
request again as usual the action
instance is saved with the member
variables there might not be any value
in the output member variables but we do
have some input member variables also
that needs to be filled like the
language in our example so the language
will also be a member variable over here
but what happens is the interceptors
will save the input language we added an
input of dotnet or Java or whatever it
is so that value gets saved to the
language member variable over here and
then the action does its processing it
accesses this value does the processing
gets the output and then saves it into
the output member variables and then the
JSP accesses those output values and
then prints it to the output so I hope
this flow is clear now so if we head
back to our application so here whatever
input value we enter will be picked up
by the Interceptor and since we have an
instance of the action in the value
stack it's going to set that value to
the member variable of this action so
it's going to write to the instance in
the value stack and then this will end
up having the value so by the time the
execute method is run
this value will be there in the language
meant the variable and that's how this
gets printed so whatever value we enter
here is going to be available to the
action class so now that we have this
value it's easy to pass this along to
the business service so if you want to
have a business service that expects an
input value over here so let's say I
have a string string language so I can
have you know if language dot equals R
let's say Java then read it on Java
brains and else we return language not
supported yet because I don't really
know any other tutorial websites for
dotnet at this point of time so let me
just close this here okay so now we have
a business service that listens to the
input value and then returns a value
accordingly so you could have
complicated processing here that you
know checks the database that searches
whatever you want because you have this
input value let me save this and pass on
that value over here to this one we
don't need this this out so I'll save
this one as well and let's treat apply
now if I pass in Java
oops
yeah here you go it returns Java brains
but then if I pass in any other language
Atta turns language not supported yet so
this is a very primitive way of getting
the input parameters but then I hope
they'll flow make sense
it's the Interceptor that's actually
saving this value we don't know what
Interceptor yet there are multiple
interceptors we're going to come to that
in the different tutorial but what you
need to understand is in order to pass
the value all you need to do is expose a
member variable getters and setters and
then have the same name as the parameter
that you need to capture and this
happens automatically you don't have to
you know you don't have to get the value
itself this you can expect that the
value will be saved to your member
variable and you can just pick that up
like I'm doing here and do whatever
processing you want so we're going to
look at a few more ways to access input
parameters in the subsequent tutorials
but I hope the way the value stack is
handy both for input as well as for
output that I hope that concept is clear
so see you in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
