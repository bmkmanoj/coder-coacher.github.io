there are two words here spring and boot
the first part spring is something must
be familiar with it's the spring
framework it's a framework which lets
you write Enterprise Java applications
it's a huge framework it does a lot of
stuff and I'm not going to go into the
detail again like I said it's kind of a
prerequisite for this course you should
at least have some basic familiarity
with the spring framework boot is
bootstrap spring boot is something that
lets you bootstrap a spring application
from the scratch and that's how it gets
its name spring boot here is the
official definition on the spring dot IO
website spring boot makes it easy to
create standalone production grade
spring based applications that you can
just run there are a lot of key elements
here so I'm going to break that down the
first important thing that I want you to
take away is that spring wood makes it
easy to create standalone production
grade spring based applications so the
key here is creating spring based
applications spring wood is a tool which
lets you create spring based
applications what do these spring based
applications look like that spring boot
creates for us it's standalone it runs
on its own its production grade so again
it's not the hello world application you
have something that you can actually
deploy prod and it is something that you
can just run this is very important
because if you have spent time creating
a spring application without using
spring boot you'll understand the pain
of having to do a lot of stuff to get to
the point for easier on it there are a
lot of configuration steps that you can
have to do a lot of charge you need to
import a whole lot of stuff to do and
only then you get to a point where you
actually run it and see it in action
but let's bring wood that's no longer
the case you have an easy way to create
a spring application that just runs with
very little effort so that's the promise
of spring boot we'll try that out and
see if it really fulfills that promise
now to really get spring boot again like
I said you need to have an understanding
of
ringing itself now what is spring</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
