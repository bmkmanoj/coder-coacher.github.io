looked at a couple of videos ago and
this is a function which constructs a
bicycle instance this clearly is meant
to be called in a constructor mode using
the new keyword because it's using the
reference test and then here is an
execution of that function in the
constructor more by using the new
keyword and now we have a new bicycle
instance with the cadence speed and the
care being these values what I'm also
going to do is add another property
called tire pressure and I'm going to
populate the this reference let the
value that gets passed in which is the
tire pressure so I can pass in a tire
pressure over here and that gets
assigned to this property of the object
now if I were to reload and run I'm
going to get a bicycle instance which
contains those properties now what I
want to do is add a method on this
bicycle instance which lets you increase
the tire pressure so I'm going to call
this method inflate tires and I'm going
to have this would be a reference up to
this because I want to be able to say
bicycle one tired inflate tires right
and when I call this I want the tire
pressure to increase by let's say three
okay and the way to do this to get make
this work is to have a property on the
object called inflate tires and have
that be a function so I am going to
create that property over here so I'm
going to say if they tires is a function
which basically takes this tire pressure
value of this object and increase it now
how do I get hold off the instance of
this bicycle object on which I'm calling
the inflate tires so you remember when
this kind of an execution happens when
I'm calling a function on an object we
are basically looking at method to write
a function is being executed in an
object's context and now then the
function is called like this you know
that the this reference in this
is going to point to bicycle one which
is really handy because that's the
object whilst i pressure we want to
inflate so that's perfect now all I have
to do is this dot type pressure plus
equals three and now I have increased
the dye pressure off that particular
object by three and now if I were to
execute this we load and run and if I
access bicycle one again you notice that
the tire pressure has increased to
twenty eight and of course there is
property called inflate tires which
happens to be a function which is just
fine we have what we need we were able
to inflate the tires for this particular
bicycle and this works for multiple
objects is well if I have another object
here which is bicycle two and this has
the tire pressure of thirty and if I
were to say bicycle - darling plate
tires then you can see that it is going
to inflate the tire far bicycle to lower
because the this in this case when it's
calling this function that this refers
to bicycle - so when it can use a tire
pressure plus equals three that
particular typewriter gets inflated no
reload and run and if I access bicycle
to the tire pressure is 33 which is
starting with 30 and one method call to
inflate tires which increase temperature
by three so this is a handy way in which
we can use the current concept of the
dis reference pointing to the object
itself in your adding methods to an
object and have it access its own
properties this is very handy but now
let's say I want to get this
functionality out so this inflate tires
there's a handy function let's say this
is a super complicated function that
somebody else is written and I don't
want this to be a part of the bicycle
alone right so let's say I have an
object which is a bicycle mechanic and I
want the bicycle mechanic to also be
able to inflate tires for any bicycle
that's handed to him or her so I want to
basically take this inflate tires
function to get outside the context of
the bicycle
have it be a part of another object so
when I do that things get a little bit
tricky let me explain why in the next
video
before we move on there's an important
distinction that I want to point out
each function could have a different
distance even though there is one
function inside another function so if
you look at the code here there's one
top-level function which is what the
constructor is right it's being called
in the constructor mode and then there
is an inner function which is not being
called in constructor more so since
there are two functions it's possible
for the distance of those two functions
to be different and they actually are
that this reference of the constructor
function is the new object that gets
created when the function is called and
constructor 1 whereas the this reference
of the inflate tires function is what
the object is on whose property the
inflate tires is being caught right so I
just want you to understand that there
are two different functions here which
are being called in different ways what
is being called is a constructor
function another is being called as a
property of an object so it makes sense
that the distance for these two
functions are different even though one
of them is inside another so that this
reference in the outer function is
different from the distance in the
inflate tires function it's very
important for you to remember that every
function could have a different this
reference just because there is one
function inside another doesn't mean
that the distance is the same so
hopefully that made sense see in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
