exception handling in lambdas and
however you need to catch exceptions in
lambda most of the things that we can be
talking is obvious but I'm going to talk
about a strategy that you can use to
handle exceptions in some of your lambda
expressions so I'm going to create a new
class here and call this exception
exception handling example and this is
going to have a main method now what I'm
going to do is create a lambda here
which X in an array of integers and a
key which is an integer and do a
mathematical operation for each element
in that array given a key let me explain
so let's say I have an integer array
let's say some numbers and I'm going to
initialize it to a bunch of numbers what
I'm also going to have is key let's call
it 2 now what I'm going to do is do a
process method I need to write this
process method which takes in some
numbers just this array it also takes in
a key and then I want to write a lambda
expression here which is basically the
expression that I want to apply this key
to for each of these numbers so I want
this process method to loop through
these numbers and for each of those
numbers I want to apply the key what is
that application it is this lambda
expression I want whatever is this
lambda expression to be performed with
each of the numbers here and the key now
let's say I want to add the key to each
of these numbers and print that to the
console we get rid of this thing here
and create the static method first I'm
going to loop through this list of this
array of some numbers let's say for
let's say I want to print each element
add it to the key alright so this system
let's say I plus
key now the output of this should be
fairly obvious this is going to print
the addition of those individual numbers
with the key itself but this is what I
want to convert to alarmed expression I
don't want this process method to do
just one thing I want it to be able to
process any mathematical operation that
I pass into it so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to pass a lambda so the
lambda will be something that takes in
two arguments two integers and it
doesn't do anything so we've already
seen that there is an interface called
by consumer so let's say I take my
consumer as an argument which takes in
two integers I need to use the Box type
for integer because we need to do that
for generics in Java I'm going to say
consumer here and let me import by
consumer now what I want to do is apply
the consumer which is the lambda that's
fasted well here doll except she takes
in two arguments the first one is the
element in the array the second one is
the key so now I can pass in the lambda
which does that print so what would the
lambda be it's something that takes in
two arguments which is the value and the
key and what it does is system dot out
dot println value plus key let's run
this and make sure the same thing is
returned now I can change this behavior
do let's say a slash and I'm doing a
divide so if I were to run this I'm
going to get an integer division now
let's introduce a scenario where there
is an exception of what if let's say the
key is zero now what's going to happen
I'm going to get an exception an
arithmetic exception divided by zero now
how do I catch this exception and where
do I catch this exception
I guess the how is simple you just need
to do a try-catch plot like we have been
doing in Java for a long time now where
do you catch the exception
one very obvious answer is you catch the
exception over here when you're doing a
consumer diet set right now this is
taking in a consumer which is an
operation now this operation is what's
failing right and I'm doing a consumer
door except I'm executing the operation
the lambda that's passed in and that's
throwing an exception because I'm doing
a divided by zero here so I could do
this I could say try here and then put
this inside a try and then I do a catch
and what I'm doing is arithmetic
exception e and then now here I can do
whatever I want here only exception but
now arithmetic exception is happening
because what we are doing here is this V
/ key but you don't know what's the
input that's going to get passed and
this might be a completely different
operation and a thematic exception
doesn't even apply maybe there is some
other exception maybe another runtime
exception or a nullpointerexception that
you need to handle so does that mean
that this is going to have a long list
of cache blocks that doesn't seem right
because the process method doesn't
really know what this operation is so
this exception that you're catching is
very specific to that operation so it's
obvious that you don't want to handle
that over here we want whoever is
passing in that lambda to handle that
operation so here's another thing we
could do I'm going to remove this try we
want this to be fairly light right we
don't want this process block to be
worrying about what exception could be
handle and then handling all those
exceptions that could be passed in over
here it's not the right way to handle
that responsibility we could say well
the lambda could handle that exception
so if I were to add a try-catch over
here that would mean it's no longer a
single line I need to have a a braces
here so let me move this inside the
braces here what I'm going to do is I'm
going to have a try and let's say I'm
going to have a
system dot out dot println an exception
happen or let me say an error it dick
exception happen all right
we are swallowing the exception here so
that there is really nothing printed on
the console for example they should do
but you can handle it in a different way
over here now refer to execute this you
can see that it's printing out the
message and it's not showing the stack
trace which is good but now look at that
lambda it was so neat and small and easy
to read now this is a mess I have a
try-catch over here and it doesn't look
as elegant as it did before
so this is also not a good idea</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
