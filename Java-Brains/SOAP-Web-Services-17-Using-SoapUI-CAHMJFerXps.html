so far when we have been testing our web
services that we've deployed
last fish we have been using this tester
page and this page is courtesy of
GlassFish all we need to do is use the
service name URL question mark tester
and GlassFish provides us with this nice
HTML page which actually looks at your
web servers and then identifies what are
the methods whether the input arguments
in all that end creates nice forms right
into this shop info service has a good
shop info operation which takes in an
input so it's actually created a text
box and a button and when I enter an
input here it actually makes a call to
the web service and then it shows us the
soap request and the soap response right
and it also gives some Java specific
information so this is handy when we are
testing our web services that we have to
plot in GlassFish but if we need to test
an external web service for maybe as you
know as web service that we deployed in
another server this tester page will not
be available right we will need to find
another way to test our web service so
there are a lot of tools in the market
which let us test soap web services it
let us make this kind of a soap request
and it lets us examine these kind of a
soap response so one such tool that I'm
going to be talking about in this
tutorial is called soap UI soap UI is
very widely used by a lot of QA
professionals you access it at soap UI
dot org this is an open source - it also
has a commercial offering called soap UI
Pro but you see here there is a download
soap UI so this is open source and it's
free so we can we can use this to test
our soap web services we have a download
button over here which gives us the
installation depending on your operating
system it's a standard installation
procedure to just extract or install and
all that and you have an executable on
your desktop another way to use the
stool the soap UI - is as a plugin
inside of Eclipse you can choose to do
either you can choose to download a
separate program and run it or you can
choose to have it running inside of
Eclipse once you have it up and running
the functionality is the same if you can
do pretty much the same things in
the standalone program and the plugin
for this tutorial I'm going to
demonstrate how to run it inside of
Eclipse
as with any Eclipse plug-in to install
it go to the help and install new
software here you can choose the site
where you have the plug-in available and
then once you enter the site you can see
the plugins that are available at that
site so we need to find out where soap I
plug in this made available so we have
the space over here which gives us
information about the soap UI Eclipse
plug-in it's again on so Pio argh so it
has instructions like it says here you
go to help install new software and in
the work with field you enter this URL
so basically this is the URL where the
Superboy plug-in is made available so
I'm going to click Add I'm going to
create new URL where I can keep the
plug-in from okay now in this URL it's
actually looking at the available
plugins and there you go there is soap
UI so I'm going to check this hit next
next accept the terms and I click finish
and that's it now Eclipse is going to
download and install the plug-in and
after the 85 megabyte download here's a
warning that says that I'm trying to
install software with which has unsigned
content I just hit OK and now I'll need
to restart eclipse I'm going to go ahead
and do that
and here is my Eclipse restarted after
the installation now what I can do is go
to the window menu show view other and
search for soap you are here so you see
there are two new views that are added
by the plug-in so one is a navigator and
one is the logs I'm going to choose
navigator here and hit OK
and here's the sopl navigate a tab I'm
going to move this to the left
and here we have projects optional here
we don't have any projects because it
will just open it but we're going to
create a project which lets us send soap
requests and we can see the soap
response from the web service of our
choice
so before I start to create a new
project let's take a minute and think
about what such a tool would need to do
right so let's say you know instead of
soap you I love you you had to write
your own - what would you need to do to
have a tool with send soap requests and
receives soap response now let's say we
have a web service and you want to test
this web service so you have to have a
client and this client could be a Java
client we've already done our WS import
before right we got a whistle with the
WS import generated the stubs and then
created the client so all that would
work right it would make a call to the
web service send a soap request but if
you want something a bit more generic if
you don't want to strictly call a single
web service you want to write a Kline
which can call any web service you want
to be able to send a soap request and
then whatever response it returns you
just want to be able to see the eczema
right it's fairly straightforward and
actually that's what soap UI or any of
these other tools does as well so
essentially the client is actually
making an HTTP call we know that the web
service that we have been writing ID
we've written the test Mart web services
they have all been accepting requests
over HTTP so in that sense it's no
different from any of the other web
requests that we make even for web
applications because that happens to be
HTTP as well now what's special about
this web service call in that case well
the difference is even though this is
HTTP what's happening is the soap
request that's going is actually is
being sent as the post body it's
actually making a post request and in
the post body we have the soap request
why do we know that it takes a
we have kind of glimpsed at the
structure we haven't gone into the
details of the soap message yet but we
know that it's XML so with any web
service call you are sending an XML as a
post body and then making an HTTP call
so that's all there is to web services
ladies and gentlemen all these fancy
terminologies it just boils down to
making a post request with an XML body
but anyway that's the thing about the
soap technology is you have all these
standards right you want to make sure
that people follow strict standards when
they send an XML because we need to be
sure that whatever web servers you're
calling actually understands the XML
right so that's the reason why we have
all these standards all these
terminologies and all that but at the
very basic we just have an HTTP request
with the post party containing the XML
so that's all we need to do right we
don't need a special you know a special
sign we have browser plugins that lets
us tweak the post body when you send an
HTTP request so that should do as well
you know you just make any post request
with an XML and you can make a web
service call it's as simple as that but
what these are testing tools like sopia
helps us do is to construct this XML for
us so we give it the visited and it
gives us the XML and saying hey I read
the visit oh and I know that you want to
make this web service call this is the
XML that we need to use because that's
what the visited says so instead of
typing the XML yourselves I'm going to
provide you with the XML
just fill in the blanks and then submit
right so that's all the testing client
would ideally need to do so once you
send the request the response is again
over HTTP and it is the XML again which
is the soap response so this is in
summary what any soap client would need
to do so that's what soap UI does as
well
so back to our soap UI plugin now we can
create a new project which lets us send
soap requests so I'm going to right
click here and say new soap UI project
I'm going to call this soap client and
now I need to give the initial list
location we know that the visit of for
our
application let me choose this sharpen
flow service so the Vista is available
over here so I'm going to copy this URL
and I'll provide that over here so I'm
giving the location off the wisdom and
there are some options over here it you
know I can create sample requests for
all the operations I will show what that
means in just a minute there are a few
other stuff like creating test Suites
and mock servers and all that we are not
really ready to put that at this point
of time but they're actually handy if
you want to create some standard test
cases that you want to run you know
multiple scenarios with but for now I
just want a sample request so I just
have this checked and I press ok now
what's OPI is going to do is it's going
to look at the Vistal it's going to
identify the operations and it's going
to create a sample request for each of
the operations so there is a gate sharp
info operation we already know that in
the wisdom so it has actually created a
request for this operation so there is
kit shop info and it is created request
one now what does this request contain
if I double click this you see there is
actually a sample XML so this XML is
something that soap UI generates after
looking at the Vistal so it knows that
for anybody to call this gate shop info
the request has to be in this specific
format so it's actually created that
it's created a soap message and it has
this one value over here with a question
mark so what this means is this is a
value that we need to pass in the
GlassFish tester page you remember there
was a text box so this is the equivalent
of that text box instead of providing
the UI text box what it does creates a
question mark inside the request where I
can actually fill in the information
that I want to send so I can actually
send the same parameter since right so I
want to know since when the shop was
open so that was the scenario now I can
actually submit this soap request and
the way I do that is by hitting this
play button and I hit this here you see
I get a soap response so this is
Dean and eczema and I'm getting the get
shop info response element and then the
return value is since 2012 which is as
expected now I can actually send a wrong
information I actually check the fault
so remember this was a problem earlier
we had not gotten the right fault
message when we sent an incorrect value
we had created the exception in our
service but we didn't actually see that
fault message so let's try that out so
I'm going to provide some incorrect
input and if I run this here you go we
get the fault message so there is a s :
fault and we have a fault code and the
fault string is invalid input and then
we have the invalid input exception
element over here with the fault info
and the message being things that we
construct in the server side so this is
a pretty handy tool we can send
different soap requests it directly in
XML format and see the response also
directly in XML format and this tool
actually has a lot of features we are
just scratching the surface here like I
said this is used in a lot of QA related
activity when we need to test web
services we are just looking at the most
basic feature that this tool provides
which is where you're not sending a soap
request on getting a soap response it
has a lot of other stuff which I would
definitely encourage you to explore but
this is very useful if you don't want to
be tied to the GlassFish tester page and
of course this does not have the
exception limitation that we have seen
in the GlassFish tester page so think of
this as just another tool in your
toolbox when you're testing Web Services
kind of like a replacement for the
GlassFish tester page when you do want
to use that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
