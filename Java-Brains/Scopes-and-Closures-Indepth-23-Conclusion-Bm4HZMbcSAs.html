course JavaScript scopes and closures in
debt we started this course by
understanding what scopes are and how
JavaScript creates scopes by using
function scoping we learned how to use
the concept of function scoping to scope
our variables using the construct called
iffy which is immediately invoked
function expressions you also learn
about the difference between the read
operations and the write operations in
JavaScript and how an undeclared
variable manifests with different
behavior in the read versus the right
and we also understood this problem of
the global scope in JavaScript and how
to prevent a typo unavailable from
creating global variables and
necessarily well we also learn about
hoisting in JavaScript which is a
feature that the JavaScript engine has
out of the box and we learned how to use
strict mode to prevent some of the
problems that local variables then we
learned what closures are we looked at a
few pieces of code and understood how
closures affect the execution of the
code and we looked at a few patterns
like the module pattern and also how
closures affect async programming but
this hopefully you have enough
information to debug and troubleshoot
scopes and closure related problems in
your JavaScript code as well as fuse
these concepts to write code which is
more elegant and more easy to read and
understand so I hope this course was
helpful again you've been watching
scopes and closures in depth thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
