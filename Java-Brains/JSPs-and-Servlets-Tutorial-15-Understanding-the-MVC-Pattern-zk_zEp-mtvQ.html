about the MVC pattern and how to
implement them we see pattern in our web
application using servlets and jsps MVC
actually stands for Model View and
controller and it's a front-end design
pattern that is useful for designing web
applications so we're going to look at
what MVC is and how we can actually
implement the MVC pattern a good analogy
that I normally use when I explain MVC
nice to think of you know the experience
that you would get when you're in a
restaurant in a typical restaurant we'd
have these three roles as employees
would be working in that restaurant the
first one is a waiter whom we all know
he or she is the person who waits at our
tables and collects our order the second
role is that of the cook who actually
cooks the dish that we order and the
third role is that of a presenter this
is something that you've seen the more
fancy restaurants they actually decorate
the food and make it presentable now
let's see how these three roles work
with each other let's say we are in a
restaurant where we have employees which
who belong to you know either the
greater role or the cook role or the
presenter role so let's see how they
work with each other now let's see here
at the table and you order something out
of the menu now your order will be
collected by the waiter and of the
waiter is not the person who actually
prepares the dish the waiter passes on
your order to the cook the cook prepares
the dish and the cook is not variable
with you order came from so all the
cookware is about us to make the dish
and have it ready and available now
after the cook cooks the dish then the
you know the food is passed back to the
later
now the waiter takes this dish the cook
dish to the presenter the job is the
presenter is to actually make the cooked
food
look more appealing so they add things
organize things in a way that it looks
really good on the table so after the
presenter is done with
you know their work the food is passed
back to their actual person was ordered
the dish now this is actually an Emmy
see pattern but we have the model the
view and the controller rules all being
performed here you know before we try to
map this to MVC let's think about why we
have these three different roles right
we have the waiter role the cook role
and the presenter role the advantage of
having these three role separate is that
there's no there is no mixing of you
know the responsibilities there is
separation of concerns the waiter
doesn't have to know how to cook all the
deleted does is take orders and pass it
on to the right cook let's say we have
three cooks in the restaurant and each
cook specializes in a particular type of
dish now the waiter gets the order and
depending on the order he or she just
assumed the order to the right cook now
once the order goes to the cook the cook
doesn't worry about where the order is
coming from the cook doesn't know how to
take orders for example so although the
cook does is cook the dish and once the
dish is ready then food is passed back
to the waiter the waiter passes it to
the presenter now again there could be
different presenters depending on
different types of dishes in different
types of orders but the waiter knows
what who is the presenter was perfect
for the order that is being served right
now and food is passed on to the correct
right presenter the presenter again
there's not worry about how to take
orders or how to cook
although the presenter knows is to
actually present it in the proper form
you know in the proper way and once the
presentation is done the food is passed
on to the actual person was ordered now
this is actually the MVC pattern as I
told you now let's look at how it works
in a generic scenario so now let's say I
have the user and the user is actually
making a request to a web application or
a URL so the first person that takes
this request is the controller so this
is the see of the MVC the controller the
controller is actually the wiring behind
all this the controller knows where to
pass on the request what to do with the
request meant to send it back and all
that the controller analyzes the
requests and depending on the request
passes on the request to something
called as a business service now let's
say the request is to pull up all the
list of users in the system now the
controller does not know how to actually
pull up the list of users although the
controller knows is that there is
actually another object who specializes
in pulling up users from the system and
this object will probably have a method
saying you know get all users now what
the controller does is it calls this
method of the business over same
business service dot get all users and
now the business service is just
concerned about getting all the users
which it does and then once the list of
users is available it passes on the list
of users back to the controller now the
controller takes this list of users and
passes it on to what is called as a view
now the view specializes in rendering
this list of users in a proper format
that the user can actually consume now
once the viewer gets this data which the
business services passed on to the
controller and which is again passed on
to the view now once the view formats
all the data and makes it ready for
consumption it is passed on to the user
now what do we have here we have C which
is the controller and we have V which is
the view so what is the M the model the
model is actually the data that flows
through over here all along now we have
the request which goes to the controller
now the request is converted to actual
data which is the parameters of this
method you know say we have the gate all
users now you might want to get all
users of a particular department so the
department ID will probably be a
parameter to this business service
method which the controller will pass
and now the business service executes it
and returns the list of users this list
of users is passed to the view and then
again back to the user so this list of
users is what is the model here now we
don't actually have a block for it here
but basically the model is what is being
exchanged in between all these three
different boxes over here and then again
pass to the user before we go ahead with
actually implementing the MVC pattern we
look at some of the advantages of using
the MVC pattern we looked at one
advantage earlier there is separation of
concerns a waiter
while the debater has to know is to wait
tables and the meter doesn't have to
know how to cook the cook doesn't have
to know how to wait tables or to present
and the presenter doesn't have to know
how to eat tables and have to cook so
each role is specific to what they're
doing and there is complete separation
of concerns the second advantage is that
you can easily make changes say for
example let's say they're in the
restaurant we have three cooks right now
and the rest what happens to recruit a
fourth cook which is a who's a
speciality in a different type of food
now although the waiter has to know is
that there is this new cook and this is
the speciality so that when the
corresponding order comes the waiter
knows to pass on the order to the right
cook now the other cooks don't have to
worry about this new cook as well they
just do their job as it is and similarly
if you have a new presenter all that the
waiter has to do is to know what kind of
food needs to be sent to the new
presenter and the cooks don't have to
worry about what they need to do
different because they keep doing the
same work so we have we have these
different modules and these modules are
insulated to change when it comes to the
other roles so each module does its job
and then it's that it's the controller
the waiter here which wires the flow
across all these different modules of
the way we're going to implement it in
our web application is that the sublet
is going to be the controller so the
sublet is the the entity that's going to
get there
request from the user first and from the
servlet we pass on the requests to a
beam a beam will actually implement the
business service method and it will
return a response back to the servlet
now the sublet will pass on this
response to a JSP the JSP will be the
presenter or the view in this case so
the JSP will format the data in a way
that is that can be consumed by the user
and this JSP will show this data in HTML
format and HTML format will be passed on
to the user but there's one correction
that you might want to point out in this
analogy the presenter might not be the
person who's actually handing over the
food to the to the customer in the
restaurant the presenter might probably
just hand over the food back to the
waiter and then the waiter takes the
food to the table well this actually
depends on the way you implement MVC now
let's go with the assumption that the
presenters takes the food to the table
for now at least in our implementation
this is actually the view the view later
is actually a JSP and the JSP is
directly passed on it doesn't actually
go through the servlet and as you can
see here the JSP is actually sent back
to the user directly it does not go
through the servlet so let's go with
this assumption for now we could
implement an MVC pattern in a way that
the view actually goes back to the
controller and then the controller sends
the actual output to the user but let's
stick with this pattern for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
