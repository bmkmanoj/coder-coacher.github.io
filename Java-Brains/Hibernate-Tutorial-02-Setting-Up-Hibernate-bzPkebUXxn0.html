how to set up our development
environment to write code that uses the
hibernate framework so the first thing
that we need to do is to download the
binaries of the hibernate distribution
this will provide us the jar files which
are required in order to you know write
code and use the framework so we need to
download the jar files and add them into
our class path to download the jar files
head over to hibernate org slash
downloads you will have a link for the
release bundles download the latest
release bundle that you see here right
now it's 3.6 dot for final I'll be
downloading the zip file ok I've
downloaded and extracted the Cybernet
zip file into my Java folder and inside
this zip file you have the hibernate 3
dot jar which we need for using the
hibernate library and along with this
hibernate 3 dot jar this is also this
Lib folder the Lib folder contains the
jars that hibernate requires so since
we're using hibernate we also have to
include the dependencies of hibernate so
the just that we need essentially are
the you know the ones in this required
folder and we need this JPA jar I'll
talk about what JPA is later but know
that this required folder and the JPA
these contain the jobs that we need to
include along with this hibernate 3 dot
jar this is the main jar which has all
the binaries for hibernate now let's
open up a clips and start a new project
ok have eclipse open here I'll
right-click new project select Java
project we'll call this
first hibernate project leave everything
else as a default and I'll say Finnish
perspective now if that's okay I want to
leave the perspective as it is now first
thing I need to do here is to include
the jar files in the classpath the ones
that we have downloaded from the
hibernate website so in order to do that
I go to properties and the Java build
path the libraries tab so I need to add
I need to create a new library and add
it I'll be creating a library because
we'll be writing a lot of code with
hibernate and it's it's handy if we have
a library with all the required jars
bundled in it so that we don't have to
worry about adding the jars each and
every time we just hide the library so
let's say I had library and I'll select
use a library now I do not have any user
libraries so I'll sing you I'll call
this hibernate here make sure that you
don't select the system library checkbox
here should be a user library alone now
I have the hibernate library now I need
to add the jars the way to do that is to
click on the add jars and go to our
hibernate distribution the main jar is
the hibernate three dot jar so I will
add that first okay that's done next
what I'll do is I'll go to the Lib
folder and the ones in the required all
these are the mandatory dependencies of
hibernate that we'll have to add to
align all of them then again I dash in
the lip there is this folder called jpe
there will be one jar inside this JPA
folder this one we need to add we will
we'll understand what JP is a bit later
and then finally inside the lib folder
itself there is a folder called byte
code so I will use the Java access we
need to add one of these two I will
choose the Java assist here
and again this is something that we look
at later as to why we are adding the
char so now we have the hibernate
library set so I press ok I choose this
library to add to the class path now I
have hibernate here with all the
required jars let me expand this you can
probably pause this video and check to
make sure that you have all the jars in
your Eclipse library now before we start
writing code here there is another step
that we need to do which is installing
the database which is obvious we have
hibernate here which connects to
databases and we are working with
databases so so we need to have a
database in our development environment
so that we can configure hibernate to
connect to this database there were a
lot of free databases available I don't
want to talk about the steps involved in
installing a database because in that
case I would have to pick one and I
don't want to enforce a particular
choice of a database to the people who
are following this tutorial I happen to
have Postgres DB installed in my machine
so I'll be using Postgres in the
examples here but this is this is not
really necessary you can have any
database available and you can configure
hyper need to connect to that database
but when it comes to these examples in
this tutorial I'll be using Postgres
database if you want to follow along and
install Posterous database you can go to
the Postgres website they can just do a
Google search for Postgres and you'll be
directed to the download section where
you can download and install for free my
ghostess installer also came with this
cui tool that I can use to connect to
the database I have set the password as
password here but yeah it's a it's a
it's a database that's set up by default
I can create databases I can run queries
and all those things using this cui -
this will also be handy but then again
this is just a choice that I have mean
because I have used Postgres before
you're free to add you're free to
install any database of your liking
and you can follow along these tutorials
equally fine however depending on the
database that you choose you will have
to download the JDBC drivers for that
database so what's happening here is
that while heaven it provides a layer of
abstraction when it comes to the
database connections hibernate
internally is using JDBC to connect to
the database and depending on what
database that we using ever we are
configuring happening to connect to we
will have to supply hibernate with that
JDBC driver so that it can use that
driver to connect to the database so
since I am using Postgres here I will
need the Postgres JDBC driver if you're
using another database you can download
the JDBC driver for that if you don't
know how to download the driver just
just doing a google search for the
driver should help for example
Postgres JDBC driver gives me the direct
link I will download the type for driver
here so that you know I just have to add
the jar file and we are done so I have
actually downloaded the driver here
already all I need to do is add the jar
to the build path again so I go to the
libraries here and I say add external
jar and my Java folder I've downloaded
this JDBC driver so I just hide this jar
and say ok now this will help the
hibernate library to connect to our
database say you want to change the
hibernate configuration to another
database you will have to do two things
first thing of course to install the
database on a particular machine and
then the second thing is to provide the
you know the required JDBC driver for
that database we need to provide that to
hibernate
so that hibernate can connect to that
database so these are the steps that we
need to do in order to create a project
and use hibernate so this we are done
here we have what we have done is we
have downloaded
hibernate binaries and we have added a
library into our project and we have
also downloaded the JDBC driver for our
database and we have added that to the
project what I did not cover in the
tutorial is actually installing the
database you can pick database of your
choice and install it and supply the
corresponding driver to hibernate by
just adding that JDBC jar into your
Eclipse projects build path</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
