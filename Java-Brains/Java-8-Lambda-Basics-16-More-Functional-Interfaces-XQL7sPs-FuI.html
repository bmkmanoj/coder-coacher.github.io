example of the standard functional
interfaces that come out of the box with
Java I have made a little bit of a teen
up though I have created a package
called unit 1 which contains all the
unit 1 code and the code that I wrote in
the previous tutorial I put it in unit 2
so the unit 1 exercise solution is using
the condition and the unit 2 example is
using the predicate that I did in the
previous tutorial just for your
reference if you were to need the
earlier version now let's look at adding
one more standard functional interface
to this example you notice here that
this method is printing to the console
every time it does a system dot out dot
println off your person object now what
if you wanted to pass in the behavior
through a lambda expression so that
doesn't always print to the console it
does what you pass it right so you can
pass in a behavior and this performs
that behavior based on whatever behavior
you're passing in so this is kind of
perform conditionally rather than print
conditionally now what does this perform
it needs to perform a behavior that you
are passing in now you can pass and let
me actually go ahead and change the
other methods as well so let's don't
have compiled in eiders now I want to
pass in the system dot out dot print to
this example so what would the lambda
expression be we have to look at the
steps we would have to do to do this you
know what we have learned is we first
figure out what the lambda expression is
then create an interface and create a
method on that interface right so let's
say let's take this example perform
conditionally you have the people and
then the condition is it always perform
it the third argument should be what you
need to perform now what is the what is
the behavior we need to pass it we want
to pass in a system that out dot println
off whatever object you're passing in so
here it would be for a P you do system
dot out dot println off P now this is
the third argument to perform
conditionally so it has to do this so
you have to accept the third argument
here and
that instead of just doing system dot
out dot println what is this third
argument it's a lambda expression that
takes in something it takes in an
argument and it doesn't return anything
it's so wide okay now if you could of
course follow the steps create an
interface which has the you know the
public wide give it whatever method name
which takes in a person object that's
what we did in the previous unit but
let's see if we have some kind of an
out-of-the-box functional interface to
help us here I'm going to open the
Javadoc again and I know this so I can
tell you you might need a little bit of
familiarity of all these interfaces to
figure out which one to choose what I'm
going to choose is this thing called
consume or this is just what we need
it's a functional interface whose
function method is an accept of an
object it takes in a single input
argument and returns no results right so
this is perfect for what we need so I'm
going to use this now I'm going to use a
consumer far accepting that argument so
I'm going to say consumer off person
consumer and now rather than just print
to the console I'm going to say consumer
dot me of course imported so that my
autocomplete works this should have an
accent method now has an accept which
takes in a person which is going to be P
and the reason it takes in a person is
again similar to by this test works
because I have a generic interface here
now I can pass in just lambda expression
over here all right now this should work
seamlessly now the method itself does
not have logic to print this performs
any behavior you pass it because you're
passing in the consumer and the only
behavior you're passing in all these
three calls is to just print that object
so let's execute this and here you see
things still work like you'd expected to
and now since you have this behavior
passed and you can change this now for
let's say for this one right printing
all
the first name beginning with C let's
say I just want to print the first name
so I can change the lambda expression
that's passed to it so let's say I do a
P dot get first name now for the first
tool cause it's going to do a system dot
out dot println of P which is going to
call the two string but for the third
call it just prints the first name
because I'm passing it different
behavior let's execute this now here you
see for the previous ones it prints
everything but for the last two it just
prints the first name so what I'd
recommend you do is play around with
these things there are a lot of these
interfaces that to come out of the box
there are things which address all
combinations of input and output so we
have a by consumer which is similar to
the consumer that we've already seen but
rather than taking just one object it
takes in two objects so this is handy
when you're doing something with two
different objects there is also a buy
function which takes in two objects and
then returns one object so here you have
a generic of three types so it takes in
two inputs of two types and then it
returns something of the third type so
if you have a function which takes in
two separate objects and then does
something with that's some kind of a
processing and then returns a brand new
object well by function is the way to go
so I'm obviously not going to be
covering everything over here but I do
encourage you to check this out there
are a lot of examples of these things
available online for you to kind of try
out and see what are the different uses
for it but this is another shortcut that
Java 8 introduces you don't have to
create your interfaces if you do have a
need for a lambda expression you don't
find any of these interfaces that
address it well then you have to create
one but this is quite a list it
addresses a lot of the common scenarios
so you don't really need to create an
interface for them for the most part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
