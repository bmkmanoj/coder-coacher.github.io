spring boot QuickStart
this is going to be a quick stat
introduction to spring boot and how we
can use it to create spring applications
this course assumes no previous
knowledge of spring boot but it does
require some basic knowledge of the
spring framework itself Spring Framework
is actually an enterprise Java framework
which lets you write enterprises you
have applications and a spring boot is
basically a lis in which you can
bootstrap or quickly start up a simple
spring application I actually shouldn't
say simple you can actually build really
complex applications with springboard
and one of the main ideas behind
springboard is that you can actually
have an easy to start spring application
you can actually build it all the way to
prod and you can have an end-to-end
application which is production ready
that you can create in a matter of
seconds using springboard so it's it's
very exciting and spring good is
personally my favorite way of creating
spring applications if you were to come
to me and say hey Kashuk I need this
spring application created from the
scratch my go-to approach is using
spring boot to create it so that's why
I'm very excited about this course and I
hope you are too they're going to be
looking at spring boot and we're going
to be building an end to an application
using spring boot we're going to be
building an end to end restful api which
has like a controller and endpoint and
it connects to the database so it's the
whole is the whole end-to-end also I'm
really excited let's get started let's
