type the next type that we're going to
talk about in JavaScript is called null
null is another type in JavaScript which
contains just one possible value which
is not okay so that's the type system
with only one possible value it's kind
of like undefined in that sense so just
like undefined as a type for just one
value and define null as a type with
just one value null let me actually
demonstrate the undefined and null so
that you know how they look like so just
like you can have allocate values like
boolean and string you can allocate
values like undefined and null okay so
let's say I let me actually clear all
these things out say a VAR a and then I
do a console that log of a what is the
value that's going to get printed the
value is undefined
like I said until you define it until
you give a value to a variable it is
going to have the value undefined so if
I run this I get the old value this is
because it's holding on to the old value
so let me right click and choose reload
and run make sure you choose this when
you are changing the variable
declaration or something like that
because this when you don't do this
you're basically running statements one
after the other so it remembers the
previous state so in order to have a
clean context always of course was clear
this and then right-click and say reload
and run when I do that you get the
actual value which is undefined
he is undefined because I have variable
a and I have not defined it I haven't
given it a value okay now I can give it
a value and say a equals true or equals
false and now let me actually reload and
run again now we see a has the value of
false
now I could change the say K equals null
in which case and I do control that hit
log of a again
is going to have the value of null okay
so i've cleared out the value of a and
have made it as null I'm explicitly
saying that I want a to contain a non
value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
