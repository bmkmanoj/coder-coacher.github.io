coding is what's called big carat of
programming this is different from
imperative programming which is worth
the JavaScript be is let me explain what
this is declarative programming is where
you actually declare functionality and
then you use it right
declarative tells you what to do right
this is different from imperative
programming where you are actually
writing how to do it okay so angularjs
or documentation has a very good example
for this and hopefully if I explain this
you still make sense um think about how
you would send our text in an HTML right
you have some piece of text you put an
HTML code code for it right you have
your dibs or paragraphs or whatever and
you want to Center it how do you do that
one way to do this is using imperative
programming where you're actually
writing the steps to Center the HTML
right you can say okay I'm going to
figure out the width of the browser
right okay this is the amount and I'm
going to figure out the width off the
HTML element that you need to Center
which is a paragraph right I'm going to
divide the width of the browser back to
so you get the exact middle you can
divide the width of the paragraph by two
so you get the exact middle and then I
position the paragraph at the middle
offset by there are half of the power
the making sense you're actually
performing the steps to Center an
element in the middle figuring out the
dimensions figuring out the center point
and then centering that element so that
is imperative programming but you don't
do that in HTML what you do in HTML is
align : Center right there's a CSS style
that you apply which is you want the
element Center alright so what you're
doing there is declarative programming
you're not imperatively preparing all
the steps to Center the paragraph
somebody has already written the logic
to Center any element in the middle of
the container and that's using CSS all
you're going to do is you're going to
declare to the browser and say hey
browser
I need this element in the center you do
that we declare that by using a line
colon Center and then the browser does
the rest because the browser has the
logic that
goes with that align Center declaration
rose already knows what to do when it
sees a declaration and it's going to do
it for you right so this is the
distinction between declarative and
imperative when you're recording in
angularjs you're going to be doing a lot
of declarative programming you're not
going to write the steps one by one what
you're going to do is create custom
elements create custom components and
create the logic for it and then use it
in multiple places right so here's one
thing you need to remember though in a
declarative code
you basically have to write the logic
imperatively right so let's say you're
creating a date in under custom detail
you are basically facilitating
declarative programming by creating the
element so that people can use it but
then the very first time you create and
declare the element you also have to
define the logic and you have to define
the logic imperative you have to define
all the steps somebody has to write the
code but then once that one person
writes the code it's available for
others to use declarative
all right hope this makes sense this
meant like the central concept behind
angular and not a lot of online
tutorials kind of touch upon this
concept because this fundamental kind of
understanding how to write code in
angular and understanding how to write
good code early let's say so hopefully
this makes sense definitely encourage
you to kind of google the difference
between these two declarative and
imperative and kind of research that a
little bit more if you're curious but
that's like the fundamental concept with
angular you create those custom elements
in the new use in multiple places these
custom elements in angular are called
components are directives terms of there
are two different ways of creating
custom elements in angular one way of
doing it is by creating what's quality
directives another way of doing it is by
creating what's called components this
is one problem with angular for anything
you want to do there are multiple ways
to do it that's because of how old
angular is it's been there for years now
and there have been new ways of creating
things new features that have been
introduced so in a lot of things that
you learn with angular there will be
multiple ways of doing the exact same
thing so it's important to understand
the distinction and when to use what
I'll try to cover a lot of
those course so there are two ways of
creating these custom elements one is by
creating directives another is by
creating components so some examples of
some components you want create
something like a slider could be a
custom element right you create a slider
using a custom HTML tag it can have a
less than slide or greater than radio
extending HTML by creating your own
slider element you can use it in your
code wherever you need a slider or a
button click and you know corresponding
text out you want somebody to click a
button and then some text should show up
you can actually do that by creating a
custom element which adds both the
button and the texts together because
that's the logic you've coded and you
know wherever you two clearer can
actually use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
