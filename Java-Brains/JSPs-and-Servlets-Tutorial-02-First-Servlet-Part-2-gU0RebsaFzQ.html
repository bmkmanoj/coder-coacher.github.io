all yeah before I start creating the
sublet now I'd like to mention that a
servlet is actually a Java class that
that resides on the Tomcat instance see
Tomcat acts as a container and you know
the Tomcat instance is going to run the
java class that we create and this class
is going to run on the VM which is on
the server where Tomcat is deployed so
it's analogous to you know our simple
Java classes you write with the main
method and execute it on your desktop
but the difference is of course that as
I said it's it's running on a different
machine where Tomcat is installed of
course in our case it's on the same
machine but it could be on a different
server and the second difference is that
you know the servlet will not have a
main method there are some default
methods that get executed when you
access the sublet and Tomcat is going to
execute them so with that in mind let's
go ahead and create a servlet so I right
click on the project here and I'll sing
you you should see a servlet entry here
if you do not see that go to the other
option and go to the web folder this is
the folder in which we selected the
dynamic web project so in this folder
you should see a sublet option to click
on that press next the project is the
project where we right-click and choose
the option source folder is something we
have selected in the previous instance
I'll give the Java package this is the
package for the class as I said the
sublet we are creating is it's just
another Java class
okay get on the package name and the
class name I will just give that us
simple sublet note that the super
classes are being auto selected it's
it's taken httpservlet as the super
class there's actually required when
you're creating a sublet
you should have httpservlet as the super
class if you write if you're just
writing a Java class you know I mean if
you're not using this lizard and you
just creating a class using you know
right even using either the right-click
new class or just starting on a new file
without the ID you would have text in
this here Eclipse does that
automatically I'm not using an existing
class in creating new one so I'll leave
this unchecked press next here I can
enter the name of the of the sublet it's
taken the default as the class name that
I entered in the previous screen so I'll
just leave that here
as it is you can of course change it
description okay let me enter something
here I've just entered it here so that
you know where it goes but it's not
really required for the sublet to work
initialization parameters gonna leave it
as blank we'll come back to this later
URL mapping is again Auto populated with
the the class name that we that we
selected what this means is that when
this particular URL pattern is used to
access the web application Tomcat
automatically comes to the sublet and
asks the servlet executes so you can add
as many other buttons as you want here
so that if any of these patterns match
what the user is requesting then it will
come to the servlet just to show the
difference what I'll do here is I'll
just call this as
simple sublet path so that can make up
the difference it doesn't exactly have
to be the same as the class name peeled
so the plus next these are the modifiers
interfaces I'm going to leave all these
as this I don't need a constructor and
these are the abstract methods we
getting this from httpservlet that we
extended in the earlier screen to get a
new poster I selected here I'm going to
uncheck do posts so that we just have do
get don't need anything else just say
finish okay there you go our sublet is
created so the things that are really
marked this and make this different from
Anna is just another Java class is of
course we saw this it extends HTTP
servlet and it implements do get method
from the HTTP servlet
me--he's check that you know in the
implement abstract classes screen and
then the other difference is this
annotation line that you see here you
see that it has a lapse of the
annotation with two properties one is
the description and well as URL buttons
description as this is as we entered
earlier we just had some text here so
that it documents what this I will it
does and you are the patterns as
explained before it tells strong yet
that okay when this URL is excuse
accessed by the user come to the servlet
and when it comes to the sublet of
course it executes only the Duquette
method because they do get is the
default for any simple URL requests
there's also a do post that we wouldn't
really know frequently use which I'll
get back to later but for now just let's
focus on the do gate so I can write any
code here and then when the URL is
executed with the context name of the
application and the sublet name so that
it comes to this servlet
then Tomcat automatically executes the
do get method so let me write some
simple code here I'll just say
system dot out dot println hello from
get method this is system route actually
this will print to the tomcat log files
again this system door out actually
depends on how the server implements a
tomcat by default when you do a system
to order out in any of the code that
runs on Tomcat it just takes that text
and prints it to the logs we should see
that in the console here so have you
done I'll say this and go to this in the
package Explorer as you can see it's
created a package and it's created a
simple Java class here inside this
package which is the one we've just
edited so I can right-click on it and
say run as run on server so it deploys
this servlet inside the Tomcat instance
and then of course you know accesses
this URL so so here we go so we have the
application context so that's accessing
this application and then we have the
sublet path so that it accesses this
servlet and it gets this from the
context which we've selected earlier and
it gets this value by looking at the
annotation that we've entered here so
when you access this Tomcat will say hey
this go it's calling this application so
let me go to this application and then
it looks at the following word says hey
it's calling simple servlet path now
which of these servlets inside this
application has the URL patterns at this
simple sublet path it sees only one
servlet here and yes that's all it does
have URL patterns or simple servlet path
so as I said by default it executes the
do get method and it prints hello from
get method and hello from get method
textures in the Tomcat
logs well this is fine but as you can
see here the response is blank you know
that you're supposed to get a webpage
Rini access this URL it's just short of
blank webpage that is because we are not
actually printing any HTML and sending
it back to the client in order to do
with that what we need to do is we need
to use the parameters that Tomcat passes
to this to get method you can see here
there are two parameters that are passed
one is a request and one is the response
requesters of type httpservletrequest
and the responses of type
httpservletresponse we will come back to
what the request is later but let's
focus on the response phenom the
response is where you actually send HTML
response to the client side so what you
can do is you can just take this
response object and there is something
called as a printwriter so when you do a
response target writer you will get a
printwriter object so I'm going to take
that into a variable here front writer
call it writer equals response target
writer of course I'll have to import
this print writer guy here it's in Java
that I you put that now I can use this
writer object and call the print Ln
method and I can actually print HTML
here so I can pass string here which can
actually be HTML text and that history
mail text will get rendered over here so
let me use some history with axial I'll
just use a h3
hello in HTML and of course close the
tag save this now I save this since it's
already deployed it should Tomcat should
automatically detect that and reload the
context yes there it does it so I don't
have to deploy it again it's
automatically done it for us so now we
find I fresh this as you can see the the
earlier statement executes and then now
this also executes and it actually
renders the HTML rather than just print
the text because you know I can see the
text as being printed in bold h3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
