is should you take this course the
reason I'm going to answer this question
is because like I mentioned currently as
I'm recording this video angular wonder
X is the latest stable version but
angular 2 is just around the corner so
which one do you want to learn do you
want to learn angular one or do you want
to learn angular 2 the reason it's an
even more important decision to make is
because angular 2 is not
backward-compatible angular 2 has its
own syntax its own way of doing things
the fundamental concepts are kind of the
same but the way to write applications
is very different so you have to make a
choice if you want to learn angular 1 or
if you want to learn angular 2 as you're
watching this video I'm guessing a few
days for a few weeks from now this would
have been different
probably angular 2 would have been
released and angular 1 is no longer the
latest stable version so it's an
important question for you to tackle and
there are a couple of considerations
there are a couple of groups of people
who would want to learn angular 1 versus
angular 2 it I'm going to cover that now
so what are the considerations why would
you want to learn angular 1 today the
first is if you are tasked with working
on an angular 1 codebase angular 1 is a
very very popular framework there have
been a lot of companies a lot of
organizations a lot of teams that have
adapted angular 1 they have applications
that are running in production today
which use angular 1 and if you happen to
be working for one of those companies or
we happen to work on a code base that
uses angular 1 you have no choice but to
learn and hopefully this course is going
to help you get there so that you're
comfortable maintaining the code base
and also adding new core to that code
base secondly if you're involved in
migrating code from angular 1 to angular
2 again there's a lot of code out there
with angular 1 and angular 2 is coming
up and like I mentioned they're not
backward compatible so let's say you are
working on one of those teams and you
have been tasked that by grading the
code to angular 2 you also need to know
what angular 1 is about
having angular2 so this is another
reason why you would want to take this
course so you can get an idea from what
angular 1 it's I should have ever let
you know that if you are starting from
the scratch if you're writing a new
application from the scratch the reasons
to use angular 1 are diminishing
day-by-day angular 2 is getting more and
more stable so you might want to
consider using angular 2 if you're
writing something from the scratch right
if you have a clean slate building
something new however if you have code
base that's already using angular 1 then
this course would be perfect for you
there's going to get you started it's
going to help you understand what that
code is doing is going to help you
understand the angular 1 concepts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
