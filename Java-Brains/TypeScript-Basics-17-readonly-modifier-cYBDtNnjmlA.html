if I were to say I'm just gonna give one
property which is name and name is now
public I can say for a person this new
person and then I can say a person dot
mean this is accessible like we
discussed this is public so you looked
at all the other modifiers for private
and protected which lets you hide how
this name is accessed whether it's only
in the type or in the type and types
that extended now there is another key
modifier that you can use which is
called read-only now let's say you want
to have name be a read-only property
once it's set you don't want anybody to
modify it you want it to retain the
value that was set so you can use this
new modifier called read-only and now
this property becomes read-only it
cannot be changed it can only be read so
for instance I can do a person dot name
so I can access it and say console dot
log I can spell that right console that
logger can access it but I cannot set
value to it a person dot name equals
something I cannot do this because you
know this unit is so read-only so you
cannot write to it this is cool but now
if this is the case how can you set a
value if you can only read it
who writes dirty there you have to write
the first time right so you can do
something like this now let's say this
is a string right I can do something
like this
alright so read only me Michael Scott
shake so I can't assign a value to a
read-only property had the time it's
being declared so in that case this
becomes set to that value and when I
print the output it's gonna print the
value that have a sign and I cannot
change it anymore well this is good but
this is not always feasible you cannot
always have an inline value you would
want to have something that's get
getting passed to the constructor the
very first time and then it becomes
read-only right you want to be able to
set it the first time with a value
that's being passed to the constructor
so that's another place in which you can
assign a read-only property to our value
you can assign a read-only property in
only two places one is during the
property declaration time you can say
equals something and that gets assigned
or you can assign a value to a read-only
property in the constructor those are
the only two valid places so let's say I
have a constructor here and have name to
the string now I can say this dot name
equals name and here I can pass in my
name so notice what's happening here
even though this is a read-only property
it's okay to assign two right to it in
the constructor but then after that I
cannot write anymore a person dot name
like we saw cannot be assigned to a new
value it's only the very first time so
those are the two places in which you
can write to a read-only value you can
initialize it now this works with the
shortcut that we have seen in the last
tutorial rather than do this declare a
property and then do a pass through
assigning constructor you can get rid of
this you can get rid of this and say
read only this is essentially a
replacement of the other syntax that you
saw it's just in one line you're using
the shortcut</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
