there's going to be a very quick
tutorial a very quick tip on how you can
override the default execute method in
your starts to application if you look
here we have with all the vile we've
seen action names map to action classes
and I've told you how the execute is the
default method that gets executed
whenever there is an action execution so
in the tutorial action I have this
public string execute that gets executed
whenever this you are the URL that have
mapped over here this is accessed and
I've told you that that's the default
behavior and I remember I've told you
that there is a way in which you can
override that as well
that's what I'm going to be looking at
in this tutorial it's going to be a very
quick one but this would be very handy
in a particular few scenarios that we're
going to talk about in a little while so
the way in which you can override the
default method this well of course if
you do not enter anything if you just
see an action name is this and classes
this it is by default gonna go and
execute this method the execute method
but now let's say I want some other
method to run okay so i'll have a public
string it still has to be a string go
here okay i'll have some other method
that I want executed whenever this call
happens okay so I do not want to execute
to get executed I want a different
method to get executed so I'm going to
return success anyway this is just for
illustration but I will do a suss out
okay and I'm printing a different
message so in the execute method I
actually commented out some of the old
stuff that I
I did in the previous tutorial so right
now we'll just as a society of execute
method coil and then there is a
different method that does this out of a
different message right let's save this
and the way I can make this method get
caught by default is by adding a method
attribute over here I just to a control
space you can see there is a method
attribute so I add that and what I do
here is I enter the name of the method
all right now what's going to happen is
this is the method that will get called
whenever the axis happens and then it
calls this method so whenever I do a get
tutorial we hide this thing so whenever
I do a get tutorial this is the method
that's going to get called without this
method tag it would be the execute by
default but then if you add this method
tag whatever method you add over here is
going to get called so let's say this
and I'm going to restart because it's an
XML change
can we close this and now I have the
same get tutorial direction let enter
see here some other method executed so
that's a different method that gets
executed so this is the way to do it so
you just change just add this method tag
and then the method attribute and then
whatever method you enter is going to
take care okay now why is this useful
why would you want to override the
default execute method well the reason
why I would want to override it is
without this right without the ability
to change the method that gets executed
you would have one action executing just
one particular unit of work so let's say
you have in your application a few set
of functionalities around tutorial okay
so you have the fetch that we've already
implemented let's say you have a concept
of say favorite tutorials the user could
add favorite tutorials it could edit
delete you know their favorite set of
tutorials typically a credit operation
now what you would have to do is you
would have to have a fetch tutorial
action an ADD tutorial action a deleted
or real action so essentially you would
have to create a separate tutoring class
for each and every unit of operation
which is really a pain so that's where
it's really handy to be able to have
different methods for each of those
operations in a common action class and
then map those different methods and
different action mappings know let me
let me give you an example so here I
have a get tutorial map with let me go
with this back I will call this get
tutorial okay and I will rename this
method as the middle of the sky here I
will rename this as
a tutorial and this is the method that
this mapping is going to call get
tutorial it's going to look at tutorial
action and it's going to call the get
tutorial method but then what you could
also do is have a copy of this mapping
say I have a add tutorial and this is
going to again
map the tutorial action but do a
different method I'm going to implement
a our tutorial alright so this method is
called when the URL has a tutorial and
this gate tutorial method is called when
the URL has gate tutorial so what I
would do is how to add the a tutorial
method to the same action I don't have
to create a new action for a different
operation
so I'll just say add and the method
would be a tutorial method called a node
call this
a tutorial method call so essentially I
have two different methods in the same
action class that are mapped to two
different actions but with this method
attribute all right so it's the same
action that caters to two different URLs
and do different methods to the actual
work
of course I will have to restart the
server
okay so close this and now if I do a get
tutorial call to get you to remit to
this call and if I do a add tutorial
then the eye tutorial method is quad and
finally there's one other tip I'll leave
you with if you look at this this action
mapping these two action mappings
there's one thing that you should
immediately think of if you look at the
the action name the methods you see here
the action name is same as the method
here so the thing that you should
immediately think of as wildcards is it
possible to implement white cards and
yes just like you can implement wild
cards and the class name and the action
and the result name you can have wild
cards in the method value as well so we
can actually simplify this much more by
just adding a wild card here so I will
instead of giving the name over here I
will have a well card star mapping to
method 1 so whatever is the action the
corresponding method will run so I can
actually do a V with this this
configuration let's save this and
restart the server
now it's going to have the same result
then I add tutorial action is going to
call the a tutorial method and the get
tutorial action is going to call the get
to to limit it of course if you if you
call something that is not actually
there you will obviously get an error no
such method because it's trying to
actually call the Edit tutorial method
off the action when we don't have that
method yet but well that's a problem
you'll have anyway if you access an
action that you haven't really mapped
anything to you will obviously get an
error and of course there are a bit of
these to handle the error right now I
just show the stack trace here you might
probably have an error page that says
hey this URL doesn't exist but I hope
you can see the obvious advantage of
having the methods differ based on the
action that you're trying to do so you
have a common in this case you have a
common tutorial action that does all
things tutorial related and then you
have credits that have particular method
and a particular you are and that's
that's mapped to it so I can implement
all the you know the get tutorial the a
tutorial the edit tutorial delete
tutorial and all that will automatically
so I don't really have to add each and
every URL mapping over here it's
automatically done and you can have all
those URLs automatically call the right
methods and get executed so I hope this
concept is helpful and I hope you try to
implement this kind of a mapping for
your credit so that you have a more
readable in a more organized starts XML</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
