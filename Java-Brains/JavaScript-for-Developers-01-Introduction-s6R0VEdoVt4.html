hello and welcome to this course title
JavaScript for developers this course is
an introduction to the JavaScript
programming language the look at what
javascript is what are some of the
unique concepts and features of
JavaScript and how to write code using
the JavaScript programming language this
course has a prerequisite I'm going to
assume that you have some familiarity
with some other programming language and
JavaScript is not your first programming
language hence the title of the course
JavaScript for developers I'm going to
assume that you are familiar with one of
those classical languages like C C++
Java c-sharp Ruby Python or any of those
kind of languages then why am i doing
that why is there a prerequisite for
this language the thing is JavaScript
comes from the C family of programming
languages so there's a bunch of
languages which are considered to be
from the C family of programming
languages they all share the same origin
as the C programming language so you
know languages like C++ Java C sharp if
you are familiar with one of those
languages you can easily pick up the
syntax off the others in that family
because they all share similar syntax
the way you would write a for loop or an
F block or a switch statement they're
all the same across those languages
turns our JavaScript is also from that
family so if you're familiar with the
language like C++ or Java the syntax of
JavaScript will be familiar to you and
you can you know get comfortable with
the syntax right away so that's actually
the reason why I am assuming that
knowledge so for instance I'm not going
to cover what a for loop is but I will
explain how a for loop in Java Script is
different from a for loop in the
language like Java or C++ I'm not going
to talk about what objects are but I'll
tell you how objects in JavaScript are
different from objects in Java I hope
you get the idea so if you are
completely new to programming you may
not get that value out of this course
you can still follow a line but you're
probably not going to follow along as
well and you're not going to get your
money back all right so let's get
started what are what are we going to
cover in this course at a high level
this is JavaScript for developers like I
just talked about
I'm going to highlight some of the
differences between JavaScript in some
of these classical languages like C++
Java and c-sharp JavaScript is its own
unique language and there are a lot of
different concepts in JavaScript that
are either very different in those other
languages or don't even exist in those
other languages so we're going to cover
some of those unique concepts in
JavaScript and finally I'm going to talk
about some of the resources that you
need to consume in order to further your
understanding of JavaScript as you go
along this journey of learning the
language and also some next steps for
you to take in order to be better at the
language all right so with that said
let's start unit 1 an introduction to
JavaScript</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
