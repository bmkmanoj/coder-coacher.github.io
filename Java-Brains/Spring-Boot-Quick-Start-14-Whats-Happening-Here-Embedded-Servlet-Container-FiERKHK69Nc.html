we're going to look at the embedded
Tomcat server again we didn't have to
download the Tomcat server to run our
spring application it just came with it
I didn't have to find a sublet container
and apply it to the servlet container
the recent black spring boot decided to
have that in embedded server the
embedded tomcat server is there are
actually a couple of reasons the first
one is of course convenient when you're
running an application you don't have to
go download the Tomcat server install it
and then apply it all that stuff just
runs and it's really easy during
development time the other advantage and
this is something that's more important
in my opinion is there is some sublet
configuration steps that need to happen
sublet container configuration steps we
need to apply something to talk cat you
have you may have to configure something
on Tomcat most of the times the defaults
were but there might be some
configuration that you would have to do
do Tomcat to have it drag in your
application however now the sublet
container configuration whatever that is
will now become a part of the
application configuration just like you
configure other things about your
application in your source code
you also have Tomcat related
configuration because everything is in
one package so as your application walls
and the configuration for your dumb cat
or any of the sublet container was it's
all together in one piece so anybody who
gets your code immediately knows what to
do in order to run it but they don't
even have to know they just have to
execute a command and the code base
rather knows what configuration needs to
happen for the sublet container in order
for that application to run which is
really handy the which kind of leads to
my third point which is that having a
standalone application really helps it's
easy to deploy it's easy to run and it's
also easy to develop and if you remember
this was one of the goals of the spring
boot project in order to provide a
standalone thing that can be executed
the final advantage that I should call
out is that something like this being
able to execute a command and to have
the whole thing start up is useful for a
micro service architecture
when you have a bunch of microservices
you don't want to have additional steps
in order to deploy each micro service if
you have one big monolithic code base
well it's okay to take the pins to say
okay these are the steps to deploy to
Tomcat but if you have like ten
different micro services you don't want
to apply it ten different times it's
going to be pain but that an application
being standalone you just have to run a
command and have the micro Service data
which is much more convenient and that's
where the embedded Tomcat server really
helps and when you build an application
using springboard
you just have that one command to run to
start the servlet container and the
application which was really handy so
these are some of the many reasons by
spring boot the pliable is something
that includes the Tomcat server with it
and then Tomcat is the default choice
again you can choose any other servlet
container just you need to specify the
dependency in your palm that XML and
configure it but then again the point is
that it's all in your codebase</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
