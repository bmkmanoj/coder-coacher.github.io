at the next data type string strings are
sequences of unicode characters these
are 16-bit characters there's no
character data type in JavaScript
everything is a string so if there's a
piece of text it's a string if it's just
one character it's basically a string
for the length of one okay so strings
are the types used to represent text
while numbers are the types used to
represent numbers so you can see that
the type system is fairly simplified in
the case of JavaScript we don't have a
bunch of different types for numbers and
two different types for text it's number
data type for all kinds of numbers and
the string data type for all kinds of
text okay so it makes things a bit
simpler the next data type is boolean
boolean as you know has a value of true
and false so a boolean value can either
be true or it can be false and these
boolean values can be used for
conditionals inside for loops and so
while loops and they can affect the flow
of the program and all that kind of
stuff so I'm going to demonstrate string
in boolean using a demo and I'm also
going to demonstrate another interesting
factor of type system in JavaScript you
see here I have a equals 10 B equals 20
I have C is a plus B so C has the value
of thready
let's say i do a bar d equals hello all
right so d is a string we move this up
these are string the value hello and
we'll have a VAR e equals true so e is a
boolean value true and I can print these
values say print D here and I print a
here clear this out and run this they go
all those values are printed notice the
color difference I told you that there
is a difference in color based on the
type that's getting
on the console so the numbers are
printed in the color green the string is
printed in a kind of a brownish color
and the boolean is red so this is one
way to identify what kind of type is
being printed on the console okay so
these are you know there's not a lot to
explain here it's numbers string and
boolean three simple data types for now
now what's interesting about the
variable handling in JavaScript is there
is no type information associated with a
variable at no point of time can I say
a is a number variable what I can say is
a is a variable that happens to hold a
number via my establishing this
distinction let me explain now we know
that a is value of 10 right here is a
number now I can as well say a equals
hello JavaScript
now what will happen in another language
which has strong typing this would have
resulted in a compiler error right it
would have said you're trying to put a
string into a number variable and it's
going to give an error this does not
happen in JavaScript because JavaScript
does not do strong typing there is no
type information associated with a
variable a variable can hold any value
at any point of time so there isn't
again like I said there's no such thing
as a number variable other string
variable so I can print this again if I
were to print console that log off here
again it should print hello JavaScript
no errors
okay JavaScript it's totally fine with
this can assign any value to anything
else this behavior is called is loose
typing or weak typing as it's called a
lot of these other languages support
strong typing you not only cannot assign
a different value to a variable you have
to explicitly define what the type isn't
when you are declaring so you don't have
to do that in the case of JavaScript
JavaScript supposed supports loose
typing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
