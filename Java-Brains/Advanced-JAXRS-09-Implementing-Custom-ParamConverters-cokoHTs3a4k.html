glasses I'm going to create an instance
of the Perim convertor provider and
create a new class we call this my date
converter provider and this will
implement an interface so I'm going to
choose the parameter provider interface
here and click finish now since I'm
implementing this interface I have to
implement this method which is gate
converter it takes three arguments the
class the type and the annotation I'm
going to copy over the argument names
from the Javadoc so these three
parameters are what Jersey sends to the
converter provider to see if the
converter provider can provide a
converter back so it sends the raw type
the type of the you know the instance
that needs conversion from string to
there's also a generic type in case we
were dealing with generics and it also
sends a list of annotations so this is
an array of annotations so in the case
of a path param the bath param would be
one of the annotations that gets sent
over here if you're not dealing with
generic types and you're not going to
look at the annotations we just
interested in the raw type so what I
want to do is I want to check if the raw
type is the my date type so I'm going to
have an if condition here if raw type
dot get name I'm going to compare it to
the name of the my date dot class now if
they are equal I need to send back the
actual parameter now if the raw type is
different then I just return a null now
here is where I create a new but I am
converting last now I could create a
separate class for our parameter
inverter and say it or done new off that
class but I'm just putting them in the
class in line here so I'm going to say
return new pair I'm converted so I'm
implement this in line so now since I've
created a new pair I'm converted I need
to implement a couple of methods so the
first method is the from string so this
is what takes in a string value and
returns the the instance of the class
which is my date I deserve where the
logic resides there's also this other
method that I have to implement which is
the to string so this is not important
for our param converter but this is
something you have to implement because
it's a method of this interface okay so
this two string takes in an instance of
our class and converts it to a string
I'm just gonna return a you know object
to string here alright so now let's
focus on the from string given a string
or today tomorrow or yesterday I need to
return an instance off the my date class
so what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to create a new instance of
calendar for our current date and then
if the if what's requested the value is
tomorrow then I'm going to do a
requested date dot add off plus one I'm
adding a date to the current date so
that I get tomorrow State but if the
date requested is esterday the string is
esterday then I'm going to subtract one
okay so by the end of this I should get
the requested date being either today's
date are tomorrow's or Esther days so if
anything else I'm just you know if
they're surpassing anything else not
necessarily today I'm still going to
return today's date okay so now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to create a new
instance of my module which I need to
send back and then I'm going to set the
date month and year to the requested
date
dot get off calendar date calendar month
and calendar year okay and now I need to
return my date since it's a generic type
I'm going to do a raw type cast of my
date so that it returns the instance of
the type that it wants okay and now on
to the to string method this is fairly
straightforward I get it I get a bean we
know if it's null I just return null and
if not I just do a bean dot to string
okay now with this we have an
implementation of the my date converter
provider and now in order to register
this class as a provider for jax-rs make
sure you add the add provider annotation
to the class now with this validation
we've got a custom my date converter
provider which looks at the raw type and
if the raw type is what we need which is
my date it returns an instance of the
param converter just has a logic to
return the type that we want from the
string this is all that matters now the
final thing I need to do is create a two
string method for our date class so that
we can send something sensible I'm just
going to use the two string that Eclipse
generates it just prints my date with
the values of these member variables I'm
going to save this and let's run run on
server now I'm gonna find do a Web API
slash date slash today it returns
today's date date is 25th if I are done
if I send tomorrow
it returns 26th and yesterday returns
24th so what's actually happening here
is just to recap we are passing a string
here and in our date resource I'm not
doing any conversion here I'm just
saying hey Jersey figure out a way to
convert that string to a date instance
this conversion is happening thanks to
Jersey but
enable Jersey to make this conversion we
have created two classes one is the
provider which registers AB converter
for the date type and then the second
class is the converter itself which is
an inline class here which converts from
a string to an instance of what we want
alright so this is how you implement
parameters this is a contrived example
you would never do something like this
but in case you have your own custom
data type that you use all over the
place rather than have that logic the
conversion logic happen from string in
all your controller methods you can
implement this converter so that the
conversion is pretty seamless right the
people who write your controllers your
resource classes don't have to worry
about how to do this conversion it's
something that Jersey knows how to do I
hope this was helpful and see you in the
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
