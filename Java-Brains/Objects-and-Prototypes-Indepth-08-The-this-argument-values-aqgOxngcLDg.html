context in JavaScript this is actually a
concept in most programming languages
when there is a function that's called
it is always called in a particular
context in the lord of the classical
programming languages there is something
like a stack trace right so there is a
stack of variables which which kind of
contain the values for different scopes
that have been a part of the call chain
and there are a bunch of other stuff the
information that it maintains but the
idea is that there is some context some
group of data which helps the execution
of a particular function and the
function might sometimes need to refer
to it so javascript also has an
execution context and the contents of
that execution context really depend on
the method in which the function is
called in any one of these four ways and
one of the variables one of the elements
of that execution context is a variable
called this if you've been working with
JavaScript or if you've seen some of my
other courses in JavaScript you will
know that there is an implicit argument
to any function execution and that
argument is called this there are
actually two arguments one is called
arguments and one is this for the
purposes of this conversation we can
just look at the argument this so
anytime you make a function execution
there is always an implicit argument
called this anytime you write a function
you can use the dis variable and it will
always point to something what that
thing is really depends on which one of
these methods you're using however once
the function call has been identified
the value of this is very predictable in
fact the specification outlines what the
value of this should be for various
different approaches of function calls
so given a way in which you call a
function it's very easy to predict the
value of this so let's identify those
different values one by one we'll start
with the method 1 I'm going to create
clear all these things out I'm executing
a function as a simple function object
directly the Venna function is executed
like this using this first
watch the value of the disk keyword is
the global object okay
so in JavaScript there is a concept of
the global object and the global object
itself depends on the runtime
environment you're using if you're
running JavaScript on a browser the
global object is a window object which
represents the window or the tab that is
actually running the JavaScript code if
you're running it in node.js there is an
object called global which is the global
object so the global object itself
depends on the runtime environment that
is running the JavaScript code but the
fact is there is an object called the
global object and when you execute a
function using this approach just
calling the function directly then there
is this reference that gets created when
the function is being executed and that
this reference points to that global
object so let's validate that by doing
console dot log of this and now if I
execute this you're going to see Hello
printed which is this console that log
and the second console that log is
printing this which as you can see here
is a window reference so this is the
first way in which you can call
functions just calling the function as
is and in this case this refers to the
global object okay okay let's move on
let's look at the second approach put
this back in here now the second
approach is to create an object and then
have a property on the object which is
the function right and I'm calling the
function as a property of that object
this is method two alright so I'm going
to again clear out the other stuff which
could distract us and just going to
leave this method two alright so now I
have this way of calling function which
is another one of the four different
ways in which we can call functions in
JavaScript now the question is what is
the value of the distance here well it
turns out if you're calling a function
in the context of an object then when
that function is called that this
reference is actually referring to
that object itself so I'm saying object
dot foo when I'm calling the function
this refers to this object instance
whose property is the function I'm
calling all right so I can i can print
console the vlog top this and this time
it should be the instance obj all right
so let me clear this out and reload and
run we have will be taken in printed to
really validate that I can add another
property here called prop and then this
is the object itself just to make sure
that we are actually referring to the
right object I can run this so I have a
property I have an object called obj
which has a property called prop with
this string and then it has a property
called foo which gets created because of
this line and I'm calling that object
dot foo and then foo gets call which is
this function that gets called this
refers to this obj okay refers to this
object
alright let's reload and run and verify
that it is the object itself and in this
case this approach this refers to the
object whose property is the function
that I'm calling so I'm calling a
function as an object ref object--
property reference so I'm calling this
in the context of an object that's what
this is in the case of method two
alright again putting the code back and
now let's look at what happens if I call
foo using new this is something we've
already learnt in this case whenever you
call a function using the new keyword
this always refers to the newly created
object so whenever you attach a new in
front of a function with the JavaScript
interpreter does is it creates a new
object on the fly it creates it at that
time and assigns it to the this
reference so when you are executing the
function using the new keyword then the
distance in that function will point to
that newly created object again I'm
going to clear all this other stuff out
so that it doesn't
practice all right so this is approach
three have a function and I'm calling it
using the new keyword if I were to say
console that log of this what should get
printed you remember when you call a new
keyword there are two lines that
implicitly get added bar this equals an
empty object and then at the end return
this so in this case the value of this
should be obvious it is an empty object
all right let's validate that by
clearing this out reload and run there
you go
it's an empty object so in the third way
of calling functions the value of this
is an empty object when you use the new
keyword all right I'm going to put
everything back to the way it was so
these are the three methods that we've
seen so far of calling functions and
we've seen how this value gets changed
for each way of calling function so to
summarize and Method one calling a
function as is this refers to the global
method to calling a function in the
context of an object this refers to that
object whose property you're calling
method 3 when you're calling using a new
keyword that this refers to the newly
created object all right so now is it a
good time to talk about method 4 well
unfortunately not yet so before we get
to method 4 I need to show you a
practical use case off using the disc
keyword and I'm going to highlight a
particular problem and tell you a
solution to it which happens to be the
fourth way of calling a function we'll
learn more about that in the next
