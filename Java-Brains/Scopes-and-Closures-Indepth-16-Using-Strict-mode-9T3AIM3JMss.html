you're using a variable that is not
declared for a read operation it gives
an error reference error but if you are
using an undeclared variable for a write
operation it actually creates a variable
in the global scope and I've told you
have global scopes are bad and it's it's
unfortunate that JavaScript as such is
doing this automatically if you really
dislike this behavior of JavaScript you
are not alone there's a lot of
developers who have been burned by this
let's say I have a var my name equals
something and somewhere down the line I
make a typo and I do something like this
okay I should have used the capital n
right so I used a small n now what does
JavaScript do it actually creates a
variable in the global scope called my
name
all small case and it assigns the value
here right so not only does it not
assign the value that I had in mind
for it it's also creating a new variable
tattoo in the worst of all places in the
global scope this is bad and there is a
way in which you can prevent this
behavior from happening and that's
called the strict mode so you when you
run JavaScript in general there are a
couple of modes in which you can run it
one is the normal mode that we've been
seeing so far the other is what's called
a strict mode and here is actually the
Mozilla developer Network page far
strict mode I'm going to share this in
the video and in the course page but
this is something that was introduced in
Eggman script version 5 okay so this is
an opt-in feature you can say I want
this to work in script you know in
strict mode I want my scripts to work in
strict mode and when you opt-in then
there are certain things with JavaScript
does that makes it a bit stricter and it
removes these kind of crazy behaviors
the way to use strict mode is to use
this string right so basically I'm going
to copy the string and paste it over
here if I do this at the very first line
if I use the string called you strict
with a space in between and any with a
semicolon it basically tells the
interpreter to say hey JavaScript
interpreter run this hole
thing in strict mode okay so I'm going
to go back here to the console if I have
if I did not have this and if I ran this
notice that my name would have the beta
value gosh ik but if I do add strict
mold over here and clear this out and I
reload and run notice what happens I get
a reference letter says assignment two
and declared variable my name which is
perfect this is exactly what we want so
this is how you can prevent these kind
of variables from being created when you
do a write operation on an undeclared
variable and that's not the only thing
that strictmode does again look at this
page for a lot of stuff that it does it
has a few more things that kind of makes
sense it's kind of like common sense
features which you would wish JavaScript
did so it kind of takes away a lot of
the craziness the JavaScript does by
default so this is how you do this again
there are a couple of things a couple of
ways in which you can use the strictmode
if you write this in the first line of
your code it basically runs the whole
script that you have in strict mode but
you can also execute certain functions
in strict mode let's say you are using
libraries which don't work in strict
mode and you want to use this only for
your code right so what you can do is
let's say all your code is inside a
function here function my code and then
everything you write is inside this
function now let's say you want to apply
strict mode only to your my code
function so what you can do is you can
apply strict mode inside the function so
in this case this use strict applies
only to this function so only your
function is going to get executed in
strict mode but if you have other
libraries or other you know code which
will not work in strict mode for some
reason those will not get executed in
strict mode because this applies only to
this function I personally try using
strict mode everywhere because like I
said it applies some common-sense
guidelines and make sure the JavaScript
runs the way you would want to do it
removes a lot of the craziness it
more than some of the rough edges of the
JavaScript as a language so this is
definitely something that you should
keep in mind and try to use as much as
possible at least if not anything else
at least in the code that you write
always make sure that you are using
strict mode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
