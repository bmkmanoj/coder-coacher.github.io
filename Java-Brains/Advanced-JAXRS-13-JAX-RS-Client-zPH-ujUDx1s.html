all right so we've done enough work on
the server side of things we've created
an API and we've been sending responses
to requests now we're going to switch to
the client side we learn how to write a
client so far in our application
examples we've been using postman to
make a REST API request and examine the
response right now what if you wanted to
do it programmatically or you wanted to
access a REST API using Java there is a
way to do this but let me tell you this
so before jax-ur is 2.0 they were
different libraries which lets you make
REST API calls and look at the response
and construct objects out of it but
there was no standard but with jax-rs
2.0 the specification itself lays out a
standard for building REST API clients
so it's actually much more portable if
you use the jax-rs 2.0 api so the
current version is 2.0 so let's learn
how to build REST API client using
jax-rs 2.0 you're going to be using
Jersey so Jersey has support for those
client API is that comes with jax-rs
now I must also let you know that when
you're writing a client you are not
really worried about what the technology
is on the server to make REST API
requests the server could be implemented
using Jack service it could be
implemented using spring MVC it could be
implemented using c-sharp it really
doesn't matter what you get as a
response is JSON or XML what you send in
the request is JSON or XML so it really
doesn't matter what the technology is on
the server side but what we going to be
doing is using Java and Jersey to
implement a client-side application so
let's get started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
