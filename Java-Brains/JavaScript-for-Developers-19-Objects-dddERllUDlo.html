this unit is going to be about objects
like we talked about in unit 1
javascript is an object-oriented
programming language you can write code
and model your programming structure
using objects so the look at how objects
work in JavaScript and will also compare
and contrast it with the way objects
work in some of the other classical
languages will recover this javascript
is an object-oriented programming
language however it is not a class-based
programming language contrast this with
a language like Java where you have
classes which define objects in order to
create an object what you would need to
do is create a class first right create
a class add member variables add methods
to it and then when you create an object
you create objects off a particular
class right you say I want this object
to be off a class so the class forms the
template and then all these different
objects are basically copies off that
template this works in a lot of
class-based object-oriented programming
languages however the case of JavaScript
there are no classes it is not a
class-based object-oriented programming
language so you can create objects
without having classes in fact it's
necessary because it's not there are no
classes in JavaScript so JavaScript
objects are essentially free form
they're not bound to a particular class
let me demonstrate this another talk
about some of the features of the
JavaScript objects so I'm going to go
back to my firefox window here and let's
say I want to create a new object right
I can't create objects in multiple
different ways the easiest way to do it
is by creating an object in line think
of how you would create a string in line
so I can say Abbar my string
equals hello this is an inline string so
I created a string variable by providing
the value inline I can do something
similar for an object so I can say VAR
my object equals and I can give the
object value inline the simplest object
value that I can give is an MD object
and I can do that by using open curly
brace close curly brace right so what
you're seeing here is an empty object
it's start object which is the open
curly brace end object which is the
close curly brace there is nothing in
the object right and with this I have to
find a variable which is an object my
obj is a variable which contains a value
which is an empty object and I can print
this so let's say I do a console dot log
off my obj I should get the object right
I see an object which is an empty object
you see this open closed curly braces so
we have successfully created an object
out of thin air
we didn't have to create a class for it
okay since it's not class-based there
are no rules about what goes into an
object and what shouldn't right you can
add anything to an object at any point
of time that's what I meant when I said
javascript is freeform when it comes to
objects there is no predefined structure
you can add new stuff or remove stuff
from an object with whenever you want
during runtime
I can actually do that by adding a
property you know objects typically
consist of properties and methods you
must be familiar with this from some of
the other programming languages which
involve objects an object is essentially
a collection of data and functionality
the data is referred to as properties
and the functionality usually is you
know consists of methods off the object
so let me add a simple property to this
my object object right now it's empty
right we can create a new fun you
probably a
dot prop equals hello so take a look at
this line what I'm doing with this line
is I'm creating a new property called
prop on the object my obj and I'm
setting a value to it which is a string
called hello okay so I'm adding a
property on the fly I'm adding a
property dynamically at runtime and now
it's going to happen as if I do a
console that log of my object I'm going
to get the object with the property that
has a value which is a string hello
let's reload and run the you see this is
an empty object which was what the
object started out as it was an open
closed curly braces which was an empty
object but then I added a property on
the object called prop and the value was
hello so if I print the object again you
see this is an object with a property
called prop and a value is hello okay
this is how you can essentially add
properties to objects dynamically you
don't think of objects in JavaScript as
belonging to a template objects in
JavaScript behave more like a map it is
a property and a value so you can add
keys to a map right you when we add
something to a map you add a key and I
associate a value to it this is more
kind of like that right so I was able to
create a key called property and then I
have a value called hello which was
assigned to it let me add another
property here so I can say my obj dot
prop 2 equals a number so in this case
it's 1 2 3 and now I print this after
both these properties
we load and run there you see the newly
populated object has two properties now
one is prop which is a string and then
one is prop two which is a number so I'm
adding properties on the fly
now not only can I add properties I can
also read from an object so I can access
a property value I can do that by using
the same convention object dot property
so I can do a console dot log let's say
the number property is and then I can
access the property by using this
convention my obj dot prop to reload and
run again do you see the number property
is one two three okay it was able to
pull up a specific property from the
object by using the object name dot
property name convention so this is a
brief introduction to objects in
JavaScript that are essentially freeform
like I told you you can think of it more
like a map than the traditional
class-based objects that you're familiar
with with some of the other languages</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
