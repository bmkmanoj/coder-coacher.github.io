typescript basics this course is an
introduction to the typescript
programming language in this course we
will learn what typescript is we learn
some of the features of that sort and
how to use it to build end-to-end
applications this as the title says is a
basic course it gets you started with
writing typescript it's not going to
cover some of the more advanced features
but learning types trip is I think
essential today that the kind of impact
it's made to the JavaScript programming
landscape whether you're working on like
a front-end application using angular or
react are a back-end application using
nodejs of your written if you're writing
code in JavaScript it's very handy to
know typescript and use that script
whenever it's appropriate so in this
course you're gonna be having a complete
overview of those basic features and
we'll get you started with writing code
using typescript all right so what's the
agenda of this course the Lund what
typescript is and why it was created and
then we learned the language features
and we learned some core concepts this
is not going to be covering just the
syntax right I'm gonna be talking about
some of the core principles so that when
you learn the principles you will never
forget the syntax and then finally we
will be building an end-to-end
application using typescript
I will be walking through a command line
text web application you can either
watch me cold or you can follow along
and does it together and I'll be also
uploading the source code to this
application on the java brains course
page so check that out if you are
following along what are the
prerequisites for this course I expect
you to have some JavaScript programming
knowledge some JavaScript programming
experience because typescript is very
closely related to JavaScript and I will
not be covering some of the concepts in
JavaScript I can essential for you to
start writing code in typescript so
knowing some JavaScript is helpful and
then you should also have some
experience but some other
object-oriented programming the language
in this course I'll be covering a lot of
object-oriented programming concepts
like classes interfaces inheritance
polymorphism and all that stuff and I'll
not be explaining those concepts so you
should have some familiarity with those
concepts you know what they are now
here's the plan the roadmap for the
course let's start off with unit 1
introduction and setting up learn what
typescript does invite was created we
also set up a dog in the environment to
start writing code using typescript you
need to cover some of the basic features
starting with types types is a very
important thing in typescript
as the name suggests it's typescript
that could introduces the concept of
typing which is very handy
we'll start our journey with typescript
using those types unit 3 covers classes
and interfaces this is where we cover a
whole lot of object-oriented programming
concepts that typescript provides for us
in unit 4 we will actually revisit the
development environment that we set up
in unit 1 the setup that we do in unit 1
is very bare-bones and in unit 4 we're
gonna revisit it look at some cool tools
that we can use to simplify our life as
typescript developers and make things
more efficient we'll also look at some
configuration options for the types of
compiler will tackle all that in unit 4
in unit 5 we're gonna put all the things
we've learned so far into practice by
doing hands-on development again like I
said you're gonna watch me code
a simple end-to-end command-line
application you can either follow along
step by step or you can sit back watch
take notes perhaps and through the
completely different application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
