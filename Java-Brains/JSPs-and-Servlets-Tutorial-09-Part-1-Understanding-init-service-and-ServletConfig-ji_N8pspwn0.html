quick recap of what we learned in our
previous tutorials we looked at three
important objects the request the
session and the context objects the
request object is something that gets
created for every user request if you
just type something in URL and press go
or you click on the link will you submit
a form every time you do something like
that a new request object is created and
it's passed on to our servlet and the
serve let's do get it or do post or do
whatever method executes and it takes
this request object that is the
processing in prints of the response a
session object is something that is
available throughout a user session so
say you open a browser and you are
browsing an application so you're
accessing different features of the
application and there are different sub
le'ts so all the while as long as you're
using a single browser and you're there
when the user was using it then you will
have a session object associated for you
so to say there's somebody else who's
using the same application in a
different browser in a different machine
they will have a separate session object
available to them and this session
object will be available across servlets
so as long as you're using any servlet
in the application they can just pull up
the session object and they can use
shared data and we saw how to retrieve a
session object as well in a previous
tutorial and we saw how to write data to
it as well okay so the session object is
a kind of like a global object which is
available across sessions but it's only
limited to a you know an a user to user
basis now what if you want an object
that's available across all subjects for
the whole application and across all
users so in that case you use a context
object they can be only one context
object per application and no matter how
many users no matter how many servlets
no matter how many machines or browsers
they use they will all share the same
context object so you want to keep some
data there that is you know necessary
for all the subnets and for all the
users that's when you would use the
context object so we also saw how to
pull up the context object from the
request object in our earlier tutorial
how to read and write into it we another
thing that we learned was that whenever
an access is made whenever you type in
URL and press go there will not be a new
object created as far as the sublet is
concerned Tomcat will not create a new
sublet object so every request is
treated as a separate thread this is
useful because you know it allows the
application to scale to the number of
users easily it doesn't have to create a
new object for every request in every
user if the number of requests increase
only the number of threads will increase
but there will not be an equivalent
number of object this actually has an
important implication when you make a
request right when you when you type in
the URL and press GO we know that a
thread is created and the do cater the
do post method is executed but there is
something that actually happens before
that okay so say I have the strong cat
container and I have deployed some
servlets here so these are simple class
files sometime somewhere along the way
these subjects are actually instantiated
and then sublet objects are created this
depends on a lot of things it depends on
you know the server itself depends on
the configuration but somewhere Tomcat
actually instantiates and has these
sublet objects created I'll just have
these two separate objects here now
let's say I have a user who wants to
access URL that sometime sublet object
one and measuring the Scott's
don't get the stakes of the subject
object
being in such a thickness in this new
presence creative and this friendly
process the request sent and returned
response so now there is another use
emotion status the same you know makes a
request and shames of the document
provides that request and the response
and it will not create a new object keep
waiting similarly some mother you get
one start to say you are that's my
object to then drunk at the sticks okay
object is already there which won't be
because of this we can identify there
are two important phases for assembling
the first phase the first milestone as
redness of the object that he created
this happen will be one in the subjects
like that and the second case is when we
sum that up you get a request and then a
new head is started so this happens many
times as many requests can do many
things updated so this happens more
frequently in one looks like that so
these are the two phases that need
pay attention to what's one time the
subject is actually associated of an
object three months the second one when
requests come on and then processing
happens each time which is the time so
this time so there are a few methods
that are associated with these two
important favors so those methods
actually in security will be program to
take a new post but it's it's acute we
have not actually used two methods in
our example we will have to do that
unless we actually need something to run
during those papers it just uses
something to get me to post method but
it can get like these methods also to
run some of our code so the two methods
that we're going to look at our town the
init method and the servicemen the image
method corresponds to the first state
that we saw earlier when the object is
created from the solvent for the first
time the servicemen that correspond to
the second period which is whenever a
new request comes in and you get escape
so and then in method happens early once
in some website and the service method
happens for each and every difficulty
subject object handles not where are
these methods we have actually little
this so these are actually these
actually come to us because we extend
the HTTP
subclass actually it looks so when I
look at the in terms of is what I'm
going to get more detail up so save into
the first call to the sub something
object is not there so what happens is
the object has to be creative and not it
creates the object across the page
method of that object anything that
takes about meter for the sublet quark
think this is something that will give
back to them but that is the perspective
approach after the image Metatron's then
the service worker has shown because
this is something that's trivial on a
call to the server say if the object is
answer is earlier if you but if you
opted to utilize along to the call and
you know I mean if you have to do this
right because God has reached down can't
endure this of the pesky process that
with this
with the subject
their octopus created and it's ready to
handle requests now the service will
actually process now what the service
method does is the service method looks
a little bit and it decides which like
the office of the activities decline to
process that it decides that if you
can't trust your own or the enforces
this is again depending on the method
that will you think you remember in a
previous tutorial reuse actually we get
method vendor to get or dominated it
because rather to Trinity force so it's
actually the service here the extreme
edge are its routine and the method is
definitely that it's received and it
calls the you get for the do things
morning of course I'm just listing these
two methods here but there are a few
other nice particular parts like the
foot and the delete and we have this
funny methods for that as well I didn't
put in the routine and so on but most of
the time we existed to get ready for
with that in this project so this is the
preferred Scott now the summit has been
initializing you have an object along x
jb n now the subsequent calls will just
die if you go to the service Mia but it
is not how to do and any future of it
will not be there the same object caters
to different requests so subsequent
crosshair equal to the service method
and then again the service method
decides that if it will give all to do
post has to run okay now we're going to
look at where these methods come from
you make a new service where are they
editing them from so if you look at the
even being heritance chart so this is
our certificate a purpose simple
subunits and reserved and all those
things
this is this going to be I would like
the VI now our class x sensitivity
sublet do you see that now the HTTP
servlet is actually one of the many
different types of changes that are
available or HTTP servlet as per its
name it it is a subnet that addresses
things should be protocol it could be
other service that is another parameter
like an input another example so that
subnet would be focus only on processing
tools for the quadratus but HTTP server
address' or arc is should be beautiful
since we had everything web application
we will be concerned about you need any
other services but because there are so
many servers there are so that activity
designed insertion made a better one
common class broad as the geniux area
that provides all the comments of the
functionalities and the interface and
the httpservlet along with the other
protocol service extend this generous
circle so we have a three level IRT ones
my arse omelette which is necessity
something and it should be be say for
instance the gender itself now they are
being again service method you were here
um the channel exalted as these three
methods you once the image at the sublet
concrete panel type another image with
army parameter and a sub-basement needed
look at this init with no parameter in a
moment but just know that it's there and
the genrich's server has all these
methods a fine now what's there in the
HTTP server the service method is over
again in velocity V so why is that as I
told you before the HTTP servlet is
concerned with HTTP protocol and think
about what the service method does
friends the service method looks at the
request and then decides whether a get
method or the post method has to be the
request is again with the raw post
method and then
that is to be given ridiculous and what
I get enforcement is there is TB method
so it makes sense for the HTTP methods
to be implemented in the case to be in
service so the service method in the
generic servlet is not doing much to
poor functionality of looking at I will
give it a second and impure together
into force lies with HTTP services
now what does our class cutting even
these industry order to get and it will
post so this is arm across the image and
the service methods are already there
after we generate some of that the
service method of being over determined
HTTP servlet and the container to do
force methods are over the super PAC get
up
so this is the chair that I saw earlier
in it service and the Deucalion we do
post so first thing is method we do not
extend beyond the or I did TP subject is
not over either the chantix are the
habits of the init method of the
direction that is called service method
we don't override it because it looks
like an STD some like yes HTTP servlet
Rho X there's nothing so this is service
method is from pinky so together the do
post is rewrite it so this is fun
in case we could not have doing this and
then we can be able to post execution
then CBP methods to get into posters
file and they do not do anything have we
mentioned it there but they are there
they do not do anything about from an
error message because we have not
implemented it they can error message
saying not implemented so in order to
catch the deprecatingly active mentation
will appear so that are significant and
not predefined
