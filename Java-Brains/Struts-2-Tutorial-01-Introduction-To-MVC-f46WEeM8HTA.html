tutorial I'll give you a quick
introduction to the MVC pattern look at
what MVC is and what are the different
components inside the MVC pattern as we
all know MVC stands for Model View and
controller I've even done a video about
MVC in the servlet series but I thought
I just visit this once more and give you
a brief overview of the MVC pattern
itself I'll start this tutorial with the
story this is the same analogy I used in
the servlets tutorial and I received a
lot of good feedback that that said that
this analogy helped them understand the
concepts and I hope you agree so this
story is of a guy who wants to own his
own restaurant he realizes one day that
his dream is to manage his own
restaurant so he builds one and you know
he just wants to start small he does not
have any employees so he decides to take
all the rules with restaurant himself so
since he happens to be a good cook
it's not a problem so he has a kitchen
built in and he has some tables for the
customers to be seated in and his open
ready for business now we have a
customer who comes in and they want to
try out this new restaurant so what are
the steps that this guy has to do in
order to serve the customer step one
would be to first get to know what the
customer wants get the customers order
now he has to get the menu and hand it
over to the customer the customer
chooses from one of the items available
in the menu and then our stickman over
here gets the order step two
he has to take the order to the kitchen
and prepare the food note that this is
just a one-man restaurant there are no
other employee so he has to do all the
rules himself so he cooks the food and
then when the food is completely cooked
he places and consolidates the food on
the on the tray as per the order so
there could be different elements of
food that an order comprises off so
there is a step involved in placing the
food in the right manner so that's that
would be the third step and then finally
the fourth step is to get the tray to
the customer and serve the food so this
these are the four basic steps that our
stickman has to do to serve any customer
to the restaurant now this could get a
bit tricky if there are multiple
customers once the restaurant starts
becoming a hit and there are a lot of
customers coming in then it would not be
possible for one person to manage all
these steps on his own so this is a
problem that a stickman anticipates and
he's really worried about how he can
solve this problem now he happens to
have a friend who is a programmer a Java
programmer so he gives him a call and
tells him about his problem he says okay
this is what I need to do for every
customer and I need to do all these four
steps for each customer over and over
again and his programmer friend tells
him hey this is actually like coding
everything in a single sublet when
you're writing a web application but
what does he mean by that let's take a
simple web application example where
everything is happening inside a single
servlet if the user makes a request to a
URL in a web application then what would
the subject have to do now this is a
single servlet web application it has to
do everything on its own the first thing
it would do is to get the request
parameters now it's a HTTP request it
needs to get the request parameters and
act on it accordingly so it would get
the URL it would get the post or the
gate parameters and all those things so
it gets the information about the
request itself the second step would be
to do the processing let's say it
involves getting some data out of the
database now it would have to connect to
the database using JDBC it would have to
run the query and retrieve the results
that are required the third step would
be to take that result and format them
into HTML which would beam it results in
a whole lot of out statements with that
it has to print different HTML tags and
it also has to embed the live data that
it gets out to the database and once the
HTML is formatted
it has to return the HTML back to the
user who has sent the request now this
is the analogy that you see here that
what our stickman has to do in a
restaurant he has to do everything by
himself now this gives the stickman an
idea and he says instead of me doing all
the work by myself let me hire somebody
who is an expert cook who specializes in
cooking not that our stickman doesn't
know how to cook but he wants somebody
else to manage that part of the
responsibility so that a stickman is
free to do a whole lot of other stuff so
he happens to find a good cook and he
hires the cook for his restaurant now
the cook works in the kitchen and the
cook is not responsible for anything
else apart from preparing the food
now with the cook in place let's see how
this flow changes now when a customer
comes in a stickman again goes and gets
the customer's orders step 1 nothing has
changed
now the step 2 instead of the stickman
actually preparing the food himself he
hands it over to the cook so he passes
on the required information for the cook
to actually cook the food
now the cook actually prepares the food
and then hands it over back to our
stickman step 3 is the same consolidate
and decorate the food and then step 4
handed back to the customer now this is
a slight improvement from the previous
situation that our stickman was it he
had to do everything himself but this
time he has a cook to prepare the food
and then the rest of the stuff was
managed by the Stig man well this is
slightly better but then our stickman
still anticipates problems when there
are a lot more people who are going to
come in now again he has a call with
this programmer friend and the
programmer friend says hey this is like
using beans which take care of the
business service now what does he mean
by that let's take an example of a web
application that uses a servlet but it
also uses business service Java beans
now the servlet the first step of the
servlet is to get the request parameters
when the user makes a request and then
instead of connecting to the database to
do the processing itself it calls a
method of a beam there is another beam
which takes care of you know connecting
to the database retrieving the results
and all that stuff so it publishes some
methods and the sublet does not prepare
the food itself it does not connect to
the database itself it calls a method of
the beam and now the beam connects to
the database and returns the response
data it is raw data now the the raw data
is a response the return of the business
service method that's called by the
servlet now the servlet takes the data
formats the results to HTML and sends it
back now this is an improvement from the
previous situation where the servlet did
all the processing itself ok so now our
stickman gets another idea he wants to
improve the process yet again and he
brings in another recruit into the
restaurant this is a person who
specializes in decorating the fool now
what happens is when a customer comes in
this is the flow step one our stickman
gets the customer's orders step two
passes on the order to the cook the cook
progressed the food and then step three
instead of decorating the food himself
the stickman passes the cooked food to
the food decorator a new employee who
specializes in decorating the food so
the stickman passes the foot to that
person the decorator
decorates the food and then the stickman
gets the tree and hands it back to the
customer now this is a drastic
improvement from our first situation
where our stickman did all the work
himself now there are two new recruits
there's one person who prepares the food
and there's one person who's in charge
of presenting the food and then our
stickman still is the main guy who
orchestrates all this the stickman goes
to the customer gets the order passes it
on to the cook and then gets the
the cooked food passes down to the
presenter and then gets the food back to
the customer so these are the three
rules that actually the stick man ends
up with and then this you know provides
a very good efficiency and then either
strand becomes a huge hit and then now
our stickman gives a call to his
programming friend and then our
programming friend says that sounds like
MVC now this is what MVC conceptually is
now what does an MVC do the MVC consists
of a sublet with a business service bean
as well as a JSP now what are the steps
the servlet gets the request parameters
passes the request parameters to a
business service method the business
service method works with the database
does the processing and then the results
are passed to a JSP the JSP takes care
of handling the HTML formatting and all
that stuff and then the results are
passed back to the user note one
difference here the JSP is directly
passed to the user of the servlet takes
the data and passes it to the JSP the
JSP does not return the HTML back to the
servlet it doesn't really need to
because this already has the formatted
HTML this directly goes to the user so
it's almost as if the presenter is
taking the data and I'm sorry the
presenter is taking the food and passing
it on to the customer so this is a
slight deviation from the analogy but
apart from that the main rules are the
same you have the servlet which is the
controller which is the you know a
stickman who acts as a waiter and then
you have the business service bean which
is the cook and then you have the JSP
which is the presenter the normally what
will happen in this kind of a flow is
something like this now having
understood this we are in a good
position to define what MVC is what
Model View and controllers are so C
stands for the controller the person who
controls everything the person who
orchestrates everything that happens
be the servlet here the waiter or the
stickman in our restaurant analogy now
the servlet is controlling how the flow
of execution should happen and there
could be multiple means over here there
could be multiple jsps over here and the
servlet orchestrate how the flow of
control should happen it can you know it
looks at the input parameters the
request parameters and it decides which
methods of which beans need to be called
and then it also decides which JSP needs
to be referred to in order to present
the data now you might wonder what
happens if there are multiple service
we're talking about just one servlet
here now what if there are multiple
servlet they could be but in that case
there has to be some kind of a front
controller that has to be one particular
entry point which decides which servlet
has to be you know pick up the execution
it could be a filter over here which you
know make sure that that gets triggered
before the servlets pick up the
execution but then the point here is
that there has to be only one controller
the controller looks at the request
parameters and then decides how the flow
of execution needs to take place now
this leads us to model view and
controllers so model happens to be the
business service it could also be a
class calling a business service figure
you know it could there could be
multiple elements there but you need to
think about the concepts here to
understand what this pattern actually
advises the pattern advises that there
is one particular entity that is solely
concerned with getting the data
providing the data and being the data
itself different definitions of module
and different documents some people call
the the role of getting the data from
the database doing the processing you
know the role of the cook as the model
the role of the business of this bean as
the model and some other definitions say
that the data that's actually getting
retrieved is the model and I think it's
safe to think of them both as model you
need to think of both the data of the
application as well
the behavior that you know that pulls up
the data both of them together form what
we call as the model the view is what
actually renders the model into a form
that's actually displayable that's
presentable to the user this is this is
the UI part of it so the business and
the data part of it is the model and UI
part of it is the view and then the
controller is the one who orchestrates
them both it pass passes the necessary
data to the model lets it do its work
and then it calls the right view in
order to do the presentation let's the
view do its work and it orchestrates the
entire flow now why do we need MVC why
do we need this distinction between
three different rules well some of the
concepts are obvious if you look at the
restaurant analogy provided our stickman
hire cook first of all the stigma did
not want to do all the rules by himself
because there was quite a lot of rules
that needed to be done but some of the
other advantages are now let's say you
know the stickman wants to try out new
cuisines to be made available in the
restaurant now instead of learning the
cuisines himself what the stickman can
is hire a new cook who is a specialist
in those cuisines and then when the
order comes for those cuisines all that
the stickman has to do is to pass the
order to the right cook so they could be
multiple cooks and the statement does
not have to worry about learning new
things to cook so that would be the
first advantage the controller is
separated from the module the controller
does not really have to know what the
model does the controller does not have
to know what the databases it pulls in
the data all that stuff the controller
just worries about taking the user input
and then passing it to the right model
the second advantage is the view is
separated from the model the cook does
not have to worry about how to you know
make the food presentable to the user
the cook just worries about how to make
it taste good
and then the presenter is the person
who's actually arranging the food and
making it presentable so that's the
second advantage some of the side
benefits are that the view can change
without the model having to change that
the processing could be the same with UI
could be different depending on the type
of application say now you can have a
business service beam that is used in a
web application as well as in a desktop
application and the business service
beam does not have to change only the
view has to change if it's a web
application it has to display HTML and
if it's a desktop application it has to
display you know controls in the you
know in the UI of the application itself
so this distinction is handy if you want
to change the UI part of it without
having to change the the core business
service part of it and then the third
distinction is of course the third
advantage is that the view is separated
from the controller again the controller
does not have to worry about how the
presentation happens there could be
multiple views catering to different
different types of application and then
the controller just calls upon the right
view depending on the user input so
these are some of the reasons why MVC is
a popular pattern there is separation of
concerns and there is minimal change to
the other rules if any one of the rules
happens to change now there are multiple
MVC frameworks that are just this
concept now what we've seen as MVC is
actually a pattern it's a it's an
architecture pattern that some people
would say it's the way you would
architect application and we see
frameworks are actually classes and
libraries that help you if you architect
your application in the MVC pattern so
if you choose a MVC pattern then there
are a few things that you will have to
do in your application and MSE
frameworks provide you the foundation on
which you can build your own application
and there are a lot of different MVC
frameworks you know if you just look at
the web application frameworks alone
there are lots of them and then there
are other wave you know MVC frameworks
that are not particular to a web
application you could have an MVC
framework for desktop applications you
could have MVC framework for mobile
applications and so on so different MVC
frameworks have different
implementations of these concepts but
then the core concepts of
reviewing controller that we've just
discussed are the same so they provide
some pre-built classes for these core
concepts and then we can extend them and
build our application using those
frameworks so some of the popular Java
web MVC frameworks have listed over here
and of course this is not a complete
list there are plenty more and you know
some of them have really gained traction
or fleet and you most of the web
applications that you would write you
would be using some MVC framework or
some MVC library or the other and it's
very likely that the MVC framework that
you use is one of them in this list</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
