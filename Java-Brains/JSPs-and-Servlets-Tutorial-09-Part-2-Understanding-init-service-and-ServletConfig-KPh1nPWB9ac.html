extending their I should it be something
so I'll show you a trick that can help
you really understand what's going on
the demoscene sphere here you can
actually open up the code for
httpservlet by pressing control and then
clicking on the game as you have
downloaded the tomcat source related to
eclipse mention dynamically disappear
they handle them that discord and do
that and then come back to this tutorial
once you do that in to be able to do
this was the schedule click on class
name and you actually took a class so
this is the source code of the HTTP
server agreement if I come yet now here
you can see HTTP servlet extends the
general subject they will be seen that
now I can do a control click on the
generate servlet and I open up the
generate servlet code itself it's easier
genrich's a little cementing servlet and
so they've gone fake we don't have to
worry about that as it now let's let's
just look at people
the inheritance pattern so we have the
year it shouldn't be something here and
the end result is here so let's look at
the genetics and we'll start with this
one
so today of like time you can see all
the methods that the genitive sublet has
so then a lot of methods which we have
not seen here but we'll look at the ones
that we are talking about now we have
the init circuit conflict failure so we
already spoke about this init method
takes an object of servlet conflict as a
parameter and see what it does it does
not conflict it will start it so it's
actually having a little fun finding and
then it's placing the input value into
this front leg and then it's actually
calling the blank infinite another it
without any power we begin another thing
that we saw so what is this integral
time it is doing because nothing so will
you come back to this dependence and
write this by this is done while
recording on the head that that use is
not doing anything so but as far as
image method is considered what it does
it takes this parameter so that config
file
we don't know what this is yet but it's
taking this country parameter and then
it's going to put its own widget that's
all that it does
so this config is actually handed over
to this by Top Cat we look at what this
party is and how we can use the tree but
for now this is what it does so this is
the first method that gets executed when
the object is created we have the
conflict pastor word and it's so you
save the con taken from the video the
next now we can request now the service
method that's to run and here's a
service member the service method takes
two parameters whether the sunlight
request and one of this of their
response and what is it - it does not do
anything again the service method
exhaust is actually implemented the ball
implementation is indirectly we serve
that class because it's it takes care of
HTTP protocol specific activities but
the service weather has been defined
which ended somewhere and it just has a
defined so now we look at the it should
give me some replies and the HTTP
servlet class that's not overwriting in
it you can see this moving affected here
but you just have the service method
over again so let's have a look at what
it does sometimes it takes the subject
you per service of the response and then
it defines to
or the HDTV some that and the HTTP sorry
density some little person
httpservletresponse takes the input
request and response and then it can sit
into HTTP for your business and
httpservletresponse so this HTTP servlet
class as used that the question the
response our expiry is actually your
type httpservletrequest
and it should be peace and it was fine
which is fair enough because we know
that the facilities of the class being
through if you give me further part so
with the represent response that it
gives will also HTTP so if it is not
then it flows an exception saying it's
an unusually request so if this is not
related and so difficult about that
other why are you calling me just blew
an exit when it gets out of this
education but it's been if this casting
is fine website then it actually calls
another service method here but this
takes this does not take the summer the
presence of their response notice it
takes these two objects guitar HTTP
several people send HTTP Salinas so
behind the scenes HTTP servlet class
until it's another service method but
this one takes the HTTP symmetrical send
HTTP servlet response so let's have a
look at that method they here
service method but they should be
because dust that's fairly
straightforward is it takes the method
from the request object HTTP request
some little boost has a get method so it
takes the method and then it says if it
said you end then it calls the to get if
it is head then impose a new head that's
opposed it or the to post and so on
there are a few other things that's
happening over here but you have to
worry about it or you need to know is
that based on the request it's calling a
little force like you are and so what is
the do here in the do for loop here
we've already seen this in a previous
tutorial let's go to get let's go eat so
the new post this consumer said saying
when I cannot allow an automatic this
event money protocol is here so one of
them isn't somebody just load on it so
we do not want this to run so it's the
anticipated to force execution
the state will get a little post request
which happens to the assembly then right
so we have to post an art server class
so that that does not run the service
nothing that we saw earlier this guy
here
takes this and you know it calls to get
new polls for the to get if it's a can't
force it suppose so when the does that
we will supply those methods so that our
methods they do get a power sublevel to
post on our sublet runs and that's what
the process the request and the response
and of course instant notice will be
posted the request and response and
that's what actually remembers so this
is repeats the code that they're
actually sending yes this peak value in
to get the logic oscillate this and
respond to the casting and I can a
previous method so we get this response
officially he said what your question is
we are okay so we learnt about the init
method and the service man
the service method is not something that
we would use you're all right off it but
the init method has a very good purpose
since we know that that's the first
method that run it is up with this width
of object initiator we can overwrite the
init method to write code that which we
want to run when the subject object is
created for the first time so in each
realization code like opening a database
connection or something like that can be
done in the init method which is
overwritten so what we need to do is we
need to alright the init method here
make it all right init method here but
we need to make sure that if they all
either be either call the super init
method you need to call this or we need
to make sure that we're taking this one
figure parameter the figuring and we're
putting it in as a member variable
because this is a very important thing
that the init method does even though we
don't know what this contact is right
now we should know that something that
it's passed to us I don't care and then
you know init method by default puts it
into comment by really visible taxable
in our serve so this little context can
be used here so we can use a conflict
okay but if we all write this init
method with our own init method we need
to make sure that this is happening we
deduce you can't record to that we came
so just to avoid all this what we do is
instead of or adding this init method
which takes the conflict parameter we
can override it method here which does
not take a parameter we know that this
is called because this init method calls
this init method which takes the
parameter calls a method which does not
take a parameter so this is kind of a
utility method that has been introduced
which makes it easy to overwrite or
where we do not need the servlet
conflict
so either way if you overwrite this you
don't worry about the server config we
know that the Bates init method take
this property and saves it in a member
variable and then we can feel it over
like this with whatever we want so again
a common use case would be you here
creating a database connection you want
alright then is method in your sublet
and create the database management of
course you should remember that this is
not something that you is acute across
of this every cell let will have its own
init method so we need to do something
that is specific to this so below so
another thing you know that we can say
in product or business method is of
course the server configure so what is
the Soviet country it is some
configuration values that you can
redefine and this solid config object
would contain that application parameter
so let's say for example I want to have
a user
being passed to the server as you know
as a standard being able instead of
doing all this you know that I'm taking
this username as a parameter I wanted to
be by default a particular value so that
whenever the sublet starts that username
will be available inside the server
so where do now is I'll have a string as
the default username and I set it in
Chile in the sublet itself and it even
if there are no parameters that are
passed the other requests and session
and context would be home but the
advantage will be there by default the
subject projects so in order to set a
value I can use annotations along with
these properties sure
wrapping around
me
 you
and put Sandow this will set the default
users parameter to the value okay now if
we visualize the in advance and have one
parameter difficulty for user and the
value is low now in order to use this in
our methods then you use the servlet but
we have seen this in init method
exploration and other genrich's of the
class we saw that there is a server
config of let's pass to D equal in is
metal so this development is inadequate
the sublet config object a little
frantic member of the class so this
member will be able to delete for us as
well so we can access this by using this
dot get cut the tunnel so this will give
us this of the coffee and the sublet
config has it in it parameter map so
let's get in a parameter method can be
used to pull up this valley so I know if
I pass this main value here I can get
the response as well
so this will give us I can shape value
that they said take charge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
