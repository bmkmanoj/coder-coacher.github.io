even this one is what's called a
function declaration you are declaring a
function it is your you're saying hey
this is a function and this is the logic
that I want to execute when that
function is called okay so this is
typically referred to as function
declaration function declaration is one
of two ways in which you can create
functions there are two primary ways I
should say the other primary way of
creating functions is what's called a
function expression in order to explain
what function expression is I should
tell you about functions in JavaScript
and their peculiar nature when compared
to methods in C++ and Java you remember
in unit 1 I mentioned that functions in
JavaScript are what are called
first class values which means that
functions are actually values in
JavaScript just as much as a string as a
value or the number hundred as a value
similarly functions are also values okay
this is different from the function
returning a value functions return a
value in all those languages but the
function itself is a value in JavaScript
okay let me demonstrate that I'm going
to clear all this thing out I think of a
typical or you know variable holding a
value so let's say I have a bar a equals
hello all right so what am i doing here
I'm having an inline string called hello
which is a value and assigning the value
to a variable which is a okay similarly
I can create a variable and say F and
then create a function and assign a
function to the variable okay
I'm not executing the function and
assigning the return type okay I'm
assigning the function itself function
is a thing which gets assigned to the
variable okay it's a little bit weird
but go with me here so let's say I have
a wire f equals and just like I created
an inline string I can create an inline
function so let's say I have a function
I'm going to call this foo and
okay I have console.log hello alright so
with this I have created a function and
assigned it to the variable F okay this
this part is what we saw before right
this was a function declaration it
declared a function called foo not only
can you do that you can take that
declared function and assign it to the
variable F in this case now F is going
to contain the function okay the
function is not executed it I cannot
stress that enough lot of people see
this and go hey foo is going to execute
and then the returned values assigned to
F no that doesn't happen the function
itself is assigned to F okay now once
the function is assigned to a variable
you can use that variable in order to
execute the function okay so wherever I
have something like this where F
contains the function now I can say F
open closed just like I could with the
other function declaration that we did
before okay now when I do this
javascript is going to say okay F is
being executed as a function so let me
check the value of F and see if that
value happens to be a function instance
turns out it's a function instance so
the JavaScript interpreter is going to
execute that function and console dot
log should be printed on you know the
hello should be printed on the console
let's try that and there you go
lo gets printed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
