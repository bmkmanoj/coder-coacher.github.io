something called type inference which is
very important in order to figure out
what type of your lambda is added what
are the types of the data that it deals
with in order to illustrate that I'm
going to create a new class here which
is called type inference example and
this is going to have main method and
here I'm going to create an inner class
here to demonstrate the string length
functionality so let's say I have an
interface string length lambda we don't
have to call all our lambda interfaces
as ending with lambda though it's just
something I'm doing just to make things
clear so I want to create a lambda which
is a function that takes in a string and
it returns the length of that string so
I'm going to have to create and in get
length and it takes in a string yes now
here's what happens now with my variable
I can say string length lambda my lambda
equals and I can define the lambda
expression here so I can say string s
and then this is going to done s start
length right this will work fine and I
can call my lambda by doing a my lambda
dot get length okay so for all practical
purposes this lambda behaves as an
instance of this interface we can pass
in a string here which is a low lambda
and let me print this to the console
okay if I execute this I'm going to get
the length of this string now what's
happening here is when I'm using this
type to assign this lambda to this
variable the Java compiler says okay I
need to match this lambda expression
with this particular type so it figures
out what the type is based on the
left-hand side over here and there are
multiple other ways in which we can do
this in the greeting class sorry in the
greeter class you remember here that we
could pass in an argument directly to
the greeter grid method you see here now
I'm using this lambda expression I'm
putting it in a variable called lambda
greeting and then I'm passing it through
what I could have done was just done
this in line rather than having it be a
variable this will work too but what's
happening is the Java compiler says okay
this is the lambda expression that I
need to be used now where is it going
it's going to this greet method which
takes in a greeting interface now the
compiler tries to match this lambda
expression with that creating interface
because of the fact that you're using
this as a greeting interface right
you're basically saying I want to use
this lambda expression as something that
is a greeting right that's type
inference for you so the thing about
having this kind of a binding between a
lambda expression and an interface is
that you can actually make the syntax a
little bit shorter now if you remember
we removed that are done from the lambda
because it's obvious what the lambda is
returning right we said we don't have to
return something like int in the lambda
expression because the compiler can
figure it out says okay this is a start
length so it must be returning in it now
this magic about having an interface
that backs these lambdas is that the
compiler actually has more information
about this function so it says I see an
input argument which is a string of s so
well you don't really have to provide
this string over here so you can
actually get rid of this
so this still works this is also a valid
lambda expression I can get rid off the
type information off the input arguments
because this is going to this variable
of type string length lambda and
Strickland lambda has an input argument
define this type string so this will
still work me run this to make sure this
still works and it still does and
finally here is another shortcut if you
have just one input argument to your
lambda you don't have to specify the
parentheses so we get rid of this
parentheses
this is still a valid lambda when there
is one input argument you have to
specify the type because it figures out
the type from the interface you don't
have to specify the parentheses you just
have to specify the input argument and
then do a start length so let's run this
and we still get 12 and this is the
shortest and the most compact way in
which we can write this lambda and I
promise I'm not going to remove any more
code if I remove any more there's not
going to be any code left so this is a
valid lambda expression which is a
function that takes in an argument what
argument is it look at the interface
it's a string so it takes in a string
argument and it returns a start length
and what is the type well again look at
the interface it's an int and of course
the compiler can also figure out from
the body itself so this is really really
cool now this can go into a method
argument if you have and if you have
like a method which takes in a string
length lambda let me actually write this
out so let's say I have this public and
I'm going to make this as static as well
I call this print lambda and it's going
to take in a string length lambda and
it's going to do a system dot out I'll
odd the method kaitland off
hello lambda need to make this avoid so
what does static method does is it takes
in a lambda expression and it calls it
with a string that prints the result now
what I can do is call this instead of
calling it right here I can take this
lambda expression and call print lambda
with this lambda expression right I'm
just putting it right there in line and
if I were to run this I'm still going to
get the value 12 right this is type
influence in action there are a lot of
things that the compiler is inferring
from your code it's kind of inferring
what the input argument type is what the
return type is all depending on what the
type of that interface is and where
you're sending that lambda expression</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
