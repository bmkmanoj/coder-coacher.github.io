welcome to unit 3 in this unit you're
going to learn about prototypes in
JavaScript prototypes is a concept in
JavaScript which lets you build objects
using a template or a blueprint a lot of
object-oriented programming languages
have a concept of using a blueprint to
create objects and the way you create
this blueprint is by using what's called
classes we create a class which forms
that blueprint a rich forms that
template and then you creates objects
out of them but JavaScript does not have
the concept of classes what it does have
is the prototype concept and you can use
the concept of prototypes build some
kind of a blueprint or some kind of a
template which influences objects it's
not exactly equivalent to classes
because you don't create instances off a
prototype however you can create
behaviors that affect multiple objects
by using prototypes if that does not
make sense don't worry about it we're
going to look at prototypes and you'll
see how that lets you build objects in
this manner so for a lot of people
familiar with the class-based
object-oriented programming languages
like Java or C++ objects are kind of
synonymous with class instances for
people who've been working with those
languages you think of an object as an
instance of a class and you the only way
to create an object is by saying that
you want it to be an instance of a
particular class you don't just create
an object out of thin air it has to be
off a specific class and now that you've
seen how objects work in JavaScript you
know that that's not the case you can
just create objects out of thin air it's
not class-based in JavaScript so the
traditional model are having methods of
classes it doesn't apply in JavaScript
in the case of JavaScript there are no
methods of objects as such object just
has properties and the property could be
another object it could be a primitive
type or it could be a function so if the
property is a function then it somehow
looks like it's a method of an object
but it's not quite let's take this
example of the bicycle class that we've
looked in the previous unit I am
creating this using a constructor and I
have a new instance of this object
assigned to
with the variable bicycle one now this
object that gets assigned to by school
bond is going to have a bunch of
properties on it it's going to have a
property called cadence a property
called speed gear tie pressure and a
property called inflate tires these
properties which are primitives should
be obvious they are properties off this
object which happen to contain a
primitive value but let's take a look at
this function now what happens when a
constructor is called is that this
function executes and one of the thing
that this function does is apart from
assigning all these other properties it
assigns a property which is this inline
function so this inline function
expression basically causes the
interpreter to create a function object
and then create a property call inflate
tires and assign the reference of that
function to inflate tires property the
reason why it's important to remember
this is that this function the inline
function expression that is written over
here essentially causes a new function
to be created every time this
constructor is called right there's a
new function object that gets created
and every bicycle that gets up gets
created in every instance of this object
that gets created as a result of calling
this constructor creates a new copy of
this function object all right so if I
were to make a copy of this and I call
this bicycle to now bicycle one has a
function object was created when this
function expression was called the
bicycle do has another function object
was created than this function
expression was caught
so you're basically clearing copies of
it now imagine you are building like an
employee management system where you
have like a thousand employees each
function of this employee object would
get duplicated will be that many copies
right so this is different from the
class-based way of thinking about this
in a traditional class based model in
order to create an object what you would
first need to do is create a class the
class has the definition of the object
right it's the blueprint it has although
you know the member variables as well as
the methods that the class needs to
contain and now when you create objects
based on the class the object kind of
owns those methods so the object knows
what those methods are because it is
associated with the class so there is
one copy of the methods then every
object is kind of
you know it's able to refer to that
existing copy so this is different from
constructor functions that you've just
seen where each object gets a copy this
is wasteful and there should be a better
way to do this in JavaScript and it
turns out there is it's just not classes
there are no concept of classes in
JavaScript there is a way to have this
method or the behavior of objects
defined in one place and have it kind of
inherited again forget what you've known
about classes and object inheritance and
all those things in JavaScript it's a
little bit different even though we
happen to use some of the same
terminologies I encourage you to look at
the next few tutorials with an open mind
to kind of understand how JavaScript
does this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
