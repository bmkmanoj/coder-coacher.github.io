implement an API which does basic auth
so it expects the client to send basic
authentication information in the header
and will write an API endpoint that is
accessible only to a particular
combination of user ID and password send
using basic auth so what I'm going to do
first is create an API endpoint which is
secured it needs a particular username
and password so I have this secured
resource I'm going to annotate it with
at pad we call this secure so the path
is going to be slash secured and I'll
have a method here which is a secured
method and use a get annotation and it's
basically accessible at the path message
it does message plaintext so the API
request URL is slash secured slash
message why we have the name secured
over here there is nothing here that's
secured right it is just another API
endpoint that is accessible at a given
location for a get request and it
returns this piece of text this API
needs login it currently does not lean
need login so we're going to fix that so
the way to make this secure is to check
if a request that's coming in has basic
authentication information okay so I
could do this here
I could say OK in the secured method I
examine the header and see if it has
basic art but I'm going to implement
this using filters because it's very
likely that this is not the only method
that needs authentication there could be
a bunch more ok so I'm going to
implement a filter so that this becomes
a cross-cutting concern I make sure that
a bunch of requests a bunch of API
endpoints are all secure so I'm going to
create a security filter which checks
this for us
so I'm going to implement this as the
request filter because we are examining
the requests so this implements
container request filter now if I add
the unimplemented methods we get the
filter method that we know now it
accepts the container request context
rename this to request context
and now here is where I can check if the
request has basic authentication
information now do we get the basic cot
information we know that there is a
specific key in the header that we are
looking for and the key is authorization
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create this constant over here which is
a string constant which says
authorization header equals this
particular straight authorization this
is the key that we're looking for in the
header now I can access all the headers
from the request context so I do a
request context get headers and since
this is a map I can do a get off the key
which is authorization header and now I
have all the header values which have
authorization ideally there should be
just one but this method signature
returns a list so what I'm going to do
next is check if there is indeed an
authorization header there should be
ideally just one like I mentioned so I
make sure there is at least one so if
the size is greater than zero I'm gonna
examine the header if the size is equal
to zero that means if the request does
not have any authorization header that
I'll deal with that scenario after this
right but in this F block I'm making
sure that there is at least one
authorization header key so if the size
is greater than zero what I'm going to
do is I'm going to do a header get off
zero again assuming that there is just
one if there are more I'm just picking
the first one that has the key
authorization now I have the auth token
what I'm going to do next is replace the
word basic so I'm going to declare this
constant which is authorization header
prefix I'm going to define this as basic
space this is what we need to take out
from the auth token so I'm going to
replace first the basic space string
from the auth token and I'm assigning it
to auth token so it'll be the original
string will be basic space and the
base64 encoded string I'm taking out the
basic space from the string so all I'm
left with is the base64 encoded string
now I can take
the string and do a base64 decode okay
so this is what I use I use the utility
that comes with Jersey you see here
there is an import from our GlassFish
Jersey internal you tell base64 you can
use any basics for util of your choice I
just happen to use the one that comes
with Jersey so I'm going to do a base64
dot decode as string the auth token
which is the encoded token and now I
have the decoded string which would
ideally be username colon password now I
can take this user name colon password
and split it to get the username as a
separate string and a password as a
separate string so I do that by doing a
string tokenizer off decoded string and
the delimiter is the colon symbol and
now I have the username which is the
first token and the password which is
the second token now I have these two
now this is where I can do
authentication if I have authentication
information is it in a database or some
kind of a business service I can check
if the username and password match for
the sake of this tutorial I'm going to
do a very rudimentary check I'm going to
check if the username is equal to user
and the password is equal to password if
that's the case then we have an
authenticated user I know it's silly but
it's it serves the purpose for now we
don't want to get into designing
business services and database requests
for this so I have a benefit over here
and if this works fine I just return it
if the user and the password match I
just do a return so if either done from
the filter that means that Jack's iris
is now free to proceed with the actual
request okay now if this is not to be
the case if the username and password do
not match what I expect are if the
authorization header itself does not
have the basic auth value I need to
handle the error scenario I need to make
sure that this request does not go
through right there is the resource
should not get this request because it's
not authenticated so what I do is I do a
response
and I built this on etiquette and not
indicated response I built this
unauthorized response which is response
that status of unauthorized so
unauthorized is an enumeration which
says that whatever request you have is
not authorized and I built the entity
which is a string which is the user
cannot access the resource just some
error message you can have a more
detailed at an object over here but I'm
just using a string here and then I do a
dot build and now I have a response I
need to send this response so I do a
request context dot a board width so a
bar twit is the method of request
context which lets you abort the request
from your filter you don't want the
requests going through here right you're
outside the if you don't want this
request to go through if it's executing
this line of code so you see a Bart
whether it's a Ajax RS abort this
request because it's not authenticated I
don't want this to go through and you
pass in the response that you want to
send back which is the response that
I've constructed over here which is the
unauthorized response okay now if I were
to do just this it's going to make every
API secure right so every request that
comes to this API it is going to get
through the security filter which is
going to execute the splitter method and
it's going to look for this right so now
every endpoint in this project is secure
we don't want to do that we want to
secure only a certain subset off the
api's now let's say I want to secure
only the API switch have the URL secure
so you see here I have secured in the
path now let's say I just want to secure
the methods inside this right so I want
to check if the URL contains the word
secured in which case I do all this
stuff if not I just let the user go
through okay so I'm going to wrap this
whole thing in and if block I have a
secured constant over here for the
portion of the URL that we need and now
I'm going to wrap this whole thing in an
if block say if the request context dot
get URI info I want to check the URI dot
get path I'm going to get the part of
this URI
I check if it contains the secure URL
prefix if it contains the word secured
and only if that's to be true I do all
this authentication if not then this
method is a no op right and checks out
this is free to call whatever API the
request comes for before you run this
make sure you have the add provider
annotation because this is the filter it
is a provider so that has to be
annotated with add provider now let's
execute this application and we'll make
a call to this endpoint secured slash
message and let me actually change this
to see it's secure all right so when I
make a call to slash a a bi context
slash secured slash message without any
authentication information it should
give me an error it should give me this
unauthorized error and if I do add the
authentication information which is the
username being user and the password
being password it should show me the
response that say is this API is secure
so let's try this out all right so I'm
gonna open postman I'm going to make a
get request to the secured URL the VPI
secured message without any
authentication information if I hit Send
well I get a nullpointerexception which
is interesting from security filter I
guess I'm not handling a null which is
over here make sure what header is not
equal to null because if you're not
sending any authentication information
this apparently is a null all right so
let's do this again and now we get the
error the user cannot access the
resource with a 401 unauthorized just
like we expected it to right I'm not
using any authentication information
over here which is why I get
unauthorized let me add authentication
information I'm going to go to basic
auth and I'm going to add the
authentication that the filter expects
so the username is user the password is
password I'm going to refresh headers so
now I have authorization
with the basic art encoded string now if
I had send now we get access to the
secured resource now let me try with an
incorrect username and password I'm
going to refresh header again if I hit
Send I cannot access the resource all
right so this is working like it should
it's basically the security filter which
is checking certain endpoints for the
availability of the authentication
information in the header and it decodes
it and makes sure that the user name in
the password is correct this is an
implementation of basic got like I
mentioned it's basic so I thought this
would be a good introduction
implementing more complex authentication
is in a similar pattern right you look
you implement a filter which is your
security filter what you do in this
method differs depending on what the
authentication mechanism is but the fact
that you need the security filter and
the fact that you filter out certain
URLs depending on what you want to
protect and all that stuff so those
concepts are pretty much the same when
it comes to implementing this kind of
authentication with jax-rs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
