tutorial we'll look at how we can use
the Spring Framework along with the
hibernate framework hibernate is an ORM
framework and have covered the concepts
of hibernate in a separate tutorial
series if you're interested in learning
hibernate I encourage you to go and
check that out in this tutorial we will
look at how we can actually use
hibernate in a spring application and
we'll also look at how we can use some
of the concepts of spring to make it
easier to integrate hibernate to our
application bring in hibernate a
lightweight frameworks and the way
they've been architected it's actually
very easy to couple them both and it's
very common to see a combination of
spring and hibernate in a lot of
production applications so here in this
is something that we did in our previous
tutorial we had a JDBC Dao
implementation and it had a method that
used the JDBC template in order to fetch
the data from the database so we used
different methods of this JDBC template
in order to fetch the data well in
hibernate there's something similar we
have a session object and we use
different methods of the session object
to fetch the data so this kind of ties
in with the spring concept of beans
because if you think of how we would
acquire a session object in hibernate
that is through a separate factory
object called as a session Factory and
the session Factory
is a pretty expensive object you
wouldn't want to have multiple session
factories getting instantiated all over
in the code you would want to have one
session factory object for one
connection to the database and then
create different session objects
depending on when you need the
interaction to happen so the session
Factory is a singleton so to speak
because there is only one object per
application and this ties in with the
spring beam concept of a singleton if
you remember we saw there were two basic
types of spring beans one was singleton
and the other one was prototype you use
a singleton beam when
would want to have only one instance
with the beam throughout your
application and while it's not strictly
the Java definition of singleton in the
context of spring it serves the purpose
for having one object for the entire
application one of the simplest ways to
integrate hibernate with spring is to
have a beam for the session Factory and
make it as a singleton and in your do
classes just get that beam
you know inject the beam dependency and
then get a session from the session
factory so as simple as that
let's quickly implement that in this
project so again this project uses a
JDBC template I have a Diego which has a
method that uses the JDBC template I'm
going to create a new dayn pier and I'm
going to use hibernate to do the same
functionality to get the circle count
but I'm going to create this in a new
Diego which uses hibernate instead well
ideally I would have liked to use an
interface over here because right now
you know if I have to make a change I
need to change this to a you know
hibernate DUI MPL or something else and
get that being injected so okay so
what's the first step to integrate
hibernate into any application you would
need the libraries I have a separate
tutorial in the hibernate series which
talks about how to set up your
application to use hibernate and I
talked about how to download the jars
and setup library in Eclipse for those
jars I will assume here in this tutorial
in the interest of time that you have
gone through that video and you have a
library for hibernate to set up in your
Eclipse IDE so once you've done that all
you need to do is right-click on the
project go to properties and go to the
Java build path and here in the
libraries tab you would need to add your
user library so I will say add library
use a library and I have the hibernate
library over here so I'll just check
that and click finish and now we have
the hibernate library added to our class
path with all the included jar files ok
so the next step would be to create a
new Dao
again as I said so this da
uses JDBC I'm going to create a new
Diego which uses hibernate so I'm going
to create a new Java class either call
this I've been a dy ampere and click
finish
okay so in this hibernate dy MPL I
intend to use just one method which is
the get circle count so I'm going to
copy the method from here because I'll
be changing it to use hibernate but then
this is the same signature okay so in
order to use hibernate in this method
what I would need to do is to use a
session object I would need to have a
session factory and from the session
factory I will need a session and once I
have the session object I can use the
create query method to you know make
queries and then run them so how would I
get a session factory here in the first
place well I will declare a member
variable private session factory session
factory and then I will generate the
getters and setters of course I'll
import session factory from our
hibernate and then generate the getters
and setters ok so now I have that here
now
what I need to do is I need to
initialize the session factory and have
that injected into this Dao again you
wouldn't want to create a new session
factory for each and every TA or each
and every method in your Diego you would
need to have one common session factory
throughout your application so you would
need to have the session factory
singleton being so let's create a bean
which initializes the session
Singleton's will have been tagged over
here ID session factory class equals now
for what would the class be more way in
which spring helps us not only do we use
spring to create the beam as a singleton
we can also use a support class yes just
like we have the support classes for the
data source and the JDBC we also have
support classes for hibernate spring has
provided us support classes when we
using hibernate so we can use that we'll
be using the spring framework so the
support class here that I will use is
this one it's our spring framework ORM
hibernate 3 annotation and the beam is
annotation session factory beam now the
- III in the package actually denotes
the new support classes that spring has
introduced for hibernate 3 versus the
earlier support classes 5-minute - which
just had hibernate in the name so - in
order to get the new classes the package
name is hibernate 3 so if you using
hibernate 3 we would use this package
name in this class ok so now this is the
class name and I have a beam so this
will tell spring that it needs to
instantiate a beam of this class and
provide it as a singleton but then in
order to instantiate a session factory
beam you would need to know what the
database is and if you were using
hibernate without spring we would use a
configuration file
we had a hibernate dot C of G dot XML
which had all the details about
configuring how hibernate behaves well
in this scenario will be using hibernate
with spring we don't need that
configuration file we can actually
specify the you know the configuration
parameters for hibernate in this beam
definition itself so I can have
properties set for this beam and I can
provide the data source and a whole lot
of other hibernate properties over here
itself
now why are we doing this why do we not
need the configuration file
well the configuration file in hibernate
was there to make all these things
configurable without having to change
the source code well you could have a
new session factory and then provide all
the configuration parameters in the code
itself but the whole reason why we had a
configuration file is that you can
change it in the XML itself without
having to change the code that feature
is there and spring anyway now you have
a beam definition you can anyways
provide all the properties in an XML
itself so there's no need to create a
different example for the purpose we can
use those configuration parameters set
in this XML file itself
so let's reset the palette we know the
properties for the session factory so
the first property happens to be the
data source we need to provide the
information about the data base to the
session factory so the cabinet can go
ahead and connect to that database so I
have I have a property name equals data
source and I refer to the existing data
source B so here I already have it so I
will refer to this B and that's it so
now this hibernate being knows what the
data source is what the databases end
where to connect so this data source
beam has all the required information
for hibernate to connect to the database
ok so the next property that we can set
is the packages to scan we had this
property of called packages to scan to
tell hibernate what are the packages
where hibernate needs to check for the
DT or the model object you know that
hibernate is an ORM framework which
means we need to have model objects and
we also need to provide information to
hibernate or have to map those model
objects to tables in the database so I
plan to use annotated model objects
which is the annotations that we have
covered in detail in the hibernate
tutorial I plan to use a circle model
object and annotated with the required
annotation so that hibernate knows what
table and the columns are and that is
also the reason why I have used the
annotation session Factory being over
here because I plan to use annotations
in this project you can look up the
documentation to look at other session
Factory beans that spring provides as
support classes ok so now that we have
plan to use annotations in the model
objects we need to provide information
to hibernate about what package they are
in so I provide the property over here
property and property is packages to
scan and the value the value happens to
be the package where I have the model
which is this one org Kaushik Java brain
start model okay so this lets hibernate
check this package for annotated classes
now we have a circle model class already
i will be annotating this one but let's
complete this configuration first ok so
now the other important information that
we need to provide is the dialect we
have configured this as well in the
hibernate tutorial we need to tell
hibernate what is the dialect or what is
a language that it needs to use when
talking to the database we use the derby
dialect because we are using the Derby
database in this tutorial so I will set
the hibernate properties and I will set
the dialect to a derby tiling and the
way to do that is to set a separate
property here
call hibernate properties now hibernate
properties will contain the list of all
the properties that you need to set in
that you would normally have said in the
CFG dot XML file so I have props entry
over here and inside this props entry I
can set the individual properties so I
have only one property in mine now I
will set the key as toilet and I will
use the org dot hibernate dialect dot
Debbie dial it now how do you know this
class name this is by checking the
dialect package in the hibernate jar so
we just go to the dialect package over
here and here you have the dialect
classes for all the major databases that
you would want to use okay so now I have
said this hibernate properties note that
this is a properties property so this is
a property of the class and the type of
this property happens to be a property
so this is all is required to get this
beam up and running now spring has
enough information to initialize the
session factory beam but note that we
have not yet annotated the model class
now we have said the packages to scan to
be this package but then if hibernate
scans that package norm it will not find
any annotated classes so let's fix that
so this is my circle model check so in
order to mark it as a hibernate entity I
need to use the add entity annotation I
will import the identity from Java extra
persistence and then of course I'll also
have to provide the ID annotations
mark the ID property as the ID again
from Java extra persistence so now this
circle model classic we've been using so
far this becomes a hibernate entity now
it's actually a Java persistence entity
so hibernate is good to go now it checks
this package and it finds the model and
it knows what the table and what the
columns are of course here it matches to
what we have already said the table that
we have in our demo databases circle and
then the column names happen to be ID
and name respectively so we are all good
here we don't have to override any of
these properties ok so now we have a
session Factory we need to inject the
session factory into our Diego and we
have a private member variable here we
also have the getters and setters but we
need to tell spring to create an
instance of the session factory and
inject it like in do it very simply by
using add or a wired this is work
because session factory is off type
annotation session factory bean so it is
the only type that's available spring
has no problem in injecting it so I will
import Auto wired so in our Diego we
have initialized session factory ready
to go now all that's left is to use the
session factory in our Bao method get a
session and a query so let's do that
next so I will create a session I'll
open a session inside this method and
say I do that this to get the session
factory member variable first which
we'll get from oh here from the Gator
over here and then I will do a dot open
session now I have access to the session
and I can fetch the you know the entity
that I want I will use a query over here
on just to keep things simple I will
write a string HQ here it's not SQL it's
be the hibernate query language I'm
going to use a select count of star from
circle notice that here the circle
happens to be the entity name not the
table name of course in our example that
matches but then notice that they using
hitch grill here
which operates only on entity names now
that I have a hitch give a query all I
need to do is create a query which is
the hibernate query equals the open
session you get a session factory open a
session and then you create a query
again I would recommend you check the
hibernate tutorials which covers all
these concepts and details now for the
create query I pass in the HQ which I
already have over here now I have the
query ready I will have to import query
from objet hibernate ok so now that I
have the query over here I can use it to
execute and return the results so I will
do a query dot you need result and I can
return this value it's asking me to
catch two integer because this returns a
long obviously cannot cast so what I
will do here is I will change this to
Casa to a long and of course I can
return a long or I can get a int value
go here so let me do that talent value
so essentially the unique result is
returning along so you can have a method
that returns a long or in my case since
you already have an int here I will just
get the int value of that long and I'll
return it so now we have a DIY MPF with
a complete method over here now I need
to mark this as a spring bean and the
way I do that is by using
Oh spring bean stereotype I'll use the
ad repository you can use any of the
stereotypes but since this is a Dao it's
actually a good practice to use the ad
repository stereotype so this makes this
a spring bean
called hi bunny dy MPO so let me get
that over here - Edom Peele
classes have any DUI appeal then ported
and then again the slime will be the
same
I'm just doing a do that it's a book on
the gate circle gone this time
happens to call the gate circle count
method off the hibernate you instead so
let's run this of course make sure your
database is running and then execute so
here you can see the hibernate session
factory has been created and the output
value five has been printed so this is
the output off the the gate circle count
method here which is getting the same
output as what we saw in the previous
tutorial but this time it's using
hibernate so this completes a quick
overview of how we can use hibernate and
spring together as you can see the
nature of spring beans goes hand-in-hand
with the way you would initialize a
hibernate session Factory and it's very
handy to have a session factory as a
spring bean now that I have the session
factory over here I can actually use the
session factory in all my Diego's all I
need to do is have an order wired
session factory member variable in my
deal and then in my Dao method class you
know in the method code I do a get
session factory to get access to the
only session factory that we have and
that gets you know used throughout the
different methods of the different de
was in your application all I do is I do
a get open session to get a new session
and then I can perform all the typical
hibernate code and I can use all the you
know this time to hibernate ap is using
that
session so hope this receptor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
