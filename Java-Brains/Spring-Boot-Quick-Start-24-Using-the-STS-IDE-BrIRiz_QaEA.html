convenient way of creating a springboard
project is using the IDE itself and this
is specifically the spring tool suite if
you're using spring 2 3 this is a
no-brainer
this is how you would typically create a
spring boot projects the easiest way to
do it
so it's just like creating a new project
in Eclipse but here since it's a spring
to sweet when you right-click on the
package Explorer and choose new you have
a couple of more options so I'm going to
choose the spring starter project option
so I'm creating a new spring starter
project and now here I can provide the
typical maven coordinates I'm just going
to call this temp for now and leave the
default I click on next now here it
gives me the same set of options that
you have you must be familiar with from
the spring initializer so here it lets
me choose the spring boot version and
here are the dependencies that I can
choose from you remember the checkboxes
in the web UI in spring initializer this
is very similar to that so here in this
case I'm going to choose web and I'll
choose the web option and you can can
choose more if you'd like and what you
done with your selection of all your you
know the dependencies that you need
click on next and then here is the zip
file and as you can see it's still
leveraging the same starter spring that
I owe and I click on finish now what
it's going to do is it's going to get
that zip file download it extract it and
then open it as a project in the IDE so
it's even more convenient rather than
have it be two steps you just do that in
one step and you have like a complete
springing boot application with the
right dependencies in the pom vertex
milligan these things should be familiar
is this a new way of creating the same
project but using the IDE UI so this is
pretty handy I'm not going to go into
the details again this is pretty much
the same as what you would be doing if
you were using the spring initializer
and again it's the spring initializer
that's backing this functionality it's
just that the UI is using the ID and
it's very convenient so with this in
summary I've shown you four ways of
creating a brand-new spring good
application first as a simple maven
project and adding
the springboard dependencies manually
second using the online tool spring
initializer choosing your project in the
web UI and clicking download to download
the project and then extract and open it
in your IDE the third option is using
the spring command-line interface and
the fourth is using the spring tool
suite using the UI of the IDE to create
a new spring boot project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
