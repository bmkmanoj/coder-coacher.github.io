test what we've learned so far now let's
say I have a simple variable called top
and I'll assign the value then do it
let's say this is line 1 and my
JavaScript code now I create a function
called foo and in that function I create
a bar inner and I said the value is
twinning and immediately after that I'm
going to print console that log of inner
so it prints the value of inner at the
time and this is just a function
declaration if I were to execute this
the script write line 1 to 6 what would
be the value of the kids printer in the
console I'm going to pause for a couple
of seconds so if you want you can pause
the video think about this answer the
question before you and pause it so a
couple of seconds for you to think
before I give you the answer all right
so the answer is that nothing gets
printed on the console if you were to
execute this code the reason is you have
declared a function but you have an
executed we need to call the function
not executed that's where line 5 gets
executed and something is printed we
just execute this code as is nothing
gets printed on the console all right
now let's say I execute the function by
using foo open/close semicolon now foo
gets executed and now what's the value
it gets printed on the console a couple
of seconds and then I will give you the
answer so pause the video if you need to
all right the answer is value of the
kits printed on the console is 20
because inner as the value twinning and
then I'm printing inner which is 20 so
when foo gets called lines 4 and flag it
executed and then 20 gets printed on the
console all right now let me add one
more line here I'm going to add a line
at the very top which declares war in ER
equals 50 at the top which is outside
the function ok now if I execute this
core execute foo what is the value of
the kid French on the console the answer
is still 20 because this is a global
variable in the outer scope because it's
not in the function and now this
function foo creates a new scope and we
have inner which is in the scope off the
function foo and then when I'm printing
console that login err it's still in the
scope of function foo and it prints
this value not this one okay so if I'm
calling foo it executes this and prints
20 however if I were to take this line
of code and put it over here let's say I
remove this right so we remove this and
they execute this at line 10 what would
be the value that gets printed on the
console this time the value is 50
because this is outside the scope of foo
this proper food starts here and ends
here I'm accessing inner outside the
scope of food so it's referring to the
global variable which is 15 so the value
that gets printed is 50 right let's do
one more quick exercise let's say I have
a variable equals 10 and have a variable
B equals 10 all right
and I have a console that log that
prints a plus B now let's say I need
this functionality to happen in the code
but I don't want there to be a and B
global variables right I want to be able
to create these two variables and then
add them up and print it on the console
but I do want them to have global scope
so what would I need to do in order to
restrict the scope of a and B think
about this and I'll give you the answer
in a couple of seconds the answer is to
wrap this in a function remember
JavaScript is function scoped so if I
don't want this to be a part of the
global scope I'll have to create a scope
and the best way to create a scope in
JavaScript is to use a function so all I
have to do is wrap this in a function so
let's say I create a function my
function and then I wrap the code inside
that function now a and B are local
variables in this function scope they
are not going to pollute the global
scope now is this good enough
is this going to achieve the same logic
as the three lines of code that I
started out with so the answer is no
because while every cleared the function
there is nothing that's calling it right
so I have the code here
it's a is equals 10 and B equals 10 and
then print console that loggy a plus B
but nothing gets printed on the console
again because my function is not being
called so in order to have this work I
have to call my function and now with
this we are a
executing the code like you know
executing this functionality 10+10 like
it was before but we have also
restricted the scope of a and B to this
portion now a and B is not available
outside it does not pollute the outside
scope
okay now let's wrap up this video with
this final exercise which is kind of
tricky now let's say I do something like
this I have a var name equals cosh ik
and now I create a function here called
print treating which takes a name as an
argument and then it prints console does
log hello name alright and now I'm going
to call print greeting but the name
Arthur Dent now what is it that gets
printed on the console there is a global
name called a global variable called
name the value car check and I'm passing
print greeting with a specific value now
accepting the parameter is name now what
would get printed on the console the
answer is what gets printed on the
console is hello Arthur Dent because
what actually happens is even though
there is a global variable called name
which has the value of car check what
we're doing by accepting a method
argument here is creating a new local
variable of local scope called knee okay
a method argument is actually creation
of a new variable the variable name gets
created in this function scope and gets
assigned to the value which is passed to
that function which is asked at the end
here alright so there is nothing that
you can do in this function to access
the global variable because this local
variable kind of shadows it right into
there's no way you can go to the top and
access the global variable hopefully
these exercises kind of made you
familiar with the idea of scopes and
JavaScript I encourage you to take the
quiz on the site and I'll see you in the
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
