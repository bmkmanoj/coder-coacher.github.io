Services tutorial series so far we have
learned this magical annotation called
the add web service all you need to do
to create a web service is to just
annotate a class with this annotation
and everything happens by default right
so GlassFish creates the visible art
affaire - creates a tester it applies
the application as a web service and
life is good and I ruined it all in the
last tutorial by saying no this is not
enough we have to now understand and
learn this mess of XML that's called the
wisdom but to be honest it is not really
that hard so think about what we said
the Vistal is actually supposed to do so
when you code in Java and you want to
share the details of your class with the
client you send an interface but in the
case of web services you cannot really
share a Java interface because you have
no idea what technology the client is
using so we send an XML interface so
this vessel is basically pretty much the
same as a Java interface but it's in an
XML format so to understand the Vista we
need to understand the interface and we
already understand the Java interface so
it shouldn't be that hard right so think
about a standard interface now let me
create an interface a simple interface
just for testing I'm not going to use
this for the application so I'm going to
call this interface little is it let's
take the calculator example right I'm
writing a calculator and I want to
provide an interface for a calculator
now let's say I want to create a two
methods so one is to add two numbers and
one is to multiply two numbers
okay so this is a standard Java
interface most of the interfaces will
more or less be similar right so you
have an interface which lists the
methods so what are the important parts
of this interface now you have let's
take the first line they have the
package and we also have the name of the
interface so these to help the JVM
identify this interface it's basically a
way to know what interface we are
talking about right so we have the
public which is a scope and the vessel
world pretty much all interfaces are
public right because you want people to
use it so this is kind of Java specific
it's not really related the core essence
of this interface the purpose in life of
this interface is to provide information
about the content rights or the methods
so no matter how many methods you have
here has information about those methods
so each method itself will have the name
of the method the input arguments and
the return-type so no matter how many
methods you have here these three pieces
of information should be provided for
each of those methods so let's see ad it
has two input arguments in de and NB and
it provides a return type which is an
int right so this is essentially what a
vestal should have as well so Vistal
should have all these methods it should
have information about the input
arguments for those methods and it
should also have the return type for
that method so let's open up our wisdom
and see if we have this information so
this is the Vistal for our test might
application that we've been writing
right so this vessel has a bit
scary-looking so let's minimize this
let's make it a bit simple so I go to
the product catalog so there are three
web methods here so I want to L need to
I want to retain just one web method and
see all the elements of the vessel that
are specific to this web method how do I
remove these web methods I could of
course just select this and delete but
I'm going to do it another way so when
you go to this web method annotation and
see what are the properties there is a
property
exclude so this exclude is a boolean
which lets us as the name says exclude a
web method so when I have a web method
annotated with exclude is equal to true
then GlassFish is not going to publish
this as a web method okay so I'm going
to do the same thing for here I'm just
going to say exclude equals true so I
want GlassFish to exclude these two web
methods so I'm essentially having a web
service with just this one single bad
method now let's see how the visitor
looks like I'm going to save this and
republish okay so now if i refresh this
so this is a bit better but this is
still a bit complicated to an untrained
eye so let's collapse all these
different elements okay so this is
something that consists of all the
high-level elements of the wisdom let's
take this one by one so let's take this
element this element is called the
poured type and the name is product
catalog so if I expand this so you see
here there is an operation called get
product categories right so this is same
as the method that we have here of
course these two methods are not valid
we have just this one web method okay so
at the base level we have an operation
that takes in an input and it returns an
output okay
so this is what we saw as an interface
right so we have operations defined
which take in input and output okay but
what about all this other stuff what do
all of those things do let's take this
types for example what is a type doing
here to understand what a type section
is let's take a look at our interface
again now this is a simple add method
that takes in to int but now let's say
instead of an int I pass in a custom
datatype though let's say I have my data
type class okay and passing in
two objects of my datatype class and
this add method accepts these two
objects and adds them both and returns
an object of my datatype okay so it's
not an ad of two numbers anymore it's
adding two objects of my datatype so now
what does this line say this line says
hey I'm an ID method and I take two
objects of this type
don't ask me what these types are I
don't know I'm just saying that I'm
taking these two objects and I'm
returning an object of the same type and
if you want to understand what the type
is you need to go to the java class
where this type is defined right so the
type information is not available in the
interface so essentially it's a
different Java class so this similar
principle is available over here so you
have types define okay so if you have a
custom datatype you define all the types
over here and then the input and output
are just references to those types right
just like you have an input argument
here which says hey I'm an input
argument off this type so the same way
you can have an input here which is I'm
an input of this time okay but there is
one minor difference in the inputs and
outputs are defined in the Vistal in the
visible for an operation a method is an
operation here so far an operation there
is only one input tag and one output tag
might be wondering how is it possible
because there could be multiple inputs
right there there's only one in output
so this is fine but then there could be
multiple inputs to an operation how is
it possible that there's only one input
for every operation so the way it works
is if there are multiple inputs if there
are multiple input arguments to any
method they are bundled together into
what's called as a message okay so every
method in a whistle takes in one message
as the input and one message as the
output okay so if there are multiple
arguments you have to bundle them into a
message so if you look here the input is
the message get product categories okay
and the output
of the message get product categories
response so these messages are also
defined separately so if you look here
there is a message called get product
categories see here and there's a method
message called
get product categories response and the
input takes this message and the output
takes this message so essentially you
have types to find for all your custom
types and you have messages defined
which consists of different types so a
message consists of types and an
operation takes an input as one message
and an output as one message so this is
at a high level what is the structure is
but now there are a few other things
that the visible defines a vessel
defines what's called as a binding so a
binding is basically how a web service
accepts these values ok so you look here
there is an element called so binding
which says the transport is HTTP which
means that this web service accepts so
progress over HTTP there are different
ways in which Web Services accepts
requests so this one happens to be HTTP
so this is the definition and then there
are a few other definitions over here
which we'll come to later but the
binding is just information about how
the service accepts requests and gives
response now the service itself is just
a list of ports so this service product
catalog service defines a board which is
the product catalog board which is
available at this address so the soap
address is this one where the service is
made available and the service has a
port which follows this binding and the
binding is defined over here so if your
head is spinning right now with all
these different types let's keep this
aside and let's open up our web service
one more time this is so simple isn't it
so this is our web method and this has
generated all this XML now how fish have
done it
so how GlassFish does it
whenever it sees a class with the add
web service annotation it's going to
create a web service and a port right so
this is a web service called the product
catalog service it just takes the name
of the class and creates a service and
then creates a port for it the port has
bindings which tell you know how the web
service is going to get called we saw it
force HTTP and a few other stuff to
worry about it but it creates a service
in a port okay so you with me so far now
what happens is now inside this board it
looks at all the methods which have been
annotated with at web method right so
here there's just one method so no
matter how many methods are there it's
going to create operations for them
right so a port consists of operations
now this is the name of the operation
the method name the same as the
operation name and it is pretty weather
this takes arguments or not
it creates an input message and an
output message for each operation now
the input message consists of as many
types as there is percent now if this
takes two parameters then it would
consist of two types if it K takes three
parameters it consists of three types
but it would be just one message so the
input message would consist of all the
input arguments bundled as a message and
then the return type would be an output
message and each message would have
types so this list of string is a type
so a type would be defined for it and
then the message would point to the type
so this hopefully explains the complete
flow so you have service with port port
defines bindings and the binding points
to a port type which has operations each
operation has input and an output the
input has a message and the output has a
message and each message refers to types
and the types are defined in its own
section
so hopefully this made sense I would
definitely encourage you to go through
the Vistal and try to identify all the
different parts this was a tough one for
me to explain because I was trying to
find ways to simplify this I hope I have
simplified it for you if you have any
questions I definitely encourage you to
break this apart and try to find out how
all these different things are
getting generated from GlassFish you can
change the names of all these different
things and see how the names get changed
in the vista land hopefully that'll be a
good representation of what gets
translated to what okay so in the next
tutorial now that we have understood
what these different types are in the
next tutorial we'll try to understand
how we can change all these different
defaults so you see all these defaults
are getting picked up from the method
names and the variable names and the
class names in our java class we'll try
to understand how we can change these
stuff and try to you know give our own
names and make sure that they're not
automatically derived we don't want
these to be automatically derived we
want to control all the different
aspects of all this XML that's generated
so we'll take a look at that in the next
tutorial thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
