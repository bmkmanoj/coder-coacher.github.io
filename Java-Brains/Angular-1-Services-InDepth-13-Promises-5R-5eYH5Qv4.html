of the easiest ones to understand
especially if you're new to asynchronous
programming it's not one of the easiest
concepts to teach as well I'm going to
try my best and I hope you are too
the idea of promises comes from having
to deal with asynchronous programming
but without needing the whole callback
functionality we have looked at
callbacks in the previous tutorial we
understood how you can send a function
to another function have that executed
when it's done and callbacks can be ugly
as we have seen more nested there the
more difficult it gets to read the code
or even modify it so promises is
actually a an attempt to solve that
problem using a different pattern we are
still going to be doing the same thing
the idea behind having a long-running
function except another function as an
argument to run when the long-running
thing is done that idea is still the
same with promises this is the way in
which the function is passed is a little
bit different hopefully this will make
sense once you're done watching these
videos so what is a promise here's a
definition from the Mozilla developer
Network a promise represents an
operation that hasn't completed yet but
is expected during the future now since
this is a new concept I'm going to give
you a couple of analogies to explain
what this is they're kind of real-world
analogies and hopefully you get the idea
when I'm done so the first analogy that
I'm going to give you is something
that's commonly used in a lot of blog
posts and tutorials online this is an
analogy of a bank teller or restaurant
where you have the token system you go
to a restaurant which is super crowded
right and you are waiting for a place
we're waiting for your table so when you
go to the front reception the front
reception gives you a token or a buzzer
and you have your place in the queue
right so you hold on to that token and
you wait for your turn
and then table opens up and it's your
turn the restaurant staff calls out the
token number or presses the buzzer on
your buzzer rings and you know your your
turn has come right so what the
restaurant staff is giving you is a
promise right it's a promise up
it's something that represents that
there is something that you have to wait
for right you're not you're not just
there standing on the queue and waiting
for your table right so you're given a
token that you put in your pocket and go
on do your thing and when it's your turn
the token is going to let you know and
then you have your place in the table
right this is a rough analogy of what
promise is but it's not exactly accurate
I have an alternative analogy which i
think is more representative of this
promise approach that I'm outlined now
and hopefully that'll that'll help so
think of you know you're working with
your teammate so you've given your
teammate you say can you do this thing
for me they say okay I got it I'll do it
but it's gonna take me an hour to do
okay so it's a long-running operation
here given your teammate a long-running
operation is gonna take a while to
complete it now while he or she is
working on that thing you also have this
other thing to do right so you're saying
okay
after you're done I need you to do this
bunch of other stuff but the teammate
says no hang on I'm single-threaded I
can only do this one thing you know you
have to wait to give me the next set of
instructions now you have somewhere else
to go you can't wait for your teammate
to finish the job and give the next set
of instructions so what your teammate
does is the teammate gives you a piece
of paper and say okay here's here's a
promised object if you tell me what I
need to do after this job or just write
it to me on the piece of paper and give
it to me I'll finish this long-running
process and then I'm going to look at
your piece of paper and whatever you've
written there I'm going to do it right
so your teammate is really cooperative
that way so what when you give your
teammate a long-running task your
teammate is going to give you a piece of
paper and say hey fill in all the other
stuff that I need to do after this long
pinning task what you're going to do is
you going to take that piece of paper
write all the stuff that you need your
teammate to do after then you hand that
paper back to your teammate and he or
she's gonna hold onto it and say okay I
got it I'm going to finish this wrong
running long-running task and then I'm
gonna approach the other stuff all right
this I think is a really good analogy of
a promise and the piece of paper that
your teammate is handing to you and you
are filling it up with the next set of
things to do that piece of paper that
presents the promise right so it's base
he denotes the promise that your
teammate is making to you that he or she
is going to do the things that you've
written in that promised piece of paper
after the long-running new job if this
is still a little bit hazy just hold on
to those thoughts for a bit I'm sure
it'll make more sense when we go into
the details but have this analogy at the
back of your mind when you're looking at
these videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
