tutorial will have a quick introduction
to strats to will just have a conceptual
introduction in the next set of
tutorials will cover how we can actually
write an application with struts too in
the previous tutorial we learned what an
MVC is and we learned that it's actually
an architectural pattern one thing I'd
like to highlight in this tutorial is
the difference between a pattern and a
framework now what is an MVC pattern and
how is it different from an MVC
framework well a baton is a set of
guidelines so it talks about how we
architect the application it's a pattern
of architecting the application the
framework on the other hand helps you to
follow a particular pattern when you're
actually building the application so
you're writing code you would have to
write some set of classes or some set of
libraries for every application that
follows a particular pattern so in that
case a good practice would be to have a
set of pre-built
classes or libraries that you would use
whenever you implement a pattern so
that's the same thing for an MVC
framework an MVC framework has classes
and libraries that would help you build
applications using the MVC architecture
pattern so the first thing is that the
pattern is a way you can architect your
application and framework provides these
foundation classes and libraries that
help you if you choose to architect your
application using such a pattern so
there are a couple of advantages of
using frameworks the first advantage is
as I said if you're if you intend to
develop a lot of applications using a
particular pattern you would have to
write a lot of common classes in every
application so if you have a framework
ready it helps you get started quickly
and then the second advantage is it
leverages some of the best practices if
you use a you know an MVC framework like
stretch tube you would have to have a
particular set of classes in a
particular you know set of design
constraints which are actually helpful
to you because the way the framework has
been designed it is considering a lot of
real world experience and a lot of good
advice so if you follow the
you know guidelines laid down by a
framework you can be sure that you are
falling to a lot of best practices in
the industry okay so this is the
standard MVC diagram which we've been
seeing all along and if you'd be sick
off by now we have a client talking to a
controller the controller talks to the
model and the view is for rendering the
output so that it's consumable by the
client now if you would design this kind
of a model in a java web application
using servlets and jsps this would be a
standard way to do that if we are
building our own framework we would have
J's piece over here to address the view
part of it we would have Business
Services to address the model part of it
and we would have servlets which act as
controllers and this is an MVC pattern
we are sticking to an MVC pattern
because we are separating the
controllers from the model from the view
but then if you're designing a framework
you would have to think of isolating out
all the common things that you would
have to do every time you build a web
application now let's say somebody gave
you the task of building a hundred MVC
web applications in that hypothetical
situation what would you do you would
not do not want to create all these
three different modules from the scratch
for each and every web application you
would like to have some common classes
that you would use in every application
so that's a question what if you had to
build 100 web applications you would
have to design a framework that gets you
started and gets you started quickly now
let's see I have a client over here and
I have a clean slate now what would I do
what would the elements of a web MVC
framework be if we had to design our own
MVC framework let's say we don't have
starts we don't have stretched or we
don't have any of those other stuff you
are building your own MVC framework what
would you do the first assumption is
that you have the business service
classes already because MVC focuses on
the interface with the business services
the business services could be anything
it could be related to the application
and these could change from application
to applications we would not want to
have anything related to the business
service in your MVC framework so the
Assumption you would make is that there
are classes already that provide you the
business services you it could either be
class files or it could be a jar that
you would add but the assumption is that
they're already there so now with this
assumption what would your components of
the MVC framework be the first thing
that you would do the first step in our
you know the analogy in the previous
tutorial was to get the client request
parameters because that would be the
first step in the processing right a
client makes a request
everything depends on the request
parameters and the request URL so my
first module in my own MVC framework
would be a module that handles these
input parameters now these input
parameters could vary depending on the
application itself but the method in
which the parameters are passed to the
framework is the same it would be either
get or a post or some standard request
and they are standard ways in which
parameters are passed so I would have
some kind of a common module over here
which handles those input parameters it
gets all the input parameters and have
it with me ready now these input
parameters are actually helpful when I'm
calling methods of this business service
so you know the input parameter could be
get me the employee record for employee
number one two three four so one two
three four would be the input parameters
and that one two three four value would
have to be passed to a method on the
business service because the Business
Service method would be like get
employee of ID and then that ID one two
three four has to be passed over here so
what I would do is I would also have a
class over here that picks up what I
have collected over here and then this
class is the interface to all these
different business services so I take
the input parameters over here and I
pass it on to my common class over here
so that these
classes are not disturbed and then this
class is going to take care of calling
the right business service okay so these
two would be the first two continents in
my MVC framework now I have you know a
class that calls the right business
servers and then gets the data you know
it passes the ID or whatever that this
guy has taken and then it gets the raw
data now that I have the raw data I
would write J's B's which would be the
view again I cannot write any common J's
piece because JSP is depend on the
application it depends on what you want
to show and that has to be written every
time a new web application is created
but then there are a few common things
that I can actually take out I can have
tag libraries these are standard
controls and libraries that I would want
to use for my J's B's and different web
applications so these tag libraries
would be something that I would want
isolate out and use it because I'm using
I'm developing 100 MVC web applications
I would not want to have you know a lot
of HTML code inside each of them if I
know that there are some standard
libraries that would be helpful for any
web application I would want to isolate
them out so this would be the next
module in my MVC framework and then
finally I would need something that
orchestrates everything over here I
would need something that calls the
right model redirects to the right view
and displays the output so that would be
some module here that route I would have
some XML configuration and then I would
route depending on the request if the
client request is get user profile in
the URL then I call the right model
which gets the user profile if the
client request is Change Password then I
would call the model which does the
change password then redirect to the
right JSP so there is one routing module
that's involved and then I would read
from an XML file so I don't have to
write this module every time all I would
have to do for each of my Android web
applications is configure using XML and
this guy is a common module which just
picks up the XML and calls the right
module so the XML would be
friend for each web application but then
the modules would be the same so this
would be a initial design of my own MVC
framework if I had to write an MVC
framework so this is very similar to
what you would see in starts - starts -
has identified all these problems and
the framework that struts - provides has
all these different modules we'll have a
look at that now so this is how a struts
to design would look like you have what
are called as interceptors interceptors
is the you know it's the gateway once
the client makes a request it goes
through what are called as starts -
interceptor so the interceptors takes
care of getting the user request
parameters so this is what we saw
earlier you need a module to get all the
user parameters and then it has
something called as an action class
this action class is where you would
call all the different business service
methods and what starts - has done is it
intelligently takes all these request
parameters that the Interceptor is
caught and it makes it available in the
action class so that when I call the
business service methods I have these
parameters ready so I don't have to
fetch them every time starts to makes it
ready and available so I don't have to
worry about that and then as far as the
tag libraries are concerned starts to
provide some standard tag libraries that
you can use inside your JS piece and
that simplifies a lot of effort and then
finally it has a more do that reads in
XML yes it is the starch XML you
configure all your interactions in your
start XML and you can say ok for this
URL this action has this action class
has to handle for this URL this action
class has to handle the execution and so
on and you can figure that in the next
ML file and struts provides module that
reads from that XML file and takes care
of this interaction so this is a brief
overview of what the stretch - mode use
looks like we will
look at all these different modules in
considerable detail in the next set of
tutorials but for now this should give
you an idea so having seen this what
would you have to do to write a struts
to application you would not have to
write interceptors they're already taken
care of so your struts to application
would not have any code to get the
request parameters from the user input
you don't have to worry about that
interceptors handles it and makes it
available over here as well so this
module is also available the module that
reads from the XML so the first thing
you have to do is write the XML that
this module reads from and then the next
thing is write your action classes that
call the business service methods of
course this cannot be handled by starts
true because only you can know what your
business service methods are so you
would have to write a class that calls
these business service methods and then
you can write J's piece that uses the
stretch tag libraries so these are the
three steps that you have to do to write
your own starts application right the
starts XML write your action classes and
write the J's piece so with this you can
write a full-fledged MVC application
using starts - so about stretched oh
it's an MVC framework that helps you
design applications using the MVC
pattern it's on version 2 there is a
stretch which is version 1 which is
considerably different from starts tools
so if you're familiar with stretch 1 you
would have to do a little bit of
learning to you know learn the new
concepts that has been introduced in
starts - and then finally it gives us
pre-built classes for MVC that we can
use our extend so in the next tutorial
we're going to look at how we can set up
our development environment to write
applications using struts -</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
