been looking at spring JDBC support we
have written a do class using JDBC and
we're trying to see how we can use
spring to make things simple so the
first thing that we did what we did in
the previous tutorial was to take all
the connection parameters out from the
class and put it into an XML file so the
XML file contained the connection
parameters as configuration for a beam
so add a data source beam that had all
these connection parameters as
properties of the beam and we let spring
each lies this beam with all the
property set and in our dao we had used
a method of that beam to get the
connection so that's the first
improvement we have done now let's look
at the rest of the code from here on so
what are we doing here we are taking a
prepared statement we are giving it a
query and then we have full you know
filling the parameters then we are
executing the query getting the result
set and then we are passing the result
set and then closing the connections and
of course handling the error conditions
so the part where the query is actually
formed over here this is something that
will change from method to method so in
this case I'm doing a gate circle and
I'm passing an ID so the query that I
need to run this select from the circle
table where ID is the ID that has passed
now if the method that I'm trying to do
is something different maybe I need to
pull it up from a different table or
I'll have to get some other set of
columns or have a different thread class
so the query here is bound to change it
could be different depending on the
method itself but then after that the
result set which is got by executing the
query this is common across all do
methods and then looping through the
result set of course getting the model
itself will change depending on what the
object is that we are trying to retrieve
but then looking through that and
getting that
is the the function is the same but the
model and the column names could be
different from method to method and then
how about this RS door close PS just
close this has to happen in all Dao
methods return could be 4 and all the
exceptions could be the same so what we
are looking here is one line of code
here getting the connection which is
same for all the methods of you you know
all the diego's the there are particular
sections over here which are different
like the query and the column names and
things like that and then there is the
rest of the code which will again be the
same irrespective of what do method
you're looking at so the the idea is to
take all these common pieces of code out
and then have a separate class that
takes care of it so it could be like you
know have a say before query execution
which I have a method here that prepares
the connection and things like that and
then I have the query over here and then
I hand I can have one more method here
saying after query execution well this
is this kind of rough picture but I
think you get the idea he had you have a
method that takes care of all the pre
query stuff then you pass in the query
and then you have a method that takes
care of the post query stuff now this is
the idea that's central to a class
called JDBC template now JDBC template
is a class that's provided by spring
that does justice it has code for the
pre execution and it has code for the
post execution and of course as I said
there are certain points during the
execution where you would want to
customize it like passing in a different
query or parsing the result set and
formulating your own model object so for
those cases alone your code will
actually have the you know the lines of
code to perform those actions and the
rest of the actions will actually be not
in this method but in the JDBC template
so let me just undo this once we have a
look at the cord it'll probably make a
bit more sense so the JDBC template is
in let's open the JDBC jar so it's in
the core package and you have a class
here JDBC template this is the one so
this is the one that we need to include
as a member variable in our Diego so let
me just do that first I have a private
JDBC template okay now I will import
JDBC template from the same package that
we saw now I can generate the getters
and setters for this okay
so a JDBC template needs to have an
instance I could use the spring XML but
for now what I'll do is I'll just use
the new believe this as new JDBC
template over here for now but we'll
change this later we'll revisit this and
look at where is where is exactly the
best place to initialize this JDBC
template but for now I'm creating a new
JDBC template by lambda clearing this so
this is this is an instance of the GD BC
template and this is the template class
that will take care of all the pre and
post execution code so once we use this
we do not need to do a lot of the stuff
that we are doing over here so let's say
I write a new method over here now we
have a get circle which takes an ID now
let's say I write a method here which
returns the count see I have a get
circle
okay so I have a get circle count that
gets the total number of records in the
circle table so if I would not use the
JDBC template what I would do is I would
use a lot of code that's similar to this
so you know this line of code would be
the same here instead of again you know
select star from I'd probably do a
select count of star from circle and
they would not be of air class and that
I would have to do the execute query
again and then I would have to get
result sets count and then I would have
to close these again I'll have to catch
all these exceptions so pretty much
everything would be the same so now in
this case what I would do instead is I
will use the JDBC template which will
have a lot of the code inside it and
we'll look at what exactly is the code
that we will actually have to write
which is the you know only the code
that's going to be in this method which
is not taken care of by either JDBC
template so for getting the count let's
say I have a string sequel equals now
what would be the sequel to get the
count it would be a select count of star
from circle okay so I have a string
which has this equal now I will have to
execute this equal and of course I'll
have to get the connection and all that
stuff so what I would do is the first
thing is I would get the data source and
I would pass it to the JDBC template
because in order for the JDBC template
to run this query are we going to pass
this query to the JDBC template in order
for it to run the query first it needs
to know what is the data source that it
has to run it against so we'll do that
now so we will pass ray DBC template dot
set that is it out set data source I
will pass the data source that we
already have so that's the first thing
I'm going to do now the JDBC template
know
for which data source it needs to run
this query now that this is done all I
need to do is so pass the query and then
get the result so I will do that by
using the JDBC template dot there is a
query for int method now the query for
int method takes in a sequel string and
guess what
thus query for int actually returns the
value that the sequel is returning and
then since I'm using a query for int
it's going to automatically return me an
integer so any query that returns a
number can be passed to the square for
int and then this is going to take care
of executing the query and then getting
the result and returning that integer so
count star select of cons star is going
to return an integer I know that because
it's account so query for end is the
method to use and then I pass in a query
that returns me an integer and then I
use that over here so all I can do is
return and this count is going to get
returned by the method now you can see
how simple this is you do not have to do
any of the get connections you do not
have to do any of the prepared
statements no execute query and no
closing of the result set and the
prepared statement no caching exceptions
this is all it takes
actually I could pass this string in
line and then you know it could just be
a couple of lines and we'll have a look
at how we can reduce this even further
but I hope the I hope the advantage of
using JDBC template is pretty obvious
now it takes care of all the things that
are common that you would have to do
across diego methods and the only thing
that changes here being the query and
that is the only thing that you need to
pass and of course the data source so it
needs to know where to execute the query
and what will you to execute and then
since you are passing it to an integer
method it's going to return an integer
and then I can just return it directly
so let's test this out by running this I
will come in this side these two lines
of code and I will use this out do dot
get circle counts and so have only one
record it should return me a value of
one because I'll see this as well now if
I run this just get the output of one
and I do so this is a very simple way of
using JDBC in your Diego if you are
already using spring so note again that
you are not doing anything specific for
JDBC all you are doing is you have a
data source and you have a JDBC template
so using these two objects you pass the
data source to the JDBC template in the
new path query and then you can execute
it so it's as simple as that okay now
that we have successfully used the JDBC
template let's look at a couple of
things that we will have to clean up
over here
first is the new new JDBC template I
told you that we would get back to this
now the question is is this the ideal
place to initialize the JDBC template
and then the second question is is this
the ideal place to pass the data source
to the JDBC template because this JDBC
template is a common object that's going
to be used by all the methods in this
tea so say you have 10 other methods in
the Dao all of them are going to use the
same JDBC template and then they're
going to get they're going to call a
method off the JDBC template so this is
you know this creating a new JDBC
template and then assigning a data
source to that JDBC template is is
something that needs to happen first in
this Dao
so whenever the steer was initialized
there needs to be a new JDBC template
and then a datasource should be assigned
to that JDBC template so we need to make
sure this happens on initialization so
there are a couple of ways we can do
that the first way is we create a B
definition for the JDBC template so I
could have a beam for the JDBC template
and then the property of the beam could
be the data source so I could say
property data source is the beam ref
which is a data source over here so I
can pass this data source as a reference
as a property
the second way we can do this is the
data source is already being passed by
spring to the JDBC do switch green
spring is going to create a new JDBC do
and it's going to pass the data source
and the way it's gonna pass it is by
calling the set data source which is
this method over here okay it's going to
use this method to pass in the data
source if configure actually this is a
good place to initialize it now here
notice that we are setting this to our
data source equals data source but we
are not really using a data source in
our class apart from actually passing it
to the template so it's actually the
template which needs the data source we
don't really need it so instead of
assigning it to a member variable what
I'll do instead is this dot JDBC
template equals new JDBC template and
now you can see JDBC template has a
constructor that takes in a data source
so I will use that and I will pass in
the data source that spring is sending
us so I'm going to directly take the
data source and I'm going to give it to
the JDBC template so the JDBC template
has the data source and again we don't
really need the data source over here so
remove this line you need that so all I
need to do is call the corresponding
method in my Dao method but during the
initialization itself the JDBC template
this pointed to the right data source it
gets created with the right data source
so all I need to do is make sure that
the setter is called when spring
initializes so in order to do that I
will take this auto wired
and I will add it to the setter instead
of annotating the field but Auto wired
so now I know that spring is going to
use the setter to pass the data source
to me and that's where I will do the
assignment so let's save and run this
there you go
it still works fine so this is a common
practice to have the data source setter
being used as the place where you pass
the data source to the JDBC template
however note that our previous method
over here the get circle this will fail
now because we are not initializing the
data source but we are still using it
but the thing is if you're do methods
actually use the JDBC template they have
absolutely no use for the data source
all they need to do is use the JDBC
template and the JDBC template takes
care of everything else you just need to
pass the query and then it's going to
work now a couple of notes about the
methods of the JDBC template we have
just looked at one method which is a
query for hint now how do I know what
method needs to be run over here the
variant orders in this case I'm using a
sequel query that returns me a number
the output of this select count star is
a number so in order to pass this query
to the JDBC template I need to use a
method that is tailored for running a
query that returns a number which is
query for int now let's say I was
running a query that returned a string
so in that case we for End would not
work I would have to use a different
method so let's say not string but let's
say I have a query that returns all the
records all the rows of a table or
probably one record and all the columns
of that record so in that case you would
either have to return a model object or
a list of model objects so we look at
all the options that we have to return
all these different data types using the
JDBC template in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
