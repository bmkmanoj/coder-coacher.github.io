in the previous
let us map existing exceptions are your
own custom exceptions to a response so
that you can control what the JSON
payload is what the statuses and all
that but think for a minute about why we
needed that you know the exception
mapper the reason is jax-rs or Jersey
has no context or no information about
the kind of exceptions that your
application could throw it could be a
custom exception it could be a null
pointer exception but jax-rs really
doesn't know what to do with it
right it could be because something that
was requested does not found it could be
because as it was a server error so it's
really hard to map an exception to a
status or do a response by default so
Jack Sarah says I have no idea so you
give me the mapper
so that I can map it to a response but
jax-rs also has these its own set of
exceptions that it does map to a status
and a response and since Jack Sarah's
knows what those exceptions are you
don't need to write an exception mapper
Jack Sora's already knows what the
response for those exceptions should be
right so this is what we're going to
cover in this tutorial before we do
anything else what I'm going to do is
first go to the generic exception mapper
and disable this the reason is this is
like a catch-all so no matter what
exception is thrown this catches it and
overrides it so we don't want that we
are creating new exceptions we're
throwing the exceptions in this tutorial
you don't want this thing to interfere
so I'm going to just delete the add
provider annotation so that this does
not get registered in Jersey and again
this is something you don't want to do
you don't want a throwable mapped to an
exception mapper this sketch is pretty
much everything and returns just one
kind of a response it's just not good
anyway so I'm going to have disable this
close this and now we're going to take a
scenario and throw one of these
exceptions that Jax that is already
aware off right these exceptions are
called web application exception I'm
going to take the example of the comment
service this time
now look at the gate comment method
there are a ton of things that could go
wrong over here right now the message ID
could be something that's not available
now if the message ID is not available
this returns null and the gate comments
is going to end up in a
nullpointerexception the other thing
that could go wrong is let's say you get
the message and then you give the
comments but the comments or map might
not have the comment ID that's requested
then it could return null so we can
address both these problem scenarios by
throwing web-application exception okay
so I'm going to take this out create a
new local variable and here I check if
message equals null like we did in the
last tutorial but this time I'm not
going to create a custom exception I'm
going to throw an exception that Jersey
already knows and that's web application
exception
now web application exception is from
Java XW Stratos and now this has a bunch
of constructors you see here there is
one that lets you set the status there's
one that lets you set the response let's
look at these two alright I'm going to
click the status one I'm going to say
status dot not found okay now let me do
something similar for garments as well
okay so I'm going to check if the
message is not all the comment is null
I'm going to throw new web application
exception of not found if both of them
are not null then I return the comment
right very straightforward
now since I'm using an exception that
comes with jax-rs that comes with Jersey
I don't have to map it because Jersey
already knows right you've created an
exception that the status not found so
Jersey knows what the status is so when
I try accessing this URL message ID
hundred which I know doesn't exist I'm
accessing comment one from it when X is
this I get 404 not found and that's
because we created and not found over
here but again the problem is since we
don't have a response
it shows the Tomcat error page so I need
to set the response here I can set it by
adding the response over here
I guess you see here there is a
constructor which takes in a response is
an argument so I can prepare a response
over here and send it to the web
application exception and that is going
to be returned over here now let me
create the response which is very
similar to what we did for data not for
an exception mapper so let me copy these
two things
this year we don't want to return this
instead we want to create a local
variable called response okay let me
change this to our message so I'll I'm
down over here in these two lines is
build the response like we've already
done but what I'm going to do now is
pass the response to the web application
exception constructor do that here as
well
okay now it should return that response
when I make this call and there you go
we get the response that we prepared
over here okay to summarize you build a
response and then you pass it to the
constructor of the web application
exception and that's what you through
and jax-rs is a ver of web application
exception so it knows exactly what to do
okay now that I've explained how to do
this let me tell you why I am NOT a big
fan of this you see here this is common
service it's a business service and in
the business service I have all this
code which handles response that needs
to be sent to the user so this is not
really business code right this is
actually I would say presentation code
because this is something that manifests
as user experience the user sees this so
this is a bad place for this code to be
in right you don't want it to be in the
comment service it's kinda okay if it's
in the comment resource let's say you
don't have that code in the service
right let's say you have that in this
method you see if get comment is
returned null in that case you create
this response I would say that's
slightly better but still this is I
don't know I don't like this I prefer
the exception mapper to be a separate
class so that it's cleaner right you can
create multiple exception mappers if it
were to be in the code you'll have your
services littered with code like this
which is not good in my opinion but
anyway if you were to choose this
approach this is how you do it now lined
up this tutorial by giving you one more
short cut it's actually even simpler to
do something like this if you were to
use one of the custom exceptions you see
web application exception is actually a
pair in class and there are a lot of
classes which inherit from it which
provide custom responses and statuses if
you look at the Java Doc's for web
application exception you see there are
some subclasses there is client error
exception redirect exception and server
error exception so there are three
classes for exceptions so if you
remember unit 1 I told you client error
are 400 error codes right 400 to 499
redirection exceptions are a bunch of
clear error codes which start from 300
to 399 server errors are a bunch of
error codes which are five hundreds
right so if you look at each one of
these you see there are like a bunch of
exceptions which have already been
defined there is a bad request exception
forbidden exception and here you see
there is a not found exception let's
take a look at this now this is a
runtime exception that indicates that
the resource was not found' which is
basically what this is doing but instead
of having a response dot status of not
found there is a cleaner way you can
throw a not found exception and pass in
the response so let me change one of
these I'm going to leave this as web
application exception but here what I'm
going to do is I'm going to use not
found exception the not found exception
is same as web application exception
except for the fact that it already has
the status off status not found right so
you don't have to set that I just use
this one line you don't have to do this
right so this is a shortcut if you were
to use web application exception for
standard error codes like this so that
you don't have to use the response
builder and pass in the status so this
is the third V of creating and handling
exceptions in your jax-rs application if
you go back to the Java Docs you can
look at some more of these so if you
look at the server error exception you
can see that a couple
internal server error exception service
unavailable exception so all these
address some of the common error cases
in the common status codes that you
would typically return when there is an
exception or when there is an error
right so I encourage you to look up
these Java Docs if your if you choose to
use the web application exception route
I hope this was helpful and I'll see you
in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
