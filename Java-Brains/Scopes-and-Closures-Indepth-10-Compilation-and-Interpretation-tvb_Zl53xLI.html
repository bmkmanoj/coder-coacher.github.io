welcome to unit 2 in this unit we can
examine the nature of JavaScript that's
both compiled and interpreted a lot of
people agree to the fact that javascript
is an interpreted language what is
interpreted mean when you write a
program in the language like C or Java
there is actually a compilation step
that needs to happen before you execute
your program write the compilation step
actually converts your source code into
an intermediate record or even the final
object code that you actually execute
right so you don't actually execute the
source code itself you execute this
intermediate tree file that this
compiled ok so there's a compilation
step which runs through your source code
and generates that intermediate refile
and that's what you are insecure however
in the case of JavaScript what you
execute is your source code because
think about it you link your javascript
code to a web page in a browser right so
then the browser makes a request to your
JavaScript code what's going to get back
is the actual source code not a compiled
code it is the actual code that you have
written now the browser executes the
code directly without creating this
intermediary file now does that mean
that the JavaScript code is not compiled
but it actually does it but it does mean
that the JavaScript code is interpreted
okay so that's what you mean by an
interpreted language
the runtime executes the code directly
right it's the source code itself that
is executed however there is actually
also a combined Asian step that the
browser does before it actually executes
it right so when the browser gets the
JavaScript code it actually does two
things there are two steps to the
browser execute the first step is the
compilation step this step actually has
the browser looking at your source code
and identifying a particular set of
things which it needs in order to
execute it okay so it doesn't execute it
on the very first step it does a
compilation step where the point is not
to generate this intermediate free file
but to look for signs and to make note
of certain things which it needs to
actually execute it
once that compilation step is done then
the interpretation step executes and
that's where the
she'll call his executor all right these
two steps happen very quickly and
together when the browser gets a
javascript file it runs the compilation
step a fraction of a second before it
runs the interpretation step so these
two are very much closely they happen
very closely in time but still you
cannot deny the fact that there is a
compilation step so javascript is both
compiled and interpreted now what
happens in these two steps that's what
this unit is going to cover we're going
to examine the compilation step first
and then we can examine the
interpretation step and see what the
JavaScript engine does in each of these
steps understanding these two steps is
actually very important in order to
figure out the behavior of the
JavaScript engine and certain pieces of
code and we'll examine that once we've
gotten an understanding of these two
steps we will examine some pieces of
code and play the role of the compiler
and the interpreter and figure out what
the output would be for different pieces
of code so see you in the next video
where we look at these two steps in
detail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
