create a web service and we started with
a web application first so we created a
web application called test Mart so the
idea behind this web application is to
create a web service that returns
product information for an e-commerce
application so we created a web app we
created a simple JSP page and we also
created this class called product
catalog which had one method called get
product categories this method returned
a hard-coded set of strings which were
the product categories books music and
movies now what we need to do now is to
make this into a web service so I'm
going to create a web service called the
product catalog service which has an
operation called get product categories
and it should return these three values
again but as a soap response to a soap
request so let's walk through the steps
to convert this product catalog into a
web service so this is a bit of a
complicated process so pay close
attention first step I'm going to call
this as a web service by annotating it
with add web service ok so the add web
service is an annotation from Java X dot
jws so import that and this class is now
annotated as a web service step two well
there is actually no step two we are
actually done this is all it takes to
create a web service out of any Java
class all I need to do is annotate it as
a web service and that's it I'm not
kidding but I was kidding when I said
that it's a long complicated process
because it's not it's just one
annotation that's required to make this
class as a web service well there are a
lot of things that are happening by
default and we're going to look at that
a bit later but at the bare minimum all
I need to do to create a web service is
to have a class annotated with at web
service now if you still don't believe
me let
to run this I'm going to deploy this on
the webserver I'm going to say run on
server so GlassFish does a lot of things
behind the scenes which we're going to
examine a bit later but for now all we
need to worry about is if this web
service gets deployed fine okay so now
there is no root page again but if we
run the new file dot JSP we should be
able to see that the application is
loaded fine now how do I access this web
service now do I have to write a client
for it just like we did before
not really so what I'm going to do now
is I'm going to open up the admin
console of GlassFish server so we know
that the admin console is localhost
colon for 8 for 8 ok now here is the
admin console now if I go to the
applications link this should show us
all the applications that have been
deployed now you see there is an
application called test mark that has
been deployed it is enabled and you see
here in the engines column it says web
services and vet so this is basically
the nature of the application that's
been deployed so if it was just a web
application this would just say web but
since we have a class that's annotated
with the web service GlassFish knows
that this is a web service application
as well so it lists web services as well
so I can click on this and I can see the
details about the application so you see
her again it's web services and web and
you can launch the web service or you
can view the endpoint you see here there
is a component called product catalog
that is the same class that we've
annotated so this is the product catalog
component which is a web service
component now it says I can view the
endpoint I click on it you see here
there are two links over here so one is
the tester link and one is the visited
link this is the link we already know it
has actually created
whistle by default for us so it's
actually examined the web service and
it's created the Vistal so I click on
this one and you see here this is the
Vistal for our web service so yes we
have actually created a web service just
by that one single annotation so you see
we have all the things that were still
needs see the service tag over here says
it's a product catalog service notice
that it's actually appended the name
service to the class name so it's not
the service is not product catalog the
service is not this name the services
product catalog service it's actually
appended the suffix service to it and
then you have a port called product
catalog port and the port has one
operation which is get product
categories so it is it has pretty much a
complete web service now how do we test
this do we have to write the client we
don't really have to write the client
for it also
what GlassFish does is it provides us
with a tester so this is the second link
that we saw that is a tester link it's
actually a UI that GlassFish generates
by default in order to test this web
service so i can click on this link here
and it shows me a page which is the
tester page i can click on this button
if there were input parameters it would
have let me fill it up here using text
boxes but since this set this doesn't
take any input parameters it is just one
button here i can click this button to
actually test out the web service but i
click this the web page sends a soap
request right so this is the soap
request and it gets a soap response back
from our application that we have
written so you see here there is a
return tag it returns the books returns
music and returns movies these are the
three strings that we've hard-coded and
this is the actual soup response from
our web service so you see here also the
method returned a list
Java dot util dot list and it has three
elements in it books music and movies so
this is a very quick whirlwind tour of
creating and
deploying a web service and also testing
it using GlassFish so things are very
simple all we needed was to create you
know an annotation called web service on
top of our class really there's nothing
else that's required you could if you
want also create a web method annotation
so basically it's saying this is this
class this method is actually a web
method okay and this is again from Java
extra GWS but this is actually optional
because once you annotate a class as a
web service it assumes that every public
method in that class needs to be an
operation on the web server so it
exposes all of them as separate
operations of the web service so this is
the basics of how to create a web
service we're going to look at more
details about all the default stuff
that's happening behind the scenes in
the next tutorial thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
