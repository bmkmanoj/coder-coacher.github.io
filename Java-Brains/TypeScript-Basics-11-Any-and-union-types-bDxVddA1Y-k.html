is have a bar a if you don't declare
type information a is supposed to be of
type any this is a feature which you can
use in order to migrate JavaScript code
into typescript because javascript has
been written without any type
restrictions for all these years right
before typescript was introduced you can
put anything too available
you can put fun datatype and then down
the line you change it to something else
javascript doesn't complain and there
have been a lot of functional code
written to use that and not kidding
about the types but the typescript you
have to be really strict now you have to
specify a single type and you got to use
it as that type always what if you want
the flexibility what if you want to be
able to create a variable that can
potentially take in multiple data types
that's where you can use the any type so
typescript introduces this new data type
called any Demeter declare it is by
using : any or you can just skip this
and by default any variable is of type
any so this tells typescript to get it
turns off right don't do type checking
for hey I can assign anything to a and
typescript is not gonna complain so for
example equals stem here and then equals
true here then a equals some sample
string this all works fine with your
basically told typescript to ignore any
type checking far variable hey earlier I
mentioned that this is a handy feature
to use when you're migrating code from
JavaScript typescript so let's say you
have a variable called a that is taking
on multiple data values in your code and
you need to give it a type you really
cannot give a single type so in that
case having it as any would mean that
all those different value assignments of
different data types would still work
fine and typescript is not gonna
complain there is another feature of
typescript typing that can be handy
we have a certain limited number of
types that you want to assign to
available let's say you have a variable
a which can take in a value of a number
or it can take in a boolean right it can
be one or the other let's say it's
always has a number value are a boolean
value it cannot be anything else one way
to solve the problem is by putting a
data type is any that case he can take a
value of number yes it can take a value
which is boolean yes but the problem is
this is too loosely typed you can have a
take on a value which is anything it can
be a string it can be anything else so
that's not ideal when you have just two
data types that you want to take that
case you can use something called less
Union type now the way to create a union
type is by creating the types number and
using the pipe symbol for R and then
using the other type boolean so what I'm
doing over here as I'm saying a takes on
a number type or a boolean type so this
is supposed to be a union type I'm
basically telling typescript to be okay
if a takes on either a number or a
boolean but if it's anything else I want
typescript to throw me an error so let's
say I assign a string to it now it's
going to complain because it's not a
boolean or a number but these two
assignments work fine because there's a
number and there's a boolean so this is
another way you can kind of loosen the
type checking of typescript you have two
options one is use it I have any for a
variable so that anything goes you can
assign anything to that variable or if
you have a certain set of types that you
want that variable to take as values you
can use what's called a union type which
is basically specifying all those
different types separated by the pipe
symbol or the R symbol you can have it
the string in which case it's gonna
accept a boolean a number or a string so
you can have as many of these as you
want but again ideally you would want to
minimize it so that you still get
some kind of strictness when it comes to
assigning the values so use this if
possible use union types of possible and
if you have too many types or
unpredictable types then use any to just
tell type script to not do type checking
for that variable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
