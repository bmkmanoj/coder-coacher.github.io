object-oriented programming in any
programming language is a concept called
inheritance are to be precise
multi-level inheritance you won't be
able to create objects that inherit from
other objects so you create a behavior
in one and then other objects which
inherit from it are going to get that
behavior for free and then you can
extend the behavior if required now in
JavaScript I've already seen something
like that happen in the previous video
you were able to create something of an
inheritance by putting something on the
objects prototype and then having other
prototypes inherited so when you have
something on your prototype let's say
dick this picture right am an employee
function you have employee instance is
created by calling new employee you have
the implies prototype so you can have
this kind of a multi-level inheritance
you know you can see that that's
happening already but this is not
exactly what we want let me give you a
scenario where I'm going to use this
inheritance and we'll see how to do this
in JavaScript so let's say I have an
employee function which current which is
going to create employee instances and I
have things on the implies prototype so
that every employee is going to get it
now what I want to do is create some
manager objects and these managers are
also implies it makes sense that they
are employees and they get all the
employee properties but then you can
have properties which are specific to
manager how do you do this in JavaScript
well this is a picture we've already
seen and let's say I create a manager
function and that function is going to
have a prototype of cars and I create a
manager object and this managers
prototype also has a dunder proto which
points to the objects prototype this is
something that happens for every
function that you create as is now what
we want to do is change this up so
before we change it let's create these
functions and add some behaviors on the
employee prototype I'm going to start
off with a clean Firefox window now I
open the console here so I'm going to
create a function called employee which
takes in the name
and let me set something on the
employees prototype let me have a get
name method which just gets the
instances name this should be familiar
now now let's say I create an instance
of employee now I can access EMP one dot
get name then it's going to get me to me
now what I want to do is create some
manager objects I want the manager I
want the manager to have two fees one is
the name one is the department that they
are managing so let's say this start
department equals department so a
manager is kinda like an employee just
both the name field and the department
field and now I'm going to set managers
prototype to have a gate department
function which just returns the store
department it's very similar to the
employee and on a chair create a manager
object
this manager has an in Michael and he's
managing the department sales now I have
access to MGR dot get department just
going to get me the department but
here's a problem I cannot do MGR dot get
name because that function does not
exist it exists for employee but it does
not exist for manager so if I had to do
manager that get name what I need to do
is explicitly set the kid named function
on the managers prototype right now I
just have the get department property I
also have to have the get name property
which is going to be another function if
it seems like a waste because there's
already a get name property on the
employees prototype can we share this so
here's the picture this is what's
happening right now
we have the employee function which has
the prototype
have a getname property on the employees
prototype which is how all emps which
are created by using new employee is
going to have the get name then we also
have the manager function and we have
the managers prototype which has a get
department okay and even this hazard
under Club which points to the objects
prototype of course then you have the
manager over here
so in essence both these set of objects
right you have the employee function
implies prototype pointing to the object
prototype the manager function and the
managers prototype which also points to
the objects prototype so whatever is an
employee is not accessible by manager
and whatever is in manager shouldn't be
accessible by employee so we are not
going to solve that problem anyway so
how do we have these two prototypes
share something want me to have them
share something is to put that on the
objects prototype you can say object dot
prototype dot get name in which case
both the employee and the manager
prototypes can have a get name property
but the problem of putting this over
here is that every object in our
JavaScript environment is going to get
that get in property which is not good
we just want the employee and the
manager to get so what we can do is
since this gender proto is just a
property reference on the managers
prototype if we were to change this
gender proto reference to say hey don't
look at the object's prototype instead
look at the employees prototype if I
were to just have this gender prototype
property point to the employees
prototype like this then guess what's
going to happen you know look at the
manager for a get name manager doesn't
have it it's going to go to the managers
prototype this managers prototype
ellicott name no it doesn't then guess
what happens it's going to look at the
employees prototype and then say it does
this object have a git name well turns
out it does so it's going to return that
value so guess what we're doing over
here you're saying that anything we said
on the employees prototype is going to
get accessed by the managers prototype
but then you can also set something on
the managers prototype which is
accessible only for managers they're not
accessible for employees so in essence
you have a multi level hierarchy
multi-level inheritance over here all
you need to do is get
the managers prototype object and change
the dunder proto property off that
object to point to the employees
prototype instead of the default just
pointing to the objects prototype so
let's change this and see how this works
all right so now if your lanyard get
name did not work so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to get the prototype
property off the manager so I'm going to
say manager dot dunder proto which is
going to get me the manager's prototype
and now I have to change the dunder
proto property off this to point to the
employees prototype rather than the
object's prototype so because right now
if I were to access the dunder proto
property of this this will be the
object's prototype turns out it's true
so what I need to do is change this to
point to employ e dot prototype now what
happens if I access manager get me I'm
going to get back Michael how did it
work again to show this picture since we
have circumvented this over here then
the proto is now pointing to the
employees prototype it gets something
from the employee all right now I can
have additional properties on the
employee so that I was able to add
something on the employee freedive
employee dot prototype dot let's say get
salary we've done let's say 100 and I'm
just going to have a temporary function
like this here now I can access EMP one
dot get salary and it's going to give me
the salary but I can also access the
manager that gets salary and it's going
to get that same property hopefully this
made sense again this is one of those
tricky topics so please revisit this
video if any of that is not clear and
all I can say is the best way to kind of
internalize this concept is by just
writing a few objects writing some
prototypes setting properties on them
and then doing a short circuit like this
and this doesn't have to be one level
you can go crazy with this you can have
another function whose prototype points
to the managers pro right now we have
one more level and that object prototype
and then this prototype then this prod
I've been this prototype C scan it goes
all the way in the chain to figure out
where to look up a particular prototype
so this is multi-level inheritance in
JavaScript very handy when you have this
kind of a structure and this is how you
do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
