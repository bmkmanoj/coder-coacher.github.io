I'm going to add one more mapping to a
URL and let's have it map to a method
and see that in X in execution we're
going to add a topic controller which
maps to the slash topics URL that we
looked at in the demo app then it comes
to slash topics when it's a get request
I want to respond with a list of topic
objects it's going to be a JSON response
which is an array off-topic objects so
let's do that in this video I'm going to
create a new package here and about a
new class called topic controller and
I'm going to put this in the package
io2 Java brain start spring boot starter
dot topic and click finish and up here
you know the steps to make this a
controller I'm going to add rest
controller to make this a spring rest
controller and here I can have a simple
method here public let me make this a
string get all topics which returns all
topics and I'm going to mark this as
Chris mapping and the URL is going to be
slash topics and one side for this this
is all it takes
to map the slash topics request that we
get from the app to return a simple
string show you the all topics of course
we need a list of topics over here I'm
just putting a string here to make sure
that this works fine so I'm going to
stop and start the application again now
insert a fellow I'm going to choose
topics and execute it I'm going to get
the string back so this works just like
we expect it to now this is not good
enough right we want to we want to
return a list of topics and ideally what
we'd like to do is connect to the
database and get the records from the
database but we are not tackling the
database part of it yet what I'm going
to do is hardcore
topic objects and then return that list
now in order to hard-code a bunch of
topic objects I need topic objects I
need to create a class called that back
it's basically the object
it's the template for the JSON for each
topic information that I wanted or done
right what is the topic and it contains
like a name it contains some kind of an
ID some kind of a code and some kind of
a description so that's good for now so
what I'm going to do is create that
class I'm going to create a topic class
go here new Java class and I'm going to
call this topic and here I'm going to
add some member variables I'm going to
have a private string ID name and
description now I'm going to have
getters and setters as well as
constructors so I'm going to have
generate getters and setters for all of
them and I'm going to generate
constructors from all of them and of
course I'm going to have a no arg
constructor just so that the object is
easier to initialize and this is my
topic model object so what I have here I
have three fields the ID name and the
description all of them are strings I
have an o'er constructor and a
constructor which takes those arguments
and initializes the object I have
getters and setters all right now what
I'm going to do is return a list of
topics from this controller so that it's
not returning a string anymore it's
returning a list of topics so let me
change this return type to say less
stuff
topic and we import the list so what we
are doing here is basically setting the
return type of the method to what the
response should be in the previous
tutorial we had to return a string
called high so the method that was
handling that HTTP request had a return
type of string in this tutorial I want
the slash topics URL to return a list of
topic objects so the method that I'm
mapping to the slash topics needs to
have a return type which is the list of
topics objects and what the spring MVC
framework is going to do is when it Maps
this request right when there is a
topics request it Maps this method
executes the method and takes that
return object that return object
wherever is this type is going to get
converted to JSON automatically right
you don't have to do anything the fact
that you have annotated this class is
the rest controller means that whatever
you return is going to get automatically
converted to JSON and sent back as the
HTTP response so all I need to do is
return that list over here and that'll
do so let me create a simple list of
topic objects over here so I'm going to
say arrays that as lists a bunch of
constructor cause I'm going to say new
topic off of course I need to pass in
the code legacy topic a spring the
spring framework and then the
description is going to be description I
have a bunch more over here so I'm going
to have alright so I have three topic
objects which I've created as a list so
I'm using the array start as list method
to create this list in line and I'm
calling the constructor on the topic
class to create new topic objects now
this list that I'm creating on the fly
was being returned by this get all
topics method
now when I call slash topics the next
time after I save this in Brad this
again spring MVC is going to call this
method and what this method returns is
the list of topic of checks in spring
MVC is going to take the effort to
convert this list of topic objects into
a JSON and the JSON is what gets
returned now I'm going to save this
class
stop the execution and run it again and
I'm going to open the browser and I'm
going to refresh the page now here you
see I get a array of objects which are
in the JSON format now how did the JSON
conversion happen again like I said it's
something that spring MVC does for us it
happens automatically so this is how
much easy it is to actually create a
restful api with spring MVC all you have
to do is create a controller for it and
map a particular request to our method
and your business logic happens in that
method in the further unit we're going
to change this to actually make a call
to the database and get the actual data
but for now I just wanted to illustrate
how the controller works by just hard
coding the data that's returned but the
mapping and all is just how it should be
in a actual application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
