of videos titled what's happening here
there is a lot of stuff that Springwood
is doing for us and it's all behind the
scenes so it actually is helpful to kind
of pause for a bit and see what it's
doing what's what's going on in the
background that causes all this magic to
happen let's start with the spawner XML
we added a couple of sections to the
politics woman and we looked at it there
was one pattern section which had the
artifact
Springwood starter parent we had a
dependency section where we chose
Springwood starter web if you have good
spring applications before you know that
you're needing more than one dependency
to get a spring MVC application running
there are a bunch of dependencies you
need to add to your upon Nord XML now we
are managing all that with just one
dependency and this is intentional what
spring boot has done is its created a
group of dependencies that do work well
together and you don't have to pick and
choose what you need you just pick the
uber group okay so here's how it works
if you just add the pattern over here
without the dependencies right let me
remove those dependencies section then I
save there's really no maven
dependencies established I have not
specified that I need a maven dependency
what the parent is pulling is just the
configuration okay this configuration
informs maven what jars tuple when you
do specify a dependency all right so
let's say I put this back and save this
now
maven downloads the jars and now you see
the maven dependencies shows up this
dependency section tells maven what
charge to download and the pennant
section configures what versions of
those charts to download let me give you
an example let's say this is a very
using 1.4.2
right so if you look here look at the
tomcat jar version so there are a bunch
of tomcat versions over here the Tomcat
jars so there is 8.5 dot 6 version of
the Tomcat jars and if you look at the
string jars it's 4 dot 3.4 all right now
let's say I go and update the version of
the spring would start a parent
do something that's really old so let's
say I make this 1.0 release right click
save now even is going to go download
the version numbers for this one again
the the jars would not probably change
but the versions of those jars would
change so if you look here the top cat
version has gone back to seven done 0.5
to and the spring jars have all gone
back to 4.0.3 so I'm going to put this
version back so that it gets the newer
versions again but this should give you
an idea this is how springing boot makes
it easy for you to pick and choose what
jars and what versions you need without
having to do all that work yourself
somebody's already done that work for
you and provided you with this preset
list this preset list of possible
combinations of jars that work well
without issues is what's called the Bill
of Materials that's what spring calls it
as you know that there are a certain
combination of jars and there's versions
that work well and it's been approved by
spring boot so all you need to do is
just pick that version of that list and
you get all the preset values with it so
you don't have to worry about individual
version numbers anymore you just have to
worry about the version of the parent
and that itself instructs spring or
maven about what are the different
combinations of versions that do work
well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
