restful appears with Jax Harris we built
a RESTful API called messenger and we
hosted it on Tomcat so the way we
configure in bootstrap the jax-rs
application was by writing a sublet in
web Direction right it was a web
application we had a web door XML file
and we created a sublet which was a
Jersey Salvatore it was a sublet class
that came with Jersey we configured it
to handle a request and that's how the
application was bootstrapped so when the
request came in it was the Jersey sublet
which handled it and then passed control
to our classes on our coat the we could
use the same thing even here but I'm
going to show you an alternative way of
bootstrapping a jax-rs application
because the thing is even though we
using Tomcat here we don't actually have
to use Tomcat or for that matter any
servlet container when you're creating a
restful api so having to use a servlet
kind of enforces that you have to use
some kind of a servlet container now
what if you don't want to use a subject
container what if we just want to create
an app that just runs as a simple Java
class so you could potentially do that
but the thing is if you're using a web
dot XML you have to use servlet
containers so jax-rs has this
alternative way of bootstrapping your
application which has nothing to do with
web dart XML and nothing to do with self
that's so Jersey comes with this class
called application and that's how you
bootstrap your jax-rs app are we going
to learn how to do that in this lesson
ok so we're going to create a new maven
project which would be a starting point
for our jax-rs application so I create a
new project by clicking in the project
Explorer tab choosing new other and look
for me then there should be a maven
project here so I'm going to select that
click Next Next again now I need to
choose the maven archetype I'm going to
choose the web app archetype you should
see this in this list
it's a maven - archetype - meba this is
like a standard starting point when
you're building a web application
using mavens I'm going to choose that
hit next give it a group ID and an
artefact ID and click finish what this
is going to do is get that maven are
type and construct a project that the
coordinates that I specified see
basically have up on the XML here and
some folder structure for us to get
started with now the thing about this
archetype is it's pretty old so if you
look at the pond or XML you see there is
no Java version specified now let me let
me do this I expand the libraries tab
you see there's this is pointing to Java
AC 1.5 which is like ancient so we need
to make some changes here so the first
thing I'm going to do is open palm dot
XML let me clear everything that's not
the configuration for our project over
here and remove all the stuff okay so
this is this is bare bones right it has
the group ID artifact ID the packaging
is a wire right version number is fine
these things we'll just leave it at the
default but now I need to add some
additional configuration for our jax-rs
project so let's think about the
dependencies what are the dependencies
we need first we need a dependency on
Jersey right because that's the
framework we're using for building our
REST API so I'm going to add the Jersey
dependency over here so it's the group
ideas are GlassFish Jersey bundles and
there is this bundle called jax-rs RI so
this bundle is all you need this
contains all the Jersey dependencies
that you would ever need so we have this
you got Jersey right hip South Jersey's
covered
dependency that I'm going to add is
Moxie if you remember from the
introductory course Moxie is the
framework the Jersey uses to convert
from our java instances to JSON
instances we don't need any extra
dependency for converting to xml because
we've got Jack's B with Java but if you
are converting to JSON we need this guy
we need Moxie we're not going to use
Moxie for at least a few more tutorials
but I'm just going to add it in there so
that this project becomes a nice
template a nice starting point for any
of your other work now I'm going to
close the dependencies that alright so
we're done with dependencies now and I'm
going to do is change the Java version
right now like I said it's 1.5 which is
bad so I'm not adding this build section
which contains a maven compiler plug-in
so what this Moumen compiler plug-in
does is force the Java version to be
something apart from the default the
default is 1.5 we didn't add anything
because 1.5 we don't want that so I'm
specifying 1.7 over here you should be
at least 1.7 if you want to follow along
this course so this is basically
specifying a compiler plug in 2 for
sub-project to 1.7 so I'm going to save
this and let's rebuild the maven go to
maven and say update project right this
updates all the dependencies now we see
we have Java 1.7 and we have all the
Jersey related jars right so all the
Jersey stuff is thanks to this one
dependency it gets the whole bundle then
we got moxie for JSON alright I'm just
going to throw in a couple of properties
here one for the Jersey version and one
for the project encoding this is always
a good thing to have
make sure it's utf-8 I'm not using the
jersey version property here because I'm
hard coding the Jersey version but it's
a good thing to do have a property
reference so that you can just change it
in
in place this is a simple project so I'm
going to bother I save this and now
we're done with ponder XML we got the
dependencies in place let's create the
application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
