environment and you're using jax-rs
i'm just going to give you a quick
introduction to have you can wire in
ejbs with your jax-rs resource so the
way EJB czar wildin in java ee is using
something called CDI it's called
component dependency injection it gets a
lot of inspiration from the spring
dependency injection or the Gua
dependency injection frameworks it
basically lets you inject being
instances using annotations rather than
lookup instances of beans using some
kind of a method or ax or a directory
the thing about Java EE CD annotations
are it's a bit different from the way
the jax-rs annotations work but you can
actually have jax-rs resources converted
to these singleton and stateless beans
I'm not going to demo this in code I'm
just going to give you a quick overview
of how it looks like so that you're
familiar with it and you can look up
online for more information so here is
an example of a stateless session bean
defined as a jax-rs resource so I have a
stateless resource over here it's
annotated with that stateless but I also
have the plat path annotation that we
already familiar with with Jack's Alice
so this kind of makes this a jax-rs
resource which is also a stateless
session bean this works the same way as
an EJB typically would but it is also
something that the jax-rs framework
picks up for handling REST API requests
and similarly here's an example of a
singleton bean being used as a jax-rs
resource you have an ADD singleton this
is something we already seen this add
singleton makes this a singleton bean
they also have the add path annotation
which makes it a jax-rs resource
so whatever jax-rs framework you have or
if you're deploying it in a Java EE
container the jack set is provider for
that container knows that this is a Jack
service resource as well this is where
the difference between the EJB way of
doing things in the jack service way of
doing things
shows up now here is the ad request
scoped annotation now we have beens
which can be request scope or
application scoped in the EJB world but
you also have the default request
scoping for our jax-rs resource now in
order to make this work tomb in order to
make this jax-rs resource a request
scoped jye resource what you need to do
is annotate it with that request scope
you don't have to do this by default
because that's the default scope offer
jax-rs resource but by making this
annotations like singleton or stateless
a request group you're basically wiring
this in with the CDI dependency
injection of the Java EE container and
of this beam can be dependency injected
you can have member variables off this
class for instance the employee class
which have the add EJB annotation that
lets you wire in different ej bees that
you already have in your container so
again I'm not going to go into a lot of
detail here this was a very quick
introduction about how jax-rs
place with EJB so you can have them both
in the same container and wire them in
using CDI purely using annotations like
I've discussed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
