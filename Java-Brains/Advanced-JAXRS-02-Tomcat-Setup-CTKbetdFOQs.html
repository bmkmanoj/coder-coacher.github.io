development environment we're going to
be using eclipse as our ID and we're
going to set up Tomcat as our webserver
where we deploy and run our REST API so
let's set up Tomcat so I have a clean
workspace nothing going on here so I go
to the service tab and I set up Tomcat
I choose Tomcat 8 for this course
because we're going to be using some of
the sublet 3 goodness you can probably
get by with Tomcat 7 but I'm going to be
running these on Tomcat 8 so I highly
recommend you use version 8 to follow
along so to configure the server here go
to the service tab and click on this
link to create a new server go to the
Apache folder choose Tomcat 8 hit next
now I need to navigate to the location
of my Tomcat 8 folder or you gotta go to
the Apache website Tomcat website
download an extract Tomcat 8 somewhere
on your hard disk and then look it up
using the Browse button so I have Tomcat
8 and this directory I'm going to choose
Java SE 8 and click finish now let's run
this and see if it works okay dump caddy
to start it up let's verify it works by
accessing localhost 8080 if you get a
404 that means you got a switch Tomcat
directory just stop the server double
click on it and choose Tomcat
installation in the server location
option alright so I'm going to close
this so that I can save it and let's
start this again
so we're start it up refresh we get the
lovely tomcat Welcome page and if you're
wondering what happened there so if you
double-click on the Tomcat server where
you can configure Tomcat you can choose
where the dung gate installation points
to right you specify the server path and
the deploy path over here so you can
choose to use the workspace metadata
which is your server
is metadata or here are you can choose
the Tomcat installation which is the
directory in which you have Tomcat
installed if you use the Tomcat
installation folder you get to see this
nice page because this happens to be a
page that's in the Tomcat directory
right so if you point down get to your
workspace metadata you don't see that
page but if you point it to the Tomcat
installation directory where you have
downloaded and extracted Tomcat you get
to see this page so that's all we did
over here alright so Tomcat is
configured on to the next tutorial
