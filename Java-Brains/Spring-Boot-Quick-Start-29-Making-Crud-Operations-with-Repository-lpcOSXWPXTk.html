later JPA and I mentioned that if you're
doing just crud operations on an entity
class you don't have to implement the
data layer you just you use the credit
repository that comes with spring Lita
JP of all the typical crud operations
are automatically handled for you and
you can you use the methods directly off
the credit repository now let's look at
what those methods are and how we can do
the crud operations so first what I need
to do is get the topic repository
instance into my topic service so that I
can make calls to the topic repository
from the service the best way to get an
instance into a spring service class is
by auto wiring it we have done this
before so I'm going to create a new
member variable a private topic
repository and I'm going to mark this as
auto wired and now with this
when spring creates an instance of topic
service it's going to inject an instance
of the topic repository to it so when I
write my methods I can use the topic
repository field knowing that it's there
now let's do this let's replace all
these methods to work on the topic the
hard-coded topic instance I'm gonna
switch it to making calls to the topic
repository and you'll see what are the
methods that we get from the topic
repository thanks to it extending the
current repository so let's start with
getting all the topics right now I'm
just returning this hard-coded list
which is what I've done over here so I'm
going to change this what I'm going to
do instead is make a call to the topic
repository let's see what were the
methods that it comes up with so I'm
going to say topic repository and let's
have this Eclipse autocomplete give us
the list of methods you see here there
is this method called
find all that should give you a hint
it's basically getting all the instances
from the table we this gets you
everything which is what we need we want
all the topics so find all
is perfect the final is an iterable so
what I need to do is convert this to a
list and send this back now just this is
all we had to do to connect to the
database run a query to get all the
topics convert each of those rows into
topic instances and get it back right
find all is doing all that for you
automatically now how do I convert this
iterable into a list so I need to create
Alice let me create a list here so I'm
going to say topics is a new ArrayList
so I'm gonna lies in URL list here and
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
iterate over this so what I get back
over here with fine doll is in iterable
so I'm going to iterate over this I
think there's a for each yeah there's a
for each over here and what I'm going to
do is for each of the elements that it's
found I'm going to put that element into
this list so I'm going to use a method
reference here topic hat so topics
rather so for each of the elements in
the iterable
I'm calling the add method on the topics
and passing that element so what I'm
doing here is a method reference if you
are new to method references and lambda
expressions I definitely recommend you
check out the Java 8 lambda basics
course on Java brains which covers what
learned expressions and method
references are in considerable detail so
in a nutshell what I'm doing is creating
a new topic list topics list and I'm
iterating for the result ask the fine
doll from the topic repository which is
basically an iterable of all the topics
in the database and for each of them and
populating this topics list with that
element and now I'm going to return
topics and with this we have
successfully replaced the get all topics
alright next let's change the add topics
how do you add a topic to the database
now let's see again if the topic
repository has a method to do just that
if I scroll down here you see there is a
save method which takes in a generic
type so let's see if this works
can I pass in the topic well turns out I
can and this is all I need to do to save
a topic to the database again the topic
repository comes with a save method
after the box if you cannot believe how
easy this is well trust me this is all
you have to do so let's run this I'm
going to save this so right now what
we've done is we've updated the get all
topics method and the add topic method
so we can run this add a topic first and
do a get all topics to see if that card
successfully added now before I run you
might be wondering well know when is the
database how do I initialize the
database that I'm connecting to but you
don't have to initialize the database
for now because look what we're doing
over here
we are saying we need an embedded Apache
Derby database so spring boot comes with
this embedded Apache Derby database it's
gonna add it to the maven dependencies
so when I start the server I'm also
actually starting and embedded Apache
Derby database and Springwood knows that
that's what you're going to connect to
because that's what's available alright
so you don't have to provide any
connection strings nothing of the side
well connect to an external database
later with there's this additional step
to tell Springwood hey can I do that
database but for now you don't even have
to do that that's just how easy it is
alright so now what I'm going to do is
stop the server and I'm going to start
this again that the running this as a
java application
and now let's
request to slash topics they should read
on an empty list because there is really
nothing in the database now what I'm
going to do is make a post request to
slash topics and in my post body I have
a simple our topic object right I'm
going to say send and now I don't get a
response path and if I were to do a get
again well there you see it has returned
the object that we have saved I can make
one more go here and take all the shower
I'm going to make requests again and I'm
forward to a get I should return both
JavaScript add in Java I do so we are
able to successfully connect to the
database and make these calls if you've
moved away from the hard-coded list but
at least for two methods now let's look
at the other methods now we have get
topic which gets one particular topic we
have update and delete let's see what
are the corresponding methods in the
topic repository which let us do just
that so I'm going to take this out and
let's see what method it has to get an
entity so we're going to say topic
repository dot well there is a fine one
which takes in a string why does it take
in a string because in a topic
repository we mentioned that the ID is a
string so the entity is a topic and the
ID is a string so the topic repository
has a fine one method which takes in a
string and it turns a topic so what is
the string that we need to sign it's an
ID right so all I need to do is just
return that so topic repository define
one takes in an ID and returns the topic
and our business server is just
basically returns that as you can see
making a call to the database and
returning the value is actually easier
than returning from a hard-coded list
which is which I find funny
but yeah that's all that's all we have
to do all right so that we have the kit
topic implemented let's look at update
topic again I can remove the stuff and
let's see what method topic repository
magically has for us as you can see we
don't have an update method now is this
where the magic ends do we have to
implement it well the good news is no
what you can actually do is use the same
method as the add topic and just pass in
the updated topic might be wondering
well how does this work a save can do
both an ad and an update well it can
because you notice what we are doing
over here we are sending it a topic
instance and the topic instance has
information about what the idea is and
what the instance itself is so the
repository knows enough to see if there
is already a row in the table for that
particular ID so if that row does not
exist then it's going to do an insert
but if the road does exist it knows that
it means to do an update so we don't
need two separate methods in the topic
repository all I need to do is do a
say-so as long as the instance has the
ID set on it I don't even have to pass
in the ID right all I need to pass in
the instance and the topic repository
does an insert on an update as necessary
so this is really cool let's look at
delete topic now what do I have to do to
remove a topic so as you can imagine
that is a method to delete a topic so
let's see there is a delete here which
takes in an ID and there's also another
signature which takes in a topic itself
but what we need here is the ID so we
just pass in an ID to it and it's going
to delete that particular thing so with
this we are pretty much done I can
remove this hard-coded list finally and
we are completely hooked in to the
database now the hard-coded stuff
anymore so I'm going to kill the server
and start this again let's go back let's
go back to our postman window I'm going
to do a get again and you don't see
anything here because it's an embedded
database it basically clears everything
out when you kill the server now I'm
going to make a post request to Java I'm
going to make another post request to
JavaScript do a get again we're just
going to get me both I can do a get for
a particular URL which is the get by ID
and it's going to get me just that ID I
can make a put request to this thing and
the request body contains an updated
payload let's say I do this updated Java
and this is the updated Java description
and now if I do a get for everything you
see the Java portion has been updated
now let's say I want to delete Java
Script I'm gonna say slash JavaScript
and I'm going to make a delete request
now if I were to do a get JavaScript
goes away so we have the complete crud
that we implemented with very very
little effort I had to describe all the
stuff to you but you look at the amount
of code that we have written it's hardly
anything so we just added so let's let's
summarize what we that write to connect
to a database we added the write
dependencies in bounded XML write this a
couple of dependencies spring data JPA
and the Derby next if you marked our
entity class as an entity class by using
a couple of annotations it was the
identity and the add ID for the member
variable which is going to correspond to
a primary key column next we implemented
an interface where we create an
interface rather called topic repository
which extended a repository that came
out of the box which was a crud
repository we just gave it the genetic
elements and that was it this is all we
had to do and we caught all the crud
operations
just like that and now in our service we
use those methods we use a fine doll
this is actually a slightly more
complicated than all these other
one-liner stuff because this returns an
interval and I had to iterate over it
and add it to a list that I created over
here and return it but look at all the
other methods fine one save delete all
these are methods that kind of came out
of the box because we implemented the
scrud repository so this is this is why
I if I find this fascinating you know
compared to the kind of work that people
had to do using JDBC years ago where
they had to write every query manually
this is super easy and very convenient
alright so in the next video we're going
to see what it takes to actually connect
to an external database so one thing
that we did do in this video was use an
embedded database just by dropping in
this class into the class path so you
know when I start to this server I'm
also starting an embedded database
server what we would like to do is
connect to an external database could be
post press it could be my sequel so how
do you do that with spring boot let's
look at that in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
