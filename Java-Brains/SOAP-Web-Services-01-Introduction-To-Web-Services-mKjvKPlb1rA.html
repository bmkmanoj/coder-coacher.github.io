welcome to this course on soap web
services in Java when we talk about web
services in general
there are primarily two different types
of web services you have one type called
us soap web service then you have
another type called as rest web service
so up is the older of the two rest is a
new entry into the web service well but
both of them are in use and both are
popular in this tutorial series I'm
going to be focusing on the soap web
service and I'll have a different series
later which covers rest so in the Java
world there are two different
specifications so there is a
specification for soap web services
called jax-ws and there is a
specification for rest which is jax-rs
right so this course is going to be
about this one so so what is a web
service first of all a web service is to
put it very simply a service that's made
available with the web I know you'd have
never guessed that one right but that's
placing the order web services it's
basically a service that's made
available over the network and it's
accessed with the network well you might
think that isn't everything online a web
service then because everything you
access online is a service that's
provided over the network right so you
go to a social media website so you use
that service to interact with your
friends you go to an e-commerce website
you use that service to purchase
products so can we call them as web
services but the thing is the difference
between a standard website and a web
service is that a website is meant for
human consumption while a web service is
meant for code consumption or
application level consumption let me
explain that with an example let's say
you're writing some code for an
e-commerce application and you've
written a business service to get the
list of products so let's say you have
written a class with a method called
get
products
this is your method and you have created
a business service for it
now this business service is deployed on
your application soap
let's see this is your observer
which hosts the other parts of the
application could be other services
other pieces of code and all these other
classes and other pieces of code I have
now free to call this method to get the
list of products right so this since
this is tip the ID on the same app
server it's a simple java method called
so any of these classes can use this
functionality by calling this method
right now let's say you want to give
this feature you know you want to
provide this feature to your users so
you could have like an MVC module
that makes this available as a web
application so the users could actually
enter a URL and see the list of products
on their web browser right so you show
the list of products but is actually
making a call to this get products so
the MVC module probably has a call to
get products and it shows the products
in a nice HTML you know format so now
what you've done is you have essentially
created a web application right so this
is a web application because any user
can use this application to show and to
see the list of products now let's say
you have a friend a fellow developer who
comes to you and says hey I have this
really cool application that I'm working
on right so this is your friends
observer
and your friend has got this really cool
application that's deployed on the app
server and your friend says hey I want
to call your get products method and
show the list of all of your products in
my application right so this is a
completely different application server
and your friend wants to make a call to
your business service get products would
it be possible well one way we could
achieve this is by packaging your
business service into a jar file right
and hanging this jar file to your friend
so what your friend does is takes your
business service as a jar file and
applies it on the app server on his app
server and then his application
makes a call to this method which is in
the journal file so there is a kit
products call
and then the functionality the code is
in the jar file with this work then we
probably might not work because the
scale product is probably making a call
to a database which has the list of
products and this database is hosted
along with the app server on your
infrastructure right so this your friend
has a completely different app server
and probably has a completely different
database this probably will not have the
list of products that your friend is
actually interested in that data is over
here right so that might not work and
the second disadvantage of this veis
let's say you update your get products
business service let's say you create a
version two now what would you need to
do to update it over here what you'll
probably have to do is repackage this as
a new jar file and hand over the new jar
file to your friend and then your friend
has to do a build read apply and then
only then will that new functionality be
available in your friends app server
right so this probably might not work
what would be really ideal is if the get
products call which your friend is doing
could directly call this get products
which is of a business service that's
deployed on your app server right if
this could directly call the instance
that's deployed on your app server that
would be really the best because this
instance has access to the data right
this instance always gets updated with
your new versions and this app will
always have the latest list of products
would this kind of a direct call work
well it works by using a web service so
that's essentially what a web service
does it allows two different machines
two different pieces of code two
different applications running on two
different servers to be able to talk to
each other so this could be app server
one
this is app server 2 so this is an
application and this is a completely
different application so these two
applications can talk to each other over
the network so the two different
machines right app server one is
probably some different physical
hardware and apps that we do is probably
a different physical hardware could be
somewhere else in the world but they are
connected over the network they have to
be connected over the network and the
applications which are deployed on these
two app servers can talk to each other
right they can call methods of each
other over the network by using web
service technology so if you have a
specific method in this application that
you want a different application to use
all you need to do is configure this as
a web service and then you can have this
application call this method directly at
execution time and of course if you want
to make this a web service as well
then this application can call this so
they can so they can actually call
methods of each other mutually the other
advantage of using web services is it's
actually signed the technology it's not
really specific to a job you can write
web services in a whole lot of different
technologies for example you can write a
web service and darknet you can write a
web service in Python or C++ right and
the best part about the web service
standard is what's called as
interoperability what means is let's say
you've written a web service Li this is
a web service that's written in Java
right the code that runs behind the web
service is actually Java code and now
let's say this is actually a dotnet
application that also has a web service
right so what the web service technology
allows you to do is a Java code a Java
piece of code can actually call a dotnet
web service and a Dartmouth piece of
code can actually call a java web
service okay and it just doesn't have to
be a web server now let's say you have
an application that's written in c plus
it's not a web service it's a simple
application that's written in C++ you
can actually have this C++ application
call a java web service or a dotnet web
service okay and they can actually call
methods and return return types during
execution time right so tell me if this
doesn't blow your mind you can actually
have different applications written in
different technologies that communicate
with each other during execution time
they can call each of those methods and
I believe this is really cool and what
this actually lets us do is you can
actually pick and choose technologies
that you want to use say you have a set
of business services that are better
implemented in C++ well you can go ahead
and write it in C++ and expose it as a
web service and then a java application
can use it right so this is one of the
strengths of EPs of this kind of a
standard and you can have you can
implement it in any technology and then
different applications written in
different technologies can use each
other's web services ok so this is kind
of like a high-level overview of web
services we haven't talked a lot about
the details in the next tutorials I will
talk about some of the terminologies
involving web services the whole web
service technology comes with its own
set of terms and terminologies we'll try
to understand that in the next tutorial
