especially the primitive types what are
the primitive types that we have
available in JavaScript we got number
boolean string we have undefined null
and symbol symbol is an es6 thing that
i'm going to set aside for the sake of
this conversation but let's look at the
other two primitive data types so you've
got undefined which is basically a value
and the data type you can have a war foo
equals undefined in which case foo
contains the value undefined in
JavaScript it's supposed to be of type
undefined so the whole data type
undefined contains just one value which
is undefined
similarly the whole data type called
null contains just one value which is
null so if a data type contains only one
value then you're not gonna get a lot of
benefit from typing so for instance if
you were to say wire foo and you use the
data type here undefined so you're
declaring foo to be of type undefined
well the only value that foo can take is
undefined cannot take anything else
similarly for null so undefined and
don't really have a whole lot of you use
in typing you wouldn't typically type a
variable as undefined you would just
assign a value and we will look at the
implicit typing in a couple of videos
from now but you let the implicit typing
of typescript handle that you wouldn't
really use these two types and the final
null
alright but know that they're there they
are primitive types and JavaScript so
they happen to also be primitive types
in typescript oh the other thing I want
to talk about is arrays so we know that
you can create arrays for my array
equals let's say one two three all right
so you've got an array consisting of
three numbers now how do you declare an
array in typescript so let's say you
want to have a my array B offer type
arrey you only wanted to contain first
of all you only wanted to be an array
you don't want it to be anything other
anything other than an array and
secondly you want the elements of that
array to be numbers only and not
anything else now how do you declare it
you can declare it in typescript by
using : number and then open closed the
square brackets so this is basically
telling typescript that my array is an
array of numbers so I can do my array
equals and m-theory that's gonna work
fine I can do my array equals an array
of one to two numbers it's gonna work
fine I cannot do my array equals an
array of string no it's gonna complain
right you see this red squiggly this is
not gonna work I cannot do my array
equals just a number that's gonna work
that's not gonna work either because
this has to be an array of numbers this
is gonna work in other operations as
well so I can say my array dot push and
I can pass in a number this is gonna
work fine I'm pushing a number to an
array of numbers types two plus happy
but I cannot do my array dot push off a
string there's gonna complain because
this is not a number you can only push a
number to an array all right and there
are a whole lot of other implications as
well with types cryptic scared of it for
you so you know that E is a number we've
declared it as a number here so I can
say a equals my array dot pop so you're
taking an element out of theory you are
sending it to a this works fine because
you know that my array is an array of
numbers whatever comes out of the array
is also a number so it can be assigned
to a which is a number but you cannot do
B equals my array dot pop because you
types of knows that B is a boolean and
it cannot assign the element of the
array to a boolean so notice that it's
quickly here so this works really good
you can declare arrays off any of the
primitive types and even the custom
types that we're going to be talking
about in the next unit and you can
assign them to other variables and
typescript is gonna do the type checking
for you but here is a thing it's with
JavaScript arrays are flexible let me
get rid of this stuff so let's say I
have a wore my array equals in
JavaScript we can do a number the string
boolean an array can contain multiple
data types and air can contain elements
which happened to be multiple data types
and there was a lot of code out there
which makes use of this you you have
code out there which manages arrays of
multiple theater types I have written
code which has arrays like this now if
you have to declare something as an
array and you can choose just one type
same number array or a boolean array
well then you letting go of that
flexibility what if you want the
flexibility what if you wanna have an
array where reality you need like a
string and a number you want the first
element to be a string and the second
element to be a number how do you do
that well there is a concept in
typescript
called the tuple this lets you create
something like an array but it's
basically just a fixed set of elements
now let's say I have a for my array
equals let's say you want to do this you
want the first element to be a number
and a second element to be a boolean so
you can do this by creating a tuple
which looks like this how do you declare
this you declare it by using the open
close square brackets and the types
you're basically saying this is a tuple
which has two elements the first element
is going to be a number and the second
element is going to be a boolean right
now I can assign my array to this
it's gonna work fine all right I can
assign my array 200 false who's gonna
work fine too but I cannot assign my
array to a single number this is not
gonna work fine you are forced to create
an array which is of the same size as
what you have declared so that's
technically not an array it's a tuple
but when you want to do things like this
when you want to create a bunch of
values which have fixed datatypes then
you can use the concept of a tuple
that's available as well so these are
some extensions to the primitive types
that we talked about in in typescript in
the next video I'm going to talk about
how typescript handles the transpilation
and especially how it handles errors
because there are a couple of things
that you will observe that are a bit
surprising if you come from a more
classical compiler based experience with
some of the older languages it's the way
typescript does compilation slash
Transportation is a little bit different
we'll cover a couple of those
differences in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
