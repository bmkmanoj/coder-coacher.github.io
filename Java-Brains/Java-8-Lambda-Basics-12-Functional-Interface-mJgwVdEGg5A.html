around the term functional interface
abet and I'm gonna explain what that
means so in this tutorial we're going to
look at where the functional interfaces
remember I told you that for an
interface to be declared as a type for a
lambda expression it needs to have one
abstract method right so we've looked at
an interface with just one method and
that was a perfect candidate for being
used as a lambda expression type we saw
the griefing interface which had just
one method called grid and you could
create a lambda expression of that type
now what do I mean by abstract method
what I mean by an interface which has
one abstract method this is an
additional requirement for this
definition as of Java 8 because in gel 8
you can write interfaces which have
implementation methods before Java 8
when you have an interface it's always
abstract methods where you just declare
in the method signature but you don't
define the method itself it's up to the
implementation class to implement the
method of the interface with the Java 8
you can have methods implemented in the
interface itself so you could have an
interface which have like 3 methods or
the 52 of them have a default
implementation and one method is the
abstract method so that interface would
be an interface with one abstract method
so this is a requirement for an
interface to be considered as a type for
al and expression it could have as many
method as it once but there has to be
one abstract method only alright so this
kind of an interface an interface which
has only one abstract method this call
of functional interface this is the type
of interface that we can use for
declaring lambda types now a functional
interface is something that is a
property of an interface now you can
define an interface which is a function
interface today but it could change
later because somebody could come in and
add another abstract method and it's
been no longer be a functional interface
now if you have lambda expressions that
depend on that function interface then
we are you have trouble right we are not
we're not going to be able to use that
interface anymore because somebody added
another abstract method and it's no
longer a functional interface so the
Java 8 we have a new way of marking a
specific interface as of
interface we're going to be looking at
that in this tutorial we looked at the
runnable interface in the last tutorial
and we know that that's not going to
change we're not going to be adding new
methods to the runnable but how about
something that we have created something
like a greeting this has only one method
and it works fine for our lambda
expression this gives a clear hint to
the compiler about what method we are
talking about because just one what if
there isn't more you remember this class
works fine right we are able to create a
lambda instance of this greeting by
having a lambda expression but now what
if I went to the greeting and I added
another method let's say I add a public
wide another there's going to be a
problem our lambda is going to fail of
course the implementation is going to
fail as well but when you know that
you're creating an interface just for
the sake of lambda and you're
distributing it as a library it's hard
to see what are all the guns you press
up this interface and you really don't
want to change the interface ever if
it's being used as an interface for
lambda this is different from if you had
an interface for class implementations
you could create a new method in an
interface and ask the consumers of that
interface were creating new classes to
add that method in the class but if the
consumer is a lambda expression they
don't really have a choice
they cannot add a method they are
counting on your interface to be just
that one method so in order to enforce
this in order to make sure none of your
other teammates or other developers are
going to go in there and add a method by
mistake you use this annotation called
the add functional interface this
interface is from java relying so you
don't really need an import this add
functional interface kind of gives a
clue to any other developer that this is
meant to be a functional interface any
interface is considered a functional
interface if there is only one abstract
method and this kind of enforces it now
if I were to do the exact same thing as
I did last time I do a public another
if I were to do this case what happens
the error shows up right here in the
interface itself it says invalid add
functional interface annotation because
greeting this interface is now not a
functional atrophies it has an
additional method alright this is
another way to kind of enforce this and
to also convey your intention that a
particular interface is meant to be used
as a functional interface so while it's
optional it's recommended to use it so
that your intentions are clear about how
this interface needs to be used</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
