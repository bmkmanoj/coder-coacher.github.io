where we'll need to create a new message
body writer I'll have a copy of the
jax-rs project one I've called a jax-rs
five I'm going to open the resource here
I'm just returning text here I'm
returning a string now what if I want to
return a date right so let's say I have
the return type as a date here I'll
return the current date so I'm going to
do a calendar dot get instance that get
time which gives me the current date
okay I'm going to import date from Java
dot util now I want this API to return
the current date and since I'm doing a
produces of media type dot explain
I want Jack Cyrus to convert the state
to plain text and send it back let's run
and see what happens so I'm going to
access the same URL web API slash test
now you see there's an HTTP status five
Huntington l server error now if you
look at the console log you see the
severe error message it says message
body writer not found for the media
typed explained and for the date Java
dot util dot date okay so what's
happening here is you're asking jax-rs
you're asking Jersey to convert from
date to plain text and turns out Jersey
doesn't know how to do it remember in
our previous course we send back objects
of different kinds from our resource
classes and we converted it to JSON and
we converted it to XML that is because
there were message body writers in the
class path which knew how to convert any
object into JSON or XML in this case
there is no such converter to convert
from date to text plain now what we can
do is we can add a message body writer
since it's not able to find it
we can create our own custom message
body writers which lets us take an
instance of date and let us convert it
to text and return it back ok so that's
what we're going to do now I'm going to
create a new class here new class I'm
going to call this date message body
writer every message body writer that
you write has to implement the message
body writer interface now this is a
generic interface which takes in the
type we are writing a message body
writer which converts a date type so I'm
going to give the generic type date here
now since I'm implementing this
I mean import this since I'm
implementing this I need to implement a
few methods if I say either
unimplemented methods you see here there
are 3 different methods that I need to
implement the first method is called get
sighs this is currently deprecated we
don't have to implement this method the
recommended best practice is to return
minus 1 here so this was used in JAC
service 1.0 but with 2.0 this method is
deprecated you have to use it because
it's part of the interface you have to
implement it but the recommended best
practice is to just return minus 1 and
just forget about this method now here
are the two methods that we should be
concerned with one is it is writable the
second thing is right - it is writable
is an implementation that you write to
let Jerzy know if a certain type is
something that this writer can't handle
this model is very similar to the
parameter providers that we've seen
earlier first of all this is a provider
right let me annotate this with that
provider all right so this has a very
similar model so what's going to happen
is there are a bunch of providers which
are message body writers in your class
path right now when jax-rs or jersey
detects that it needs to convert some
return type because it looks at all the
resources right if it
finds some data type that it needs to
convert it's going to look at all the
providers which happen to be message
body writers and it's going to ask them
all hey provider given an instance of
this type can you write to the output
stream can you return this in the HTTP
response so that's this method okay so
every every message body writer is
pulled with this method and saying oh
hey can you write this so this method is
called for a given type now the first
argument is that type so if we are
trying to convert a date now we have a
date here right so what it does is it
sends this type to the is writable
method off this writer and say given
this type can you write to the output so
what we need to do is we need to see if
the type that the jacks are sends us
there's a date because this writer is
only for date if it is a date we can say
yes I can write to this and return true
if it's not a date we have to return
false so there jax-rs can continue to
ask other message body writers in the
classpath so I'm going to check here if
type happens to be a date and I do that
by this piece of code I'm going to do a
date dot class that is assignable from
the type that's fast okay so if the type
that's passed there's a date then this
returns true if it's not a date it
returns false we can also do the name
check that we did in a previous tutorial
but yeah for now this should do okay so
this is is writable lemon jax-rs ask
this message body writer hey can you
write a date type then is writable is
going to say yes I can
returns true up next when there is an
API call and the date is returned and
jax-rs has to write that date instance
to the output it knows this is the
writer needs to call so it's going to
call the right to method now the right
to method has a lot of arguments which
don't have proper names here so I'm
going to just copy the names of the
arguments from the Java doc all right so
here are all the arguments the first
argument is the date right because we
can accept a date instance too right
there are a few more arguments one is
the type the actual type you have
annotations you have the media type
that's you that you're supposed to
return so depending on the media type
you can return different things and
there's the output stream here which is
where you need to write the output to
write so this output stream is what gets
sent over as the HTTP response so you
have actual control over the stream
itself you can write whatever you want
here what this method needs to do is get
the state instance and write that to the
output stream you can convert it to a
string or whatever and you just write it
to the output stream so for now what I'm
going to do is I'm just going to do a
date dot to string and I'm going to
write data to string so I'm going to do
a out dot there must be a right okay so
the right accepts a byte array I'm going
to convert the string into a byte array
and that's it now I'm writing to the
output stream a string version of the
date and that's all we have to do we
just have to have some way of taking
this instance and writing it to the
output stream
so I just choose to do a do string and
write that one final thing we have to do
is annotate what are the media types
that this can handle now notice here I'm
returning media type dot text plane now
you could potentially have multiple
message body writers for different media
types I'm going to use this message body
writer for text alone so I'm going to
annotate this with add producers media
type dot text plane and import the
produces annotation so what this lets
Jersey know is this message body writer
needs to be used when Jersey needs to
send back explain so you could
potentially have another message body
writer that is just returning JSON or
XML or whatever all right I'm going to
save this and let's
run this project I'm going to make the
same call again to get the date and
hopefully it doesn't say no message body
right off on because it should be able
to find this message body writer and do
the conversion alright so I'm going to
do a Web API slash test again and notice
we get the date dot two string returned
in the response right so what's
happening is jack sarah says okay I've
got a date that I need to convert to
text plane so it's going to look at the
class path for message body writers that
can do that conversion it finds the date
message body writer because it has
called the is writable and it knows that
date can be converted we've written true
so it knows that this is the guy for the
job now when it actually has to do the
writing it calls the is writable and it
passes sorry it it calls the right to
method and it passes in all these
arguments and we are just writing the
two string which is how this two string
ends up on the response so this is how
you create message body writers I'm not
going to demonstrate message body
readers but that's very similar you have
create your own class which implements
message body reader which is another
interface and I think it has a read from
and it passes in the string and you
convert it to the instance the other way
around right I encourage you to look up
the Java Docs but the concept is very
similar if you know this you should be
comfortable writing message body readers
as well so I hope this was helpful in
the next tutorial I'm going to teach you
how to create your own media types see
you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
