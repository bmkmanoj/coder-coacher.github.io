springboard to bootstrap it right there
are multiple ways in which you can
create a simple spring application using
springboard
the first approach that we going to try
we're going to try all those multiple
approaches in this in this course but
the first approach we're gonna try is to
create a project rather create a maven
project right so here are the steps so
with my spring tool suite open over here
I'm going to right click here and choose
new maven project we have a bunch of
other options over here you can choose a
spring starter project a spring project
if you're not going to go into that yet
we're going to be creating a simple
maven project and we're going to add the
spring dependencies to it so I'm going
to choose the maven project option I
choose this create a simple project to
skip our type selection option so if I
do not skip the archetype selection it
basically lets me choose from one of the
different templates of heart types that
come with maven that forms a starting
point from a maven project if I skip the
archetype selection I'm going to get a
simple bare-bones maven project which is
perfectly fine we want to start from the
scratch so I have this checkbox checked
I click Next and I'm going to have a
bunch of details that I need to add for
this maven project the group ID the
artifact ID and the version the group ID
is kind of like a package name it
uniquely identifies the namespace for my
project the artifact ID is kind of like
a project name I can give the name of
the project itself the version is
basically the version of the component
the version I'll just leave it as zero
point zero point one snapshots it's like
the styling version so this is fine for
the group idea I'm going to choose I or
dot Java brains
Springwood QuickStart and the artifact D
is going to be course API and I can fill
in a bunch more details of the name as
Java brains course API and I'm going to
click finish now what maven is going to
do is it's going to start it's going to
download a simple template and it's
going to create this project here so
this is the project that it has created
has a bunch of source folders they're
all empty right now but you see it Alby
has one dependency which is the Java
system library 1.5 and as all these jars
downloaded here is the bomb that XML
that I'd mentioned earlier this is where
you can declare your dependencies and
open that double click on it and then
choose the spawn dot XML tab what you're
seeing here now is a graphical
representation of it if you click on
this last tab over here you're going to
get a text representation which is
playing XML now here are the details
that we've already entered the group ID
artifact ID version name and version and
the name and number this we have a
simple maven project now what do I have
to do to make this a springboard project
there are a bunch of steps that we have
to follow what we've done so far has got
nothing to do with springboard is just a
simple maven project what are the steps
that I need to do to convert this into a
fully working
Springwood project step one add this
block of code here called the parent
section with the artifact ID and the
group ID having these values the group
IDs are good spring framework to boot
artifact ID spring boots starter parent
and the version is 1.4.2 release now
what is this doing this is basically
declaring that our project is a child of
this parent project so this parent
project and child project is a very
maven concept it's a concept that comes
with maven you can have a maven project
which is a parent and another maven
project which is a child off that parent
the idea is that you can have
configuration defy
the parent project have the child
project inherit the configuration so
what we are doing here is we are setting
our project which is the course API
project to be a child of this project
here that they're calling the penet the
project is Springwood starter parent and
we're making our project be a child off
the spring would start a parent project
what is this project and why do we need
to make this the parent of our project
you remember I told you how spring boot
has the philosophy of convention over
configuration for 80% of the use case
Springwood provides default
configuration and only for that many
person to use case we have our own
configuration that we have to implement
so springboard is an opinionated
framework there are some configurations
that it comes with out of the box now
what the spring boot team has done is
they've created a project called the
spring boot starter parent and they put
all the default maven configuration into
that project right so this one project
called the spring boot starter pairing
contains that opinionated set of maven
configurations and now when you're
creating Springwood project all you have
to do is declare that project as a
parent and of your project contains that
same configuration it inherits set times
to maven balanced child inheriting right
so that's why we need to put this as a
parent so that you're inheriting all
that default maven configuration from
the spring would start a parent you're
going to go into a little bit of details
about what this parent is a little bit
later but it's step one for now just add
this parent block into the barnyard XML
so that we are importing certain maven
configuration all right step two is to
actually declare the dependencies you
remember I told you that
maven serves as a purpose of dependency
management we specify the list of all
the jobs that we need and then even is
going to download it and add it to the
class path now what are the what is the
list of jars that we can the need we are
creating of their application here right
this is a course REST API so it has to
listen to rest requests and provide rest
response it's all over HTTP so it's a
web application
now there are a bunch of jars that
you're going to have to import in order
to build a spring web application it's
not a simple list it's it's quite a big
list right now one thing you could do is
identify that list and add each and
every entry into this formula XML which
is what you would typically do in a
maven project right you identify all the
dependencies or all the jars that you're
going to need and make a list of all
those dependencies in do your bonded XML
but here's where spring boot helps us
again spring boot says well we know that
if you're creating a web project you
need these lists of jars that you're
going to have to add to every web
application anyway so what they've done
is they've created a meta dependency
which is like a parent dependency which
in turn pulls in all the jars that you
would need right then all you need to do
is establish one dependency to that meta
dependency so this is where you specify
maven dependencies typically going to be
step two I'm going to add this block
over here which is a dependency block
again the group IDs are got spring
framework to boot and the artifact ID
the dependency that we're actually
importing is spring boot starter web
again think of this as a meta dependency
kind of a poor dependency which pulls in
all the web related jars so that we
don't have to add each one of them one
by one okay now with this added I can
save the Palm D'Or XML and the ID is
going to go fetch all the charge so if
we notice here there are no other
dependencies except for the GRE but the
minute I save this maven is going to
build the workspace and here you see we
have a list of we have a new node called
maven dependencies and if I were to
expand this you see all the jars that of
web application would need this
downloads automatically we would have
had to add these jars manually one by
one but we don't have to do that anymore
because we have this convenience
dependency call spring boot starter web
and just by adding this one dependency
they're all set to the web application
with springboard now we notice here that
there is an error and if I go to the
markers tab maven problems here you see
it says that the project configuration
is not up-to-date with bound or XML
select maven update project in order to
fix this so I'm going to right click on
the project name go to maven and then
choose update project click OK the
project gets updated and we have all the
dependencies available over here another
thing you might have noticed is that the
JRE library was 1.5 but it's been
updated to 1.6 because that's again a
configuration that we are importing from
the Springwood parent and what if you
don't like 1.6 1.6 is ancient if we want
the latest version of JDK which as of me
recording this video today it's 1.8 now
how do i specify that I need 1.8 as the
Java version another configuration for
this just step 3 I'm going to paste this
code which is basically a properties
section and I can define a property
called Java dot version and make that
1.8 if I were to save this and have me
even do its thing you don't have to
update project again now here you see
the GRE is been updated to 1.8 all right
so this is the maven configuration now
let's move on to the next step in making
this a spring good application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
