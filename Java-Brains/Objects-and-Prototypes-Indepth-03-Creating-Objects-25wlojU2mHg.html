object-oriented programming language in
the sense you can create objects to
solve your programming problems
you're trying to solve the problem what
you would do is if you're doing the
object-oriented approach you can create
objects which represent your entities
your things in the system and you can
add logic so that they become behaviors
of objects that you can have objects
interacting with other objects to solve
your computing problem that is one way
in which you can write code in
JavaScript let's take an example of an
employee management system I know it's
cliche but I think that's something that
everybody understands so let's start
with hope you would design an employee
management system you would have objects
for employees you would have broadly
objects for managers and some kind of a
method which identifies if a person
reports to a particular manager or not
really essentially looking at objects
and behavior right that's all there is
to object oriented programming okay so
let me start by creating a simple
employee object I'm going to call this
EMP one I'm going to make it an empty
object to start with and now I'm going
to add properties to it so let's say I
have like four properties I need to add
- the first name the last name the
gender and the designation of the
employee so let's start by populating
those stuff so in EMP one is my object
so I'm going to do EMP one dot first
name which is going to create the
property first name on the object and is
going to assign the value which is the
string Michael now I'm going to add
other properties similarly I'm going to
have EMP one dot last name the gender
and the designation so with these
property assignments I now have an
object assigned to EMP one and it is
going to contain these four properties
first-name lastname gender and
designation now this is something that I
would need to repeat for every employee
in the system right so let's say I want
to create another employee I would need
to do the exact same thing from P to
initialize it to an empty object and
then again set the first name the last
name the gender and the designation so
this has to keep repeating for each and
every employee in the system and you can
see right away that this can get tedious
if you have like 100
in your company you need to do this
hundred times and you need to be really
careful because let's say you miss one
line right so you're basically skipping
a property off an employee object which
could cause problems later so you need
to make sure that this assignment of all
these properties is foolproof you need
to make sure that it doesn't fail then
you have things like this which you need
to repeat multiple times then you don't
want to repeat the code multiple times
what you would prefer to do is to write
it once and then use it in multiple
places and JavaScript has just the right
structure for it which is a function you
need whenever you have a piece of code
that needs to be repeated multiple times
from multiple data you just create a
function and pass the data as arguments
so let's say I create this function
called create employee object so the
purpose of this function is to create
employee objects like this basically
what we are doing over here
okay so let's say I copy over this code
and add it as a function over here so
let's say I'm going to paste this code
I'm going to call this route on for
maybe another call this new object is
going to be this in the object I'm going
to say new object dot first name
everywhere I'm replacing the object with
new object and then in the end I need to
return this object so I'm going to say
return new object now this is going to
create now this function create employee
object is always going to create just
one employee object because the values
are hard-coded I want to make this
dynamic so I can accept these as
arguments let's say I accept the list of
arguments here which is the first name
last name
gender and the designation now that we
have this I can replace this string
hard-coded string with the first name
that I am accepting from the method
argument so let me go ahead and replace
all this other stuff with method
arguments go now we have a function
which accepts four arguments which are
the properties of your newly created
object the object that you want to
create and now this function is going to
do this job right so rather than
repeating these lines multiple times we
just call this function with the values
that you need so let me create a third
employee object for mp3 and I'm going to
use this function now all right so I'm
going to say create employee object I
need to pass in the four arguments let's
say I pass this and now mp3 is a new
employee it's a new object which behaves
exactly like EMP 1 and EMP 2 they have
the same properties but now that the
values that you need now if you don't
really to repeat all this stuff every
time you just call this function and
then now you have something which
creates objects for you ok now if I were
to put this code on the scratch pad and
run this now I'm going to have three
objects
EMP 1 there's an object emp2 is another
object which was created manually by
writing all these lines manually but now
if I look at EMP 3 you can see that it's
a similar object but now we have call
this function in order to create it so
we didn't have to manually repeat this
all right so this is one image we can
create objects without having to
duplicate code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
