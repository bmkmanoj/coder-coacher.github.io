are a few other properties here we'll
have a look at what these are take a
look at this one we have the JDBC
connection pool size you know it's set
as one which will do for now we will
have a look at what the connection pool
size is and how to change it in the
later tutorials
next we have something called as a
sequel dialect the dialect has been set
as H to dilate this is the case because
we know it was using H 2 database now if
we need to look at what is the dialect
for Postgres and this is again a setting
which depends on the database so
depending on what database you're
connecting to you will have to set that
eye dialect and what is a dialect mean
dialect is is it's a configuration that
you specify here so that hibernate knows
what kind of language needs to use to
talk to the database and what do I mean
by a language to use to talk to the
database isn't it all SQL
yes most of the queries that we write
our SQL but some of the databases have
some peculiarities when it comes to how
we use SQL to connect to the database
the way you run queries in Oracle is
different from the way you run queries
in a Postgres or a MySQL for example
there are some nuances which are
specific to the database itself so if we
specify what kind of a dialect hibernate
needs to use to connect to the database
hibernate will then use that particular
dialect or that particular language in
order to write and execute SQL queries
since we are not directly writing the
scale queries since hibernate is doing
it for us we need to provide hibernate
with this information so that hibernate
knows what kind of a sequel dialect the
database is using so this is again a
class which is inside the hibernate
package so this is something that you
would have added along with the
hibernate library so it's over here now
we need to pull up the class inside this
library that is specific for Postgres so
what we have mentioned here the h2
dialect is specific for h2 and what
would be the class which is specific
or Postgres now we need to search for
the particular package which is the oil
cabinet dialect here okay here it is we
have the archive in a dialect package
and inside this here you can see there
are classes for every database that you
can think of gh tools over here H SQL is
here in form X and all the MySQL Oracle
everything is over here so what we need
is this Postgres we have Postgres plus
also we just will just use Postgres SQL
dialect which is the basic SQL dialect
so we will replace this with this class
name the PC here so it is PostgreSQL
dialect so this class has information to
hibernate which says what are the sequel
very variations that we need to use
specifically for writing queries for the
Postgres database so now that this is
set we don't have to worry about all the
other configurations but let's quickly
go over them anyway at a very high level
okay so we have another configuration
which is the second level cache don't
worry about this we will look at what
second level cache is later here we have
a property called show SQL which which
is set to true which means hibernate
will print out all the SQL that it
generates it's a handy feature for now
since we are learning hibernate so we'll
leave this as on this is an important
property we have h PM 2 DD l dot Auto
and it is set to create what this means
is depending on what we configure as
model objects it's going to create the
database schema that's required to save
those model objects remember I told you
earlier that we don't have to create the
tables which are require
for saving these objects have been it is
going to do it by itself how hibernate
does it is say I want to pass an object
to hibernate and say hey happen I'd save
this object for me hibernate is going to
look at the database and see if there is
already a table available to save the
object now if the table is not available
hibernate will create the table for us
and it will have all the right columns
which are required to save all the
member variables of the object so we
believe this is create so that we don't
have to create the tables ourselves now
here we have something called as the
mapping class here it says names the
annotated entity class so what this is
doing this here we need to list out all
the model classes that we have
configured so that's going to be the
next step we will just leave this as it
is for now so depending on what model
classes we create we will have to
mention the name of the class over here
so step one is done almost well except
for this particular entry so this we
will fill after we complete step two
what is step two after the first first
step which is configuring the hibernate
XML the second step was to actually
write the model class so let's do that
now I will say new class package will be
the usual Java brings package with a DT
or next word because we are writing a
model class let's call this class user
details to finish okay I have my user
details model class here I'll just have
a couple of member variables I will have
an integer user ID make the supply of it
and I'll have a string
you use a name for the first example
this should do I just have an ID and the
name
now let me generate the getters and
setters okay now we have our model class
with the user ID member variable and the
name member variable the ID is an
integer and the name of the string they
are of private put the member variables
are private so I have defined public
getters and setters so that they are
accessible now this is the model class
that hibernate needs to persist so in
order to do this we need to go to the
hibernate configuration file and specify
that in this section the mapping class
we said that this would be replaced with
the model class no matter how many model
classes you have you will have to list
down all those classes here so since we
are having just a user details class I
will list the user details class here
with the complete package name use the
details okay so now this completes the
first step which is configuring
hibernate using this hibernate or CFG
dot xml cell flows this file we are not
done with this yet there is still a
couple of things we need to do here in
the model class so what I need to do
here is to give some clues to hibernate
as to how to persist this class and the
way we do that the way we can figure
this is by using annotations here you
can also configure this using xml's
we'll look at that in the later
tutorials but in this tutorial we're
going to use annotations so there are
- annotations that we have to use at
least these two annotations at the bare
minimum we need to specify the two
annotations to this model the first of
those annotations is at entity as soon
as I type that it comes up with an
import suggestion I'm when I open this I
see two possible options one is import
entity from Java X dot persistence and
another is import entity from our dot -
a dot annotations now which one do we
choose we will go over the Java extract
persistence even though this is a
hibernate tutorial we are not going to
go with the hibernate package I will
explain why we are going with this
particular Java extra persistence import
later so just go with this for now so
this is one in this is one annotation
the second annotation is called ID and
that needs to be on top of the member
variable which you want to allocate as
the primary key now let me use the ID
the user ID property and I will mention
the add ID annotation here so again I
need to do the import I will import from
Java extra persistence now so what are
these two annotations doing first entity
is telling hibernate that it needs to
treat this class as an entity and it
needs to save it
well view already configured this in the
XML haven't we we have let me open up
the signal okay here we've already given
the name of the class as an annotated
entity class now why do we have to give
an entity here as well we need to give
this because there are a few other ways
in which we can we can make an object
annotated without it having to be an
entity we'll have a look at that in
later tutorials but what what this means
is that all your model classes which
have annotations have to be listed here
so that -
it looks up at the annotations in those
classes and takes action accordingly but
in each of those classes you need to
have the corresponding annotations which
dictate how hibernate is going to treat
those classes and the thing that we need
to do at on the top of the class header
you know on top of this public class
class name is the entity which means
that we are telling hibernate to treat
this class as an entity class the second
annotation as I told you it's an ID
annotation which says that this field
will be the primary key for this object
so hibernate knows that it needs to
treat the values of this field as the
primary key now with these two
annotations we are actually done with
the second step which is writing the
model class so we will be using only
this class for now we can have as many
model class as you want in this in this
example we'll be using just one model
class which is the user details we have
given all the annotations that happen it
needs to get going so the entity and ID
class are the only two that are
mandatory so now that we have done this
let's move on to the next step</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
