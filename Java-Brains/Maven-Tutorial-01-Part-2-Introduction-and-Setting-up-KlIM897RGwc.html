compile this code let's have a look at
what's there in the Java class that
maven has built for us okay it's just a
main method with a hello world which
works fine enough for us now in order to
compile our maven application we first
need to go to the directory in which we
have the bomb dot XML so this is the
application directory so make sure
you're over there and then what we need
to do is issue a command MVN compile the
maven takes care of downloading all the
related dependencies that you mentioned
in your palm dot xml and it's going to
get that ready and it's going to do the
compilation of the java classes in your
application directory again it's
downloading all the plugins so if it's
the first time you're running this this
might take a while and there you go the
compilation is done now you don't have
to compile each and every class now say
you have 100 classes inside your SRC
folder SRC main folder all those classes
will be compiled and it will be
available ready so now once all the
compilation is done and I need to
package this so again I use a MBN
package command now it's going to
package this into a jar file might
download more plugins in the process
okay now the packaging is done at and
you can see here at building jar it has
created the jar in the target folder and
it's maven desktop and the version dart
jar what this is actually also done is
it has also run our JUnit test cases say
for example in this SRC test
see I had test cases for all my code in
the SRC main folder then maven would run
all those test cases as well every time
it has a compile so we don't have to
worry about manually running the test
cases ourselves so it's done
automatically now we have the jar ready
let's execute it
it's an target jar name and don't
remember the class name let's look that
up tap
well you see the hello world so this
class is executed and you will see the
hello world message there's a lot of
things that maven has done for us in the
background so let's have a quick
overview of what maven has of all the
things that me one has done for us okay
to give a very broad outline of what
happened we installed maven in our
development environment now as I told
you before
maven gets all its knowledge from the
maven repository and the main repository
has two types of information the
archetype information and the dependency
information the archetype information
has details about different types of
projects that you want to create and the
folder structure and all the required
information about creating a new project
of that particular type and the
dependency information is a list of all
the jar files that you normally use and
the other jars that are dependent on the
jar that you need so the first thing
that we did was we used the archetype :
generate command and what that did was
so you know maven went to the archetype
information repository over here and it
got all the required information about
the type of project that we are doing we
mentioned the default selection and that
just created a simple you know simple
application class and it was just one
class with a related test class along
with it now once we issued that command
may even knew that this is the kind of
application that I was trying to develop
and it got all the related information
and created the directory structure
based on that particular application and
now I'd also given what is called as the
group ID and the artifact ID now the
group ID you know informs me when that
this particular project belongs to this
group and it is analogous to what we use
as packages
developing classes and if you also
mention the artifact ID which is the ID
of the artifact that we're going to
generate out of building the application
that we are planning to write in that
case it is a simple jar file because we
just used a archetype for you know that
had only a class now after the generate
command was issued you know may even got
the directory structure information and
it also created what is the called as
the pom file so the pom dot XML has
information about the project that we
are trying to create including the group
ID and the artefact ID and it also has
information about dependencies if you
want to add more dependencies in your
application you would add that to the
pound or XML now by default since we
have created a simple application it had
only g-unit has the dependency so that
dependency was entered into pom dot XML
by default and that was made available
now once this is ready all we did was we
did a compile and package now when we
did a compile in the package may even
realizes that form dot XML has this
j-unit dependency and now it goes to the
dependency information in the maven
repository and checks what are the other
dependent jars that it needs to get say
I had depend higher dependencies on five
different jars and I had mentioned it in
the palm read XML maven is going to
check for dependencies for all those
five jars so first it's going to
download those jars and since we also
mentioned the version of the jars in the
pom load XML it's going to get the right
version and it's also going to look for
dependencies off for that version of the
jars and it's going to download them and
make them available over here and then
once this is done it's going to compile
and generate the class files and if you
do a package command it's going to
generate the base package in which in
our case there's a jar file so maven is
doing all this in the background and
since we have selected the archetype it
has information about what the build
commands are and what the jars are so we
can override the default behaviors by
specifying a different archetype or
patching by taking the default
our type itself and specifying different
dependencies are different you know
application related data in the formula
XML you will have a look at what changes
we can make in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
