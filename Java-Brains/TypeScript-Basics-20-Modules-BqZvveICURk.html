which lets you break your source code
into multiple files via building a large
application with something like
typescript it's hard to put everything
into one file it gets unruly really
really fast and you want to break this
into multiple files you can do that you
can essentially export classes or
interfaces or functions from one file
and then import it in another file right
so that's the concept of a module each
file can be treated as its own module
and then have certain elements of the
file imported into another file that is
elements of a module imported into
another module let me give you an
example you see here this person class
exists in this class's tertius file
alright so you have this person class
over here and I'm using this in the
generic start es and basically copy
pasting that class over here if you
don't want to put this in two different
places right you want to use the class
that's defined over there so here's what
I can do let me get rid of this and as
you can notice you see this error
message over here because the editor is
actually assuming that they are all one
application and it says I have this
class showing up in two different places
right we don't want that you want to
reuse the person class even though
that's not an error in this case it
might be an error and a big project
which consists of multiple files which
are broken down into modules right so we
want to reuse the person class from
classes tertius so what does it take to
get this class which is declared in
another file to be used in this file how
do I get that class definition the way
to do this is by exporting from here and
then importing it over here real export
a class from a file
is by using the keyword export so what
this does is it marks this class as
candidate for an export so anybody can
import this file this class from this
file
anybody can import the person class from
classes to TS now how do I import it the
way to do this is by using the keyword
import curly braces whatever you need to
import here it's
person from the file name which is
classes taught TS in order to do that I
need to do a relative path so I need to
do a dot slash to indicate that it's at
the same level as generics 40s and then
I say classes I don't have to do the dot
TS extension though because this is all
typescript I can skip in fact I should
skip the dot d s extension I shouldn't
provide that but this I have provided
the import statement which is required
for this to work
so again import the type within curly
braces from the path and name of the
file that we're importing excluding the
dot TS extension and now notice the
person class is in this namespace and I
don't have to define it here and these
statements work fine I'm referencing
person over here but it typescript
doesn't complain because what I've done
is I essentially told typescript that
this is a type that should be available
to me when I'm using my code and so
typescript now knows and it uses this
it's almost as if I've created that type
right here in this file here's an
important thing for you to remember now
let's say I run this right so I say TSC
generic start es and node generic start
yes you gonna run this right that works
fine now notice the console output it
spinning out by name but I don't have my
name printed out anywhere over here
right there's no console that out
console that log
anywhere here which prints out my name
well guess what that is actually coming
from classes 30s you see this class 30s
not only exports this class it also has
available which creates a new instance
of person and it prints out the full
name which is what's printing out this
thing so when you import something from
a typescript file is you're actually
executing that typescript file you're
actually running the code that is over
here
right that's an important thing for you
to remember and if you have stuff like
this it's gonna get executed as many
times as it's imported and you don't
want that you want to make these
important bill classes in portable files
to be stateless you don't want it to do
anything except export the types that
you need this is the concept of modules
you can break your code down into
multiple pieces and have one file be
like the thing that you execute
typically people do like index RTS which
is kind of like the starting point and
it imports a bunch of other files which
imports other files and so on so you can
have like a pretty complicated structure
in place but this is how you use modulus
it's a basic introduction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
