angular 1 services in depth this course
is going to cover services in angular 1x
version of the framework there are
actually three topics that I want to
cover in this course which are kind of
closely related first of them is angular
1 services services are a type of object
or a type of functionality that you can
plug in to the angular 1 framework we'll
talk about why you need services what
you need to use it for and how to use
them after we cover services we're going
to be looking at one of the several
services that come out to the box with
angular just $1 HTTP service this comes
with angular and you can use it to make
HTTP requests dollar HTTP I would say is
one of the most frequently used services
that come with angular you use that to
make REST API calls in order to get data
from a REST API endpoint or to save data
to a text API endpoint this is how you
communicate to the backend from your
front and angular application we're
going to be looking at how to taste API
service the dollar HTTP cells can be
used and will write code to actually use
it finally we're going to be looking at
promises and async programming in
angular this is a natural result of
looking at the dollar HTTP service
dollar HTTP requires us to use something
called promises it's basically a pattern
to deal with asynchronous programming in
angular 1 we're going to look at what
promises are and how to use them before
we start I just want to make a quick
note about the prerequisite for this
course I hope that you have some
familiarity with angular 1 this is not
going to be discussing angular 1 from
the scratch you must have had some
experience working with angular 1 are
you should have taken the Java brains
course thinking in angular 1 if you're
completely new to angular 1 I definitely
encourage you to take the thinking that
give your one course before you go ahead
but the other thing I should note is
that this is the angularjs one our next
version of the framework this does not
cover angular 2 so make sure this is
what you're looking to learn all right
so what are services and why do we need
in the thinking in angularjs one course
we've looked at the ng-controller
directive we created a bunch of ng
controllers in our page and we had the
corresponding controller function we did
this because we said global variables
are bad global data structures are bad
we would like to kind of bundle related
functionality together and not put
everything in one global space so we
created these controller as we created
controller functions and the
ng-controller markup would work on the
scope that was created for the
controller function each controller had
it had its own scope and everything but
in its own little container right so we
kind of saw the global problem we don't
have a global anything but now we have
the opposite issue what if you want to
share things between these things
now each koenji controller and a
controller function is its own Island it
has its own scope it has its own you
know area where it works on so it's
really hard to share so how do we share
things we don't want to get back into
the global paradigm again right we don't
want to put something in a global
namespace now let's say you have some
business functionality or you have some
common data you don't want to define
that in each and every controller you
want to have a common space where
multiple controllers can use it how do
you do that well enter services services
are an angularjs construct which lets us
create these separate things they could
be objects that could be functions which
can be shared by multiple controllers
again the idea is not to have a global
entity instead we have these new
constructs called services which are
essentially share of though you can have
a service created and you can share
those that service among different
controllers we're going to take a look
at how that's done but that's the whole
idea behind services services are
essentially reusable elements in your
angular code that can be shared across
multiple controllers these can be values
constants objects functions so pretty
much anything in JavaScript so you
create those services and have that
shared across
different controllers and different
elements in your HTML</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
