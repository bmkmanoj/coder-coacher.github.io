REST API we have a
which returns a list of hard coded
messages we will obviously enhance this
to be able to get a particular message
to be able to update a message to create
a new message and all that stuff the
problem however is this message service
that this resource is calling right so I
have a get all messages method which is
hard-coded right in so there are a
couple of messages that have hard-coded
now this will not do I will have to
enhance this service to be able to
support all those operations right the
key you know the gate particular message
update a message delete a message all
that stuff and I also talked about not
using a database for this I don't want
to get involved in all the database
connectivity sequel queries and all that
nonsense I want to be able to stub in
with the kind of like fake methods but
they are something that our resource
class can call right so I could have a
set of methods with just print
statements so that we know that those
methods are called we don't really worry
about whether a message B is being saved
or whatnot but I went a step further I
have decided to use an in-memory set of
objects to act as a database so that's
what we're going to do in this tutorial
we're going to enhance the message
service to support all the crud
operations and when we are done with
this lesson we'll have a message service
class that looks like this there is a
get all messages method which returns a
list of messages there is a get
particular message which accepts a long
which is the ID and returns that message
there is an odd message method which
takes in a message object and adds it to
the database and it returns that message
that was added update message similarly
takes a message as an argument and then
returns that message the updated message
rimu message takes an ID which is the
long ID as an argument and then it
removes that message from the database
and it returns the message that was
removed right so these are the basic
methods that we need in our message
service
now again how you want to implement it
is up to you you could system dot out
dot println for all these methods and
just print that hey this method is
called with this argument and that's all
we would need rights again we are
learning jersey we're learning jax
we're not learning how to connect to a
database and insert records so if you
want to just to printer in statements
that's fine you can actually skip this
lesson but in this in the rest of this
lesson I'm going to talk about an
implementation which is in memory right
when you create a map in memory which is
a map of ID to message instances I'm
going to add messages to that map I'm
going to remove from that map I'm going
to get messages from that map okay so
the first thing I've added here is a
profile model object so this is very
similar to the message model object
which has the ID the message created
date and the author the profile is
basically ID the profile name the first
name last name and created right so it's
very similar structure even this is
annotated with XML root element and it
has a convenience constructor like the
message object which takes in these
arguments and sets the object now
instead of having this stored in a
database what I will do is create a
database class which is basically static
class which has a couple of static Maps
so there is a message map which maps ID
to a message and then there is a
profiles map which Maps ID to profile so
any class in the application can access
the entire map of messages in the entire
map of profiles by calling these static
methods so there is a get messages which
returns the message map and there is a
get profiles which returns the profiles
map so this is our stub for a database
this would ideally be a you know a JDBC
or an hibernate class which connects to
the database but here what I'm doing is
I'm just storing this as static variable
so that every every class and every
object can access this one thing to note
this is not thread safe because this is
you know there's no concurrency
protection over here I have done this
because I'm under the assumption that
there's only one person one developer
who's learning jersey on your machine
and they're connecting to this class
this is of course just for learning
purposes please don't write code like
this in production
okay so with this set now what I want to
do is in my message service all I need
to do is do a database class dot get
messages and then write methods to
delete a message to update to this
messages map okay so I'm going to do
that next
okay so I'm going to switch to my
message service now create a local
member variable called messages which is
a map of long and message and I'm
basically getting the messages from that
static instance right I'm doing a
database class which is a static call
that gets get messages to get this
instance of messages and every time
there is a new instance of the service
it still points to the same instance off
message so that way I can add a message
in one request updated in another
request and it will still be that as
long as you don't restart the server
it'll it will be there so it just it is
handy for trying out new things and
learning as we are doing now okay so now
this is something that I can remove I'm
going to have a list of all messages
which is basically messages that value
is right so this I want as a list so I'm
going to do a new ArrayList of messages
start values so this returns a list of
all the values of the map which is all
the messages that we have in the map
then this is called so I'm going to
create similar methods to get one
message to update a message and to
delete a message so I have get message
which takes an ID and it does messages
dot get off that ID add message takes in
a message is an argument now this is
something that needs to figure out what
the ID of the messages right so when a
message is added think about what the
database does right it it finds out the
primary key the last primary key and
incremented by one for example and then
it
returns that ID so it basically the
added record has that ID in it so that's
what I'm doing over here so I'm just
doing a messages dot size and I'm adding
1 to it so I get the next element and I
set the ID off the new message to that
number right so the message start size
plus 1 is the new ID and then I do
messages dot put I'm putting it to the
map the ID that I have just generated
and the message so I'm adding something
to the map and then I'm returning the
message that was added so you get the ID
back as the response right the message
with the ID is sent back as the return
and update message is fairly simple
so I'm accepting a message as usual now
the message should have an ID set when
it's doing an update so if the ID is
less than 0 I just return null if the ID
has a value then I do a messages dot put
after ID as the key and the message as
the value and I return the message
itself the removal message is also
fairly straightforward I accept an ID
which is the long and then I do a
messages dot from so messages is a map
so dot remove with an ID is going to
return the value that was a remote so
I'm going to return that so this method
returns the message instance that was a
remote so fairly straightforward this is
a bare-bones message service which hooks
up to a static message so multiple
operations is going to return the same
consistent response so you add a message
and then you do a get all messages that
message is going to be there so that's
really cool so back to the message
resource now I do a message service dog
get all messages right so let's test
this and see if this works so I'm going
to start the server run as run on server
and I'm going to switch to Chrome and
into the request URL which is messenger
of API slash messages doing a get
request the hits send well I get nothing
back why is that
because if you've removed the hard-coded
list of messages so there is nothing in
the database class right it's a new hat
so there is nothing in there so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to create a
constructor over here to just seed a few
messages right so I'm going to do a
public message and add a couple of
messages so it's the same to hard coded
messages lists this is message service
sorry
so this is the same couple of messages
I'm just putting a an ID one log and
including a new message which is ID one
hello world I'm doing a message put ID
two and then I'm creating a new message
with ID - hello Jersey with the author
Kaushik it so there are two hard coded
messages that I'm adding whenever the
message service is instantiated so I'm
going to save this and let's try that
again now if I do a message resource get
all messages it should return those two
messages let's try that
hit Send again and there you go we have
two messages so what we've done is
pretty much created this back-end this
fake back-end for us to play with we can
add messages remove messages and all
that stuff that's going to be handy when
we move on to other operations in the
message resource again most of what we
did in this lesson is not Jack satis
it's not Jersey but it's kind of like
the foundation required for us to start
doing these different read operations in
Jersey so that's what we're going to do
next in the next tutorial now that now
we have a list of all messages right in
the next tutorial we're going to get one
message given an ID see in the next
tutorial and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
