and the delete requests for the topic
resource so I'm going to copy this
existing method out and I'm going to
change this to a update topic because
that's what up put request will do and
person will change the method if there
is a put two slash topics slash ID I
want that particular ID to change so
there are these changes that I need to
do to this method so first of all the
URL is going to be slash topic / ID the
request method is going to be a put the
request body is still going to contain
the topic like the post requested when
you make a put request to slash topic /
ID the request body is going to contain
the updated topic but now since I'm
using a different URL i'm using the
slash ID URL and the ID as a parameter i
need to accept a path variable just like
i'm doing it over here so i'm just going
to copy this as well that's going to be
an additional method argument to the
update topic method in the controller
right so i'm going to take this and now
what i need to do is create an update
topic method on the service which takes
in the ID as well as the new topic so
let me go ahead and do that what's the
update topic and I'm going to pass in
two parameters one is the ID and the
other is the topic now this method
obviously does not exist so I'm going to
go ahead and create that I get the
auto-generated method here and now in
this method I'm going to use a simple
for loop to loop through the list of
topics and get the one which has the ID
same as the input ID and then update the
topic in it so I'm going to use a for
loop here I'm mixing this up of I used
stream than lambda here but here I'm
going to use a simple for loop and I
equals 0 I less than
if the ID matches in a particular topic
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
replace that so I'm going to say topics
dot set add that element I'm going to
set the new topic and I'll just return
all right so this is what's going to
happen it's going to look through safety
topic keep depending on the size of the
topic is going to look through that many
topics and it for each topic in that
list it's gonna compare the ID with the
input ID that we've got and if it
matches that at that location I'm gonna
send the updated topic I'm gonna set it
to the list and I'm just gonna return
all right so there's going to be the
service and now that I have the updated
service this controller is actually
believe it or not it's done now you get
the ID from the parameter or the path
variable sorry and you get the topic
from the post body and it updates it now
let's go ahead and try this out and
start the server let's get the topics
first then we have three topics over
here let's say I want to update
JavaScript I'm going to copy over the
JSON payload change this to a post
request to a slash topics slash
JavaScript output requests sorry and in
the request body what I'm gonna do is
put in an updated value just gonna
update the name and the description I
could of course update the ID as well
I'm not checking anything here but I'm
just gonna update the name in the
description of this case so I'm going to
make a put request now the headers
already has the content type as
application slash chaser so I mean you
can put two topics slash JavaScript at
send course I don't get anything back in
the response because the method is a
wide but let's say I'm going to do a get
request again to slash topics
now here you see the JavaScript topic
has been updated at the payload leave
the hood request
so that's update and that's the put
delete is actually something very very
similar so let's copy over this guy here
now when you make a delete you make a
request to topics / ID you call this
delete topic and the request method
would be a delete so instead of a put
here I'm going to change the total
delete the thing to note though is the
method name in the controller really
doesn't matter as you must have observed
I can give it any arbitrary name over
here these names really don't matter is
is that you have any you have a method
and you have the right annotation on
that method and the right input
arguments and it's doing the right thing
that's what matters the name itself
really doesn't matter so let's say I
call a topic service dot delete topic
off the ID so I'm going to go ahead and
Cree that method here because this can
be a wide as well and I'm just going to
get the topics array and use the remove
if option did remove method takes in a
predicate lambda expression and removes
all topics in the list where the
predicate is true so in this case the
predicate is basically for a topic if
the get ID is equal to the input IDs in
the sense it's pretty much the same
predicate as what you're doing to filter
over here here you're just doing a
remove alright so this is the delete
topic method and now my
of course I don't have to return
anything here I'm going to make this
avoid as well alright so this is done
I'm going to restart the server now I'm
going to go back to get all the topics
well the JavaScript thing that I changed
is back because we didn't process it
just fine now what I'm going to do is
make a post request to slash topics this
is the post request we did earlier I'm
going to add Java EE into the list get
again get all the topics now we have
Java EE now I'm going to go ahead and
delete the topic that I added so I'm
gonna make a delete request to slash
topics slash Java EE and of course I
don't need anything in the request body
I could just delete this off the header
still has gotten type application Jason
I'm making a delete do topic slash Java
EE we make a request of course nothing
is gotten back but I make a get to slash
topics again Java EE goes away I can
make one more delete request to
JavaScript so let's say I make a delete
to slash topics slash JavaScript I hit
Send and if I were to get all the topics
again now JavaScript goes away as well
so this is how the delete request works
so these are the standard methods for
any typical resource in a REST API so
you have the get on the root resource
URL the collection resource URL which is
the slash topics which gets everything
right you also have the individual fetch
which is the slash topic slash ID which
gets that individual topic we have the
post to the collection URL which creates
a new topic we have the put to a single
resource URL which updates that resource
that topic and you have a delete to the
single resource your resolution deletes
that topic so this should give you an
idea how to create these methods
in spring and we see again here what we
are doing is working off of a hard-coded
list but that's going to change in a
subsequent unit I want you to focus on
the controller itself and how we were
able to create a simple controller which
handles different methods by adding the
right kind of annotations in the next
unit we're going to take a slight detour
we can look at how you can create a
spring boot application that other
radius ways in which you can create a
spring good application we looked at one
saturating unit one which was creating a
simple maven project and then adding the
right dependencies but there were a
bunch of other ways you can create them
so we're going to take a look at that
and in the unit after that we're going
to get back to this application and do
some database work but in the next unit
we're going to look at a few more ways
in which you can create a springboard
application see you that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
