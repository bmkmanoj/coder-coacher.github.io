something called anonymous function
expressions you see this way of creating
functions that we looked at the last
video in this is Kyle a function
expression so this contrasts with the
other way of creating functions which we
solved before where is a function
declaration okay so if I were to take
the score out and write a function this
way this is a function declaration and
this is a function expression I don't
need the semicolon here but a function
declaration but for a function
expression it's good to have a semicolon
because this is just like any other
expression or something equals something
so you add a semicolon at the end okay
so these are the two primary ways in
which you can create functions now this
let me actually get rid of this now this
we saw was a function expression and
I've noticed that we are assigning this
function to a variable called F and we
are using F to execute it but notice we
also have a name
foo fire this function and we never use
food right we never call this function
with foo open/close so since you are
using it just with the variable F and
with the name F I don't need this foo
here actually I can get rid of this okay
and this will actually still work let me
clear and reload and run
you still get Hello printed because we
are basically creating a function which
doesn't have a name and we are assigning
it to the variable F we are using the
variable F in order to execute the
function okay so this way of creating
functions is what's called anonymous
function expressions okay so this was a
function expression okay so if I remove
foo this is still a function expression
but now I have an anonymous function
here I'm not giving this a name okay so
this way of creating functions is called
an anonymous function expression and
this is fairly common when you have a
function expression because you use the
function with the variability of
assigned it to and you don't really use
the name so we might as well have it
anonymous the tricky thing about an
anonymous function expression is you're
basically creating an inline function
just like you create an inline
string and then you assign it to
available now if you assign something
else to the video below this function
will get lost okay now I have F over
here right let's say I say F equals one
now what's going to happen if I do F
open closed well this is now no longer
going to work because F is no longer
containing of function values containing
a number value okay so this is going to
give me an error see here F is not a
function at this line because F has been
changed to point to a number value so
this is one drawback of using an
anonymous function expressions because
you might lose the value that you have
but you don't typically do that it's
it's you know you don't want to do this
if you don't want to have this error you
shouldn't really do this okay so as long
as you don't do that you can you can get
away with anonymous function expressions
and indeed it is very common a lot of
JavaScript code to have anonymous
function expressions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
