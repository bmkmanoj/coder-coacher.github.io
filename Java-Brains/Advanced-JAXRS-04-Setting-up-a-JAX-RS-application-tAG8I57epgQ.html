classes I'm going to add Java classes
under SRC main Java there isn't a folder
there so I'm going to just create one
new I will choose folder and I'm going
to create as our C main we call this
Java finish now since this has already
been marked as a source folder it shows
up like this I'm just going to click
refresh now then I have a source folder
I can create Java classes so I'm going
to create a resource first create a new
class choose the package
Arg gar shake shower brain start
we call this rest and I'm gonna say
money resource finish so what do I need
to do to make a Java jax-rs resource the
first thing is a path annotation right
I'm going to say test import path from
Java XW SRS path I'm going to create a
method here so I'm going to say public
string test method
just hundred on some string now I'm
going to annotate this with a get
because I want this to return then a get
method is called on this URL and I'm
going to do producers media type dot
text plain shorter than plain text here
okay so this is our resource right this
is step one step two is to actually
configure this to be a Jack service
application what we did in the previous
course was open web dot XML and
configure the sublet and mapped it to a
path and all that stuff turns out we
don't have to do that so there is a way
you can configure this using just Java
so I'm going to create a new class going
to call this my REST API app just going
to call this my app
all right this is where I tell Jersey
how to create this new app so I do that
by extending a class called application
now application is a class from July X W
SRS core I'm going to finish now I don't
have to implement any methods over here
application kind of has all the methods
implemented you see here I don't get an
error when I'm extending this no
unimplemented methods but this aft old
jersey that this is a jax-rs application
as simple as that now how do I map it to
a root URL if you remember we had a Web
API prefix to all our resources right so
we had a slash web api and that was
specified in the web dot XML I can do
that by using an annotation called
application path now if I import this
it's a Java extra PSRs application path
now I can pass in a value here which is
going to be that prefix now let's say I
do a Web API now this means that our so
there are two things that's happening
here so one is I have defined an app
which extends application which tells
Jersey that this is a jax-rs application
and then annotated it with application
path which says any rest api prefix it
with web api so what this application
does by default is look at every
resource write every resource in your
path it finds my resource so it exposes
this at the path Web API slash test ok
so this is all you have to do you don't
need to mess around with web.xml
ok so let's run this and verify that
this works I'm going to right click run
as run on server Molly's going to choose
Tomcat 8 the restart the server
I'm going to load hello world which came
with the artifact so if you expand SRC
main web app there is indexed our HTML
that's what it's loading but that's not
what we're interested in we are
interested in the app context Web API
slash test so I'm going to just access
that Web API slash test hit enter and
there you go we have a fully working
jax-rs application without any XML
configuration okay so we have a resource
here and we have an application here
which maps all the resources in this
