question is that something that does
dependency injection that's the perfect
answer
as of 2006 as of this day and age that's
no longer just the case spring is much
much more than dependency injection it's
a whole application framework it has its
origins from the concept of dependency
injection but it doesn't hold on more
it's actually something that lets you
build Enterprise Java applications there
are like five 142 gazillion Enterprise
Java applications out there and they all
do things which are very very different
but the underlying concept the
underlying foundation of all those
Enterprise Java applications have a lot
of similarities when you're writing a
business service you do similar things
for every business service no matter
what business problem they're trying to
solve things like transactional services
you want to establish a transaction to
connect to the database those are common
problems there are common things that
every Enterprise application needs to
solve and spring handles all those
things it provides a template it
provides a framework which lets you
build those enterprise applications it
also has a programming and configuration
model the really cool thing about spring
is that you focus only on building your
business services and you let spring
handle a lot of these common concerns
for things like connecting to the
database running queries are things like
handling HTTP requests having some kind
of an MVC layer what spring gets you do
is build classes which are simple poles
and they have annotations on them which
did not what they are so let's you're
writing a business service right you
write your business service with
functionality the code containing only
the logic that's specific to your
business application and then what you
do is annotate that business service
that class but something like at servers
and that lets spring know that you
intend that class to be a service and it
applies a whole lot of things to that
class and it manages the lifecycle of
the class so that it acts as
a service so what you do when you're
building your application is you focus
on your business problem and you let
spring handle the rest so it provides
that model for you to build those
applications and then it also provides
infrastructure support Spring has
support for various different things
like I mentioned again connecting to the
database if you are a connect to an IBM
s database you want to connect to a like
a MongoDB database Spring has
infrastructure support for it already
and you can leverage some of those
infrastructure when you're building your
applications so this is spring and there
are a lot of cool things about spring
but there are certain problems with it
too the first problem is that it is a
huge framework Spring started out by
trying to solve these common concerns
that people could have when they are
building enterprise applications right
now these common concerns are not just
one thing there are so many different
things there are so many different ways
in which you can build an enterprise
application and spring who are the years
has tried to address all those different
ways and provide support for all those
different ways you come to spring and
say hey I need to build this particular
thing with this combination in this
configuration spring says well I have a
solution for you and it has that
solution of the framework so over the
years there have been all these
different ways of building things that
spring has support for all these
different ways and it's ended up being a
huge framework in the process there are
so many things that spring does that
it's at this point of time very
overwhelming to even get started like
there are so many things how do I even
get started with a spring application
there are multiple setup steps spring
can connect to MongoDB can connect to
our DBMS it can connect to a whole lot
of other you know JDO which is all dated
but it still has support in the spring
framework so since it does a whole lot
it needs a whole lot of configuration
for it to do exactly what you want it to
do
right since it has a lot of capabilities
you need to specify exactly what you
want spring to do so there's a lot of
setup and configuration steps that you
need to do with spring and then you have
multiple doesn't apply steps
you'll need to know how to build an
after the plugin we have various
combinations the important fundamental
problem here is that spring has a lot of
capability it has a lot of flexibility
and that capability and flexibility
comes with a cost
you need to do a whole lot to get it to
do exactly what you want it to do and
the second thing is since it can do a
whole lot you don't really have a
starting point you don't really have a
guide which says okay this is the best
practice this is how you should ideally
do it unless there is a need for
something else so there's no pathway for
you to get to a point where you have a
spring application that is exactly what
you wanted to do right you're left to
figure that out on your own so this is a
problem that the Spring Framework has if
you were to start building a spring
application you have these problems to
tackle with and this is where spring
boot comes in handy wouldn't it be cool
if you could somehow abstract these
steps out again going back to the
original premise of spring you want to
have something that is abstracting away
all these infrastructure concerns all
these setup and configuration concerns
so that you just focus on your business
logic granted there are 100 different
ways to build a spring application but
if only somebody could tell you that
this is for 80 percent of the cases the
right way to do it and then for the 20
person you just configure it and tweak
it a little bit so that it works
differently right if you address the
majority use case if you have some kind
of an opinionated framework opinionated
configuration it says ok this is where
you start with and then tweak it if
necessary that would be really really
good and that's what spring boot does</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
