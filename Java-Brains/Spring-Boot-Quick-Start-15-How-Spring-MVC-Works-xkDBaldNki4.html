course spring boot QuickStart
this unit is titled spring MVC the view
tier this unit we're going to be adding
some controllers and handling some
requests that we get to our web
application and build some simple logic
so that we have a proper response for
all those requests they're going to be
building the controllers and having
files that Java files that map progress
to responses but you're not going to be
connecting to the database yet we are
just going to have these controllers
ready so that later in the subsequent
unit we're going to be able to connect
to the database and show live data but
for the sake of this unit if we can
establish the mapping and use some
hard-coded values and hard coded data
all right so what is the beauty or in a
spring board application like I
mentioned the view tier is handled by a
framework called spring MVC which is
another project in the spring framework
umbrella spring MVC lets you build these
controllers which map request to
responses think about what happened when
we created our spring food application
we had an app and thanks to the spring
web starter dependency that we had in
our spring good application we actually
have spring MVC added to our app but
when we first started the app wouldn't
write any controllers so when a request
came in when an input request came in
but spring MVC said well I don't know
what to do and it showed an error page
right we did not have any controllers to
handle the requests what you would
typically do in a spring MVC application
is build these controllers so that you
know that when a request comes in you
have a proper response and the via
controller works as these controllers
are simple Java classes which map a URI
and an HTTP method to some functionality
right so this controller is a simple
Java class and it has some Java methods
to handle requests and return responses
now these methods are annotated with two
pieces of information one is a URI that
this controller is going to handle when
there is a request coming in and then
the HTTP method that this controller
method is going to handle right so let's
say there's a particular
you are I and there's a get request
coming in so you want a particular
method to handle that request then what
you do is you write that method and then
you put the right spring MVC annotations
that map that URI and that HTTP method
so that this gets executed what you do
is you write a bunch of these
controllers and apply them in your
spring boot application now when a
request comes in the spring MVC
framework is going to look at the URI of
that request and also going to look at
the HTTP method right it can be a post
request to URL a it can be a put request
URL be a get request URL see whatever
that is right it looks at those
parameters and then it examines the list
of controllers that it has in the
classpath and sees if any of these
methods have the URI and HTTP that Maps
the request that comes in if there is a
match then it executes that method and
then whatever is the return type it
converts it to a proper response and
then sends it back now what do I mean by
converting to a proper response you
remember when we wrote our first
controller when the topic controller you
know was implemented in unit 1 we
returned a list of topic objects we
don't really bother to convert it to
JSON but what spring MVC did was it
detected that this was a rest controller
so it knew that the response probably
needs to be JSON so it actually did the
conversion for us right it has the
libraries built-in which converts Java
values to JSON so it did the conversion
automatically so what you do is and you
return the value that you want to send
back as a response you don't worry about
converting to JSON spring MVC handles
that so you write a bunch of these
controllers you can have multiple
methods in the same controller class or
you can have multiple controller classes
as long as you put it in the class path
spring MVC is going to do a class pot
scan and have it ready and then it's
going to return the response based on
what the request is right it makes a
note of all the things that it needs to
handle and then it returns the right
response depending on the right request
so this is what you're going to be doing
in this unit you're going to be writing
a bunch of these controller classes to
handle a bunch of requests now what are
those requests that we're going to be
handling in the course API let's look at
that in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
