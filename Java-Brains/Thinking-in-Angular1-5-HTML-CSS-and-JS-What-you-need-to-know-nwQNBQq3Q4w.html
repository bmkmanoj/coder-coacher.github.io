of a client-side application this unit
is going to go or some of the basic
client-side application concepts if you
are completely new to client-side
programming I definitely encourage you
to take this unit but if it or if you
already programmed on the client-side
before by using jQuery or ember any of
those other client-side programming
frameworks you might want to skip this
but I'm just doing this so that if there
are pure suicide programmers who are
taking this course we are all on the
same page when we actually start
learning angular so this unit is not
going to be about angular it's going to
be about the fundamental client-side
programming concepts just so that we're
all on the same page alright so I'm
going to start by talking a little bit
about three basic technologies which
work on the client-side HTML CSS and
JavaScript HTML like you probably know
stands for hypertext markup language
it's basically a language which you can
use to build webpages right so what
happens when you access a web page on
the browser is that the browser makes a
request to the server gets the HTML
content and then it parses the HTML
that's returned what kids are done as
HTML is basically a chunk of text okay
it doesn't have any structure to it it's
just a bunch of text
however browser is going to parse this
figure out what all the tags are so
there's a head tag there's a body tag
there's h1 he whatever the tags are the
browser kind of virusis it and it builds
what's called a document object model 3
out of those tags so as the browser is
parsing that chunk of text once it
identifies a tag it creates unload so
every tag has an Associated node which
is a document object model node so a
paragraph tag would result in a
paragraph node a div tag would result in
a div node so the structure of the HTML
is basically replicated in a structure
of tree of objects okay so HTML gets
converted to this tree of objects where
each element each node in that tree
corresponds to attack and thus tree is
called the document object model tree
commonly referred to as the Dom tree
and once the browser creates the strong
tree it takes that tree and uses it to
render the view and that's what you see
when you access a page on the browser
right you hear a URL you hit enter you
see the view what the browser is doing
is it's getting the HTML which is a bulk
of text it converts that it parses it
and converts it into an object model
tree and then that tree is what
influences the view all right secondly
CSS CSS stands for cascading style sheet
this is what you use in order to style
the HTML on the browser however more
accurately it's what's used to override
the default style what I mean by this
every browser has some kind of a default
style that it uses to render the page so
you build a simple HTML page we check
without any styling information what
happens that you have a page with our h1
right so you have an h1 hello world and
the browser renders it what's happening
there the browser has some default
styles that it applies it most probably
applies a vine background right black
text since it's an h1 is going to be big
and bold and the font is probably going
to be Times New Roman so you see this
the browser is actually making stylistic
choices there is some kind of a default
CSS that's out there and what you write
when you write CSS is to override the
default style um it the purpose of CSS
is to separate the document from the
presentation you have the HTML document
which contains what needs to be
displayed and you have the CSS which
styles it which kind of tells how those
elements need to be displayed and there
are three different ways in which you
can write CSS one is inline basically
have CSS elements in the HTML body where
an element has a style attribute and
then you have your CSS attributes inside
that style attribute that's inline you
can also have block CSS where you have a
style tag on the head for instance you
have all your CSS in the style tag the
file mode is where you have all your CSS
in a separate file and you refer to it
in your HTML this is probably the most
common and probably the most recommended
way of having CSS
that you can separate out the document
from presentation like I mentioned
finally JavaScript JavaScript is a
dynamic programming language versus HTML
which is a static programming language
and what do I mean by that if you write
an HTML document open it you're going to
get a view right you open it again
you're going to get the same view open
it a hundred times you're going to get
the exact same view this is different
from JavaScript and since the JavaScript
is dynamic you have code that executes
on the client side which could change
the way the very experience of the
strengths you should change what you're
going to see on the browser so you can
compare an HTML document to something
like a word document once you have a
word document you save it every time you
open it you're going to get the exact
same content unless you change the
document what you see as the content is
not going to change
so if HTML is kind of like that it's
static it doesn't change the view
javascript is what's going to drive all
the dynamic functionality that you're
going to build on the client side
javascript is commonly referred to as an
interpreted language but what people
don't realize that is that it's also a
compiled language right it's compiled
and interpreted exist that the
compilation step happens a fraction of a
second before the interpretation step
but the browser does compile JavaScript
and then it interprets it if you're not
familiar with these concepts when you
want to learn more I definitely
encourage you to check out some of the
other JavaScript courses and Java brains
especially the scopes and closures
course scopes enclosures in depth and
Java brains covers this difference
javascript is used to modify the Dom on
the browser I told you a couple of
things first HTML is static it doesn't
change no matter how many times you open
an HTML document and secondly HTML uses
the document object model tree in order
to render the view right so javascript
is dynamic it can execute logic on the
client-side so what you can have
JavaScript tools you can have it change
document object model 3 right so let's
say you have a div and you have a couple
of paragraphs as children of that div so
what the browser does is it renders the
div and it renders those two paragraphs
inside the div
of which you have JavaScript code
running on the client side you can have
the JavaScript code change that tree
right you can add an extra paragraph or
you can remove a paragraph you can have
a button there whose click is going to
add a paragraph you can have all those
kind of dynamic manipulation now what
happens when you change the Dom tree the
view gets changed because the tree is
what affects the view like I've already
covered so javascript adds dynamic
functionality by doing just that
or changing the document object model
tree this enables interactivity like
I've told you and it enables to build
rich client single page applications to
commonly refer to as sparse single page
applications are applications that work
on the client side and they don't have
multiple full page refreshes right you
don't have to reload the whole page when
you want to show a different view it's
just that one page which has different
view the example that I gave earlier of
Gmail works that way you have your inbox
lets you want to check your sent mail
you're not doing a full page refresh
it's just the same page but it has a
different view right so this is what's
referred to as a single page application
and JavaScript lets you build that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
