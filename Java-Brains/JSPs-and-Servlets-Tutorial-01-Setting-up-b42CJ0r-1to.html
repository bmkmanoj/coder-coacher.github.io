first of a series of tutorials on
developing Java web applications using
JSP and servlets this tutorial is aimed
at someone who has previous experience
developing java applications but they're
new to web applications alone so it
assumes that you have a little bit of
Java programming experience the first
tutorial which is this one starts off
with setting up the development
environment on your desktop and it
includes setting up the IDE which I'm
going to use is Eclipse and also setting
up the server which is Tomcat installing
these two you know the Eclipse and
Tomcat
is fairly straightforward you just head
over to the website and download the
latest versions I am using Eclipse 3 and
Tomcat 7 because that's - those are the
latest versions as of today but you
could you know you could ideally
download the newer versions if you have
newer ones available and run through
these tutorials so what I suggest is
downloading and extracting the the two
downloads into a folder called Java and
you don't really need to do anything
else just extracting and running the
files should do so I have Eclipse and
Tomcat both downloaded into this Java
folder so the first thing I'm going to
do is go to the Eclipse directory and
run the Eclipse executable it's going to
ask me for my workspace I'm going to
select the default
okay so here we have Eclipse open the
first thing we need to do is setup
Tomcat inside of Eclipse so that it's
easier for you to start and stop the
server as well as deploy your code
directly here so in order to do that you
select the service tab here and you
right click and select new server you
have a set of predefined server adapters
we are installing Apache Tomcat so we
can expand the apache node and we have
tomcat version seven so i'm going to
select this it's going to ask me for my
Tomcat installation directory so L say
browse go to my home directory Java
Tomcat I can select the JRE that I want
because Tomcat needs just a JRE doesn't
need a JDK to run you can either go for
the workbench JRE or if you have any
other JDK installed on your machine you
can go for that I would recommend going
for the JDK that you've installed now if
you have any projects it's going to ask
you to configure them on the server we
haven't created any projects as of now
so this is blank so you just say finish
so there you go Tomcat a setup
you also see an entry in the package
Explorer tab here of the servers it you
know it treats it as a project and if
you expand this you see all the Tomcat
related XML files we will leave all
these at the default the first thing
we're going to do is try starting the
server here so I just right click on it
and click start
notice the console tab it gets selected
by default and you can see that the
Tomcat logs are being displayed here so
now we see the last line of the logs
ASIS of a startup in so many
milliseconds so it means the Tomcat is
up and running as you can see here as
well so in order to test this what we do
is we'll open a browser window and
access the default URL which is
localhost colon 8080 so there you can
see Tomcat web pages up now what is this
localhost 8080 mean localhost actually
means the domain name which is actually
the machine name on which the server is
running since you are running it on your
desktop any accessing it in the same
machine you can specify localhost
which stands for you know the same
machine 8080 is the default port that
Tomcat uses in order to accept HTTP
requests so this can be changed actually
the default value for any web site is 80
if the value is 80 that means you don't
have to give the port number but Tomcat
uses the value of 8080 so you have to
specifically mention 8080 here but as I
said you can change this to some other
port so if you change it to 80
then just HTTP colon double slash
localhost should do you should be able
to get get this page so this page is
actually the home page as you can see
here this is a success message
confirming that we have installed Tomcat
successfully you get the tomcat version
number here you also have a few other
links for managing the Tomcat instance
so we'll not worry about that for now so
we know that Tomcat is up and running
fine
now there are a few common problems that
you would face when you follow the steps
here
the first problem which is common is
that you know when you open eclipse you
don't see a server tab sometimes so to
get the server tab what you need to do
is you need to go to the window menu and
show view so here are all the commonly
used tabs there are a few other tabs as
well so you click on other because you
don't see the server tab here so just go
to other and search for service so you
can you can click here and press ok then
you will get the tab the other common
problem which we face sometimes is when
you're trying to test the tomcat server
so you've started it here is it dry
click and then you data start and then
when you open the browser and you're
trying to access localhost colon 8080
you might get a 404 page not found
exception that is again a common problem
and that if you're facing that you need
to follow these steps here so
right-click and click on properties so
when you click on properties you get the
properties here you have a a location as
workspace metadata click switch location
so you have the location as server slash
tomcat server at local host server so
what this means is that you are making
the configuration over here which is
this one so what I do is I right click
here go to properties I'm sorry about
that
I just double-click on this yeah that's
where that's what I was trying to do so
I double-click on this and here you have
the configuration make sure you have
this option selected use Tomcat
installation you might have this used
workspace metadata option selected just
make sure this option is selected and
then press save or ctrl s so what
happens is why we get this error is that
if this option is selected then it it
changes the value of some of the
Catalina variables that Tomcat uses the
variable that has an impact here is the
home folder where Tomcat actually looks
for what to render when somebody is
making HTTP requests so by default it
might take the Eclipse location the
Eclipse metadata location which does not
have the you know the the greeting page
here so that that's the reason why you
might see a 404 but then if you use the
Tomcat installation which is you know
the Java folder which is this folder so
here you have web apps with predefined
web pages so when you access Tomcat it
will know what to serve and it'll serve
this particular web page
so now we have Tomcat set up and up and
running the next tutorial will develop a
simple web application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
