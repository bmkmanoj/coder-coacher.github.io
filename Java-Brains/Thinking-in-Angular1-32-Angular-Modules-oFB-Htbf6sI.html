concept of angular modules and you will
finally understand what the mysterious
empty array is at the second argument of
angular dot module I'm going to
demonstrate this by creating a new
directory called the modules directory
again the same slab structure I will
next our HTML with the two scripts
angular and after GS and I'm an ng app
pointing to modules AB and AB dot J's
which creates the module module zap
again the mysterious empty array now
what we've been seeing so far is
something that follows the structure
like this you create a module and you
register your controllers with that
module it's typically the case but
sometimes you end up having a really
huge application and you might not want
to have every controller of yours or
every directive of yours in that same
module I told you module is like a phone
book now if your phone book it's really
really big you don't want to have
everything every contact of yours in
that single phone book you want to split
that up so you can do that with angular
modules you can actually create multiple
modules and link them together so that
they work as a single application
let me demonstrate that by creating a
controller over here so let's say I have
an app dot controller call this hello
controller and let me just put something
on the scope here to start
from the main module so it's just a
string property on the scope now I'm
going to take this controller and use it
in my HTML and I have a div
ng-controller this should be all news
now as ctrl + inside this I'm going to
print the ctrl dot a little message
refresh the page I get the message
now if I have way too many met
controllers and I want to somehow
Montilla rise them I want to split them
into multiple modules and multiple files
having them all be a part of the same
module is going to make it hard for you
to split them and distribute them what I
want to do is create this module as a
reusable module and have other people
use it right so I have created the slope
controller to really fancy controller
and want other people to use it now I
don't want them to say hey copy this
code and use it in your application
paste within your application and change
the module names and all that stuff I
want them to be able to import this
somehow and the way to import this is by
sharing modules you essentially create a
custom module for your reusable elements
and then you share that module and have
other people import that module here's
how you do it so let's say I create a
module over here I'm going to create a
new file say my onto old rjs ok now I do
something very similar to what I've done
over here but rather than have it be a
modules app I'm going to call it
something else I'm gonna call it my
hello module
okay so this is a custom module and I'm
gonna call this my my 0 the variable
name really doesn't matter and over here
in the my hello module I'm registering
the hello
controller right and I'm going to change
the message to say I'm from the my hello
module right so this is a module that I
have created where I have isolated my
functionality this has got nothing to do
the app right so this exists in
isolation as it is its own module that's
going to contain its own functionality
registered with that module now I can
take this javascript file my module dot
J's and I can share it with people you
can say hey here's my cool new module
that you can use in your app right so
let's say somebody else is writing an
app like this my modules app and let's
say I remove this stuff now I don't want
to write that controller I'm going to
import this code over here you add this
javascript file into the directory and
I'm going to use the JavaScript and the
conventionality in the modules app now
how do I use it I can of course use the
same controller hello controller but now
this time it will not work I look at
roller over here if I were to refresh
this and of course if I save this app
refresh it will not work I would look at
the console will give me an error it'll
say hello controller is not available
now I have this my module j/s that I've
our import what should I do the first
thing I'm going to do is import the
JavaScript file here just like I have
abs rjs I'm going to have the module my
module rjs okay so have imported the
JavaScript file that's good enough let's
see it's still not good enough because
even though you have the JavaScript over
here it's not a part of the modules app
that you're using an index dot HTML
index traditional is using modules app
so what angular is going to do is when
it sees a controller which phonebook
does it look up it looks up the modules
app phonebook and then the modules app
phonebook is really nothing so it
doesn't find hello controller and it
complains what you want to do what do
you want angular to do is say hey not
only look at this phonebook also look at
this other phonebook that
important which is the my hello module
how do you add that to the angular's
lookup you do that when you're actually
creating the module you see here I'm
creating the module what I'm going to do
is I'm going to tell I get a Hale not
only do I need to use this module here
are the other modules that I want to add
as a dependency and the way to do this
is by using this array so far we have
had this is an empty array what does
that it actually means is a list of
modules that you aren't dependent upon
here I'm dependent upon the my hello
module module so what I'm going to do is
add that as a dependency or here so
inside the array I'm going to have my
hello module add it as the dependent
module all right so it's a string which
contains the name of the module this can
be one module it can be multiple modules
in which case you're going to come as a
break and then add the other module
names but in this case is just one so
this is actually the significance of
this array as a second argument all
right so now I'm going to save this and
refresh the page up here you see I get
the message
from the module just this message
alright so I was able to successfully
import the module and you use it now
this is where your code the chemistry
useful you can create these modules with
the stuff registered in it and then you
can share this file then what a consumer
will need to do is first add the link to
the file in index dot HTML secondly add
a dependency to that module in your
angular dot module in your module
creation step alright once you have done
those two steps then whatever this
module has registered within it it
happens to be a control it could be a
bunch of other stuff whatever this
module has registered within it is going
to get imported into your main
application module and you can use it in
index dot HTML so this is a significance
of modules and angularjs which will have
you import and use a module now before I
wind up I should also let you know that
there is another
nature for the module function up here
I'm using angular module that's two
arguments let's say I forget that and I
say bar equals angular module angular
turf module audio zap if I were to
forget this second thing what angular
actually does is retrieve the module
it's basically going to get let's say I
have a rap to what's going to do is it's
going to retrieve the module that was
created over here which is essentially
the same as app so when I do this
without the square bracket as a second
argument it's not going to create the
module it's going to get it I know this
is very bad design and this is confused
a lot of people but remember that when
you don't have the second argument what
angular is doing is not creating the
module it's fetching an already created
module with this name if it doesn't have
that module is going to give an error so
remember that and that's actually the
reason why it's very important to have
this empty array as a second argument
when you are creating modules in angular</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
