confusing the nested scope hierarchy was
and in this tutorial I'm going to show
you the controller as syntax which is
basically a syntactical solution to this
problem
angular introduced this as a new feature
it's basically syntactical sugar it's
basically a different syntax to do the
exact same thing but the syntax actually
makes things very clear and you know
which scope you are referring to a
minimal you have an angular expression
near code so here's the syntax right so
this is how you write controllers using
controller eyes first of all when you
have an NG controller remember this
isn't actually used to write with an NG
controller equals the controller name
and the controller name is what you've
defined your controller as right this
part is going to be the same however
when you're using ng-controller equals
controller name you not just specify the
controller name you also give it an
alias every controller that you write an
NG controller can be given an alias so
the alias is provided by using the
syntax it says the controller name as an
alias name we just see one over here
right here I have controller 2 I'm going
to say controller 2 as C 2 so the name
is because of this as keyword in that
context right if you do this you're
basically doing the controller as syntax
now by doing something like this you say
hey angular I'm going to use this new
syntax and angular is going to expect
you to use the alias whenever you're
referring to the controllers scope all
right so here I'm using test prop I
can't just say test prop and have
angular figure out where and the
hierarchy needs to look up I need to be
very explicit about which controllers
scope I'm referring to here I want to
look up the controller 1 scope so I'm
going to say C 1 dot test drop so this
way it's very clear that I'm referring
to this controllers scope similarly here
I'm referring to see tools are going to
see C 2 dot test prop all right so this
I have converted this HTML 2 controller
as syntax right now I'm in the
controller as
mode now this is the HTML part of it
there is some change that you need to do
to the controller as well when you've
decided to use the controller as syntax
you need to write your controllers in a
slightly different way all right so how
do you write your controllers first of
all when you using controller as syntax
you don't have to inject the scope you
should not inject the scope then how do
you get hold of the scope well here is
the thing when angular sees a controller
as syntax you can assume that it adds
this virtual line in the first line of
every controller assume that it adds a
war this equals dollar scope right just
assume that it adds something like this
it doesn't literally add it but it does
some stuff which is pretty much simin
simulates this kind of a logic right so
rather than have dollar scope as an
argument to your controller when you
using controller as syntax angular does
this so that you don't actually have to
pass this as an argument anyone you can
just use this because angular
automatically takes that dollar scope
and it sets it to did this keyword you
must be familiar with this keyword in
JavaScript it's an implicit argument to
any function and what that value
contains could be different depending on
how the function is called angular makes
sure that when the controllers are
called the disc keyword always points to
the scope so since you already have this
in the function you don't have to inject
dollar scope anymore instead you just
use this dot s prop similarly here you
see this dot s pro alright this is the
controller as way of writing code
alright so I'm going to remove this
because it's not really there you just
have to assume that there is that syntax
that executes but for this we have
converted our previous code to the
controller as we have doing things so
what are the changes we did first
we've enter the ng controller and change
the value to the controller a syntax is
not just the controller name anymore its
controller name
as a Diaz right we do that for every
place where we have ng-controller
secondly wherever there is an ng bind or
an angular expression you just don't see
the property anymore you say the alias
that property to tell angular which
specific controllers scope you're
referring to
so here it's c1 dot s prop here it's C
to dot s per where c1 and c2 are the new
aliases that you created for the two
controllers this is the HTML part the
next change you need to do is go to the
controllers itself and rather than
injecting the scope and then sink dollar
scope dot property you remove the scope
injection right every controller gets
the scope for free using the disk
keyboard you just say this dot and then
set whatever property what instead of
dollar scope just going to do the start
alright so these changes let's refresh
the page one more time
and nothing should have changed this is
controller one and controller
two and the advantage of this approach
is now I can say c1 dot this drop inside
the inner controller I guess what
happens it pulls up from that outer
controller so I can access controllers
scopes so hey it's more flexible and B
it makes it really really clear so you
know exactly which controller's scope
you are referring to so this is a
controller as syntax this is highly
recommended whenever you're using
controllers in angular 1 dot X please
make sure you do use the controller as
syntax some feel better and be easier to
