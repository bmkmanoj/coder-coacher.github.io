expressions to flex our lambda muscles
this is kind of practice to see what it
takes to build these lambda expressions
you know compared to the kind of
functions that we are used to so for
instance let's start with the greet
method so we had like a greeting
function which was a lambda expression
which looks something like this this is
a empty list of arguments and the actual
body of the function was system dot out
dot print off hello world this is a
lambda expression what this does is have
a function inline which takes in no
arguments and the body of the function
just as systems are order print of hello
world so this function is assigned to
the variable called greening function
all right now one thing that you must
have noticed is I don't have the type
here what is the type of this variable
cleaning function let's hold that
thought for a bit I haven't talked about
the type of these lambda expressions yet
I'll come with it a bit later but for
now I want you to focus on just the
right hand side here them obviously
since this is jawline it could declare
this type of the cleaning function I
haven't done that here that's actually
why I'm typing this in a different
editor and it's not eclipse because I
don't want the squiggly lines to show up
and distract us so again hold it out
about the left hand side for a bit and
what the type of these variables are the
right hand side is the expression itself
that we are focusing on at this time now
one of the advantages of having this
function be assigned to a variable is
that this variable can be passed around
you can send it to another method as an
argument and have that method have
access to this function so for instance
I can do agreed method I can call a grid
method and pass in the greeting function
right so you remember we were talking
about how you need to write you need to
be able to write a public void greet
which takes in some kind of an action
and then it performs that action right
so
this is kind of enabling that isn't it
you're able to take this action and
assign it to a greeting function the
action being just printing off hello
world and now for you to pass this there
is a way for our greet method to accept
that lambda expression and execute it
the syntax is obviously not this we'll
talk about how to execute a lambda
function in a bit but that's the idea we
have encapsulated a function in a
variable that can be passed around and
it can be sent to other methods that's
really cool now what's even cooler is
you don't really have to assign it to a
variable you can have this lambda
expression be inline so let's say I were
to take this out and instead of
assigning it to a variable and passing
it here I can just pass the lambda
expression here like this so what we're
doing is we are passing a lambda
expression of function to the greet
method and that function is in line
right here so this is a function which
doesn't take any arguments and it just
prints hello world to the console right
this is one way in which we typically
use lambda expressions we can have that
be inline so we'll write a few more
lambda expressions and that will make
sense but at this point of time let's
look at different varieties in which we
can write these expressions so this is a
lambda expression which is a function
now functions are not always with empty
parameters you might need a function
which takes in arguments now how do you
write that as a lambda expression now
let's say I have a function which is a
double number function which takes in an
integer and returns a double of that all
right so let's say I have this table
number function which is let's write the
method at this time does it say this is
a public int table all right and then I
have an int a and what this does is it
returns a times two okay so this is my
function that I want to assign to this
this is not a lambda expression of what
do I have to do to convert this to a
lambda expression the first thing is
remove the modifier it's not attached to
a class it's inline so public
doesn't make sense so get rid of us next
the name here doesn't make sense because
we're going to be referring to this
function by using this name double
number function so we're going to get
rid of this next is the return type
again like I said the compiler now is
smart to detect return types in lambda
expressions so it sees that this is a
times two so it knows that this is an
integer because the input is an integer
so integer times two should be another
integer so it says I've got this don't
send me this so we're going to remove
this so this is our lambda expression
but remember there's one other thing we
need to do which is the arrow which is
the minus and the greater than symbol
now this when you add the semicolon here
that this is a complete lambda
expression again since this is just one
line I can use the shortcut you get rid
of this here now here's another shortcut
if your lambda expression is just one
line you can skip the return as well so
what Java compiler is going to do is
what the Java interpreter is going to do
is it's going to look at what the body
of the function is and it is going to
return that so you don't have to specify
a return here so this makes it really
really crisp and really really terse so
this is a lambda expression which takes
in an integer and it returns this so
what's on the right-hand side of this
arrow is actually there it done so this
might seem a bit confusing so let's do
one more let's do a function which adds
two numbers let's call this the add
function which takes in two arguments
two integers and then it returns the sum
of those two so would this look like
this is the structure right and then
there is first of all there is the input
arguments this is the arrow and then
what is being returned so the what are
the input arguments for adding two
numbers it's in a and then int B now
what does it return it is a plus B this
provides a lambda expression which adds
two numbers up passing these two
arguments it returns the switch is a
plus B okay now if you look at this
you might be asking a question well how
does it work over here is the greeting
function returning the return of system
da da da print in away yes because
system dot out dot print really returns
a wide so it works over here but what if
this was returning something else this
is a question that you're gonna have to
hold on too far a little bit longer
let's write a few more lambda
expressions and I'll talk about two
things that I said I will talk about
later one is the type of these
expressions and how to call them and the
return type is something that will
address when we talk about the type of
these X these variables alright so let's
do one more let's call this a divide
function let's call this a safe divide
function right I want to write a safe
divide which which basically takes in
two integers and it returns an integer
division and what it also needs to do is
make sure that you don't do a divide by
zero right if the second argument is a
zero just return zero but if the second
argument is not zero then to an integer
division alright so let's see how that
works I can do it in a and int P and I
can do this
right a /b now this is going to do a
divided by B and it's going to return it
but what I want is a safe division I
want to make sure that the second
argument is not zero so for this I need
to add an if block and since I need to
add an if block and this function is
grown to more than one line I need to
add the curly braces so let me go ahead
and do that here I'm going to get rid of
this now the curly braces and here I'm
going to say if B is equal to zero then
I want to return zero else I have done
eight divided by P okay so this is my
lambda expression again since this is
more than one line I have to add this
curly braces alright I'm going to do one
last expression to really drive the
point home and then we can wrap this up
so let's say I want to add I want to
create a function which does a string
length count right so it's a string and
count function the name of these really
do not matter I'm just putting some
arbitrary names over here is just a
variable name so what is this function
going to be like it takes in a string
and it returns the count of the number
of characters in that string so let's
say this is going to be a string s and
then this returns s star length okay
this is a lambda expression which finds
out what the length of the string is
given an input string argument so
hopefully by looking at all these things
all these different examples you're kind
of getting familiar with uncomfortable
that the writing lambda expressions
these in this way so in the next
tutorial we'll tackle some of the
pending questions first of all what's
the type of this of these variables and
secondly given a variable like this
let's say I'd give you this variable
which is the string length account
function which holds this lambda
expression which holds this function how
do i execute this thing let's look at
that in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
