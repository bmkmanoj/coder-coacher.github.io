tutorial is a brief introduction to
maven we will look at what maven is and
we'll also learn how to set up maven on
your development environment so what is
maven to answer that question in a
single sentence is not possible because
even as a lot of things put into one so
the most of the common usages of maven
is to use it as a build tool it is it is
similar to add in this case for example
and it helps us in building iron code in
our development environment the other
rule that maven does is of a project
management tool it helps to generate
reports it helps in dependency
management and things like that in that
tutorial we're going to focus only on
using maven as a build tool we are not
going to be looking at how it can be
used as a product project management
tool to look at what maven does for us
as a build tool let's look at some of
the common problems and some of the
common activities that we perform while
developing applications and we need to
build them the first thing is the
problem of multiple jars let's say I'm
using a couple of frameworks in my code
and I will take the example of say
spring or hibernate now in order to use
the hibernate framework in my
application I need to include all the
required jars in my application I need
to make them available let's say I'm
developing a web application I need to
make sure those jars are available
during compile time I need to bundle
them in my distribution when I'm
deploying it I need to know what those
jars are that's a common problem that we
face sometimes sometimes we miss out on
some of the jars we don't know what the
jars are and this is something that
maven helps it helps to solve a second
common problem as dependencies say I
have a particular job and that has a
dependency on another jar I need to make
sure that all my dependencies are closed
I need to make sure I have supplied all
the dependent jars for you know the jars
that I already have
there is a related problem here which is
because of the versions the dependencies
could differ there could be lot of
instances where we need to make sure
that we are matching the right versions
of chars in our dependencies the third
common activity we do is to set up the
project structure a simple example is of
a web application we need to make the
project structure proper we need to have
the proper directories web-inf the
libraries the fourth common activity is
build to publish and to deploy if you
are using and you would write all these
targets and you would execute those
targets whenever you wanted to build
publish and deploy so these are four of
the common activities and some of them
are actually problems here that we face
when we are you know writing code and we
want to build and publish them so maven
helps us in these four activities and it
has a very elegant solution for each of
them so we will have a look at how even
helps us but before we start let's set
up maven on our desktop so we first head
over to the maven website even as an
Apache project so the you know the URL
is maven dot apache dot org here you
will have a download link it's currently
on 303 release this might be different
depending on when you are viewing this
tutorial but just go ahead and download
one of these I'm going to download the
the binary zip file okay now I have
downloaded the zip file and I've
extracted it here I open it here is the
latest maven release now all that's left
to do is set a couple of environment
variables so open up the command prompt
or if you're in Windows you need to
change the environment variables in the
system properties now the first
environment variable we need to set is
m2 home so if you are on UNIX or Linux
you do a m2 and score o equals and
but very of extracted maven the second
variable we need to set is the path
variable the reason we do this is so
that you can trigger the maven
executable from anywhere in your command
prompt and it will point to the right
maven executable which is in the it's in
the bin folder here so we need to pass
this path to the path variable and of
course I'll also have to append it with
the existing path values so that it does
not override it and they go you're all
set now let's test out that maven is
working fine by executing the maven
command the simple command from a Venus
mvn and let's pass the version flag to
check what the version is yeah we have
maven setup this is one more thing
you know I was telling you that maven
helps us in creating the project
structure it helps us in managing
dependencies downloading dependencies
and things like that to all this you
know intelligence that maven has comes
from what is called as repositories
there are repositories available online
and maven talks to those repositories
and gets the information and that's how
maven helps us in all these activities
so one thing we need to make sure is
that your machine is connected to the
Internet because maven needs to go
online and get all this information get
connected to the Internet we are here
all set now we can actually start using
maven now let's look at the first
advantage that maven provides for us
regarding the project structure and the
directory structure let me just make a
directory
called my app I'll go to that directory
and I will use a command called maven
archetype : generate when you run this
for the first time maven will download
all the required meeven plugins and it
takes a while okay now after a whole lot
of downloading this is where we are now
maven has a prompt displayed for me and
it says choose a number and 1:06 is the
default now what is this number you see
here there are there is a list of
different archetypes here what an
archetype means is is it's a it's a
model as to how you want your project to
be structured all these are the
predefined art types so they come with
information about the application itself
now say I want to create a spring JSF
JPA
application then I would use the spring
J's of JP archetype or give this number
286 so all these are different types of
applications that you would want to
create and if we choose one number then
maven will create a blank application
with all the dependencies and all the
jars and it will have it ready for us so
let me go with the default as of now the
default is 1:06 so if I just press enter
it's going to take 1:06 now I can choose
the versions the versions are you know
the versions of the archetype itself so
I'll choose the latest version which is
6 now it's going to download more
plugins which are related to the SAP
type and after that now it's going to
ask me for a few properties the first
property is the group ID this would be
similar to a package name that you would
create for some of your components
I'll just give the package name that I
would use the next is the artifact ID so
this would be this is analogous to a
class name while group IDs analogous to
a package name but note that here what
we are defining is for the complete
application itself the you know the
application that you're creating
now the artifact ID that I want to use
here is let's say maven test app this is
the name of the jar or the word that I'm
creating by building and deploying this
application that I'm planning to write
version number version number by default
is 1.0 snapshot which is fine for now so
I'll just leave that define the value
for the property package it's stick in
the group ID itself which is fine
it asks for confirmation for the inputs
that I've entered everything is fine so
I just say yes and now it's finished
then what is me even done now let's see
now it's created a directory called
maven test app what's inside that
directory so there is a folder called
SRC and there's an XML called Pym dot
XML let's check that out ok so now at
the top you see the entries that we have
entered we have the group ID which is
you know the package name that we have
entered the artefact ID which is the
name of our application and the version
number and the packaging it's taken this
is a default it has made the packaging
as a jar which means that the
application that we are trying to write
here will be built and packaged as a jar
file there is a name node which means
that this is going to be the name of the
application this can be different from
the artifact ID and
what happens if it's different is our
application will be called by this name
but when we are actually saving this
application compelled application in the
repository the artefact ID for this will
be this name you can ignore the
properties the dependency is where are
you know the other part of maven comes
into play which is managing dependencies
we'll get back to this in a minute now
let's have a look at the SRC folder now
it has created two folders here one is
the main and one is the test which is
very convenient because we can keep all
our Java classes in the main method it
has even organized our package and it
has created a simple dot Java file and
we can also use the test folder in order
to save our j-unit test cases so all
this is ready for us we already have a
app tester job it's already created a
test Java class now maven has done all
this it has created all the folder
structure it has created all the
required package directly and it has
also created something called as a p1
dot XML which has information about the
application itself and what the
dependencies are now let's have a look
at the dependencies so dependencies is
mentioned in this palm load XML and
there's only one dependency mentioned
here which is the j-unit the group ID of
this dependency is gene unit the
artifact ID is je unit it has specified
the version and it is also specified
what is called a scope which we'll come
to in a minute but but look at these
three look at these three items here so
it has mentioned that this project is
dependent on J unit and it is dependent
on version number three dot a dot one
now if J unit were to be dependent on
some other jar then we won't have to
worry about mentioning it here you know
maven takes care of getting all the
related dependencies so we need we just
need to include the jars that we need as
the first entry point and all the
related dependencies will be taken care
of by maven
since now that this is done let's try to
compile this code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
