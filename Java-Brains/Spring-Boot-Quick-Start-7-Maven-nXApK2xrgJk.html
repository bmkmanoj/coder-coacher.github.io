we need to manage dependencies we need
to import the jars that are required for
the spring application to work and
typically what you do have any handle
dependencies in Java you get the jars
and you add it to the class path right
put the jars in the class path and the
app has it available all those classes
in those jars are available to your
application we are not going to be doing
this we're going to be using a tool
called maven if you've been working in
Java you should know what maven is it's
kind of ubiquitous at this point of time
but let's just give a quick introduction
maven lets you declare all the
dependencies that you want in a single
file you don't have to download the jars
and add it to your class path you
mention what the jars you need are into
this file which is called palm nerd XML
this file contains a list of all your
dependencies that maven needs to know
right maven is your dependency
management tool then you run away even
command and maven is going to look at
your dependencies and say ok these are
all the things that this app needs to
run and it goes to this repository which
has all the list of all the dependencies
that you would ever need and it's going
to say hey I need all these you know
jars hide it to the class path and the
repository is going to give this huge
list of jars that it needs based on what
every empty claire did it's going to get
downloaded to the class path right this
is what maven does maven is a build in
dependency management tool that this is
what we're going to be using for this
course so when we need to add
dependencies you're not going to go
download the jars and add it to the
class path what you're going to be doing
is creating this file called partner XML
and we're going to add the list of
dependencies there and run a maven
command what nema also lets you do is
create the starter project so that you
don't have to create all these
individual files yourself it comes with
this archetype which is what it's called
it's a simple template which lets you
start a simple project and that's where
we're going to be starting away we're
going to create a simple maven project
and it's going to give you a Palm D'Or
XML you're going to let start all your
dependencies in that bomb that XML and
run the mail in command and me when it's
going to go download the chat
for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
