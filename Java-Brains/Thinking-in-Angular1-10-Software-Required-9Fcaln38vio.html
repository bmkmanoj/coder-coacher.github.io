development environment to build
applications using angular the great
advantage of web development at least on
the client side is that you don't really
have a whole lot of setup steps in order
to start working on something we're
working on HTML and JavaScript the set
up and the kind of software you're going
to need is use relatively light wing up
there to some other platforms so there
are two requirements two pieces of
software that I'd like to have installed
on my machine before I work on angular
first is a text editor any text editor
should really do but I'd prefer having a
text editor that has an option of
opening multiple files or opening a
directory the editor that I am going to
be using in this course is called Visual
Studio code this is a free editor by
Microsoft and this works on Mac and
Windows and I believe one Linux is well
so this is going to be the editor I'm
going to use but there's really nothing
special about this editor any text
editor should do the only requirement at
least in my mind when you're working on
an angular application would be you need
to be able to open multiple flights you
see here this editor has a preview I
have opened an MD directory right now
so there's really nothing here but if I
were to open it directly which has files
so dot that directly in the contents of
the directory would show up over here in
the tree view so I can switch between
files easily by clicking on the file so
this is a handy feature even though this
even this is not required any text
editor should do some other
recommendations that I have our item by
github and there's also sublime text
which is a very popular editor among web
developers but that one isn't free
Adam is free Visual Studio code is free
and brackets by Adobe is another editor
which is free I'm going to link to all
these editors in the description so
definitely take a look and pick one
which you like and use that for
development but for the sake of this
course I'm going to be using Visual
Studio code so this is the first
software that you need the second piece
of software that you need is a web
browser this is obvious you're doing web
development you definitely need a
browser the browser of choice however
that I recommend for this course is
Chrome I'm in general not a big fan of
Google Chrome but that's the browser
that has the best support for angular
development considering that you know
angular is from Google probably you can
probably use another browser but I
recommend using Google Chrome for this
course again like I said not my favorite
browser but I grudgingly use it because
it has really good angular support so
these are the two softwares that you
need to have installed I'm not gonna
show you the installation step I'm
pretty sure you probably have at least
one or even both of these software's
already installed on your machine so
just if you haven't just have to set up
and I'll see you in the next video where
we'll actually start building an angular
application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
