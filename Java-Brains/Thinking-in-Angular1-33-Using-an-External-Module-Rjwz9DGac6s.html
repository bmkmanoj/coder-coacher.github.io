going to demonstrate using a publicly
available module that's written by
somebody else this is just to
demonstrate what it takes to use a
module that somebody else is given if
the previous video has not driven the
point home already
that should clarify and clear any doubts
so have this website that I frequently
use for picking up some open source and
pretty cool modules called
ng modules start a lot of these modules
are really cool and some of them are a
little bit more involved and that takes
a lot of setup to do but there are some
which are pretty handy and the one that
I want to try today is something called
ng tags input so this is a module let's
go to the home page over here that has
this tag UI okay you can create the stag
UI pretty quickly in angular and go to
the demos page where it shows how to
actually create the stag input is a
pretty handy plunker snippet as well so
what I would need to do to use this
module there are a couple of steps first
I need to get a JavaScript file so
apparently this let me expand this so
apparently this javascript file is
available on the CDN and here is the
script tag for it so I'm just going to
copy that over and use that in index dot
HTML when I put this above the after GI
so I'm basically linking to the ng tags
JavaScript file second I'm going to need
to declare that as a dependent module so
apparently the name of the module is ng
tags input so what I'm going to do is go
to my apt rjs and when I'm creating the
module I declare this as a dependency
there you go
ng tags input is now a dependent module
now that I have declared it as a
dependency I can use the directive that
comes with it apparently there is a
directive call tags input which has an
NG model which should point to a tags
property a tags is apparently just
no strings so I'm just going to copy
this over to my controller I'm going to
have to create a controller over here AB
dot controller let me call it tags demo
ctrl and in my function tags demo ctrl
I'm going to copy this since we're using
controller as I'm going to say this dot
tags is will change the name over here
just to make sure it's picking what we
have supplied to it test3 all right so
these are some tag objects now I can use
that in my HTML get a link to this
controller rather than the one that we
have over there the end inside this div
I'm going to discuss tags input is the
directive that the component is exposed
with an NG model pointing to ctrl dot
tags all right so I have ctrl Z tags
we're just going to contain this this is
what's going to drive the tags input
directive to do its thing again tags
input is not a directive that comes out
of the box with angular it has been
given to us thanks to this NG tags
script and now it is made available in
our phone book in our module by adding
that as a dependency over here by adding
this module dependency I'm pulling in
the directive that has been registered
with this and I'm using the director
using tags input now let's refresh the
page and see if this works so there you
go we can see the tags but the styling
doesn't look right maybe there is a CSS
file to be linked yes there is
there is a CSS over here which I'm going
to link as well to make the tags look
like tags add that to my HTML save and
reload this is much better now they
actually look like tags they also have
this functionality where you can click
and close it I can add new tags by
typing stuff and clicking and pressing
enter they all form new tags over here
and I'm assuming the back the model
merges the tags array and as you add new
tags I won't be surprised if it adds
these objects to the model the tag
component itself is not important you
don't have to worry too much about how
the tag input directive works what's
important to note is that we were able
to add new functionality to our angular
application by importing a module we
imported the javascript file and had the
module that comes with a JavaScript file
the independent module - what we have
and just by doing this anything that was
registered in this module becomes
available to us in our HTML like this
tag input directive now we can actually
look at this javascript file to see
what's going on this is I'm guessing
minified javascript so it will not be
very visible but it's fair to say that
this javascript file has an angular
module where you have the module defined
with an empty area they don't have a
dependency but this is what creates the
module that we are using here so I hope
that kind of helped to make you
understand what the modules are and how
to use them see in the next tutorial
where we going to start an exercise as
promised we're going to be building a
to-do app from the scratch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
