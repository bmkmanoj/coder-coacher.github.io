weirdness and all the quirks in
JavaScript is the kind of complex
applications the developers are building
with JavaScript today you have code
bases that span thousands and thousands
of lines of code
they have code bases that are being
worked on by tens of different teams
across the world and the kind of
complexity does take a toll on
JavaScript and kind of like the language
design so if all this is such a big
problem then why do we use JavaScript
why do we need it well there's a simple
answer Fred because browsers support
only JavaScript so we're stuck given a
browser you're sending in a file which
is dynamic and it needs to execute on
the client-side it has to be coded in
JavaScript but there is kind of a
solution for this this kind of mirrors
another problem that we've been having
in computer science for a very long time
which is how to write code that gets
executed in multiple different
environments that's where the concept of
high-level programming languages was
introduced in the concept of compliation
was introduced when you write code using
something like C or Java you don't worry
about which machine it gets deployed in
you write code using the language and
you go through a process of compilation
which transforms the code into machine
language which is apt for the kind of
machine that you're executing in the
case of C err the case of Java of course
you got the Java Runtime but the idea is
you don't worry about where the
application runs when you're writing
code you write code in whatever language
you like and then you go through a
process of compiling where the code that
you've written gets transformed into
something else
which addresses the problem so
compilation has been working fine for a
lot of applications right when you run
code across multiple machines
compilation is what saves the day so can
we use the concept of compilation to
address this problem if javascript is
required browsers need JavaScript you
send a file to a browser that better be
JavaScript
you cannot avoid that but can we do this
can we write code in a different
language something that we are more
comfortable something that does not have
the kind of weirdness that JavaScript
has and then go through a process of
compilation the compiler takes that code
that you've written the language that
you like and converts it to JavaScript
if you can do that then you don't have
to worry about the mess that's
JavaScript you still write code in the
language of your choice and then what
you get as an end result this is
JavaScript that you can reply to
browsers which understand only
JavaScript so that that all works great
can we do this well this is kind of
possible with typescript well it's
actually possible with something called
web assembly and that's coming it's not
there
as of today as of me recording this
video that's probably gonna chain in the
future but at this point you can kinda
get something like this using typescript
and that any language that you see over
here that's actually typescript you can
write code using typescript
and you go through this process of it's
not compilation it's called
transpilation
but people call it compilation really
doesn't matter in this course I'll be
using those two terms interchangeably
but the idea is you write code using
typescript which is this new language
which doesn't have the weirdness of
JavaScript has some cool features but
then it can be compiled it can be
transpiled to JavaScript and then you
take that javascript and apply it across
different browsers you get the best of
both worlds right this is what happens
with that rip and this thing that
converts from typescript to JavaScript
is called the typescript compiler so
this is what we're gonna be doing in
this course you're gonna be writing code
using typescript we're gonna install the
typescript compiler on our machine and
then we're gonna have the typescript
compiler run and convert our typescript
code to JavaScript code and we'll
execute the JavaScript code right the
key thing here to remember is that the
conversion from typescript to
happens during development time when
you're writing the code and you're
executing the compiler that's all during
development time
once the compiler executes tunicate
javascript javascript is then deployed
on two browsers it's deployed on a
node.js environment to whatever so
that's the distinction that you need to
remember now notice I said no js' that's
very similar a similar concept applies
to node.js too because again no J's
runtime understands only JavaScript it
doesn't understand type spin so you do
something very similar you write node.js
applications using typescript
run it through the typescript compiler
you get JavaScript and then you have
JavaScript executed on the node.js
environment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
