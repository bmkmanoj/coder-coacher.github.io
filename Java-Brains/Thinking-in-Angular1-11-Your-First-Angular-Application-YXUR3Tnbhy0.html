application first create an empty
directory and open the directory in
Visual Studio code you can really create
this directory in any location open
visual studio code go to file open and
then browse to that directory and click
open by doing that you're basically
opening the directory in Visual Studio
code if you've just created the
directory that's obviously gonna be
empty so you're not going to see any
files there but as you start adding
files into the directory gonna see them
all here alright that's the first step
second step open your browser and go to
angularjs.org like I mentioned before
this is the official web site for
angular 1.x
and this is what we're going to be using
so go to angularjs dark and you need to
download the angular script you can
actually do this in a couple of
different ways so here you see you have
an option of downloading angularjs one
are trying the new angular 2 going to be
doing this right so click on this button
and it's going to give you a bunch of
different options for using angularjs
right now the latest stable version is
1.5 or x12 5.8 specifically you can
actually link it to the CDN so they have
actually hosted the angularjs script in
the CDN Ajax start Google API store come
you can actually link it directly but
what we're going to be using is a
downloaded version so choose one dot Phi
dot X which is the stable version under
Bill choose uncompressed so you have an
option of choosing a minified script
file or zipped script file minified is
basically you know ugly fiying the
script in order to make it really really
small it removes spaces it removes
unnecessary indentation comments and all
that stuff we would like our angular
script to be readable at least for
development purposes so we going to
choose uncompressed and then click on
download and when you're asked for the
location of the download choose the
location that you created with the new
directory that you have open over here
right in Visual Studio code so you're
going to add the script
downloaded into this directory so when
you click on download and choose the
directory the script needs to show up
over there so I'm going to go ahead and
do that now I have the script downloaded
I'm going to
lesson finder or Windows Explorer if
you're using Windows and move this
script to that directory so I have my
thinking an angular folder and I have
angularjs downloaded and moved into it
so if I open visual studio code now you
will see that that's filos showing up
over here you can actually click on it
and you have the complete angularjs
source code you can read through this
maybe once you're comfortable with a lot
of the concepts we're going to be
discussing but at this point of time
we're just going to use it for our HTML
we're not going to be reading this now
how do we use this in HTML first thing
we need to do is to create the HTML so
that's the next step right I'm going to
create a new file and I'm going to call
this index dot HTML that's kind of like
the standard convention for a root HTML
you can call it anything you want really
all right so I have index dot HTML if I
switch to finder well there you go it's
going to show up there so this view
links to this view because you open that
directory now I'm going to create a
simple HTML over here and I'm an HTML
open andclose node and within it I have
a head open and close and a body open
and close and inside the body let me
actually have an h1 here which is hello
angular and I'm going to save this if I
open this in finder and I can actually
use this I can actually open this HTML
file if I open this up it opens up in
Google Chrome because I've said that as
the default browser for this course so
it opens this location and here is my
HTML and I were to make a change here I
click refresh and the change gets
updated so this is going to be the
development process right we're going to
make changes to the HTML over here and
visual studio code and go to Chrome and
click refresh and the change is going to
get refreshed in the browser alright so
this is a simple HTML not that fun we
need to include angular the way to
include angular is by actually linking
to that script you remember I told you
that angular first needs to load in
that Lindo it needs to execute in that
window so this is an executable piece of
JavaScript core
somebody has to execute this so for the
browser to execute it and we have to
link it so it goes Dutch and link this
thing so I'm going to link this in the
head for now I'm going to talk a little
bit about their to link this best but at
this point of time it's okay if it's in
the head then create a script SRC equals
the location off the script in this case
it's at the same location so I'm just
going to give it the name let's see
angular tarjay yes and I'm going to
close the script tag
okay now let's refresh seems like
nothing has changed but if you open the
developer tools I did a command alt I
but you can actually open the clipper
tools by going into more tools here and
developer tools and you're going to get
this view and now if you open the
network tab choose all and refresh there
you can see index.html is loaded the
browser sees the script so it says okay
let me go ahead and load angular it's
going to load angular dart GS and that's
being loaded it'll browser of course we
haven't asked angular to do anything so
you don't really see angular doing
anything so let's go ahead and make that
change we will have angular do something
here so how do you make angular do
something how do you tell angular that
you need to create an angular app of
course you can write some JavaScript
code to do it but the standard
recommended way to instruct angular that
you need to create an angular app is by
using a directive yes
angular follows the concept principle if
you just talked about a lot of things
that you do in angular
you don't write JavaScript code to get
the element and have it behave in a
certain way you actually write
directives you just use directors right
you have declarative programming so the
best way to tell angular that you have
an angular app is to declare an angular
app right so the way to declare an
angular app is by using a directive
called ng app how do you use a director
you use it by just adding it to
HTML nor so say ng ah so this actually
get rid of this you just have to say ng
app here and I have added ng app to the
HTML node right the HTML node was just
HTML open and closed right so I've
actually did a space here
and then said in G - app so this is a
directive it's an extension of HTML that
comes with angular and this tells
angular that you want this to be an
angular application
this is declarative programming again
somebody has already written the logic
in the angular script over here that
says hey if there is an ng app create an
angular application so that's what
angular is going to do okay so I'm going
to save this and run this again alright
this is an angular application well it's
a bit of a disappointment because it
still doesn't do anything this is
nothing change because while we have
declared this to be an angular app we
haven't used any of the angular features
in order to make this dynamic so let's
do that next now let me actually add
this paragraph tag here let's say yes
good morning simple paragraph tag you
first - I see good morning here but this
is not always true is it now let's say I
open this HTML page at night I don't
want to be told good morning I want the
screeching to be dependent on the time
of the day so what I want to do is have
this be conditional I want to say if the
time of the day is so much that intro
good morning if not show something is or
whatever right but for now I'm just
going to have a conditional true or
false to either show this or hide this
so in order to conditionally show an
element in angular there is what you get
another directive you can declare an
element to be conditional and angular is
going to make that condition depending
on whatever condition you have right so
the way to do that is by using another
directive called
ng - if it's similar to ng - app here
right that's a built-in directive you
have to remember this just like I have
ng - app -
declare HTML as an angular application
you have an NG - if to declare an HTML
element as a conditional element okay so
let me make this a conditional element
by marking this as ng - if now just this
is not enough what is this conditional
upon has to be conditional upon a
condition right so I'm going to just say
condition equals true so this is always
going to show up right ng F true so if
this is true show good morning so this
is billion or it's always gonna show up
so let's verify that well they're just
going to show up so we still don't know
if angular is doing anything yet there's
one way to know and that is by changing
this to false if we change this to false
the condition is false so angular if
everything is wired up right should not
show this good morning message right
let's save this refresh so the message
goes away now angular works now we have
a definite proof so here's what we did
we have created an angular application
alright we did this but doing a bunch of
different steps the first step was to
add a script to include the angular
script into our HTML this is required
because angular is a framework you have
to add the framework because before you
add your application code so this is the
first step right you added the framework
code step 2 you declared this page as an
angular application by using a directive
called
ng - app by doing this angular knows
that this is an angular application I'm
going to talk a little bit more about
this in a bit so just go with me here
the third thing we did to actually see
if a healer's doing anything this is to
have some kind of dynamic functionality
the basic dynamic functionality we
choose to try out was a conditional HTML
element this conditional HTML element is
declared by using ng - F equals and the
condition you want to use so depending
on this condition angular is going to
either leave this element in the Dom our
condition as files is just going to
remove that element from the Dom so by
marking ng-if equals false you're
basically asking angular to remove this
all the time but since it is in the HTML
we finally had angular do something
right we gave it some work saying okay
remove this element and now if you go to
the browser that element is now gone so
we have ladies and gentlemen our first
angular application in the next video
we're gonna try out a couple of more
things to see what I killer can do now
that we have a complete angular
application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
