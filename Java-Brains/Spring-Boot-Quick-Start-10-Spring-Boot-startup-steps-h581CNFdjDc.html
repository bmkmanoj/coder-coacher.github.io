good so this is the magic line it says
spring application dot run takes in two
arguments one is the class and one is
the command-line arguments that you
would pass through the main method the
important thing is there is a static
class called spring application has a
static method called run and it takes in
this class and this class has an
annotation which is a spring application
annotation and this does a whole lot for
you now what are the things that it does
first of all it sets up the default
configuration you remember I told you
that spring boot favors convention over
configuration it addresses the 80% use
case and the default configuration
addresses that 80% use case we're in
most part the default configuration is
fine so that's what it goes with the
second thing that a desert starts the
spring application context what spring
is is a container for all your code that
runs on your application server right
let's you have business services you
have your controllers you have your data
services spring acts is a container for
all those different services and this
container is what's called an
application context every spring
application has this application context
which runs when the spring application
runs so this spring boot starter creates
that application context what it also
does is performs a class pot scan the v2
plug-in code into spring boot is by
creating your own custom classes and
annotating them with the intent lets you
want to create a business service you
create a class and annotate it with add
service annotation we'll create a
controller you create a sir class and
then annotate it with the controller
annotation so you're basically marking
your classes and say ok this is a
service this is a controller this is
something else and so on right so each
class contains a marker now spring has
to look at all those classes and say ok
depending on the marker treat it
differently if it's a service annotation
treat it as a service if it's a
controller annotation treat it as a
controller in order to know what to do
in order to know what the files allottee
of mark it has to actually scan the
class path
identify all those different classes
that I've annotated that's where the
classpath scan does spring on starting
up can potentially look at your class
path which is looking at all your code
and see if there are any classes which
have the special annotations if it does
it considers them and it treats them as
such a service is treated as a service a
controller restricted as a controller
and these classes typically have other
metadata which also Dell spring how that
controller needs to behave or how that
service needs to behave just bring in
furs all that from the annotations and
it does the right thing but the point
here is fright to do that it needs to
scan the class path finally it actually
starts the dumb cat server which is what
we access right we were able to access a
URL and we of course got an error page
because there was nothing in there but
it was actually a tomcat server that got
started did you download dumb cat and
install it well no you did not
this came with spring boot and this is
why the output of spring boot is a
standalone application we covered that
in the previous video standalone means
you don't have to create a servlet
container spring boot is all you need to
start their application and start a
separate container which is really cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
