to bootstrap a spring boot application
but the first one that I want to talk
about is this web UI that's on the
spring website it's on star dot spring
that IO which lets you bootstrap an
application by choosing your options and
downloading it so here it's a spring
initializer bootstrap your application
now it has options for what you want
your project to be so here you say
select the maven project or you can
choose a Gradle project but we want
maven in this case I choose the maven
project
good springboard version you can choose
the version so I'm going to choose 1.4.2
because that's the lit you know the
latest stable version in this list I'm
going to choose that but now here I can
choose the project metadata so these are
the coordinates for my maven build if
you remember we had a bunch of
coordinates added in the previous
example so here I'm going to do I owe
dot Java brains
Springwood QuickStart and then I'm going
to have this be course API and up here
I can choose the dependencies now we can
search for the dependencies are I can
switch to the full version there it
gives me a list of dependencies so here
are all the things that you can add to
your spring boot application remember we
chose starter web it's the full stack
web development with Tomcat and spring
MVC
so we had this when we added that
starter web dependency to the Palm D'Or
XML but another way to do this is to
create a project here and then check
this checkbox and now if I click on
generate project it's going to download
a fully prepared maven project with that
dependency added so now how do you know
what are the other dependencies that you
need to add to the Palm D'Or XML you
don't have to know that you need
security wire spring security just check
this checkbox and the related spring
security dependencies will be added to
the Palm D'Or XML that gets downloaded
over here you want a or b just check
this checkbox so you have all these
options over here in this menu you can
choose all the things that you need we
have database connections as well which
we can handle in a later unit we have
cloud related configuration there's a
whole lot of
that you can add to your spring boot
application and just check all the
things that you need and then click on
generate project so in this case all I
have is the group the artifact ID the
name is course API and this is the
description Java brains course API the
package name here packaging is a jar
Java version I can choose 1.8 you
remember we did add the property there
the language is Java and now I can click
on generate project now what the page
does is it downloads this zip file that
I can choose to extract and I'm in my ID
I can import that project that I've
downloaded I'm going to say import an
existing maven project click Next
provide the path where I have downloaded
the project and extracted it here's the
bomb that XML that came with it and I
click finish the ID is importing this
project and building it has a maven
project now here if you look at the porn
or XML and switch to onload XML tab now
here you can see there's a lot of what
we did in the first unit which is just
done for us so here you see there is a
parent section which points to spring
boots start a parent if we've already
done and we have the java dot version
property set to 1.8 but it also does a
couple more it has the source encoding
in the output encoding set to utf-8 as
well it has the spring Booth starter web
which is what we added as a dependency
but it also has a spring booth starter
test because you would imagine you would
write test cases for it so it kind of
bundles that as the default it also has
a spring boot maven plugin for better
maven integration so this is the project
and now if you open the course API
application that Java so here you see it
has created this Java class but
when we created a blank maven project
this class was obviously MD and we had
to add this code you remember we had to
add this pretty good application
annotation and we had to add the spring
application later on well this comes out
of the box with that download so all you
have to do is click the Run button and
run it as a java application and things
are going to work just like your you
have seen before in the previous unit
this is one way to start a springboard
application it gives you a UI which has
like a menu of options if you're not
really sure what you want to choose so
the name of this online application is
called spring initializer and it's
available at this URL start that spring
