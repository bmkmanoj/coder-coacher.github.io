lambda basics and I'm gonna call back
the first set of slides that we had in
the first video that I talked about why
lambdas I had given a bunch of points
which really didn't make a lot of sense
unless you really knew knew what was
going on but hopefully now after going
through this course these lists of items
should make sense
first of all lambda enables functional
programming we've already seen that in
action multiple different places you
think of functions as entities that get
passed around and that's the fundamental
concept behind functional programming
think of functions as entities you have
readable and concise code we've already
seen that we've seen how verbose the
anonymous inner classes and how lambda
makes it really concise and more
readable easier to use api's and
libraries we have the example of the
collection API and as more and more
libraries use land as in order to enable
this function programming model you can
have better api's when compared to the
old Java 7 way of doing things where you
had to have a class or an object in
order to pass behavior to any particular
library and finally we've seen support
for parallel processing we've just
looked at that in the previous video
we've seen how collections can be made
to go through a battle stream and this
could potentially leverage parallel
processing depending on the processor in
which the you know the JVM is running
alright so we are going to go back to
the things that we said we're going to
cover in this course and again hopefully
all these should make sense for you
understood what lambdas are maybe we
actually use them in a couple of
situations in sample code we've looked
at functional interfaces what they are
and how to use them we've looked at
method method references again we've
taken an introductory look at them and
seen how there are certain usages of
lambda expressions that could be
converted to method references there are
a few more that you could potentially
use definitely check out the
documentation to look at all these other
combinations and finally we've looked at
improvements to the collection API by
using this stream approach and seen how
you can use functional programming to
have these different operations apply to
collections and have the code be more
to learn more elegant and also enable
parallel processing while doing so
so hopefully this course was helpful
this has been Java 8 lambda basics
