thinking in angularjs 1 this course is
an introduction to one of the most
popular client-side JavaScript
programming frameworks as of today which
is angular j/s angularjs or angular as
it's often referred to has its origins
from Google it's an open source project
and it has grown in popularity over the
years and people all over the world have
contributed to it at the time of
recording this video the latest version
of angular is angular 1.5 and this
course is going to cover angular 1 dot X
it's the 1 X version of angular but
there is however a newer version of
angular which is angular 2 which is
round the corner but it's not released
yet so this could be different depending
on when you're watching this video and
if you want to learn angular 2 and if it
has been released by the time you're
seeing this you might want to check out
some other angular 2 material this
course is going to cover angular 1 all
right so what is angular angular is like
I said it's a client-side JavaScript
programming framework it lets you build
client-side applications which have
verage dynamic functionality the first
example that comes to mind when you
think about a rich client-side
application is Gmail Gmail is a very
complex application but the whole thing
the whole functionality is just one page
you load the Gmail web page and then
anything you do with Gmail like creating
a new email replying to somebody reading
your emails it all happens in that one
page without having to do a full page
refresh the vein does it the way the
Gmail application does it is that there
is a lot of JavaScript code that runs on
your browser that interacts with the
server using REST API calls so you don't
do a full page refresh you actually have
rich dynamic functionality which is
running on the client-side using
javascript and the javascript is
responsible for running on that logic
and that's all happening on the client
side and it's fascinating
I don't think Gmail web application
itself uses angular but Gmail is a
classic example offer rich
dynamic client-side web application so
I'll running on the client side and you
can build applications like that using a
lot of client-side development
frameworks and one of those frameworks
is angular if you know angular well you
can probably create your own gmail
application but which runs all that
functionality on the client-side all
right so a quick introduction about what
this course is going to be about right
so first like I mentioned it covers
angular version 1 dot X of the framework
it is an introductory course right so
we're going to start from the basics of
angular we're going to learn all the
concepts and then go ahead and write
code so it assumes no previous angular
knowledge you don't have to have any
previous knowledge we can start from the
scratch I'm going to guide you through
the basics and I'll help you along each
step of the way as we write code and
again we're going to be doing hands-on
coding we're going to build an
application probably two if time permits
are we going to put angular based on the
concepts that you learn you're going to
start learning the concepts first and
then apply it and build some live
applications which have interactive
functionality that ran on the client
side</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
