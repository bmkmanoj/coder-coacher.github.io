exercise you're going to be building a
calculator app yes it sounds very
complicated but it's not trust me it's a
very simple app that we're going to be
building using the concepts that we've
learned and let me assure you that if
you've been following along this course
you have everything you need with this
app so here's what's going to happen
right you're going to create an app with
two simple text boxes these are going to
contain numbers that you enter so you
can enter numbers in these text boxes
I'm going to do validation it's going to
be a very basic app we can assume that
the user is careful enough to enter just
numbers and we have these operations
over here so you can choose from one of
these operations you have some addition
subtraction multiplication and division
for the four buttons if I click on one
of these patterns that you want to
choose that operation for calculation
and depending on which button I choose
the right operation gets selected and
then I click the equals button depending
on these inputs and the operation
selected it is going to update the value
the result with that number so I can
choose a different operation and it's
going to have different values I can
also do decimals and it's going to use
the right operator to calculate the
right value to the right this analysis
it's basically accommodating floats so
this is the app I've already built this
and I've recorded everything I've done I
have even messed up and made a mistake
while I'm coding but I have recorded and
retained it in the video just in case it
helps if you have encountered a similar
problem you made the same mistake so
I'll give this a shot before you check
that out try this on your own and if
you're stuck or if you're done and you
want to see how I've done it go to the
next video where I walk through the
implementing this app from the scratch
and hopefully you doing this as well as
watching the video will kind of make the
concepts of you covered so far clear so
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
