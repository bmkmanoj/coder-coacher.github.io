language called typescript that you can
use to run web applications just like
you would with JavaScript but with some
cool new features so what does this new
language contain what does this consist
of types trip happens to be just
JavaScript plus some additional features
it contains types which is why it's the
Miam type script there is a concept of
typing
that doesn't exist in JavaScript but
typescript provides that concert and
that's very handy as you can tell from
the subsequent videos you can create
types declare types and make sure that
type checking happens during the types
of compilation process you also have
some other stuff and we can be covering
some of those features in addition to
types but the essential thing to
remember is that typescript is a
superset of JavaScript typescript
contains some syntax features that he
can put into JavaScript code but they
are all optional if you just write
JavaScript code so a valid JavaScript
code is valid typescript code you don't
have to use any of the typescript
features so it's not like a switch it's
like you are you writing typescript or
you're writing JavaScript it's kind of
like a dial you can just write
JavaScript and it's valid typescript can
add a little bit of time to feature it
still value type strip you can add every
typescript feature there is that's still
valid typescript right so it's kind of
like syntactic sugar on top of
JavaScript another thing that happens
with typescript is it kind of includes
some of the new developments in the
JavaScript programming language so
javascript is continuously evolving
there are new features that are being
introduced example you have a lit
keyword which addresses the scoping
problems with variable declarations in
JavaScript you have arrow functions
which are short and interser way of
writing functions in JavaScript all
these are features that are coming to
JavaScript they are in some of the newer
versions of JavaScript
but here's the thing you cannot use them
confidently if you want your application
to be deployed across multiple browsers
because
is not saying if to all the browsers
that your audience is using supports
those features these are new JavaScript
features so probably the new browsers
support them what about the old browsers
they wouldn't work so well javascript is
evolving and there are new features
being introduced
you cannot confidently use them you
always have to be careful but here's the
thing
typescript takes care of that for you in
your types of code you can use some of
the newer JavaScript features and
typescript does the conversion for you
it uses some kind of an equal it in pure
JavaScript native JavaScript which is
addressing the older versions so you can
write something like an arrow function
and run it through the typescript
compiler and typescript is going to
convert it to a standard function I'm
gonna showcase that in a subsequent
video but the idea is typescript
consists of JavaScript the old classic
JavaScript which is deployed across all
browsers just call es5 it also contains
some of the new features of JavaScript
es6
es7 and it also contains the typescript
features so it's a lot of cool stuff
that you can use in your code without
having to worry about whether it's going
to work on advocates typescript takes
care of the conversion so typescript
makes building complex applications
easier because of a whole lot of
features because of type checking
because of things that it does to make
sure that programmers don't make certain
mistakes it's useful a lot of different
frameworks especially angular the newer
versions of angular angular 2 onwards
use typescript extensively and you can
technically write code in JavaScript and
angular but it's a bit tougher it's much
more easier to write code using
typescript so angular there's a very
good use case gonna learn angular might
wanna learn tax with as well and many
more frameworks might use it in the
future
react is another community which is
adopting typescript increasingly these
days you can write elegant react
application is using typescript as well
so lot more reasons to use and learn and
use Dijkstra</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
