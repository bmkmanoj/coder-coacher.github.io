JavaScript scopes and closures in that
true dudes name this course covers two
important concepts in the JavaScript
programming language scopes and closures
I think these two concepts are essential
to understand when you're writing
JavaScript applications but the fact is
you can actually write a lot of code
without even knowing what the scopes and
closures are and without understanding
those concepts but still I think it's
important to understand these concepts
because a it lets you leverage these
concepts and write more elegant code and
be if you're writing code which doesn't
work like you expect it to having a
knowledge of how these scopes and
closures work is going to let you
troubleshoot the problem and debug the
problem and figure out what's wrong
quicker so this course starts off with
an understanding of what scopes are in
general scopes is a kind of generic
concept it's not restricted to
JavaScript it's there in pretty much a
lot of programming languages so we're
going to understand what scopes are and
we'll then understand how Cope's fit
into the javascript picture what our
JavaScript scopes what causes scopes in
JavaScript and then we're going to move
on to understand the concept of
JavaScript being a compiled and an
interpreted language a lot of people
think of JavaScript as an interpreted
language but people fail to understand
that there is actually a compilation
step that happens like a fraction of a
second before the interpretation step
happens so we learn what those two
different steps are and what happens in
each step and then we're going to move
on to closures they'll understand what
closures are and you'll see that
closures are something that happen
whether you like it or not it's a part
and parcel of the JavaScript programming
language itself
we'll see how it affects the Scopes and
let's see where closures can be used in
your writing goal so this is a slightly
advanced course I'm assuming that you're
familiar with the JavaScript programming
language so that would be the
prerequisite for this course some
familiarity with the JavaScript language
you should have written some code you
should have an understanding of what
objects are in JavaScript what functions
are and as a prerequisite
would recommend checking out the
JavaScript for developers course that's
available on Java brains if you haven't
programmed in JavaScript at all and this
is your first introduction to JavaScript
I would definitely encourage you to take
up another course like the JavaScript
for developers courses you're kind of
familiar with the syntax and then tackle
the scopes and closures course as for
reading material I highly recommend the
series of books called you don't know J
s by Kyle Simpson these books are
actually available online for free there
is a link to the github repo which has
the entire text for these books in the
video description so highly encourage
you to check it out on that page you
also have links where you can purchase a
paper copies of these books so I hope
you're excited to get started thanks
again for deciding to take this course
this is scopes and closures in depth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
