we need to know what's the server we're
going to point to we need to know what's
the end point that our client is going
to access I could have picked any of the
freely available
you know REST API endpoints but what
I've decided to do for this course is
pick a project which we built in the
previous course titled developing
restful api is with jax-rs when i say
that that's the prerequisite for this
course you don't really have to have
gone through that course to be able to
perform this step all we are doing is we
are looking at the project that we
worked on in that course and you're just
going to get the code and integrate it
to our project it's just an API for us
to call from our jax-rs client so I have
a link to the zip file which contains
the code in the tutorial page you could
also go to this project location on
github and click on download zip so that
you get the source code again the
details of this project doesn't matter
all we are doing is getting the code so
that we have a REST API endpoint that
our jax-rs client can access okay so
what I have here is a copy of the
template project checks r01 and what I'm
going to do is go to the messenger
project and navigate to the SRC main
Java
arkasha Java brains folder so this is
the messenger folder which contains all
the source code for the messenger
project now I'm going to copy this
folder and import it into the same path
here as far as the main Java
arkasha Java brains so I'm going to
paste that folder over here so again
since messenger doesn't have a database
dependency it's all in memory right it's
all driven by the code that we've copied
here so this should work seamlessly so
we are going to be primarily concerned
with the message resource in this
tutorial we have hard-coded a couple of
messages here so it should make it easy
for us to just access that URL and get
going all right I'm going to restart the
server here and open post
I'm going to make a call to this URL
here so this is advance Jack zero zero
six which is the root context off the
project if we just saw this is the
copy-paste project it's jax-rs
zero six and web api is a route that the
application class we've implemented
configures now slash messages should
give us the message resource now I'm
going to do a get request here and there
we go we get the two messages that we
have hard-coded in the previous course
if you haven't watched the previous
course all that's happening here is a
hard-coded list off message entities
that have put into a map and we using
this instead of connecting to the
database just to make it easy to just
get this app running alright now that we
have this let's write a client which
makes a REST API call to this URL n gets
messages and post messages and all that
good stuff okay I'm going to start by
creating a class which has a mean method
we are building a client here so we
don't need a server so I'm just going to
create a class here I'm going to call
that list API client I'm just going to
go to the package dot rest dot client
and I need the main method so I'm going
to check this and click finish all right
now how do we create a client you could
of course use the low-level network
api's that java provides to make an HTTP
call because all we are dealing with is
HTTP right but there's no fun in that
what we're here to learn is a more
elegant way to make these REST API calls
so jax-rs comes with a few API is that
let us build clients and make requests
to REST API right so that's when we
include Jersey we are getting that
library to make REST API requests so
jax-rs gives us a handy object called
client which is super useful when you
want to make REST API calls right it has
all the API is for building requests and
making calls and all that stuff okay but
client is actually an interface you need
an implementation for it right you need
to ask jax-rs to say hey give me an
object of client
so the way you do that is by doing
what's called client valor dot new
client so this is how you create an
instance of client you're basically
asking Jack sellers to say hey give me a
client object and now you get a client
object now with this client object you
can actually start making your requests
and sending them the first thing you
want to do with your client object is to
tell it where to point to rights the
first thing you need to tell you this
where is your realized API URL okay so
you in to tell it what's the target that
the client needs to point to so they
need to specify the target for your
client is to use a method call can you
guess target so there are three
signatures or actually four signatures
here so you can send it the link you can
send it a string you can send it a URI
or URI builder I'm just going to choose
string here so in this method I can send
the URL for where I want this client to
make a REST API requests to okay so I'm
going to choose this URL here I'm going
to make a call to Web API slash messages
slash one so this is this hard coded
message I want to retrieve message ID
one right so that's going to be the
target for this client now that I've
pointed the client to our target I'm
ready to build a request right so the
way to build a request is using the
request method okay so now I have built
a request now what I what I need to do
is send this request the way to send the
request is by using a method based on
what I want to do with this right do I
want to do a get do I want to do a post
here I want to do a get so I'm going to
say hey request do a get okay and now
this is going to give me a response so
I'm going to hold on to this in a
variable create a new local variable
called response now this response is all
I need right so this is the response I'm
going to get from the REST API all right
so let me print out the respond
here all right so now what happens if I
run this I'm going to say run as java
application you see here we get a jack
set us response object which is not
really what we want what we've got here
is a wrapper object right we want to get
the message instance out of this
so this library has no idea that what
you're looking for as a message instance
we've got the wrapper but we want to
unwrap the wrapper and get the message
instance you want to read the message
instance out of this to unwrap this
wrapper object and read the message
entity out of this you use a method
called read entity and you pass in what
class you are expecting as a response
so here it's message dot class now
message is something that I import from
my model package alright so this lets
jack set us know that what you want is a
message instance let me actually take
this out so that it's a bit clearer once
a message message equals response dot
read entity off the message class so
what this does is it takes this response
and says ok this response holds a
message instance you're passing in the
class so it's going to unwrap the
message instance in this response and
it's going to create a new message
instance over here and now I'm going to
print message dot get message alright so
now let's run this and see what happens
they obviously hello world so hello
world is that hard coded message in the
API that fit bills now we've created a
separate program which makes a REST API
call to that URL and wraps the message
entity out of this and then prints the
actual message all right so this is how
you create a REST API client using
jax-rs we've glossed over a lot of
details here so I'm going to talk about
a few more tricks to make this easy and
I'll
and see you in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
