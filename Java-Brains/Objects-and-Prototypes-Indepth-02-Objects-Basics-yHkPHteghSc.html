the concept of objects in JavaScript
objects are essentially a collection of
multiple values you can have values and
variables which are primitives like a
number or a string or a boolean or it
can have something like an object which
kind of bundles multiple values and you
can put a lot of other values in an
object like an object itself you can
have an array you can have a function so
an object is essentially a collection of
multiple values and the collection is
typically something that makes sense
it's it's a thing like a house a person
or an account or something like that
which contains multiple properties so an
object can be created in multiple ways
in JavaScript the simplest way is to
create an object in line so you say var
my obj equals open closed curly brace so
with this I have essentially created an
object inline and I'm doing this using
the open and closed curly brace and this
is an empty object because there's
nothing between the open and the close
curly brace so my object is essentially
an empty object if I were to to console
that log and if I were to run this I'm
going to get an MD object here similarly
I can type this in the console here
directly and I'm going to get an empty
object I can add properties to this
object by doing a my obj dot foo equals
value so what this does is basically
create a property called foo on the
object my obj and it's going to set the
value of that property to a string just
value alright now I can access that
property by doing my obj dot foo and
it's going to get me that value right I
can add more properties like this the
thing to remember about objects in
JavaScript is it's not class-based so
there's no blueprint that every object
needs to adhere to I can create any
property on any object whenever I want
and there's no restrictions now there
are no datatype restrictions as well so
I can easily change my obj dot foo to be
a number over here and then that's be a
number so there are it's a our objects
are essentially freeform and I usually
tend to think of them as key value pair
you know you're familiar with the
concept of Maps hopefully a map is
basically a key containing a value so an
object is essentially like a key value
pair there are other ways in which you
can create objects so this was the
inline empty object but let's say I want
to create this value upfront with the
property so I can say something like
this foo and then assign it value you
can have age assign to the value 30
address which can be a nested object
inside I can have a street alright so
have an address with a with a street
city and pin codes and address is a
nested object over here so I can
basically create the object in line with
all the values set so if I were to
reload and run this now if I were to
access my obj I'm going to get that
fully formed object alright the other
important thing to remember is that you
can access properties and objects by
using the dot notation or the square
bracket notation so I can access the
full property on the object by doing my
obj dot foo we've already seen this but
the other thing we can do is use the
square bracket notation which is
something like this I can add the double
quotes and then send the string which is
the property in you know surrounded by
double quotes and then send it to a
square bracket and then I hit enter it's
going to get this same value so this is
what's referred to as the bracket
notation whereas this is referred to as
the dot notation they're essentially the
same alright so this was a quick
introduction to objects in JavaScript
again I encourage you to refer to the
JavaScript for developers course where I
cover some of the more basic features of
objects and how to play with them and
some of the intricacies of dealing with
objects in JavaScript as we continue
this course I'm going to assume that
you're comfortable with JavaScript
