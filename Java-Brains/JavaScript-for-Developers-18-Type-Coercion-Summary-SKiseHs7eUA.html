does when it comes to the if conditions
and type conversions is you can do
something like you do in C where you
pass in the value to an F block okay so
let's say I want to do something like
this if a okay now what do you think
happens let me remove B need this it has
a value of 10 now I'm going to do an if
a something like this will not work in
Java right it's going to say it has to
be a boolean you cannot do an F on a
number okay but this works in JavaScript
it works similar to how you do things in
C in C if a has a non zero value like 10
it's going to return true and if a has a
value of zero then it returns false
right so if I were to execute this
reload and run I'm going to return
values re let me change this it's not
values are equal any more is true and
clear reload and rerun is true because
it has a value of 10 if I were to say a
equals zero and we load and run it does
not execute because 0 is a false value
so every value in JavaScript has a
corresponding boolean value let's say I
change a to minus 10 and reload and run
CA is still true ok it's only if a is 0
as long as there is a number as only if
a is 0 that it returns false for all
nonzero values a is true okay let's try
string if I pass in a string hello are
any string for that matter reload and
run yes true however if the string
happens to be an empty string you reload
and run is false
okay I can add an else condition here so
that it's
obvious what's going on consoled that
log is false
alright so reload and run is false then
let's look at other data types
boolean it's obvious if it's true it
executes if it's false then he is false
but how about undefined
he is undefined
yes false okay similarly for null he is
null is false okay so in the case of
number 0 as far as all nonzero numbers
are true the case of string and empty
string is false
any other string as long as it has at
least one character it is true undefined
as false null as files pull into and
false or obvious okay so to summarize
that coercion javascript is flexible
with typing sometimes to the frustration
of the developers but this is 3 the
languages it kind of converts from type
2 type depending on the syntax and the
need values of all types have an
Associated boolean value you don't have
to have a boolean in an if block or a
while block instead in fact you can have
a value of a different type and each of
those values have a corresponding
boolean value
and we talked about the double equals in
a triple equals right so always use the
triple equals for precise checks when
you want to check both the value and the
type match if you just use a double
equals javascript could potentially do
type coercion and see if the coerced
type matches which might not be what you
want sometimes so I personally choose
triple equals all the time because I
want to have both type and value checks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
