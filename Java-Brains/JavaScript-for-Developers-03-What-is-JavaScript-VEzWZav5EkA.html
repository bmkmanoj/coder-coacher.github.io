a definition that I've pulled up from a
website called Mozilla developer Network
or mdn for short if you're not familiar
with Md and I'm going to introduce that
in the resources section but in the end
or the Mozilla developer network is one
of the best resources for learning and
you know having a reference to
JavaScript that's available anywhere
online in my opinion of course so this
is a definition of pulled up from the
ambient page there is an introduction to
JavaScript page and this is one of the
first few sentences and I think it
summarises JavaScript really well so
here's the definition javascript often
shortened to jas is a lightweight
interpreted object-oriented language the
first-class functions and is best known
as the scripting language for web pages
but it's used in many non browser
environments as well okay and this is
the link to the Mozilla developer
Network page about JavaScript and this
is where I pulled up this definition it
does have a lot of buzzwords so it has a
lot of catchphrase er so let's extract
some of those buzzwords and look at
those in detail here's what JavaScript
is it's a lightweight language it's an
interpreted language it's object
oriented it has first-class functions
and it's a scripting language look at
what each of these mean but what is a
lightweight language a lot of people
have different definitions of what a
lightweight language means but at a high
level the way I think of it a
lightweight language is something that
is really easy to implement it has a
small memory footprint there's not a
whole lot of ceremony that you have to
go through before even write your first
line of code so that's what I think of
as a lightweight language and this is
what JavaScript claims to be next--
interpreted language javascript is an
interpreted language and it means that
there is no compliation that happens the
instructions are executed directly so in
the case of JavaScript there's no
compilation step that is technically not
true there is a compilation step but
it's different from the way you think of
compliation in a language like C++ or
Java think about what you would need to
do in order execute a piece of C++ code
a piece of Java code right you finish
coding the program what's the first
thing you need to do in order to execute
it you need to run it by a compiler
right so you need to compile the code
and you end up with an intermediate
binary right in the case of C++ it's an
object by object binary another case of
Java it's byte code so there is this
intermediate code that gets generated
and you execute that right so you take
that file and proceed with the execution
that step does not exist in the case of
JavaScript in the case of JavaScript
there's no intermediate file that you
compile and get write the instructions
that you write the code that you write
is executed directly okay I hope that
makes sense
next buzzword here is that JavaScript is
object oriented this should be familiar
to a lot of you folks object oriented
means that when you write code you model
your code around objects right you don't
look at code as okay what are the steps
that I need complete in order to solve
the problem you think of a problem you
break it down into objects and then you
create those objects with data and
functionality so JavaScript there is an
object-oriented language
it has objects and you can use objects
to model your application and solve
problems the next term is that
javascript has first-class functions
this is a little bit tricky if you're
not familiar with the any of the
functional programming languages this
concept does not exist in a language
like Java or C++ what function what
first-class functions mean is that
functions can be used as values think
for string value right like let's say
you have a string hello world you can
assign it to a variable right
similarly in JavaScript you can have a
function be a value you can take a
function value and assign it to a
variable you can pass functions as
parameters to method calls right so it
is a whole lot of powerful you know
flexibility there and I'm going to cover
that in a later tutorial but this is
something that JavaScript provides which
doesn't exist in some of those classical
languages well there is this concept of
functions that has been introduced in
Java
so it is getting there but javascript
has way more flexibility when it comes
to what you can do with functions which
is actually both a good and a bad thing
we'll cover that when we get there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
