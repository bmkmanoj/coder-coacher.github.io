what we've done so far we have chosen an
art type for maven and we have set up
our code and project structure in our
development environment and we also used
maven in order to compile run test cases
build and publish our artifact into a
repository in this tutorial we're going
to look at dependencies so what I'll do
is in the sample project that may even
provide it for me I will add a
dependency and I will make changes to
the Palm D'Or XML in order to in order
to let me even know that I have this
dependency and it needs to import the
charge so by doing this we will learn
how to set up dependencies in maven so
here I am at my project location I have
my Palm D'Or XML here have the source
folder here the target folder is
actually the result of all the build and
compiled that we did earlier I can
actually clear this out by using a
command called mV in clean now clean is
a phase which removes all the classes
and all the you know the distributions
that were generated before so here you
can see it's actually doing a delete of
this target folder where all the classes
in the jars are available so the target
folder is gone so we are we are as if
this is as if we've just created this
you know the project structure and we
have not done any compile we haven't how
we haven't generated any classes yet so
what I will do is I'll go to the source
folder okay I'm here at the source
folder and here we have two folders
which is main and test now I'll be
focusing on adding our dependency so
I'll be focusing only on main I'm not
going to write any test cases in this
tutorial so what I'll do is I'll open up
the Java file that has been created here
which is the app dot Java it is just a
simple hello world so what I will do is
I will add a dependency here the example
that I'm going to choose is a logging
framework so I'll use the SL f4j logging
framework API in order to log a test
message normally what would
as if I was doing this outside of maven
I would have to go download the slfe
cheat jars and then added to the class
path and only after that would I be able
to compile any class file which has a
referred dependency on those classes in
the jar but when it comes to mimin we
don't have to you know go and download
all the jars and add it to the class
path there are things that maven does
automatically for us we just have to
tell me even that we have this
dependency so first let me add the code
here in this main class in order to log
this hello world message or instead of
printing it to the system dot out what
I'll do is I'll print it to a log file
using a Cell effigy so I'll just comment
this line out and then I will use the
logger object of a cell effigy
okay
so it's a simple piece of code I just
have the log of Factory here and then
I'm just printing out an info message
which is hello world now let me import
the SL FEG dependencies over here so
what I lose at this to an import org dot
s elephant G let me import all the
classes here might need this later okay
so I've done the import here and I have
used the logger class in order to print
the log message save this and close this
now let's see what happens if I run a
maven compile now so I have made the
change to the you know the class in this
SRC folder now if I ask me when to
compile this what's gonna happen is it's
gonna return in a it returned an error
message so let me expand this you can
see this clearly okay so here you can
see there is an error in the compiled
note that it says meeven compiler plugin
okay so it's actually a compiler plugin
will talk about plugins later but just
make a mental note of this what's
happening is the compile was feeling
there is a compilation error and it says
that our glorious lfhe does not exist
because it cannot do an import there's
no such class there in the class path
and then it cannot find the logger class
obviously again because we don't have
the nagas factory so this is a problem
because we don't have the jar file in
place so how do we tell maven to in
to the jar file first we need to tell me
even to pull up the jar file from the
central repository with the main
repository which is accessible over the
Internet it does not assume that it's
not there in our development environment
at all what we can do is we can ask
Navin to go connect to the central
repository and pull up this jar file and
in order to do that what we need to do
is we need to go to the bomb dot XML so
here I'll edit the bomb dot XML and here
what I'll do is just like we have the
dependency here for j-unit I need to add
another dependency for SL effigy so what
I need to do is I need to have another
dependency tag and here I need to
specify the group ID artifact ID the
version and the scope same as what we
have done for J unit ingenuine and we
have specified the group ID artifact ID
version and the scope as you have
discussed this earlier these are the
coordinates at least these three these
three the Gav are the coordinates for
maven in order to identify any
particular jar file so we need to
provide this set these three values for
RSL effigy SL effigy jar now how do we
find out what these values are well
there are actually a lot of sites that
help us search for these repositories so
what we'll do is we'll open up our
browser and we will search for
maven repository search so here we have
maven repository calm ambient browser
calm repository dot Sona type dot-com
sauna type is the company that that does
a lot of work on maven so we can we can
look any at any of these sites here so
we will search by a group ID if we can
search by a group ID we can search by a
fact ID or by some description so what I
lose I will just type SL if for J and it
comes up with the list of matches and
I'll just go with the SL effigy API now
here we see all the different versions
and we have the types whether they're
you know release or release candidate on
alpha it's recommended to go for a
release because they are the stable
versions so what I'll do is I'll just
click on the version number here and
it's going to tell me the piece of code
that I need to add as a dependency over
here see it has the group ID the
artefact ID and the version so 41.6 dot
1 these are the values that I need to
enter so it's fairly simple here I have
the arc
dot SL f OG as the group ID and the
artifact ID is SL foj
- API so I'm going to copy the snippet
here and paste it over here in between
these dependency tags fix the
indentation a bit and save this okay so
now all I need to do is run the same VM
compile command again enough this time
what's going to happen is maven is going
to look at this dependency tag over here
there's an additional dependency tag
so what maven does is before it actually
issues the compiled command it will go
and download all the jars which are
required for this SL effigy API and once
it gets all the jars it's going to
include them in the glass bath and mix
it available for compile so
run this again you should be able to see
the SL effigy downloads happening so
there you go it's actually connecting to
the maven repository and it is
downloading all the resources and this
time you can see that the build has been
successful and there is a class folder
generated in the target directory and we
have successfully compiled the class one
thing you should note here is that in
this dependency where I've added the
dependency for SL foj I do not have a
scope value if you see here for the
j-unit dependency there is something
called the scope and we have mentioned
the value assessed but we do not have a
scope value here well what's happening
is we essentially haven't provided the
scope value it's sticking the default
scope and the default scope is compile
so let's say I do not enter a scope
value it's going to be same as this with
a compile scope
now what compile scope means is that
this chart is going to be available
during the compile phase you're going to
look at the few other scopes as we go on
we're going to develop a few other types
of applications and see how these scopes
work but the thing to note here is that
compile is the default scope and if we
do not specify the scope the same as
specifying a compile scope and this
means that the char that we have
mentioned as a dependency is available
during compile time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
