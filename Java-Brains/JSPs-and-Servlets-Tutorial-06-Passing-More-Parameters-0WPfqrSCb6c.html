tutorial we looked at how to pass
parameters to a get and post requests
we're going to expand on that a little
bit in this tutorial we're going to look
at other ways in which the parameters
are passed we're going to look at
different HTML controls and we'll see
how they affect the way we retrieve
those parameters the example that we
have here the code that we wrote in my
previous tutorial has a simple text box
and the text box has a name which
corresponds to the get parameter that
we're going to do here you're going to
do a get parameter of that name and this
string the user name string will be
associated with the value that the user
is going to pass when they fill this
text box and click Submit so the value
is passed to the name of the control
itself so it's pretty straightforward
whatever name you use here you use the
same name in order to do a get parameter
and you retrieve the value so let's try
a few more things here we'll have one
more textbox
we call it full name well I'm not gonna
worry about the leave the CLS I'll just
call it full name or let me relieve it
okay so I have two text boxes here so if
the user fills this there will be a
parameter called full name that will be
passed
so let me capture that here as well so I
have a user name here which I'm
capturing so I need to capture extra
parameter as well so
I will use another string very good and
because I can call the string variable
anything but this has to be same as the
name of the textbox so I will say will
name here okay so I'm going to modify
this one note that we are not modifying
the do gate because in our form we have
mentioned that the method is post so we
know that the do post is the one that's
going to get executed so I am just going
to modify this for now okay so you're
going to tell the user what their full
name is
see okay some cat redeploys it
automatically now go back to this make
sure you to fish the form this is a
mistake that I did last time unless you
refresh the form the changes that you do
in the IDE you will not get perfected
over here so I'm going to submit this
now I will say ABC my full name is ABC
the yes summit quit so there you go it's
a hello from the post method so we know
that the post is run you know the we
have captured the username and we have
also captured the full name so there are
two parameters that are passed
simultaneously okay so let's add a few
more things here okay a ladder
profession radio
type this radio Leamas shall just call
that froth I need to pass the value so
that's the value developer okay there
laughs one more radio let's call it
architect okay so I have two radio
buttons here let me add a break here so
that looks neat
okay so I have two radio buttons here
and they have the name of prof. so I
need to capture this value in the
request dot getparameter the same way as
i would capture a text box but instead
of a value that the user types what will
be passed is the value that user selects
so let me go ahead and I have that code
here I'm not going to add to the same
line I'll have a new line string prof
equals request dawn kit meter ruff
so I'm capturing the value that is being
passed in the prof parameter stay out
dot then Ellen you are you go so yeah
now I've saved it so I think um catch it
or to deploy it has fresh this again so
I have this video i'll choose developer
the other values are there say submit
okay so here we go
we have the earlier text and we also
have the newly captured value so again
you have multiple radio buttons you can
find out which is the one that's been
selected by capturing the value you can
probably have an if for some conditional
there to take action based on that next
we're going to do a select select
name equals missing location an option
again here I need to have value
okay this some something I would figure
okay this is also straight forward not
and a big difference
came back a fresh juice here of course
this comes up now is the tricky part now
what happens if I choose more than one
let's say I have this option of choosing
more than one give a size equals three a
few more options
okay against the some arbitrary values
for testing
okay now let me not change this okay I'm
still gonna retain the code the same way
but what I've done here is I have
enabled the user to choose more than one
so let's see how this works reload this
now I'll just choose here submit query
everything looks fine now what happens
if I choose more than one I'll say here
and there only here comes up and what's
happening to there in order to catch
multiple parameters we need to make a
change instead of calling get parameter
we need to call another method let's
have a look at that this is something
that we need to do for any HTML control
that has multiple values that's been
sent another example that I can think of
right now is the check box you can check
multiple items so in that case there are
multiple values that are being sent for
the same name which is in this case it's
location it'll be the name of the check
box in the case of the check box so in
that case how you capture all of them so
let's have a look at another method
request dot get
parameter values get parameter values
knows that the values are you passing
this you know it's I it has multiple
values so in that case it's going to
give you all those values but in order
to capture that you will need to take it
inside a string array it will not you
know you cannot pass a die to a string
the return type as a string array if you
just move your mouse over you can see
that the Charlie yeah yeah the return
parameter is a string array so let's do
that we will pass the same location here
but instead of catching these values
inside a string I will catch those
values inside of string Eric
okay so
chain stitch length don't and a length
the quick
our look
take this out dot println value and the
print location of phi it's not really
the best score but should serve a
purpose for now so yeah it's also deploy
now let me choose here and there it's up
query so I get a spawn saying I'm at two
places here and there so both these
values the values that I've selected
here both these have gone as a string
array so I can say I can select all of
them and we know it's been a it's going
to create those many new strings in the
area and it's going to and add them so
it's either the count is five and here
it's printed all the values that are
selected so the same thing works for
checkboxes also you will have to use
though and get parameter values you can
of course use a get parameter but then
it's going to return only the first item
in the array like we saw earlier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
