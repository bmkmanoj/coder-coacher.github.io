wanted to have it is from state method
which takes in an argument and then
compares the input to the state that
this person is part of so I'm going to
go ahead and create this method so the
method is is from state now this is a
function on the object so I'm going to
create a function here now I have a
function which doesn't do anything but I
have the is from state property of the
person object B a function now what does
this function have to do it needs to
accept a string argument which is the
state so let me accept that here state
okay and now I need to compare the state
to this state of this address object of
the person now how do I compare it how
do I so in order to compare I need to
get the state first right how do I get
the state first I could do but you know
person dot address that state but that
would have the problem off depending on
the person this is what we talked about
earlier if person were to have a
different you know if it were to point
to a different object and you're holding
onto the object into that in another
variable nothing's going to work so you
don't want to do person door addressed
at state you need to do the self objects
reference dot addressed at state and the
way to do that is using this so I can
have logic here which is if this dot
address that state is equal to state
notice that I am using the triple equals
here the double equals should work but I
as a rule always used to be equals so if
they are equal I return true else
or return false all right and this is
this is it this is implementation now if
I call this from state and I pass in CA
now it's going to compare this to
registered state to CA now this to
registered state is this object dot
address dot state which is CA it
compares CA to whatever input which is
ca and it will return true if I pass in
ABC it's good this state is going to
have the value of ABC just going to
compare CA to ABC and I'll return false
okay so this will work
one other shortcut you can do is you can
actually get rid of this F condition you
notice if we are evaluating this
expression it's a boolean expression the
expression is true you return true the
expression is files you return files
instead of doing the a if you might as
well return the expression right if it's
true he return true if it's false you
written false just return it so that's
what I'm going to do next I am going to
change this to put it done and I do not
need this whole if block at all so it's
going to return whether this is true or
false
now if I were to run this from state of
ABC weakens all that log this log and
reload and run it returns false if I
were to pass CA it returns true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
