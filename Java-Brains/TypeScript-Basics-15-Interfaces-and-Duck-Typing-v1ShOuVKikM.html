interfaces which lets you define a
template for an object and have multiple
objects fit into that template if it
matches the criteria so we looked at
reading classes for a person what I
could do is create an interface for a
person and the way to do this is by
defining the keyboard interface followed
by the name of the interface the
convention is again to use the first
letter as a per case just like classes
and here I can define the properties but
types just like you do with classes
right to have last name the only
difference comes with methods you don't
really create method implementations
with interfaces you just create the
signature of the method and then have
classes implemented so for instance we
have a get full name method in a person
class now I can define a signature for
the method get full name but I cannot
really define the method content itself
that has to be implemented by a class
which is extending this interface so get
full name can be a function that takes
in no input arguments and then it
returns a string so here what I'm doing
is I'm just defining the the method and
not providing the implementation now
here I can have a class this could be
anything implements person and now since
this implements person this has to have
these members in the class so here you
see there is an error and visual studio
code provides me with autocomplete say
to implement the interface person and if
I click that see here you get all the
contents of that interface provided as
implementation so you have first name
and last name as to properties which are
strings they have to match and then you
have a method implementation over here
which by default throws an error but I
could return the start
first name that's dead last name and now
I have an implementation of this method
right so this is how interfaces work
interfaces let you define the structure
without defining the implementation and
in the class that implements the
interface has to provide everything that
the interface is declaring right so the
declaration goes over here that you want
enforce every class that implements it
to actually follow and implement as well
alright so interface is a fairly simple
but I want to introduce a concept of
duck typing which is pretty important in
typescript now we have the person
interface and then you've created a
class called foo and thanks to
polymorphism this shouldn't come as a
surprise if I were to say let a person
which is declared as the interface type
equals new foo this will work because
foo implements the interface so an
instance of the class foo can be
allocated to a variable that's declared
off that interface simple enough right
now here's where things get a little bit
different with typescript that's a
doesn't really enforce this entirely you
can create an object that has all the
properties of this interface even though
the object is not an instance of a class
that implements that interface let's say
I create an object let some obj equals
I'm just going to create an inline
object right it's not an instance of a
class just a random inline object I'm
going to create first-name lastname and
then I'm gonna create a get get full
name be a method that returns tests as
well all right so this is a simple
object which is not an instance of the
class foo it is not an instance of any
class that implements the person
interface but it is very similar to an
object
would have been an instant a fool would
have been an instance of a class that
implements the person interface right it
looks very similar has the same
properties it has the same method the
same signature so here's what typescript
does typescript allows you to treat this
as an instance of person it really
doesn't matter if it's strictly
implementing a class or strictly
implementing an interface as long as it
matches the structure it is fine so for
instance I can say a person which we
know is an is declared of type person
can be assigned the value of some object
and this is fine why is this fine this
is biggest this has the same structure
this kind of structure based typing is
what's referred to as duck typing the
name comes from the phrase if it looks
like a duck if it quacks like a duck
then it is a duck so it's basically what
typescript looks at sees an object and
if it looks like the object that is
being assigned to if it has the same
properties it has the same behavior
that's good enough for typescript right
this is an important thing to remember
when you're dealing with objects that
are not necessarily strictly created as
instances of a class or instances of any
implementation of interfaces as long as
the properties match exactly it's gonna
work fine now what do I mean by the
properties matching so here there are a
couple of nuances to it first if a
required property doesn't exist then
this is gonna fail all right so let's
say I remove lastname now that trip
complains because it expects last name
to be available but it is not available
I mean the property last name is missing
so the required properties have to be
there but here's where things get
interesting they were to add an extra
property right let's say I have a foo
it's ten random property which is not a
part of the person interface this works
fine see types rep is not giving me an
error the problem though is I cannot
access foo from a person a person
that foo is gonna give an error this is
because food does not exist on person so
this is the default behavior of the
typescript compiler it requires that
structure to match but it doesn't really
have to be a strict instance of classes
order interfaces something for you to
remember we're dealing with external
objects that may not necessarily be
instances off classes directly but they
have the same property in the same
structure that should work fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
