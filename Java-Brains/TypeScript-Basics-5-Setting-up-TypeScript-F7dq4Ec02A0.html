to set up our development environment to
start writing typescript code there are
a bunch of things that we're going to
install first is the IDE or the editor
unless you're going to be writing code
or the editor of choice that I'm going
to be using in this course is Visual
Studio code oh you get that at code
Visual Studio com it's and I deter which
has some pretty decent support for
typescript and it's gonna be handy when
you were writing code using typescript
so head over to code dot which is studio
comm and download the version for your
operating system I'm currently on a Mac
so it says it has the download for Mac
on different operating systems you can
get the corresponding download once you
download it it's an installer that you
run on your machine standard
installation procedure for your
operating system there shouldn't be
anything to complicate it you don't have
to use Visual Studio code though you can
pretty much use any editor of your
choice the only thing that I would
suggest is use an editor that lets you
open multiple files at a time if you
look at the editors that come with the
operating system like notepad for
Windows or TextEdit for a Mac it lets
you open just one file at a time right
you open a file opens in a new window
open another file it opens in another
window that can get painful because
we're going to be working on a bunch of
files so choose an editor that lets you
open like folder and then you can open
all the files within that folder without
having to create a new windows for it so
as long as you do that any editor should
be fine so the next step is to install
nodejs like I mentioned before nodejs is
going to be the platform in which we're
gonna be running the typescript compiler
we need the compiler to convert from
typescript code to JavaScript code and
that's a node.js program so you need no
js' installed on your machine to run the
typescript compiler once you have run
the compiler and if you've got
JavaScript code you're going to be using
node.js again to execute that JavaScript
code which is the result of the compiler
so we're going to be using node.js twice
first to convert from typescript to
JavaScript and then the second to run
the JavaScript that it has that is
resulted so we need node.js installed on
our machine so go here to node J star
arc and download
the version of nodejs that you prefer I
like to go with the latest version but
you can choose the long-term support
version as well again when you click
this you're gonna get an installer that
you just need to run and you will have
no J's installed on your machine you can
verify that by opening terminal and
typing node - V so a node is the name of
the program which is the node J s
program and dash V tells node to print
out the version the version that I am
currently on a seven-point 9.0 as you
can tell it's a little bit older than
the version you see here which is 8.5
but that's okay something around seven
or eight should be fine and even the LDS
like I said six is also okay another
thing you can do is around NPM - V so
NPM is the package manager for node it
comes with node.js when you ran the
node.js installer it installed
NPM with it so NPM - we prints out the
version of NPM man that should be
installed as well so you see these two
well notice successfully installed
now that you have deaths the final step
is to install the typescript compiler
because we're gonna be writing
typescript code and having it compile
how do you install the typescript
compiler the typescript compiler is like
I said a node module it's a node package
so you use the node package manager to
install typescript the way to do this
the way to install any node package is
to type NPM install and then the name of
the package all right so the name of the
typescript package is typescript so you
say npm install typescript but feet if
you just run this command the default
behavior of NPM is to install the
package of your choice into the
directory where you're running NPM
install so right now I am in the
directory home slash typescript basics
so when I run NPM install type strip
it's gonna install it in this folder
types through basics
I wanted available across the board in
all my directories so if I'm in a
different directory I should still be
able to run the typescript compiler in
order to do this I want to tell NPM to
install this globally
I knew that with the flag - gee now NPM
is gonna install types globally for me
so irrespective of which directory I
mean I can still run the typescript
compiler it's gonna add it to my path if
you execute this command NPM is gonna
fetch typescript from the global
repository and it's gonna install it I'm
not gonna run this right now because I
already have typescript installed but as
long as you run this command you should
be able to get that script installed on
your machine now with these three things
the editor visual studio code nodejs
and the npm install of type strip you're
all set to start writing types ripcord
and we'll do just that in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
