functions as values is you know it makes
sense it's a bit weird if you are not
familiar with these functional
programming languages but yeah once you
get used to it you can understand how
you can have a variable pointing to a
function pass it around
and when I say pass it around I do mean
pass it around so think about all the
things you can do with a variable and a
value anything you can do with a
standard value you can do with a
function because a function is a value
so let's say you have a variable which
is a string you can pass the string as
an argument to another function right
similarly for variable is a function you
can actually pass that function as an
argument to another function okay so you
can have a another function which
executes the function that you pass to
it okay let me demonstrate that let's
say I have let's keep this F is a
function now rather than executing F
directly what I'm going to do is clear
this out and create another function or
executor which takes in a parameter
which let's say happens to be a function
okay and let me just do a console that
log here off whatever parameter I'm
getting and now I'm going to call the
executor function if I don't call it
with any arguments it's going to print
undefined right FN is going to be
undefined if I pass it with a string is
going to take that string and it's going
to print it now I can pass a function as
well now what's the function that we
have here F is a variable which contains
a function now let me pass F to this
function now the executors function
takes that input and then it prints it
so it should actually print this
function now what is printing a function
look like
let's see now here you see it prints
function f it doesn't print the contents
over here but it's kind of like a string
representation off the function that we
are passing okay so it is able to get
that function and actually print that
function but what we are interested in
is not printing the function what we are
interested in is in executing the
function so in order to execute the
function it's pretty much the same
same logic so rather than have the same
syntax so rather than have an F open
closed now its variable that contains a
function is FN so I like to do is FN
open closed and with this I'm executing
the function K that gets passed to it
now let me clear this out and reload and
run up here you see hello gets printed
but here is the flow of control here
when this part gets executed there is a
variable called F which contains a
function object
I think it's printed on the console this
part gets executed there is an available
called executor which contains a
function object again nothing is printed
on the console this just says okay
whatever is the value that gets input
treat it as a function and executed and
now when we come to line 11 this is
where we call function 1 and we pass in
function to right so when this when this
line 11 gets printed this function gets
called and the value that it's taking
happens to be a function so it executes
set so line 7 gets executed when line 7
gets executed this results in this
function being Kyle and now line 2 gets
executed and this is where hello gets
printed on the console all right so this
is how you can pass functions as
arguments and then execute them in other
functions and of course if this were to
take sub arguments right so let's say
this and of course if the function that
we're passing happens to take arguments
let's say this was this had a name as an
argument and then we had holo name now
since we are not passing any arguments
to this function this would return
hello undefined however I can pass a
named argument over here to the executor
and have the executor take that named
argument and pass it to the function
that's that's being called here which
sends that named argument to F and now F
should have the value kochak which is
passed through an intermediate or e
function okay
so now we get that value so if this is
confusing pause for a minute and go
through the flow here it should
be fairly obvious once you step through
the flow of execution but the essential
concept that I want you to take away
from this video is that you can pass a
function as an argument to another
function possibly with the result of
having that function being executed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
