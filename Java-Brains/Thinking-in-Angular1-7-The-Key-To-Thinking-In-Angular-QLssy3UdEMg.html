the last unit was an introduction to
client-side web applications and why me
need a client-side MVC framework we saw
how we could address the client-side
development and the complexities on the
client-side by having some kind of a
framework which helps us write code
using four you know standard patterns
like the MVC pattern in this unit we can
start looking at angularjs so here's
where we can actually kick things off
with angular we can look at how angular
solves the problem of client-side MVC
thumbs up angular is really good for
doing client-side MVC it provides you
the pattern in which you can write the
model view and the controller separately
so that you can manage your code better
and write more complex application on
the client-side but if you would look at
the angularjs website the official
website for angularjs is angularjs.org
so this is the official website for the
1/3 x version if you look at the landing
page you're not going to see the
occurrence off the term MVC which is
actually interesting because I need a
just as a VC so well what you're
actually going to see is something like
this it's probably going to read HTML
enhanced for web apps that's what it
reads today as I'm recording this video
it might be different but it's very
likely going to be the same because this
is kind of like the fundamental core
philosophy of angular now why is this
why does angular not call itself at NVC
framework why does it call itself HTML
enhanced if you read some of the
description on the website I have
actually taken a small snippet of this
description and I've put it over here so
this is what it says it says hTML is
great for declaring static documents but
it falters when you try to use it for
declaring dynamic views in web
applications you remember we talked
about how HTML is static and that's what
they mention with you angularjs lets you
extend HTML vocabulary for your
application the resulting environment is
extraordinarily expressive readable and
quick to develop let's ignore the last
statement this kind of marketing speak
but let's look at the first
in the in the second paragraph angularjs
lets you extend HTML vocabulary do you
see that's almost as if the creators of
angular seems to hate HTML they're
trying to fix it they're saying hTML is
great for static documents but it's not
great for dynamic documents so angularjs
lets you extend HTML so you can actually
build dynamic documents and applications
like that right so it's almost as if
they hate HTML and are trying to fix it
but maybe not hate but they certainly
seem to think that it's not good enough
for dynamic applications and they want
you to use angular to extend it alright
so this is the key philosophy for
extending hTML is the key philosophy of
angular and this is a reason why angular
does not call itself a client-side MVC
framework this is actually it turns out
to be a key distinction to make as an
angularjs developer angularjs is not or
differently or a better way to write
your standard JavaScript or check very
code it's a whole new way to think about
writing client-side apps so let me
demonstrate what this different way of
thinking is let's take a complete
example let's say you want to show a
date right the current date in an HTML
document into your building HTML you
want to show what the current date so
that when somebody loads the HTML page
they see the date at which they loaded
the page right it's a simple simple
requirement so let's take something like
this you create a div with an ID called
date right and you want to show the
current date there so that's when the
page loads the date is displayed this is
clearly JavaScript because HTML like I
said is static it cannot change what the
content is based on when you load the
page so this is you know a classic
example of the content changing
depending on the time at which you go to
the picture this clearly has to be Java
Script which executes on the client side
browser gets the current date and adds
it to the HTML so that you see it right
so here is the standard JavaScript are
the jQuery way this is how
would write javascript code if you were
to show the date and the HTML the first
thing you do is you find the element
where you need to show the date if you
need to get that element in the Dom here
it's a div with an ID dick so you need
to say okay
hey Don or hey browser give me the div
which has an ID called it you're going
to get that the object it is the object
in the document object model tree going
to get that object then what you do you
write code to get the current think
javascript has a way to get the data
there's a data there's a data object so
you can get the data object get that
date convert it to some kind of a string
and then now that you have the div with
the ID day you can append that string to
that done and you're going to insert
that string into the div now once you
insert the string the browser is going
to show the date right so these are the
three standard steps that you would need
to do in order to show that it every
time you need to show the date we have
three steps first get the element get
the date put the data to the element
right set name does that make sense so
these are the three steps and this is
the standard javascript are the jquery
way of doing things but think about this
wouldn't it be nice if you didn't have
to do this this is a country of the
example of course but there are a lot of
use cases but you have to sprinkle some
JavaScript to get what we want out of
HTML most of the times you need this for
something that's dynamic right because
again static is all that it even can do
any dynamic you need javascript and you
have to do something like this but what
if we had something like this the
current date element I know that HTML
doesn't have it but imagine if HTML did
have it or maybe something like this
there's a div and the current date
attribute now all you need to do when
you have to show the date let's just add
that element or add that attribute and
HTML would insert the date automatically
going to be cool if you did that
wouldn't it be cool if there was a
feature in HTML which did exactly that
well turns out there isn't a feature but
wouldn't it be cool if you could extend
HTML and create this element
this is what extending HTML means and
this is what angular lets you do angular
that you create these custom elements in
the HTML and you can use functionality
you can write code to bind to those
custom elements so that every time you
use that custom element you're gonna get
that functionality that code that you
write armed to the element is going to
get executed and you have JavaScript
running on the client side right this is
a very important distinction to make
this is different from the JavaScript or
the jquery way of doing things that I
showed you before here is the JavaScript
or jQuery way of doing things
first thing you do is find an element
right find the element that you need to
modify get it from the Dom second you
run some custom logic which you need for
the data then third you update the
element right you take that custom logic
whatever is the output that it generated
and then you add that to the element
that you found in step one this is the
standard classic JavaScript where the
jQuery be and this is where it's
different with angular with angular you
need to do three steps but it's a little
bit different so here's what you need to
do first you need to create a custom
element type right you're not finding
the element you're creating or you're
declaring a custom element time you
create your own time you extend HTML
behind your own custom type and then you
define a logic that goes with that
element right you declare it and you
define it in the case of a date you
declare an element quality and you
define the logic that is coupled with
that element and now that you have this
custom element you use the element
wherever you want right so that's a
third step the good thing about this
approach is none that you've defined an
element type you can use it in multiple
places easily the logic and the element
are kind of bound together if you have a
new element that you've created and
defined called current date you have to
do the just once and then you can use
that and as many places in your HTML as
you want and every time you use that
element it's the exact same logic that
executes and it's the exact same
behavior that you negate
in a way you kind of
creating new like components that you
can use in multiple different places
hopefully that makes sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
