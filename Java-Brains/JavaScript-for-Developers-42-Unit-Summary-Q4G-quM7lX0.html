salient points of JavaScript functions
functions can be written in the literal
farm right just like you have objects
bar will be J equals and then the curly
brace actual object in line you can have
functions in line a function is a value
that can be assigned to a variable we've
already seen this you can call it by
passing in arguments and those arguments
are available to the function and now
here is a secret functions are also
objects okay the way JavaScript deals
with functions is by actually creating
an object so when you assign a function
to a variable you're actually creating
an object which happens to be a function
and you're assigning it to the variable
okay so this is the this is how
JavaScript deals with functions in the
background we talked about flexible
argument count said if you can pass more
than what's required it's ignored if you
pass less than what's required the
remaining arguments are undefined we
discussed how function overloading is
not possible because you know no matter
how many arguments you pass it's always
going to call the same function we
looked at default arguments the
arguments argument and the dis which we
didn't cover in detail but know that
it's there and then we use the arguments
argument in order to get all the
arguments to a particular function and
use it for computation now to quickly
summarize function declaration here is
an example of a simple function
declaration this is how you would
traditionally write functions as
function in function name argument list
and then the body and then you can call
it by sending arguments to that function
and get hold of the return type and we
looked at how Java Script has this other
thing called function expressions which
is you having a function and assigning
it to a variable and you can use that
variable in order to call the function
and then we looked at
anonymous function expressions where you
don't have a name in the function
expression and the function is just
referred to using the variable okay so
these are anonymous function expression
and then finally we looked at how
functions can be properties on an object
and you can call functions as properties
of the object by using the object
variable dot property and then the
parentheses to call that function</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
