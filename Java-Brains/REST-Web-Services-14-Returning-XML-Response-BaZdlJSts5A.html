message resource handler which mapped us
- messages and we returned hello world
this this URL REST API URL which returns
hello world all the time this is a
really lame REST API if you want to
enhance this to return a list of
messages that's what we're going to do
now so here's the thing if this were a
real application you probably have a
database back in right we'll have a
table for messages and then you would
have some kind of a data layer which
connects to the database and pulls up
that information right the data layer
could be something like JDBC or it could
be hibernate or whatever but we are
learning about jax-rs and building
restful api c or we don't want to waste
time writing all that code to connect to
the database and retrieve the data so
what we going to do is for this course
I'm going to stop the business service
and the data tier and I'm not going to
connect to the database establish that
connection retrieve data cards and all
that stuff right you want to focus on
learning how to build restful api is
using jack service so I'm going to
create this mock service and a mock stub
which returns it a cards which returns
an instance of message that's all we
need right we need a service which
returns a list of messages or lets you
add messages delete messages and all
that stuff so we're going to create that
mock service and we're going to focus on
the link just restful api s-- okay so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create a bunch of classes right so the
first thing I'm going to create is a
model class right we need a message
instance and what we need that are done
is a list off such message instances
right there's going to be a model object
so I'm going to create a new Java class
call message which is in single instance
of a message and put this in the model
package and I'll just have a few member
variables and get as in setters over
here
so if you remember the APA that we
designed these were the member variables
that we had in mind we're just gonna
import date so we have an ID the message
itself the date at which the message is
created and who created it I'm going to
generate getters and setters for all of
them now we have a simple model right so
this is what contains one instance of
the message let's save this now what I'm
going to need next is a service which
returns the list of messages you know
there's probably a method there which
connects to the database or whatever and
returns the list of messages we're going
to create that next so I will create a
new class called
message cells and use this in service
package and in this service class I'm
going to need a method that returns a
list off message instances right get our
messages this method should return a
list of all the messages so I could hard
code a few messages over here so what
I'm going to do is let me create a
constructor over here and this
constructor lets me create new instances
of the message class so it's taking an
ID the message and the author s
parameter and I'm just going to create
the instance right it sticks the ID the
message in the author and it just picks
the current date so this helps us create
new instances right so I'm going to say
message m1 equals new
message I've let's say one too long the
messages the world author is Kaushik and
I'm going to create one more into which
is Heidi - and I'm gonna call this hello
Jersey and the same author and I'm going
to create a new ArrayList and then
return list I hope this makes sense I'm
just creating new messages adding it to
a list and I'm just returning that list
okay and this is why I need the
Constructors I can create these messages
on the fly but whenever you creating a
constructor like this always always make
sure that you have a no op constructor
until you buy a bit later but brief
explanation is whenever you're messing
around with any XML or JSON conversion
you need unknown constructor you need a
way for those frameworks to be able to
create new instances of your class if
you wondering why we need XML or JSON
conversion well we need to return the
message as an XML or JSON in the
response right so we're going to deal
with that when we get there but always
make sure you have the snow op
constructor okay so now I have a simple
message service which just returns a
hard-coded list of messages okay so now
what do I have to do over here in the
message resource all I need to do is
create a new instance off message
service and then instead of returning
hello world I'm going to return message
service dot get all messages right the
hard-coded list is what I wanted
returned and I'm going to change this
return type to list
messages which is what this returns okay
so I hope this make sense so far just
create a model and I created a service
which returns a simple hard-coded list
of messages and in my message resourced
rather than returning that boring
hard-coded text
I'm basically making a call to a service
and returning that list of messages now
there's one more thing I want to do
right I don't want to return this as
plain text I want to return this as XML
say let's start with XML so I'm going to
do a dot there should be an application
eczema there you go so this is what I
want to return it as right so when there
is an XML and there's a get request
being made
I want these message instances which
have created over here to be returned as
XML okay let me save this and restart
the summer which what happened I was
really interesting so let me open up a
browser here and access this URL I get
an error very nice let's look at what
the editors this message body writer not
font for media application XML type read
list if you are not really sure what's
going on here basically the idea is you
have a generic type called message and
it's really not sure how to convert that
to XML okay and you know you want this
to return XML and that's where the
problem is how do you make the XML
conversion happen it's actually very
simple you just use an annotation over
here but before I talk about with the
annotation is this thing for a minute
about what does this conversion so
you're basically asking Jersey to take
this list right so Jersey execute this
method right you're basically asking
Jersey to take this list
whatever is returned and converted to
application XML the thing that actually
does this conversion is Jax B as you
know Jack's be kind of comes bundled
with Java right so you're basically
asking Jersey to say hey there's already
Jack's B which is available just use
Jack's be to convert whatever the return
type is to XML and send it to this guy
right but the problem is Jack's be kind
of needs some clues to do the conversion
the one clue that it needs is an
annotation call at XML root element if
you work with Jack's B you would know
what this annotation is right it's Java
X XML by in the annotation so basically
giving some clue to Jack's be saying
this is kind of like the root element
that you are concerned with it and this
is all it needs right Jack's B then
looks at these member variables and then
it creates XML tags out of it so I'm
going to save this and I guess the
server is getting restarted on its own
let's try that again I'm going to hit
refresh and there you go we got XML so
you have a message tag which encompasses
the response for this messages and then
you have two messages you have the first
message which is hello world with ID one
and you have the second message which is
hello jersey with ID 2 so we have made
progress so instead of a hard-coded
piece of text now we have a hard-coded
list of messages so if this were to be
an actual service it would actually make
a call to the database and get the list
of messages we're going to tweak the
service a bit to make it a bit more
flexible I'm going to use a database for
this course but you get the idea so you
have a resource which makes a call to a
service gets the return type and then
converts into application XML and thing
that helps it convert there's this XML
root element tag annotation that you
need to set to your model to help jack
speed do the conversion</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
