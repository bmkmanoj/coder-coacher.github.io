that the ad web service annotation
violet does help us write a web service
but just annotating with that single
annotation it's useful only in a very
simplistic scenario there are a lot of
scenarios where just annotating as web
service with AD web service annotation
would not be enough so in this tutorial
we're going to spend some time and try
to look at the scenarios where it would
not be enough and Bible we would need to
learn a few more things in order to
customize the way our web services turn
out so let me start with the simple
question when we write new code do we
write the interface first or the
implementation first so let's say I have
an implementation and I have an
interface and let's say I'm writing this
code to provide some kind of a logic a
business service to a client a piece of
code right so there is another piece of
code here which is actually calling my
code so now I need to write the
interface and I need to write the
implementation now which one do i do
first this the answer to this question
could depend on a lot of things well
personally for me I believe that most of
the times I end up writing the interface
first right so let's say I'm writing a
calculator program and I want to provide
add functionality to add two numbers
right so the first thing that I think
about is to write a method that adds two
numbers and returns a number right so
what I'm thinking of there is the
interface I'm thinking of a method I'm
thinking of the two input arguments
which is the two numbers and I'm
thinking of the output the return type
which is again an argument so most of
the times I personally would write the
interface first and then I would write
the implementation the advantage of
doing this is that I first solidify my
idea of the interface right I fix this I
say this is what the interface is going
to be this is what the method name is
this is what the return type is in these
are
what the input arguments are right the
reason for locking this down right the
reason for fixing what the interface is
going to be is that I can change the
implementation the way I want
but since the interface is fixed the
client code does not have to change
every time I change the implementation
so I have a fixed interface and I have a
fixed piece of client code and I change
the implementation however I want right
so this is one of the advantage of
writing the interface first or even if
you don't write the interface first this
is the advantage of fixing what the
interface is going to be locking down
what the interface is going to be okay
so having said this let's look at what
the interfaces in the webservice
technology right so in the webservice
technology so you have a web service
implementation what is the interface
here the interfaces like we discussed
the Vistal right so the client code
refers to the visu to find out what the
web service is providing so to make
calls to the web service implementation
it actually accesses through the Vistal
so it uses the vestal to find out what
are the input arguments was the method
name order the return type ssin of that
so to follow the same argument just like
we lock down the interface here it makes
sense to lock down the vista right you
say this is the vista and then you lock
it down you're not going to make changes
to it so the advantage of locking down
the misc dollars irrespective of how
many ever clients you have let's say you
have like a hundred different lines that
are referring to this blister and making
a call to your web service since you're
not going to be changing the Vistal the
clients do not have to change right so
they have no changes that they need to
do and you can change the web service
implementation the way you want okay
this all sounds good
but here's a problem when we do the add
web service and
right when we take a web service
implementation class and we do the Hat
web service annotation so we annotate
this class with that web service now
what's happening is the Vistal is
actually getting generated after your
web service implementation so we
actually going the other way around we
are not writing the interface first
we're writing the implementation first
and we are actually auto-generating the
interface right this could be a problem
because now let's say I want to change
my web service right so I make a change
to the code I make a change to a method
let's say there is a new naming
convention that I want to follow so I
change the names of all my methods
now when I'd apply this web service what
ends up happening is this Vistal will
get changed now if I have a hundred
different clients who are making a call
to this Vistal any change that I do is
going to impact all these different
clients which is a problem now I want to
make changes to the implementation class
I want to be able to freely make changes
to the implementation class but I want
to fix down the Vista right I want to
lock down the Vista I don't want the
Vistal to change now how can we do this
we know that the wisdom is
auto-generated there are a whole lot of
default behaviors that are happening so
the name of the implementation is same
as the name of the operation the name of
the web service class is same as the
name of the service itself and all that
stuff which is good it does a lot of
work for us it saves a lot of work that
we would have to do but then it wouldn't
work if I make changes to the web
service itself right so this would
automatically make changes to the vessel
which is a bad thing so with that said
is there a way to reverse the process
now instead of generating the vessel
from our Java class file is there a way
we can write the vessel first and then
give the class later
so essentially I want to first write the
wisdom and then from the vista generate
the server simple of course when I say
generating the server simple this will
obviously not generate the business
logic will have to write the business
logic but then is there a way we can get
the Java class later
the idea is to write the visit of first
the advantage of this process is again
you just like to write the interface
first we write the contract first we
write the vessel first and this doesn't
change and we find a way to do things
the other way right we find a way to
write to generate the service until
later and then we can modify the service
simple without having to modify the
wisdom so this leads to what's
traditionally two different ways in
which we write web services so the first
way is called the service first and the
second way is called the contract first
so these are the two ways in which you
can write web services the service first
essentially means you write the service
first and then generate the Vistal this
is what we've been doing all along and
the second approach is called the
contract first in which we write the
little first and then write the service
implementation so we write the XML right
so the whistles that we've seen
generated automatically is what we would
write first right we would write the XML
file and then we would generate the
business service out of it right so both
these approaches are very much in use
and each approach has certain uses
certain advantages and disadvantages and
you would choose an approach depending
on this scenario you're working on the
service first approach is ideal for
learning web services and that's what
we've been using all along because we're
learning web services so we write the
Java class first and then let the raziel
get generated automatically
but then the contract first is something
you would use in a real world production
scenario where you know that there are
like lots of people who are going to use
our web service and you want to fix down
you want to lock down the Vistal so you
write the visual first
share it with all the consumers and then
you write the service implementation
afterwards and you can change the
service implementation without having to
change the Vista okay
so this is a we're going to cover both
these approaches in more detail later
but for now just note that there are two
different approaches you can take and to
write web services of any significance
using either of these approaches
especially in the second approach where
we do a contract first where we write
the wisdom first we'll obviously need to
unsend the Vista we'll need to know all
the XML that's going on there in the
vestal file we need not know all the
individual details but at least the
basic elements of the vessel needs to be
understood so we're going to take a look
at that in the next tutorial we're going
to open up the vessel that's been
auto-generated for us for our test mat
application and we'll try to understand
some of the basics of what's going on
