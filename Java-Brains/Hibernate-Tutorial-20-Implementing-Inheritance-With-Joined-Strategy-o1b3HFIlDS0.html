inheritance so far the first one was the
single table strategy where all the
objects were saved in a single table the
second was the table per class strategy
where every class had its own table now
the first strategy the single table
strategy was the least normalized
because all the columns of all the
classes went into a single table and
there were many columns where the data
was not applicable and it would carry
null for most of the records now the
second strategy is slightly more
normalized because we have a separate
table per class so there is no column
which is a quote-unquote not applicable
for a particular record so this is
slightly better but then if you have a
look at this if you look at the tables
here let's say a query of four wheeler
now the four wheeler has the vehicle ID
and the vehicle name now the two wheeler
also has a vehicle ID and a vehicle name
that's because they have these columns
inherited from the vehicle which of
course has the vehicle ID in the vehicle
name so these are columns that are
repeating across different tables so
there is a way you can make this design
slightly more better of course it's a
relative term depends on the necessity
but this is another way we can do this
and this is by looking at the third type
of inheritance strategy and that is by
using this one the joined inheritance
strategy so again there's nothing else
that we need to do here I'll just leave
this so as long as you have all the
three classes marked as entities and you
have the inheritance type as a main
inheritance strategy mentioned as
inheritance type tour join you're all
set so let's let's run this class I came
to recap I have three objects of liquor
two wheeler and the four-wheeler and I'm
saving all the three of them so let's
see how hibernate creates the tables and
persons these records okay
so let's just look at the database so
that it's more clear
okay now have a look at this the vehicle
table has the vehicle ID and the vehicle
name which is same as earlier but
interestingly it has data for the two
wheeler and the four wheeler as well
note that we had declared bike as a two
wheeler it was it was an extension of
the vehicle class apart it was a
separate class but what's happening here
is the bike which is a two wheeler is
also inserted into the vehicle table the
Posche which was a four wheeler is also
inserted to the vehicle table now what
does the two wheeler contain so the two
wheeler has the vehicle ID and it has
the property that are specific to the
two wheeler which is the the steering
handle now the same way the four wheeler
has the vehicle ID and the property
that's specific to the four wheeler
which was a steering wheel so what's
happening here is we are looking more at
a join strategy so in order to get all
information from the four wheeler I need
to look at the vehicle as well as the
four wheeler table in order to get all
information from the two wheeler I need
to look at the vehicle and the two
wheeler table so in order to pull up our
other information for the four wheelers
a so all I need to do is I need to do a
select start from take a join four
wheeler on vehicle dot I think it is
vehicle ID but let's verify that
okay it's vehicle ID on vehicle or
vehicle ID equals four-wheeler dot
vehicle ID now here you can see it's
pulling up all the information that we
need so this is the complete information
of the four-wheeler so I have a bit of
information in vehicle and I have the
rest of the information in the
four-wheeler table so what's happening
here is it's in a much more normalized
form than the table per class strategy
we've seen earlier so the data that has
been inherited from the vehicle table
does not go into the child tables it
remains in the parent table so the
vehicle ID and the vehicle name are
going to be in the vehicle table no
matter what the type of object is so the
bike the two-wheeler object the
four-wheeler object since they are
inheriting from the same columns the
data goes to the vehicle table itself
and the way you can extract the data is
by doing a joint now the you know the
the child class specific columns the
child flash specific properties I'm
going to go to the child class tables
now for example say I have a few other
columns defined here so let's say I have
a you know a couple of other string or
integer columns I'm in properties to
find here then what would happen is it
would go to the tabular table so I would
have a I would have more columns here
but then I would have just one reference
to the vehicle ID this would be a
foreign key I would have just one
reference to the vehicle table and all
the you know the columns that all the
properties that have been inherited from
the parent class would go as you know
columns over here so no matter what the
object type there would be a record
which would have all the inherited
values so I hope the difference is clear
now we have three strategies one is the
single table strategy which puts
everything into one table then we have
the table per class strategy which
creates a separate table for each and
every class but then it duplicates the
properties of the parent class that has
been inherited now so if five classes
inherit from the same parent class so
all the properties of the parent class
will be duplicated to each of those five
tables but in this strategy which is the
joint strategy what's happening is
whatever properties are being inherited
from the parent class they will remain
in the parent table so the parent table
will have the core properties which is
inherited by each of the child classes
and the child classes will have tables
for itself so it is doing a table for
each class but then it has only the
properties which are specific to the
child class and all the inherited values
will remain in the parent class and we
will have to do a join in order to get
all the data so that's the reason why
it's called a joint strategy so this
these are the three options we have and
you can choose what kind of inheritance
strategy you want in your design
depending on the need</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
