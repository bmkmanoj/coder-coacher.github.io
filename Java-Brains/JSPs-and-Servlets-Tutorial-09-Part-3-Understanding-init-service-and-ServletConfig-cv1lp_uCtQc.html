telemeter has city cookies in a mess
it's a perfect questions the
this is
description okay so now we got sending
this in a contest I hear me advantage of
listeners and figuring this front and
this can be used no matter whatever the
value of the request for that particular
matter
save this
okay now let's go fishing
okay so this parameter is not been a
fascinating decision parameter values
because we haven't set it there what
extra meter is not affected we have in
fact what we use the first execution
onwards you will see the value is what
we have set
so this is the way you contribute in the
parameters in annotations can also do
that using you can also do that enough
excellent application you say we were
using the connection to configure the
server that it should be a servlet
application so when you mainly define
the self if you give it a name inside
the submitting the X of the name and
separate class unity success so along
with that inside the same subject now we
do have an inner parent node and inside
that we have a panel name which is the
name of the parameter and the bottom
value which is it right so I can have as
many parameters as I want
but again this is title a servlet and
when the separate series method runs
this is passed as a servlet perfect to
move a init method and then it's saved
inside remember we live inside the class
who are just can't really access it
whenever we want and became used to run
in a quick somebody up in it takes us of
the conflict parameter this is available
the generic sublet implementation you
can add consolidation code by overriding
the unit inside your class to make sure
that you're overriding the image which
takes the subtlety parameter make sure
that you are setting this up like a
chemical engineer such perfect memory
this is a pulse of the computation so
whatever value is specified is
applicable only for that sub if the
advantages no matter where in the code
you are using you do not use it will be
availabe because you know that when you
are just initialize which is set in the
config number will use the vectors of
the class and that we saw we can
configure the parameter we were using
annotations or embed products in so we
have specified is responding that if
that's in irritation switches in a
parameter and then ethany parameters or
correction will be happy name and the
current value and then finally we also
saw that there is another init method
without any input parameters that we can
use for overriding so if we are wearing
the in it we don't have to set the
member variable as the inputs of their
config parameter that we would have to
do if you are overriding the other one
which actually takes the servlet config
parameter so if it will be overriding
the inner it spit it over at this one so
that the servlet config parameter is
already accepted by the previous method
which takes that as a parameter and then
it sets it as a member variable so in
our init method that we were right the
servlet config will be available in the
member variable and we can use that in
the init method itself then we also had
a look at the service method the service
method is overridden at the HTTP servlet
for our HTTP purposes and the whole role
of the service method is to analyze the
input request that it's getting and
check what kind of HTTP request it is is
it a get request or a put request or a
delete or a post or whatever so
depending on the request it calls the
corresponding method which is the do
gate or the do post and so on to handle
that request so we do have an
implementation of this service method in
the generic sublet itself but sin
generic sublet is not specifically
concerned about the HTTP protocol it
deals with a generic request and a
response but then in the HTTP servlet it
overrides this method and then cast
those requests and response to
httpservletrequest and
httpservletresponse and calls the
corresponding do get order to post
method with these parameters which is
the httpservletrequest and the
httpservletresponse so that when we
override those do get and do post
methods we have those HTTP requests and
response objects as parameters so yes it
decides which method to be called and if
we do not override that particular
method in ourselves that's then the HTTP
servlet has got to throw an unsupported
exception so that you know we get an
error saying this method has not been
implemented in the Sublette itself so
this covers the first set of tutorials
on servlet in our next tutorials we are
going to start looking at J's piece and
the reason why we look at sub let's
first before we try to learn J's piece
is that there is you know an
understanding of servlets is required to
understand J espy's and most of J's
piece actually eventually translates to
servlet understanding anyway so thanks
for watching and see you in the next
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
