resource you arise both instances and
collection let's work on the operations
that can be performed and the data
that's exchanged we saw that URI like
get messages dot do question mark ID
equals ten as action based and it's not
restful we chose your eyes slash
messages slash ten to replace that URI
this is resource based and restful and
all that good stuff but here's the
problem look at the URI get messages dot
do question mark ID equals ten it has
three pieces of information in it one it
refers to messages - it refers to the ID
ten and three it gets that information
as mentioned in the get messages snippet
of the URI now look at the URI slash
messages last time that we have chosen
to replace this with but it definitely
has the information about the resource
it we know that it refers to messages
and we also know that it refers to ID 10
but this URI doesn't have the third
piece of information it doesn't have the
information that it's actually getting
the message ID ten you could argue that
accessing this URI gets the message
right accessing slash messages slash ten
gets the message ID ten but what about
the other operations we've just looked
at getting the data so far you could
have your eyes that submit the data
imagine or URI like post messages dot do
question mark ID equals ten now what
would be the restful URI equivalent for
this well it would still be slash
messages slash ten now how about
deleting a message let's say the rock
there's a URI delete message dot do
question mark ID equals ten what would
be the restful URI to land for this well
it would still be slash messages slash
ten how is that possible how can the
same URI do all these different
operations and how does it know when to
do what
the answer is using HTTP methods if you
want your API client to perform
different
operations on message-id 10 just have
them use different HTTP methods on the
same URI slash messages slash them the
most common HTTP methods are get post
put and delete there are some other
methods which are a bit rarely used like
head and options but for the most part
we'll focus on these four common HTTP
methods in this course these HTTP
methods have specific meanings and
typically you use the right method for
the right operation also when using HTTP
when you're browsing the web you are
actually using these methods in
automatically without your knowledge if
you type in a URL in a browser you're
actually doing a get request for that
URL so you have a page where there is a
HTML form and you submit the form it's
very likely that the page is actually
doing a post so these methods are
intrinsic they are already there in HTTP
you just have to use a write method for
the right job so for example in the rest
world you don't make a call to get
products you make a get request to the
products resource URI
you don't call delete order you make a
delete request to the order resource URI
I hope you get the idea the URI tells
you what entity or resource is being
operated upon and the method tells you
what their operations so let's look at
some scenarios in our messenger
application let's look at getting a
message this should be obvious now we
know what the resource URI for a
particular messages so to get the
message just do a get request for that
URI so a get four slash messages slash
20 returns you message ID 20 now let's
look at updating a message let's say our
social media application lets you make
changes to the messages that are already
submitted what would be the right method
for submitting the sub dated message is
it the post you know that post is a way
to send data to the server
well this one's not all that obvious you
can use poast
and I know some people do that but the
standard practice is to use the put
method why put and not post there is a
very important difference between the
two and I'll talk about that a bit later
but for now remember that we'll be using
put to update or change any resource of
course you will want the resource to be
updated with something the new content
so that content needs to be sent in the
body of the put request for example a
put request on slash messages last 20
but the request body being the content
of the new message is going to replace
message ID 20 with this new message
content now let's look at deleting a
message this one should be easy yes
there is a delete method and that's what
you need to use here so when you want
the clients to delete a particular
resource just have them issue a delete
request to that resource URI and no
request body is required here because
you're not sending any new content so a
delete request far slash messages slash
20 deletes message ID money now finally
let's look at creating a new message
this one's interesting before we talk
about the method to use let's think
about what the URI is to create a new
message so we've looked at getting a
message updating a message and deleting
a message and for all these three
operations the resource URI was the
message resource URI is right / messages
/ message ID so you get a specific
message ID you update a message with a
particular ID or you delete a message
with a particular item now how about
creating a new message the message
hasn't been created yet so there's no
message ID and the ID is typically
managed by the application it basically
finds the next available message ID and
allocates it so the client really has no
idea what the ID will be this is why
requests for creating a new resource as
always issued to the collection URI for
that resource so to create a new
which you make a request to slash
messages because you really don't have
the message ID so it's usually the
collection you are similarly to create a
new profile a request is made to slash
profiles the application receives this
request and then creates a new resource
new instance and then assigns an ID to
it okay with that settle
what's the HTTP method for creating new
resources the practice is to use the
post method the post body should contain
the content of the new resource once a
resource is created the server will need
to let the client know what that idea is
because unless the client knows the ID
the kind really cannot do anything we
cannot do a get they cannot do an update
or a delete right all those requests
need an ID so when a post happens on a
collection URI the server creates a new
resource and then the response is going
to be the resource ID so a post request
on slash messages for the request body
containing the new message is going to
create a new message on the server and
then the response is going to contain
the message ID of the newly created
message now let's look at collection URI
scenarios you will appreciate the
elegance and aural awesomeness of this
URL design when you realize how
seamlessly these concepts translate to
collection you arise now imagine what
happens when you make a get request to a
collection URI like slash messages it's
obvious you get all the messages
otherwise CTP methods work the same way
- let's look at some examples a delete
request to slash messages / 10/10 days
all the comments associated with message
10 a get request on slash messages / 10
slash comments this is going to get all
the comments for message ID 10 write
post works the same way - so a post
request on slash messages / 10 slash
creates a new comment for message ID 10
the request body of course containing
the new
I'm an information button delete work
the same way to so for example up put on
slash messages slash 20 slash comments
is going to replace the entire list of
comments for message ID 20 with this new
list of comments in the request party
okay
similarly a delete request on a
collection URI is going to delete the
whole list so a delete on slash messages
is going to delete all the messages a
note though this put requests on a
collection and a delete request on a
collection like slash messages is not
very common you won't want the client to
be able to date every message in the
system by showing a delete request on
slash messages but if you need to do
this this is the way to do it and there
you go we have identified standard HTTP
methods for all the crud operations
whenever you need to provide api's for
creating deleting fetching or updating a
resource you now know what methods to
choose for them this of course doesn't
address all the operations right very
rarely do you have web applications that
just perform crud operations now what if
you need to provide an API to archive a
message or run a server-side job there
is no crud equivalent for this so how
can we map the get put post and delete
methods on these miscellaneous
operations the factors these methods
don't really map to credit operations it
looks like that with the examples that
we've seen but there's actually more to
it we'll talk about this in a later
tutorial so hold on to that thought for
a bit but for now I hope you have a
clear idea of what the basic usages of
these methods are in the exercises you
can practice some more on these HTTP
methods along with the collection and
instance resource you are eyes and I'll
see you in the next video thanks for
