we're going to be learning all about the
a CDP service and how to make REST API
calls to a rest endpoint using angular
we've looked at services in considerable
detail in the last unit and we created a
couple of services ourselves but what's
also important to note is that angular
comes with some services out of the box
there are some services which are
convenience services which help us do
some common action like logging and one
of those services is the dollar HTTP
service right so the name of the
services dollar HTTP and dollar again is
a convention that angular framework
follows to let you know that that's
something that angular provides out of
the box versus a service that a
developer might have created on their
own so the dollar HTTP service lets you
make REST API calls to an external
endpoint the API could be a get request
a post request a put or a delete all of
the common HTTP verbs are accommodated
in this service in order to use the
service you have to use the same
dependency injection that we are
familiar with now but you don't have to
create that service that's provided out
of the box for you so this unit is going
to be about us using the service in
order to make the REST API calls but in
order to do this in order to make these
calls we need to have a REST API to
begin with right we are not going to be
spending a lot of time in creating this
REST API what are we going to do instead
is set up the JSON server do we act as a
fake dressed API we install the JSON
server program at the beginning of unit
1 and the purpose of this program is to
act as a fake REST API that's using the
JSON file as the backing so what we
going to do is in the contact tab I'm
going to create a separate directory
called data and this is going to contain
the data that JSON server needs in order
to run this fake REST API so I'm gonna
open the command prompt here kill the
HTTP server that's running right now and
switch to the data directory now in the
data directory I'm gonna run JSON
server I have not specified which JSON
file it needs to read from so it's gonna
complain and throw me an error so the
error it say is that I need to have
something like this I need to have a DB
dart JSON there has to be a file there
and the JSON server is going to use that
to publish a REST API
so let me go ahead and do just that I'm
going to create a file called DB dot
JSON now if this debate or JSON needs to
have a particular structure so that the
JSON server knows what the rest api it
creates should be so now let me go ahead
and create this file DB dot JSON so the
structure of the media JSON is
essentially an object as with all JSON
files but this object is going to have
properties for each endpoint in our case
we are looking at contacts so I'm going
to have a contacts property here and the
value of the contacts property
essentially needs to be this array that
lists all the individual contacts and we
are already familiar with this this is
the array of individual contacts that we
already have in the app a contact data
service sorry so I'm going to copy this
whole array this whole thing and I'm
gonna put this in DB dot JSON there's
gonna be the array and remove the
semicolon because this is a JSON file so
with this what I've created is an actual
endpoint four slash contacts which is
going to list all these individual items
over here now the one thing that I'm
gonna have to add to each of these items
is an ID field right now I don't have an
ID field here well there is one ID but
it's it's not a unique value right it's
just an object so and what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna take this Heidi and I'm
gonna find all the IDS here and instead
of having it be an object I'm going to
have it be a number right I'm gonna have
ID one here and then here I'm gonna ID 2
ready threesome giving each object a
unique Heidi we have to lightly ten so
now given each one an idea this is a
requirement far the JSON server so now
that I have this data I can tell JSON
server to use this file to create a REST
API endpoint so I'm going to ask this
JSON server to run to the same command
but now I'm gonna pass in the JSON file
DB dot JSON and now JSON server runs
exposing our endpoint contacts as a
resource now I can open this in a
browser and access this URL and you see
here it's going to give me this JSON
payload which contains all the contacts
now the advantage of using this JSON
server is it actually break this down
into an API like structure so let's say
I want the first contact I can just say
slash one and it's just gonna give me
the first user I can say / - and it's
gonna give me the second user what's
really really cool about this is I can
actually make post requests to slash
contacts and right now if I do a get
it's gonna get me all the users but if I
were to make a post request to slash
contacts but the post body containing a
new contact is actually gonna persist it
it's gonna save it into db2 JSON so it
pretty much works like a full-fledged
REST API which is really cool and we
were able to do this but very little
effort it's just creating this JSON file
and running running the JSON server
program pointing to this JSON file so
this is JSON server and we're gonna be
running this in parallel throughout this
unit and then we need to make a REST API
call we're gonna be making a call to the
same point which is localhost cone 3000
slash contacts in a real world scenario
this URL is probably going to be
something else maybe a different machine
or a different server but the result is
the same we're gonna be making get and
put in post requests to that endpoint it
really doesn't matter if it's on your
machine or somewhere else as far as
angular is concerned it's just a
different API
so make sure you have this set up and
running and read in the next video we're
gonna be actually looking at the data
HTTP service and we're gonna begin our
journey of making REST API calls with
angularjs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
