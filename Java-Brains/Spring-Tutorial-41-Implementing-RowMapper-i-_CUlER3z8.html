at different objects that we could
return using the query for object method
of the JDBC template so we were trying
to return a circle module object by
running this query which is a select
star from circle and we pass a
particular ID so we stopped at one
particular point which is in the query
for object method the first and second
parameters happen to be the sequel query
and the method place the placeholders in
that query the last argument is
something called as a row mapper so we
need to implement a row mapper class
that has a callback method that map's
all these different values in your
result set to an object so we'll
implement that in this tutorial so the
class can be an inner class because I
intend to use that mapping class only in
my dao method which is fair enough
because usually in your code you would
have do methods based on models so if
you have a circle model you would have
one particular do class which has all
the methods that operate on the circle
model so get circle get circle for ID
gets a good name for ID so all the
methods related to the circle would
probably be inside one tu class so it
would make sense to have an inner class
for that Diego class we look at some
other approaches later but for now I'll
write up in a class we'll have a private
again since it's going to be used only
here I'll use a private I'll make it a
static which is the best practice I can
make it a final as well which is the
best practice call the class as circle
mapper now the circle mapper has to be a
row mapper so it implements a row mapper
of cerca
I'll have to import the raw mapper from
this one or explained framework JDBC
core ok so inside this one if I
implement row mapper
I will have to implement one particular
method which is the callback method so
let me implement that this is the one
it's a map row of the map row returns
the type which I've defined for the row
mapper it's a circle and now it takes in
two arguments the first argument is a
result set the second argument is an
integer now what are these two arguments
the first argument results set this is
the result set that the JDBC template
gets after querying after running this
particular query now here's the thing we
are providing logic for mapping right so
now the JDBC template runs the query
that we pass and now the JDBC template
has a result set with it if it were a
simple data type we see as we saw
earlier it knows what to do if it's an
integer it knows what to do if it's a
string it knows what to do but now it's
got a circle it doesn't really know what
to do so we need to instruct the JDBC
template about what needs to be done
when a result set is acquired so the
first thing that we need to take as the
result set I'll call this result set and
then the second argument that it needs
to take is the position in the result
set
it is the row number in the result set
we'll call this row num now what happens
is depending on the number of records
that the results it has this map row is
called that many number of times now a
select star could return depending on
the number of records it could return
one record it could return ten records
you really do not know so what we need
to do is we it we need to pass the class
that has a mapper implementation and the
JDBC template is going to
all this map row for every record that
it finds in the result set so it's going
to pass these two parameters result set
as well as the row number so if there
are ten record results in the result set
it's going to call this ten times result
set is going to be the same every time
within the row number is going to change
it's going to go from one to ten and
what the JDBC template expects is it
expects us to take this result set and
return an initialized circle object so
that's what we're going to do over here
so I'm going to remove this I'm going to
create a new circle object and then I'm
going to initialize it so let's see
Circle dot set ID the ID would be the
result set dot get int and the column
name is heidi similarly set name would
be a get string for the result set and I
would pass the column name which is name
and now I have a phony Felicia lized
circle I will return circle okay so I
guess I do not have this constructor and
the circles will decide that okay we are
done so now I have initialized a circle
object with the values in the result set
that I've got over here now notice that
I'm not using the row num you would use
the rhone um it won't some different
behavior depending on
the actual roll number but in our case
I'm just creating a circle object for
every row so I don't really bother about
the rona so this is the method that's
going to get called for every record in
the result set that the JDBC template
gets when it executes the sequel query
that we have passed over here so now
that I have the circle mapper
which is the raw mapper I can pass this
circle mapper over here so I will say
new circle mapping and now all that's
left us the circle that it's getting has
to be returned so I'll just use wrote on
here so it's going to return the
instance of circle now let's save this
and let's try executing that so I will
say do dot get circle for ID plus the
value of 1 dot get name so I'm printing
out the name of the circle object that
I'm getting over here so let's save and
run this there you go the name is
printed so again what's happening is I'm
passing the logic for mapping a record
of the result set to an object and
returning the object and this is the
callback method of the class that I'm
passing now JDBC template does not
really know how to map so what it
assumes is the third parameter that we
are passing has to be a row mapper of
course so what it assumes is the map row
method of this third parameter will
contain the mapping method so all that
the JDBC template does is it blindly
calls the map row method of this third
parameter every time it sees a result
record in the result set so it's going
to call that method for every row in the
result set so this is how the custom
mapping works so we'll try out one more
thing
over here we will try generating a list
so in the case of the list what will
happen is this method will get executed
for every record in the result set now
here we know it's going to get executed
just once so we are just returning the
object itself but in the case of a list
we need to call a different method over
here but it's going to be the same with
the same concept so let's try the router
let's see public
let's see list of circle and get all
circles okay so it's going to return all
the circles in the database so the
string sequel this is going to be
select star from circle that's it no ID
where class so what we need to use is
the JDBC template dot I'll use query so
there is just this query which has the
similar functionality that we've seen
see we have a string sequel object
arguments and the row mapper so this is
what we're going to use so we will pass
the sequel as the first parameter we do
not have any arguments over here it's
just a select star from circle if we had
arguments we would have to pass that but
in this case we're going to skip it and
the second argument the final argument
will be the row mapper we can use the
same row mapper that we have used
earlier so it's going to be a new circle
mapper that's it so now this is going to
return me a list so I will return
the output of this query and now this
query method knows that this circle
mapper actually it's a it's a list of
sever because the result is the circle
so this is gonna return a list of circle
so I will have to import list from Java
ryuuta and this is it so this is all it
takes to run a query that returns a list
now let's execute that and I will call
this method get all the circles I'll
just print out the count here so I don't
have to type in the loop get all circles
size just print of the size it should I
delete it on me a value one and it does
I've got the value one I'm getting the
list from this method so in this
tutorial we've looked at a couple of
ways in which we can use the JDBC
template to return a custom object one
is returning the object itself directly
our own model object the second thing is
returning a list of our model objects so
both these are accomplished by creating
our own implementation of the row mapper
so we have created a circle mapper which
is in a class which was our own
implementation of the row mapper all
they had to do was implement a
particular method called map row and we
take in a result set and for each record
will return the fully initialized model
object so we're doing it for just one
record and we'll let the JDBC template
call this method for as many number of
records as required depending on the
result of the query so we don't have to
worry about managing the list we don't
have to worry about all those other
things all we need to do is for one
particular record in the result set
we need to create a model object so this
is all it takes and then we pass this
rrrow mapper into each of our methods be
it away for object or be it just a
generic query and then you know the JDBC
template is going to take care of
everything else we just return the
output of the result of this method and
then we are done so this completes some
of the concepts that we need to
understand to fetch data so this is no
longer required now this huge method is
no longer required JDBC template is
going to take care of all the
intricacies and our do methods become
such short and simple lines of code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
