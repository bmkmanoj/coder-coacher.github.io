you need to build angular applications
the obvious question is how does this
work we have essentially teaching the
browser new tricks the browser has a
very limited set of vocabulary which is
what the HTML spec covers right whatever
is in the HTML spec browsers typically
do it but now we are talking about
creating our own HTML element our own
custom HTML spec how does it browser
know what to do with it right so here's
how the here's how things work in an
angular application this is how the
browser learns these new tricks so the
first thing you need to do in an in in
any angular application is of pushing
tab and HTML right so you write your
HTML and then you need to add this new
layer of functionality to it right the
way you do this is by first adding the
angularjs script angular is available as
a downloadable JavaScript file you can
go to angularjs regard and download the
file or you can link it to a location of
the CDN where the file hosted but that's
the way first step you need to add the
angularjs script into your HTML file if
you don't do that then the browser
really wouldn't know what to do with
your custom HTML elements right Roger
just knows the standard HTML syntax so
you create your next UML you add the
angularjs script so now angular is
available on your page the next thing
you need to do is to create your custom
directives or components in the case of
the current date example you're going to
create your current date element because
it's not available yet right the browser
doesn't know so you're going to create
your current data element and then
define the logic for it in this case the
logic would be show the current date it
should be get the current date and then
display it right you're going to define
this logic right to declare the element
and define the logics we create all
these custom elements as many as you
want create them and then the final step
is to actually use those elements in
your HTML right you can have you've
declared the elements and you've defined
the implementation for it now we can
actually use it in your HTML so there
are a couple of steps that happen here
you create your directives when you
create your components you're basically
using an angular API to define the
behavior for it you're basically saying
hey angular these are the custom
elements that I need now for each
element this is the HTML and this is the
behavior now go register them right
that's the imperative step and then you
use the directives which is the
declarative step I mean you use the
directives angular is going to say hey I
see this custom element I know you had
defined this before this is the behavior
and I'm going to go implement that be
executed be and this is how you create
these custom components actually use
them all right so this is like the basic
process for creating an angular
application using them if these are not
very clear just wait for a little bit we
actually going to create an angular app
and it will make more sense what angular
also comes with is some custom inbuilt
elements write angular comes with its
own directives that you can actually go
and use the minute you include the
angular script your HTML page you don't
have to create those custom directives
yourself you can if you want but I
neither comes with its own derivatives
that you can actually start using
without creating your own custom
elements the minute you add your angular
script in your page all those custom
directives that comes out of the box
with angular will be available to you
all right so now let's set up an
angularjs application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
