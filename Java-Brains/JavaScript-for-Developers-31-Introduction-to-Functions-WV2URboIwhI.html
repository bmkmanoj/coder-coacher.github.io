welcome to this unit titled functions in
this unit we will try and understand
what JavaScript functions are and how we
can use them at the basic level a
function in JavaScript is very similar
to functions in other programming
languages function is basically a piece
of code write a few statement or even
one statement which is isolated out into
a separate thing that can be called by
other pieces of code right so there are
ways in which you can pass arguments to
the function and have the function do
things with those arguments and perhaps
give a return value back this concept is
more or less the same but there are
certain new answers which kind of take a
turn things are a bit different later
but for the basic part let's look at the
way we traditionally think of functions
as a way to bundle logic that can be
reused so I'm going to start by creating
a simple function called say hello which
prints something to the console the way
to create it is using the function
keyword so I type function and then I
give the function name say hello and
then the open closed parentheses
indicate that this is a function and
then the open closed curly braces
indicate the body of that function so in
the body I can add code which is going
to be a part of the function which
executes when the function is called and
executed so here I'm going to print a
simple console dot log hello right very
simple function which contains one line
of code which prints something to the
console and now if the way to execute
the function is by using the name of the
function with the same open close braces
okay and if I were parenthesis I'm sorry
if I were to execute this reload and run
you see Hello being printed so I'm
declaring a function and I'm calling it
using its name alright
now this is what results in the hollow
being printed over here when the
JavaScript interpreter runs it executes
line 1 and says ok there is a function
declaration it registers this function
but it does not print anything to the
console the execution comes all the way
to line 6 and this is where the function
is called and that's where the control
jumps back to line 2 and prints the
value to the console again this is
simple function concepts which is you
know kind of common across multiple
programming languages this shouldn't be
much of a surprise to you guys
alright so functions can also take in
arguments like I said if I were to say
hello to a person and I want the
person's name to be passed in as an
argument I can declare the function as
something that accepts arguments and
then then the argument is passed I can
use that argument in my logic so the way
the way to create and declare an
argument to the function is typically in
even in other programming languages it
is when you write something here between
these parentheses which indicate what
your parameters for the function are
going to be the C++ Java they all have
the same concept so typically in those
languages what you would do is you give
the datatype and the variable name which
is going to contain the value that
somebody who is calling it would have
passed so it would be something like int
a and then float B and all that stuff
but in JavaScript we don't have these
kind of typed variables right everything
is a war so you don't have int and float
and double and all that so rather than
have var a and then war be the language
designer start by simply add war just
skip it so you don't have to declare the
type or even declare it as a water you
just send the list of arguments as you
know a list of variables comma separated
and those get the right values so in
this case I just want to take one value
which is the name so I'm just going to
say name ok so no wire name no string
name just name
now that now that I have name here I can
say hello to that person so I'm just
going to use the string concatenation
here and then I say hello name and now
if I were to call this function with a
name value which is again sending the
actual value in the parentheses let's
say I want to say hello to myself now I
can right click and run and it is going
to say other Kaushik because kochak is
the value the string value that is sent
to the function when the function
executes name is going to be a variable
which contains a value which is the
string caution so this is how you send
parameters to functions you can have
multiple parameters as well the way to
send multiple parameters is again using
comma separated values here and then you
know you can say multiple parameters
over here and then you can accept the
right parameters over here again comma
separated so let's let me add one more
argument and I will show you some weird
thing that JavaScript does for now
everything is more or less it makes
sense right I hope it does so let me add
one more parameter which is let's say
time of day okay and I'm just going to
print that here
I'm just accepting another argument and
then printing the message time of day is
and then just print that value so let's
say I add time of day as another string
here let's say afternoon and if I
execute this it gets both those values
and prints them both again there
shouldn't be much of a surprise all I'm
doing is sending two arguments and then
I'm using those arguments in a single
console that log</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
