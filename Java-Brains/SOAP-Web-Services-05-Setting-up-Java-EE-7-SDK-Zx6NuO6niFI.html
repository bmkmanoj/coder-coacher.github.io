download and install the Java EE SDK in
our development environment so I am
recording this from my Linux laptop they
have JDK setup but we are going to be
downloading and installing Java EE SDK
before we start there are a couple of
checks that will have to do to make sure
JDK is fine so the first thing I'm going
to do is go to the command prompt and
type Java - version so what I'm doing
here is I'm checking if Java is in the
path and I'm also checking the version
of the JDK so I need to have jdk 1.7 to
actually install java ee 7 so make sure
you have jdk 1.7 if you have 1.6 or
lower make sure you download and install
the latest jdk after you do this also
make sure that your java home is set so
i do echo java home so Java home should
be pointing to the jdk 1.7 directory
right so this is the same procedure you
know even in different operating systems
on Windows or Mac make sure that these
two are fine
once you have checked for these two we
are all set to install Java EE SDK so we
can go to the Oracle website and
navigate to
the Java Enterprise Edition download so
go to the Downloads tab and you can
choose this one Java e7 SDK I accept the
License Agreement here so I'm going to
download the installer for Linux so
depending on your operating system
choose the file that you need to
download let's save this and wait for
the download to complete once the
download is complete we are all set to
run the Installer in Linux an additional
step that we'll have to do is make this
an executable file because by default
when you download something it will not
be executable so go to permissions and
choose L of executing as a program right
so we are setting the attribute to make
it an executable so now I'm going to run
the Installer results which to my
downloads directory and start the
Installer and we see a wizard so I go
for a typical installation now it's
asking you to choose the directory where
the GlassFish server will be installed
now GlassFish server is an open-source
application server that comes with the
java sdk and this is the server that we
are going to use to test our java
applications so we are going to install
it I'm going to choose the Java
directory to install the GlassFish
server and notice that the version is 4
so GlassFish 4 is supports the Java EE 7
release so we're gonna install GlassFish
4 here hit next it's asking me if you
want to install the update tool the
update tool is basically something that
updates the GlassFish server when there
is a new release I'm going to install it
here and notice the steps over here so
it installs the update to install the
JDK I already have the JDK so it
not an issue it installs a GlassFish
server it installs the uninstallation
software then it configures the update
to bootstrap and then it also configures
the GlassFish server we'll look at what
that configuring is in just a minute
okay so I skip through a little bit of
the installation process so now it's
almost done with the installation and
now it's actually configuring the
GlassFish install so basically what it
does is it creates what is called as a
domain so there is a default domain
created called domain one and the domain
one is any domain is kind of like a
container where you can deploy your web
applications so it's created this domain
called domain one and it's actually
starting the dummy okay so now it's done
it's configured everything and notice
that the admin port here is four eight
four eight you just make a note of this
we'll we'll take a look at what that is
in a minute so now that says command
start domain is executed successfully so
it's created a domain called domain 1
and it has already started it so
GlassFish server should be up and
running now I hit next
let's do overall summary and I exit ok
so now since GlassFish server is up and
running we should be able to access the
admin console of the GlassFish server
you remember that the that the Installer
said that the admin board was for 8 for
8 so basically that's the port in which
we access the admin page so to access
the admin page I do HTTP localhost colon
for 8 for 8 this should open up the
GlassFish server administration console
ok so now the console has loaded there
are a lot of things that we can do here
to customize our installation and to
also deploy any applications I'll just
quickly walk through what it takes to
deploy a standard java web application
so let's say you have a war that you
want to apply on your GlassFish server
so the way to do it is there are
actually multiple ways to do it the way
to do it
using this GUI using this admin console
is to go to this applications link over
here and here you have a deploy so you
just click on that and now you can
actually choose the war that you want to
pick so you just go to your filesystem
choose the war and click open and you
can choose the type if it's a web
application or an enterprise application
all this other stuff and then you hit OK
then the GlassFish server is going to
install I mean it's going to deploy the
war and the web application should be
accessible after that in the 8080 port
which is the standard port that you can
access any web application in one other
thing we need to know is to start and
stop the GlassFish application server in
order to do that we will navigate to the
directory where we have installed
GlassFish server in so it's in java
GlassFish in my machine so here you have
the GlassFish installation so you have a
bin directory go to that and there is
this utility called ace admin so the ACE
admin is used to start and stop the
server the commander's ace admin start
domain and you have to give the domain
name we know that the default domain
that the installer created was domain 1
but since there's only one domain it's
the default so you don't have to specify
it so you just do a start domain so now
that it's already started so it says
that there's already a process that's
running so it carries out but in order
to stop this all you need to do is issue
this stop domain command this will stop
the GlassFish server so now if i access
this it should at arad see here now this
i will is stopped you won't be able to
access the admin console but now we can
start it again by using the start domain
command
and there you go so what is up now so in
this tutorial we downloaded and
installed the GlassFish application
server we configured the domain well at
least the installer configured the
domain by default we learned how to
deploy a war in using the admin console
and we also learned how to start and
stop the GlassFish server using the ACE
admin utility in the next tutorial we're
going to start writing some code and
deploying it on the server thanks for
