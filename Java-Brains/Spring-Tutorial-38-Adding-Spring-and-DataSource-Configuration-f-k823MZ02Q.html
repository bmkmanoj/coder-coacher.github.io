a Java project that has a Dao class and
that connects to a database to fetch a
particular record and we've looked at
how we could implement that using JDBC
we looked at all the code you need to
write to implement such a method in this
tutorial we will start to use some of
the features that spring provides to
make our job easier when we when we talk
to our database so there are there are a
lot of things we can do we'll take it
step by step in this tutorial you're
going to implement a simple connection
that spring provides and we look at how
the you know the connection support
that's provided by spring makes it very
easy to handle the connections so first
of all this project is not at all
related to spring we don't have any of
the spring jars over here so let's try
to add some spring magic here first
thing we'll do is add the spring library
so I go to the project properties Java
build path and then you add library use
the library this is the spring library
that we have configured earlier I just
select that and click finish and ok ok
so now I have the spring jars added to
my class path next step is to add the
spring XML so I will create a new file
I'll call this spring dot XML and this
will create a blank XML where I will add
all the spring configuration I already
have some configuration here so I'll
just paste it over here there's nothing
special the bean starting tag and I have
a couple of tags for annotation so I
have annotation config and then a
component scan very simple let's see
safe now
if you notice the main I'm creating a
new JDBC DUI in PL well since we have
spring no need to use the new we can use
dependency injection so let's do that
this DIY MDL is going to be
hook beam a spring beam so I will use
the add component tag to mark this as a
spring beam and of course imported as a
stereotype now since I have used the
components can this class is
automatically going to get registered as
a spring beam with the name JDBC GUI MPL
of course with G small case so let's
save this and now instead of creating a
new JDBC DUI ampere I will use the
application context so I'm picking up
the spring XML and then I'm creating a
new application context we'll import
these two and now I can use a gate beam
in order to get the da so I'll use these
this line of code it just creates a
Diego which is a gate beam off JDBC DUI
MPL and I'm also passing the class so
that I don't have to cast so I get a
handle to an instance of this tu class
so after that it's straightforward now I
can use a Diego in order to get the
circle so instead of a new class I will
use the Orkut circle and this should
work let's test this out so that our
spring configuration can be verified
well there you go
the spring is initialized the bean and
then I'm getting the same output of
course when you run this make sure your
database is running so the tpw from the
command line prompt that we had fired
earlier this is the network server that
the program connects to so make sure
this server is running ok so now we have
added some spring functionality but
notice all the changes that we have done
is to the main we really have not made
any changes to the to the Diego method
with this is the problem method that we
were talking about in the earlier
tutorial now what can we do how can we
use spring
to simplify this method so that's going
to be the next step let's look at this
Dero method a little bit more detail so
what are you trying to do first we are
trying to set up a connection to the
database so connection is the first step
and then the second step is we are
trying to create a prepared statement
depending on the query that we are you
know we are trying to run and then the
third step is actually executing the
query the fourth step is passing through
the result set to get the output or the
you know the model objects that we want
now the first step connecting to the
database giving the database connection
string and then establishing a
connection of course we also have to
give the driver so this step is not
going to change for different methods of
the application most likely an
application will connect to just one
database so this will come in you know
these three lines of code will probably
show up in every Dao method that you
would write in your program of course if
it's a different database that you know
the connection string would be different
or probably the driver would be
different but then there is a limited
number of databases that you would
connect to as an application in most
likely it will be just one so why do we
need to keep this information in the
method why not take this out and make it
a part of the configuration so this is
going to be the first thing that we can
address now this connection is a
standard interface that we can use and
spring provides some support classes
that implement this connection interface
and we can use that and make it easy to
configure this particular connection
object so let's have a look at that if
you open the spring jar that if you add
it to the library there is one jar for
JDBC argh Spring Framework JDBC so if
you expand this and look into the
packaged JDBC datasource there are some
data source classes there the support
classes will pick this one driver
manager data source
so we'll use this class to configure the
data source for this application and
we'll do this in this bring xml rather
than in the method itself so I will
create a new beam definition here I'll
call the IDS data source and class is
this class the driver manager data
source okay
so now once I have this beam here I can
actually add configuration values to
this beam so it's just like any other
spring beam I can add the configuration
here the configuration happens to be the
driver class and the URL itself so I'll
just paste those two here so I'm adding
configuration for what the driver class
is and where the data bases so these are
the two information that we need to use
we could also use the user and password
if your database requires it so this is
configured as just like any other spring
beam so now that I have this being here
I can use this in my do instead of
initializing a new data source I can use
that so what I'll do is I'll have a
member variable here
private data source data sources again
from the sequel package July extra
sequel and I will generate the getters
and setters okay so now that I have this
I can actually do a auto word because
the type there is only one data source
type so I will just use add provide and
there you go I have actually created a
dependency and then I'm fulfilling their
dependency by making a configuration in
the spring XML so now that this is done
I can actually use this data source in
my code now I don't have to do this
thing over here I don't have to you know
specify a driver I never have to do this
instead of calling a gate connection
from the driver manager I do a gate
connection from the data source this is
the one that I have just configured and
this gate connection does not take in
the connection string because this is
something that you already configured in
the XML okay so once again to summarize
I'm using a data source beam which is a
sample data source implementation that
spring is provided it's a support class
and we have configured the properties
for the data source which is the driver
class name as well as the connection URL
for the database second in the D you
have created a data source member
variable with getters and setters and I
have marked it as Auto wired so that an
instance of the data source gets created
and gets assigned to this D then the
third instead of getting a driver
manager data source connection what I do
is I use this data source member
variable and then I do a get connection
from that and then the rest of these
rest of the code remains the same now
let's let's run this and see if this
works well there you go
it still works so the advantage of doing
this is that you have the data source
specified
and one location in the XML and then you
can use that wherever you want say you
have 100 DEA objects in under your
classes then you can use a data source
just have a data source member variable
and then mark it as Auto wild and then
this automatically creates an instance
and then you can use the same data
source for all your do classes now this
data source that I've used is a sample
implementation that we provided
out-of-the-box by spring it's not really
a very efficient implementation it does
not implement connection pooling and
what this actually does is every time
you do a get connection over here it's
actually creating a new connection far
from ideal when you're talking about a
production system so what we can do is
instead of using the data source that's
provided by spring we can use some of
the other implementations of data source
that do support pooling so one example
is the dbcp and dbcp is a popular open
source library and it implements
connection pooling so it's let's try
implementing that over here so in case I
need to change the data source again the
advantage of using spring is all I need
to do is modify the XML and I do not
have to change the code itself so in
order to modify the XML the first thing
I'll do is as reading the data source
bean ID but the class the implementer of
the data source instead of using the
spring JDBC datasource I will use the
dbcp implementation and the
implementation classes this one
arghhhh batch a commons dbcp basic data
source and the properties all remain the
same we don't have to modify that but
then the advantage of using dbcp is you
can add additional pooling related
properties so I can add these two lines
over here which configure the initial
size of the pool which I've configured
as value 2 and then the maximum active
connections in the pool at any point of
time which I've configured for a value
of 5 so this is all it takes
Lesley scored vice in order to change
the data source implementation and of
course I will have to add required
libraries and I need to add the charge
which are required for the BCP actually
dbcp requires a couple of charge
one is the dbcp charge itself you can go
to common start apache dark /tv CP and
then the second thing is the comments
pool which is common start apache dot
org slash pool and you can of course get
this by searching for dbcp and commons
pool respectively but once you get the
charge and you download them you can add
it to the project so you say add
external charge and in my Java folder I
have the comments dbcp which is just one
like that and then i also add the
comments pulling which is this one so
these are the two jars that you need to
add so one is the commons dbcp dot jar
and in the comments pool third jar once
you add them both
you would have supplied all the required
binaries and now you can actually run
this code if you run this there you go
it still works but this time the
connection source is actually from a
connection pool which is managed by DP
CP and you can do this without making
any changes to the code all we have done
is modified the spring example so this
is one of the first things that we can
do to use spring to make our do classes
a bit simpler so we have taken away all
the connection related information in
the dao method now the next step we'll
have a look at as the JDBC template so
that's provided by spring</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
