before we solve this problem let's see
what the problem was problem was that
there was just one copy of Phi that got
incremented all the way to ten and then
all those said timeout calls were
pointing to the same were referring to
the same print function which was
referring to the same copy of I so then
that print function eventually got
called ten times I had an updated value
so it printed ten ten times right so the
problem there is that there was just one
copy of Phi
what we need is when we queue up all
those print requests right to set them
off can you say okay execute this after
second we do that ten times there are
ten calls to this print object which are
in the queue what we want is for those
ten queued items to point to different
values of Phi right because we don't
want them to all point to the same value
of Phi if they point to the same value
of Phi then they are going to print the
same value right we want them to point
to different values the value that was
contained in the variable I when the set
timeout was called right so we need
multiple copies of I and how do you
create multiple copies of a variable in
JavaScript you create that using
functions remember every time you
execute a function whatever bar is
declared in that function there is a new
copy of it created we've been through
this already so what you need to do is
wrap this in a function and then create
a war I inside it and that's how you get
this so here's how I do this how do you
wrap something inside a function the
easiest way to do this is in a fee okay
so I'm going to create an Fe here which
I'm going to say function there it is
going to be an anonymous function and
inside this function I'm going to move
set timeout here okay and this is going
to be immediately invoked so I have and
if we here okay
just by converting this to anything
nothing happens it's exactly the same
okay just to prove this I'm going to
execute this one more time
reload and run it is going to print ten
ten times but now what's going to happen
is it is actually creating a scope for
this Fe okay there is a scope that's
created for each
execution of thus far loop the first
instance is zero but now there is a
scope created and inside that scope
there is a set by mod that's called
right which is executed immediately yes
but there is that scope object that is
created thanks to this iffy but the next
thing I'm going to do is to convert this
to an inline function rather than it be
a function object because it makes
things a bit more easier to read and
follow so this becomes an inline
function this might look like it's no
very easier to read but trust me and as
we make these other changes that we're
going to do soon this becomes a bit more
easier to read semicolon here ok now the
second mod is taking this function which
is the first argument and this number
which is the second argument again I
have not affected the logic it's pretty
much the same so rather than it be a
function reference which get passed it
is the inline function which is getting
passed to set time on I'm going to
execute this one more time to prove this
reload and run there you go then gets
printed ten times after it waits for one
second but now here's where I'm going to
use closures you remember I told you how
this if he was creating a new scope for
each iteration of this for loop now what
I'm going to do is I'm going to create a
variable inside that scope so inside the
function which is the effets I'm going
to create a bar current value of I it's
a tedious variable name I know but
hopefully this makes it very
self-explanatory so I have a variable
called current value of I now what's
going to happen is every time this
function gets created since there is a
new scope object there is a new copy of
this current value of I that gets
created so since this loop executes ten
times there are 10 different copies of
the current value of I so since there
are multiple copies what I'm going to do
is I'm going to assign the value of I to
this copy each time so the first time
for the first scope object is zero so
current value of i0
second scope object I is one so the
current value of I is one so there is
the same variable I that gets updated
each time but since there is a new copy
of this current value of I variable I
can actually print that variable instead
of I so I'm going to print this and I
gets updated at the end finally it's 10
all the time but now there are 10 copies
of this function scope that have 10
different values of this current value
of I so now if I were to execute this
notice that it waits for one second but
then there are different values that get
printed because each time need each
iteration of this far loop I'm holding
on to the value of I at that point of
time and I'm saving it in the scope that
does if we created for that execution so
set timeout is going to hold on to this
function which remembers the scope
thanks to closures it remembers what was
the scope chain and what's the scope
chain here there is this function scope
which does not have any variables so
when you access current value of I it's
going to look up and now it's this
Effie's function scope which contains
the current value of I that has
preserved the value of I add that point
of time and that's what's going to get
lured to the console ok so hopefully
this made sense there is another way in
which you can do this which is rather
than have it be declared inside I can
actually accept it as an argument right
you remember a function argument is
basically a variable assignment so I can
actually have this be current value of I
as a function argument and now what's
gonna happen is when you execute the if
e you need to pass that I during that
point has a function argument so I'm
going to pass I over here so when this
if he executes it is going to pass I as
an argument and this Fe since it
executes immediately the current value
of I is going to get assigned to I which
is pretty much the same as same same
water current value of I equals I but we
are doing this as a function argument so
this gets executed in this works exactly
the same way we load and run and it gets
the right value each time so again this
is some
that's tricky at least I found it tricky
when I first learned about this but
hopefully me explaining through the
steps and what happens in each iteration
kind of makes things simpler I
definitely encourage you to play with it
and probably watch this video again if
this some of it doesn't make sense and
it's one of those things that once you
get it you get it and then all this
thing makes sense play around with this
and see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
