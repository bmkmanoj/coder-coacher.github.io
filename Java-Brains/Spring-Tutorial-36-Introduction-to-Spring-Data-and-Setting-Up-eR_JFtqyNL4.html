the first of a series of tutorials where
I talk about Spring data support we have
already covered some of the core aspects
of spring as well as spring AOP if you
have not gone through those tutorials I
highly recommend that you go through
them and then come to this one while not
all of the things that we have discussed
earlier will be applicable knowledge of
those concepts is very helpful when you
try to understand the data support that
spring provides so in the course spring
section we talked about some of the core
features that is provided by the spring
framework the main thing being
dependency injection and dependency
mapping in XML and configuration format
in spring AOP we talked about how we can
introduce aspects into our program and
we can have cross-cutting
functionalities isolated out into
separate classes and then apply them
again as configuration rather than in
the actual code when we talk about
spring data support the VAE spring helps
us in coding is kind of slightly
different from what we've been seeing so
far because if we look at core spring
and aspect-oriented support it's kind of
open-ended you can use it for anything
you want it could be for data it would
be for something totally different but
when you talk about spring data support
it specifically for the purpose of your
application interacting with data or a
database and then you typically write
Java code that talks to a database there
are a few things that you will have to
do irrespective of what business logic
you're writing you need to open
connections you need to close
connections you need to manage
transactions you need to write some
boilerplate code and the whole point of
using spring data support is that you
can do away with all those extra code
and the code that you write is
specifically for the business case in
the business problem that you're trying
to solve now when you talk about writing
code to interact with the database in
Java there are numerous ways we can do
that it could be as simple as JDBC or it
could be some kind of an ORM framework
like hibernate or live at us
and of course we have a whole lot of
technologies that we can use now spring
supports a lot of these technologies
Spring has a JDBC module that provides a
kind of an abstraction layer and all the
tedious JDBC coding that we would do
this kind of taken away if you use the
JDBC module that spring provides and
spring also provides an autumn module
that of course does the same thing but
for different Orem frameworks
it supports jpe hibernate ipad s and
again it has an integration layer that
we can use and that layer and spring
support will take care of all the
boilerplate code that we would have to
write even in the case of an advanced
data layer framework like hibernate so
as we go on as we you know look at the
various ways in which spring helps us I
hope the concepts will get more and more
clearer but for this tutorial what I
would like to do is I'd like to set up
some kind of a database running on your
development environment so that you can
follow along these tutorials the
database that I have in mind is Apache
Derby it's a very lightweight in-memory
database and it's something that's very
easy to set up and it takes less
resources it's perfect for testing out
new concepts and trying out things that
we're doing right now so let's get
started so the first thing we do is head
over to the Apache Derby website and
download it I have my browser open here
the website is DB dot Apache dot org
slash Derby so I head over to the
download tab and here you can download
the official latest release I happen to
have a download available here already
I'll just open that once you download an
extract the zip file you should get a
folder like this the more important
folders that we will be working with our
the bin and the Lib folders the bin
contains the program which lets us start
and stop the databases and the Lib
contains the jars that we'll have to
include in our program when we connect
to the database now after downloading
and extracting the distribution the neck
step is to set the environment variables
so Apache Derby recommends a couple of
environmental variables that needs to be
set the first thing being Derby home
there will be home needs to be set to
the location where we have extracted our
distribution so here this is a location
that we need to set up including the
name of the folder which you have
extracted so this folder will contain
the bin and the Lib folders okay so
that's the first environment variable BB
home and the second variable that we
need to set is the path we need to set W
home slash bin to the path variable and
the reason we do that is that all the
you know the commands that we run are in
the bin folder we look at these commands
in a minute but it you know setting this
this folder in the path allows us to run
those commands irrespective of where we
are in the command prompt so that makes
it easy to run these commands without
having to type the entire path and a
quick note on how to set those command
variables if you're on Windows I have a
web page open here which kind of gives
all the details so all you need to do is
right click on my computer go to system
properties and then in the system
properties there will be an environment
variables button click on that and you
will get the environment variables both
for the user as well as for the system
so you hit new and it asks for the name
and the value so here you say BB home
all caps and here is the value where you
have extracted the folder and for the
path there must be a path variable
already available so all you need to do
is click on that and click Edit and then
you can add the W home slash bin to the
path of course separating the previous
one with a semicolon
and then hit OK so that both these
changes get reflected in the environment
variable so after having said the two
environment variables we have completed
all the steps required to install Apache
Derby so those are the only two steps
first is to download and extract the
distribution the second step was to add
the environment variables Derby home
as well as double home /bin added to the
pack now we open a command prompt and
head over to the location where we have
the Apache Derby
so I navigate to where I have extracted
it and I have this location over here so
I go to the bin directory and in the bin
directory you have a lot of batch files
and script files if you're on Windows
you would be running the batch files and
if you're on UNIX or Mac you would be
running the script files Derby operates
in two modes one is the server mode and
one is the embedded mode so we are going
to look at the server mode or the
network server mode and we'll be using
that in our example so we need to start
the B as a network server well what is a
networks of a mean it is similar to all
the other databases that we have come
across you have a database on one
machine and then other machines across
the network can connect to that embedded
mode as something specific to Derby and
we'll have a look at that down the line
but for now we'll stick to the network
server mode so in order to start Derby
as a network server we need to use the
start network server script or if you're
on Windows you need to run the start
network server dot bad batch file so I
will do that
start network server and there you go
the B's running and it's accepting
connections on the sport one five to
seven and we can actually test this by
using a client to connect to the server
W actually comes with a client called I
J also I J dot bat for Windows users we
can use IJ to connect to the server and
actually run queries so let's do that I
have a second command line prompt over
here which is in the same bin directory
but this time I'm going to use the IJ
tool to run the client okay so I have
this IJ running now I can ask
IJ
to connect to this server so that I can
execute some commands so let me paste a
command that already have here so the
command is connect and then the query
string and look at the query string here
I'm using JDBC : derby and local host :
one five to seven so this is them you
know the database running on the same
machine so the IP will be can be
replaced by localhost and the board is
one five to seven which you've already
seen and I'm creating a new database
called DB because I have given a
database name and fixed it with create
equals true so it's going to try to
connect to the database DB running on
this server if it finds it yes it does
connect directly but if it does not find
it it actually creates the database and
note that I'm ending the command with
the semicolon in IJ you need to end all
your sequel commands with a semicolon so
this is the command to connect to the
server and create a database if it's not
already there since this is something
that I've just installed this DB will
not be there and will get created just
press ENTER so it has created the
database and connect it to it so now
here I can run any sequel queries that I
want so I will run a simple create table
query and you know we'll use the same
circle object that we had saved earlier
we will try to create a circle table in
correspondence with that circle objects
or have a create table query for a
circle so it creates stable called
circle it has two columns ID integer and
name which is a 50 character long field
and I end this with a semicolon and hit
enter so it's a zero rows inserted
updated deleted but it has actually
created the table so if I do a select
star from surco it's going to give me
this table definition ID n name and
there are zero records and of course I
can insert values here I can see insert
into circle first circle of course ended
with a semicolon always one row has been
inserted so if I select again that
record should get displayed and yes it
does so this is a quick primer in
setting up and you know running Apache
Derby on your development environment
and this is all it takes now we have a
fully full-fledged database running we
have a network server running and then
you can also use this IJ client to
connect to that if required and when
you're done you just say exists
semicolon and it comes out of the flight
so having done this we are all set to
look at some of the core JDBC code that
you would have to write and how spring
helps us in the subsequent tutorials</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
