unit we're going to be looking at a few
more directives that come that angular
we also be looking at some module
related concepts and we're gonna wrap
this up by building a to-do app as
promised so we're gonna start by looking
at a few more directives I mean you're
obviously not going to be covering every
directive that comes up with the angular
that's going to be a big list and it's
not in scope for this course I am going
to be covering a few directives that are
fairly common than the usage and I
consider them to be the important ones
I'm going to start off with the ng show
and the ng-hide directives in order to
demonstrate this I've created this
folder called more - directives which
again has the same structure that we've
seen before it's a simple angular
application with an app called more
directives app and have an app that is
where I initialize the module more
directives app and I have the angular
adapter.js linked the same structure
that we've seen all along now I'm going
to create a controller here div or
directives controller as ctrl and this
is the divet I'm going to be adding all
my HTML content I will of course have to
create this controller over here not yes
here's a handy shortcut and some people
do this instead of doing an app dot
controller what we can do is instead of
holding on to this in a variable I'm
just going to do something like this dot
controller you see what I'm doing here
rather than have angular module return
an app object which I'm going to hold on
to in a variable and then do a variable
dot and basically good to do angular
module dot controller so this star
control is basically executing on the
return of angular module which is what
we did earlier as well so I'm going to
be doing a controller called mode
directives controller well it's really
more directive that's a typo
okay you can create this function I'm
just going to leave this as an empty
function for now I'm going to go to
index dot HTML I'll have a checkbox here
and a small paragraph so I'm going to
have any input type equals checkbox and
I'm going to drive an NG model equals
checked off ctrl dart checked so this is
going to be my check box and then I'm
going to have a paragraph here says show
some content all right now if i refresh
so I have this check box and I have some
content over here we know that's this
check box since its type to the ng model
then I check this check box it's going
to have the scope is going to have a
checked property that's going to die in
that the content of the check box if
it's check that property is going to be
true so now I check the property's going
to be false okay now what if I want to
have this conditionally show or not show
depending on whether it's being checked
or not I can do something as simple as
this ng - if equals ctrl dot check we
have already seen this ng F is a way to
add the element to the Dom or remove the
element from the Dom so if I were to
refresh this it's the check box is not
checked so the content doesn't show up
the minute I check this the content
still doesn't show up which means that
something is wrong let's look at the
console will they go the theater I'd fix
the typo in the controller but not in
the HTML had given the wrong name for
the controller
all right let's refresh this one more
time you see here when I check the check
box the content shows up and when I
uncheck it the content doesn't show so
this is fairly straightforward what I'm
is either showing or hiding the content
depending on a boolean this is fine but
there are a couple more directives that
looks similar but do something a little
bit different so the directives are
ng-show and ng-hide ng-show lets you
show an element depending on a boolean
so if I were to do this instead of doing
an NG if I were to do an ng-show refresh
the page same behavior right so you
might be wondering if I have these two
directives but before I get there let me
also show you ng-hide what if you want
to reverse this thing we want to hide a
particular element if the guy if the
value is a boolean for instance if you
were to uncheck this the content shows
up if you check it the content doesn't
show up in order to do that I will do
ng-hide which is actually a negation of
entry sure right it does the opposite of
ng-show
if I were to use ng-hide see the
checkbox is unchecked the content shows
up but and I check it the content is
hidden all right so these are the three
directors that you could potentially use
to show or hide certain things depending
on a boolean
there is ng-show ng-hide and ng-if and
of course all these things take the
negation as well so if I were to say not
of control that check basically what I'm
doing the same as ng-show right let's
show this one more time
refresh see behaves just like ng-show so
they are innovate convenience or
directives but why have these many the
difference lies in the fact that ng-show
and ng-hide
work a bit differently when compared to
ng-if so here's what happens when you
use ng F when it change this to ng if
refresh the page all right and then open
the console browser console I'm going to
check this and I'm going to inspect
element - like it - this paragraph so
you see here there is a paragraph over
here like we would expect it to but
notice what happens when I uncheck this
paragraph goes away right so that's what
happens when you use ng if I kind of
stress that earlier and I want to stress
that again when you use ng if
and the condition evaluates to false
angular removes that element from the
dot
it literally removes it it Yanks it out
okay and when you when the condition
becomes true angular puts that element
back into the Dom now notice what
happens when I use ng-show refresh the
page the behavior is the same but notice
what happens I'm going to do inspector
so this element still shows up but when
I uncheck it
you notice the element is still there
it's not gone but there is a class
called ng-hide added to that element and
what does ng-hide do ng-hide as a CSS
property called display:none impart
which is basically the CSS property to
hide a particular element you can have
the CSS display : none on any element
and it essentially hides it that is of
course the important here to make sure
that no other style or no other CSS
rules overrides this but essentially
what this does is set a class called ng
- hide - an element and that class has a
styling which it's that element all
right this is what ng show does n ng hai
also does something similar once the
other way around then the boolean is
true is when it's hidden again you see
here in G hide is the class that's added
so this is the big difference
you essentially have three Directors
here in G F which either adds the
element to the Dom or it removes the
element from the Dom depending on a
boolean condition and then you have the
ng-show and ng-hide directives which are
complement complements of each other
which don't remove the element from the
Dom are added to the Dom instead it adds
a class which shows or hides the element
based on CSS rules now that you know the
difference the obvious question is why
do we still need that mol-1 suffice well
the reason we need to and also the
reason why you would want to use one
over another is whether you want to
actually temporarily sure hide the
element or you want to completely remove
the
from the dawn if you know when loading
the page that you don't need that
element depending on user data you would
use mg if because it literally Yanks the
element from the Dom however if you
might potentially need the element later
depending on user action you might show
an element for a little bit and then
remove it like you know validation
messages right you're in validating the
user password you want to make sure that
the right password is entered so the
message comes below the password and
it's very likely that you're going to
show it so for such situations you use
ng Shore ng-hide which doesn't literally
you remove the element from the time it
shows or hides it so it makes it a
little bit faster to show or hide so if
during the lifecycle of the app you have
reasons to show or hide an element you
use ng Shore ng hide
however if you know for sure that in the
lifecycle of an app once you remove an
element it is going to stay remove and
won't likely add it back you use ng if
so that's a pretty good rule of thumb
for deciding which one to use but they
are very similar detectors and you can
actually get away with using one instead
of another</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
