typescript first in the most obvious
thing is that it's a programming
language it's a free and open source
programming language it was created by
Microsoft and it's so kind of being
maintained by Microsoft window itself
it's an open source project the question
what does typescript is fairly simple to
answer the question why typescript
require some explanation
in order to understand why typescript
was created you need to understand some
problems with another programming
language a related programming language
called JavaScript what are some problems
with JavaScript I think the challenge
with JavaScript is it was created many
many years ago for a completely
different purpose it was created to be a
simple lightweight easy to learn easy to
get started
language that was meant to do some basic
Dom manipulation for HTML that beta
static HTML web pages and I'm pretty
sure the creator of JavaScript at the
time would not have imagined the kind of
adoption the kind of complexity that
JavaScript drives web applications today
so what happens is there are certain new
answers to the JavaScript programming
language there were certain decisions
that were taken during the language
creation time that haven't aged well
there are certain quirks in the
languages resulting from those decisions
I'm gonna show you some of the quirks in
the language now with just JavaScript
you know talking about typescript I'll
show you some of the quirks some of the
weirdness in JavaScript and just keep
that in mind and if you're wondering why
is this guy talking about javascript in
the typescript course
well typescript attempts to address a
lot of these quirks a lot of these
weirdness and there are features which
can attack all these quirks so remember
these squares in JavaScript that I'm
gonna show you right now
when we talk about dikes regulator I'm
gonna call back to these quirks kind of
like a flashback in a movie so you
better remember this take notes we will
look at what typescript does to solve
these problems later all right so here's
the developer tools open and my
Chrome browser I can execute random
JavaScript statements and have them show
me the output so let's look at some of
the problems with JavaScript the first
thing I'm going to talk about is a lack
of a typing system there's no type
checks and there's no enforcement of
typing for example let's say I have a
bar a and this is a variable I can
assign the number 10 - a I can assign a
string hello to a it all works fine
there is no way I can restrict here to
contain values that belong to a
particular type i cannot say a needs to
be a number only or a needs to be a
string only for example this is a
problem not just for primitive types but
also for objects i can say a equals an
empty object i can create an object of
something else a different structure and
it's all gonna work fine i can make some
other structure here and javascript will
not stop me the additional problem is if
you've written code like this and you
actually intend to make a to be a number
only variable there's no way you can
check you'd apply it at runtime and
everything works fine if you have
assigned some other datatype to a
JavaScript doesn't complain it's only
when you assume a to be a number and do
something with it that only works with
numbers and happens to be something else
that's when javascript complains so it's
just not very helpful when you're
developing the second problem that i
want to talk about is relating to
function arguments now let's say i have
a function I'm gonna call that add which
takes in two numbers and then it returns
the sum of those two numbers simple
enough
I can call add on one and two and it's
gonna return three now what happens if I
call add the just one argument it's
gonna work fine javascript is not going
to complain but the function is going to
gonna get another number because then
function is called without the required
number of arguments the arguments that
are missing it actually substituted with
undefined so ad here is trying to add
one to undefined which is why we get not
a number again not really helpful but
there's really nothing you can do to
prevent JavaScript from doing this
what's so funny is I can actually do add
one two three and this is gonna work
fine two three is essentially ignored so
you can have different arguments being
passed to a function and JavaScript
doesn't care it just picks what it needs
and then proceeds executing silently
again not very helpful when you're
working on a large code base in one
enforce that the consumers of your
function are passing in the right
arguments the third problem I want to
talk about is relating to objects and
how you cannot enforce the structure of
objects let's say I have a war person
equals let's say I give a property first
name this is an object which contains
two properties first name and last name
I can print that object and here we go
now what if I want to make sure that
nobody adds any other properties to it
now let's say if somebody comes along
and this person dot foo equals 10
now person as will have a new property
called foo and there's really nothing
you can do to prevent somebody from
doing this objects are loosely
structured there's no concept of a
template there's no concept of a class
in JavaScript
well there is technically a concept of a
class in JavaScript but that doesn't
really do much to enforce member
variable structure like we would expect
to in some of the other programming
languages which are strictly class-based
so this is a problem and this becomes
more of a problem when you're
an object that you are not sure how was
constructed let's say somebody gives you
an object and say is there are these
many properties in it how do you know
you really cannot tell for sure the only
thing you can do is examine those
properties and find out if they really
have a value you have to check if the
value of the property is undefined or if
it's something else there's really no
way somebody can give you an object and
guarantee that there are a certain set
of properties there this is going to be
a problem again because objects are
loosely structured in JavaScript</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
