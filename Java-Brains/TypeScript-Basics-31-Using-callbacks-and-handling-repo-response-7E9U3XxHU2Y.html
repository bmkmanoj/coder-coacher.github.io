the response from this request API and
then constructing our own custom object
an instance of a class from it but we
don't want to do the actual work in this
API service right so the console that
log that I'm doing over here is going to
change to something else if you want to
do with this user object if you don't
want this service to do that I just want
the service to create this user instance
and somehow hand it back to the consumer
of this method now here's a problem with
handing things back you cannot really
either turn the user instance from this
method the method cannot have a return
type be a user why because this is
amazing Kronus method it's making a call
to a get API which is asynchronous and
the response of this method depends on
the response of this asynchronous method
so there this method itself is
asynchronous if you have any synchronous
method you cannot really do it done the
result of that asynchronous operation
from the method itself but JavaScript
there are a bunch of different ways in
which you can do this you can have
promises which deal with a way of
handing over asynchronous output back to
the consumer you can have things like
observables and all that fancy stuff but
the very basic way of dealing with
asynchronous methods is by using
callbacks not just this method requests
are get this is an asynchronous method
and how does it return the value to you
it's offering a callback mechanism
so since get user info is an
asynchronous method as well this method
signature also needs to accommodate
callbacks all right so what are you
gonna do is declare a function as an
argument there's gonna be a function
which is gonna be the callback and when
you call get user info from anywhere
else I need to pass in the callback so I
need to pass in the function over here
which is what I want to do but that user
and I want this function to accept that
constructed user object all right so
this would be the
way to do this so let's say this is the
signature that we want right we want to
accept the user object and their
response and do something with it over
here I'm an import user again so that we
have the signature so this is what we
want right this is what we want the user
info method signature to be in here I
wanna do console the log user so in this
way we are letting the consumer of this
method handle the response and not the
method itself alright so in order to do
this I need to create this callback
signature so this needs to be CB this is
gonna be a callback function and now how
do I provide a signature for this
function the signature needs to be a
function which accepts the user instance
and then the return is any rate it's it
could be anything so in order to do this
I'm gonna create this signature so what
this does is it creates this callback
function as a parameter and get user
info and I'm also typing it you see this
this portion there's me typing this and
the type indicates that this is a
function that takes in one argument
which is of type user and then the
response the return can be any alright
so now that I have a callback type what
I'm gonna do here in the respond in the
callback of this request API is rather
than print to the console I'm going to
execute the callback let the user object
that I've created over here alright so
again to summarize there are a couple of
changes that I did the first I made this
function that can accept a callback the
callback is a function that takes in a
user as an argument an instance of the
user class is an argument
and does something with it right now I
somehow need to update this method in
the service to handle this new argument
which is a function one way to do this
is to just accept that argument and this
is a function well I'm gonna call the
function with the user over here in the
callback response so the user object
that I'm you passing over here is
received by this guy over here and I can
print it to the console that's great but
now I need to somehow type this right
this has an implicit any type you see
here we are in type script line so I
know I need to provide type information
for this callback so that's what I'm
doing over here with this snippet of
code this snippet of code is type
information for the function it's
telling what the type of the function is
it's a function the ticks in a user
instance as an argument and then it has
a return of any type
all right now with this I have moved
over the logic of printing to the
console into the consumer I'm gonna go
ahead and run this and I still get the
same functionality but I have moved over
the logic to the consumer I'm going to
do the same thing for the repos as well
remember we have this other method that
we haven't implemented so I'm gonna go
ahead and copy this over here in fact I
can extract the options as
constant here outside class making
something as a constant mix this
reusable in both these methods and I'm
going to pass options directly over here
and there's going to be something very
similar for repose as well very similar
method so this is gonna be username plus
V pose and the signature is gonna be
similar alright so what I'm gonna get
back here in this case is a little bit
different though it's gonna make the
call to the REST API if you add a github
the Consular user slash user name slash
repos but what are you gonna get back in
the body there's not going to be
something that fits into user it's gonna
be an array of repos right so what I'm
gonna get back here is an array of
repositories that needs that where each
of those repository instances needs to
be fed into a repo instance let me show
you what I mean I'm gonna get rid of
this thing so this is there's a repos
API right it's an array and each element
of the array consists of information
that needs to be converted into a repo
instance so I'm gonna get back a body
water 3/4 array equals volume let me
collect here now for each element of the
repo a I want to construct people
instance so I'm gonna say repo array dot
map where each element will be new repo
of people so I'm basically mapping each
element of the response to repo now I
don't have a constructor for repo so I'm
gonna need to create that constructor so
I'm gonna go over to repo and just like
the dead fire
for user I'm gonna have to map these
names to whatever is available in the
repo so this start name is gonna be the
product name description there's gonna
be description what else do we have
URL is gonna be same as URL as HTML URL
size is gonna be size and for count is
going to be forks there's gonna be 4x
should actually size for us in my API I
can map each of these things
so whatever response I'm getting back
right is gonna be an array so I'm gonna
map and each of these elements from the
response is gonna get mapped to a new
repo instance I'm going to
the same line so I'm mapping each
element do this and now I have a repo
array that contains a bunch of instances
off this repo class right each one of
these responses has been mapped to my
custom instance and now I can set this
as the response
so rather than this be a user in this
case I'm returning a repo array and this
is gonna be an array of repos
I'm just gonna call this repos and this
is gonna be returned this thing so
here's what I'm doing I am taking this
body which is a bunch of objects a list
of an array of objects with the response
that github provides and for each
element in that array I am creating a
new instance of my custom class the repo
class and I'm doing that using the
constructor model passing that instance
and creating the repo instance and once
I have mapped each element over here now
I have a new array where you don't have
individual objects as what the response
comes in as I have individual objects of
the 3po instance and since I have this
running on body I'm just gonna do body
dot map so just a one-line function
which does all this work it's pretty
cool now in my main class I can pass in
a callback which is going to get an
instance of an area of repo instances so
in my index RTS I'm going to make
another call here as we see that get
repos
and I'm still gonna pass in username and
the callback function is going to be
something that accepts an array of repo
instances and here I'm gonna do console
dot log off repos of course I need to
import Depot class now save this and
let's run this now we should get the
user output printed and the repo output
printed well turns out three part but
isn't getting printed so let's figure
out what's going on well that's because
I'm not calling the call back so let me
go ahead and call the callback with this
rather than return it so that was a
mistake I was making again you don't
want to return from the request I want
to call the call back with this so I'll
say let repos equals this and then what
I need is to pass this constructed
object this a day of people instances to
the callback and not return it call back
off depots now under second and yes I do
get the output with all the array
elements you see here each one is an
instance of repo right all my
repositories are getting this plain as
an array all right
this leaves us with the last step to
synchronize these two and print out one
consolidated output of the user
information and the repository
information and also to sort out the
repositories right rather than print
everything I just want to print like the
top four or the top five repositories
based on the number of forks all right
so let's do that in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
