have created a directory called to-do
app and I have the same structure that
we were familiar with all along we have
an index or HTML with an Ag app having
the name to-do app angularjs app da GS
with pretty much nothing in the body so
for this h1 and in my Hut yes I have the
to-do app I'm using that name to create
a new angular module now let's start
building the to-do app I'm going to
create a div with an NG controller we
call this to do ctrl on this person I
have to create the controller over here
you'll see app dot controller the to do
ctrl is the controller in here function
leave this as an empty function for now
so what are the different elements that
we're going to need further to do app
first of all we're going to need a list
of to dos that just display then the
tools that are already available right
later we're going to need a text box and
a button which lets us add to do is to
it at this point of time let's just
create a list first so I'm going to
create this div for just showing the
list I'm going to have a paragraph so if
you your to do and then inside this
inside this div me close this div I'm
here I'm gonna have one paragraph for
each element alright so this is my to do
one to do two and so on right so I'm
going to build this list over here now
the list needs to be backed by data
there ideally needs to be an array in
the scope for the student roller which
is going to contain this list of to do's
and then I can use an NG repeat to
actually print all those to do is over
here so I'm going to go create a
hard-coded
this stuff to do first so I'm going to
have this dot to do equals an array
alright so the area would be lon
angular one is one to do try out
exercises visit our brains site write a
little bit of a self plug there alright
so these are the three to dos right now
and what I want to do is in my index dot
HTML I want to print those I'm going to
have like a button paragraph for each to
do and I'm going to print those things
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
have a paragraph ng-repeat equals a
variable name in the list right so this
is going to be to do in I'm going to
have this be a controller as and of
course make sure I've spelled controller
right ok so now that I have a controller
as syntax I can access the to-do list
by knowing ctrl dot to do so I am
looping through controller scope dot two
dues which is this array I'm going to
look through this array once for each
element now once I'm looping through
this will close this paragraph tag and
inside this paragraph what I want to do
is I want to print that to do so I'm
going to do this alright so I am I'm
printing this to do as I loop through
the array so each time it's going to
create a paragraph and the contents of
the paragraph is going to be the this
string here in the array all right so
let's refresh the page now here are the
three elements now these are individual
paragraphs what I want to do is create a
list so I'm going to use the HTML list
structure so let's say I use an ordered
list which is o L and I'm going to pin
this within a while now each list
element is going to be a L I so I use
here and now I have a list element let's
refresh again there you go have a
numbered list let's go okay now that
I've done this what I'm going to do next
is create a text box in the button which
lets us add new to Deus
so I'm going to create this up at the
top put another div here and the
paragraph choose add add to do and an
input and a button as you can see the
standard way of building these apps you
first write the markup and then you make
sure you have the right model and then
you hook those to em right so right now
I just have the markup so I have what I
need to add to do but these things don't
do anything yet so I need to hook in and
give it makes your data goes to the
scope so how do i hook in the scope link
for a textbox again I need to use the ng
model and I'm going to set this on ctrl
dot new to do and just by doing this
then I enter something in here in the
text box it is going to add a new
property on the scope called
new to do all right now I need to hook
in the ad so I'm going to have an
ng-click equals add new to do and this
is again going to be ctrl dot
so now I need to add this method on the
scope so I'm going to do a this dot add
new to do is going to be a function
which is going to take the new to do
property on the scope and it's going to
push it do this to do s-- array so I'm
going to save this dot to deus array dot
push
of the start new to do alright so I have
pushed this now what do I need to do to
show the updated element in this list
well as you can imagine you don't have
to do anything
this is two-way data-binding angular is
going to detect that there is an update
in this array and it's going to add that
new element
let me demonstrate that I'm going to
refresh the page now I'm going to add a
new to do here and there you see it gets
added over here so I can add a bunch
more this add this odd so this all gets
added and you don't have to update the
view here's something though the when I
press add I want this textbox to be
cleared right let's say I type in
something and I click Add but it gets
added to the to-do list but still
showing up in this textbox I wanted to
become black now how do I do that well
again thinking an angular if you have to
update a view what do you have to do you
have to change the model that backs the
view now what's the model that's backing
the text box view it is the scope dot
new to do so if I have to clear the text
box all I need to do is clear this
property new to do on the scope just
exactly what I'm going to do after I
push the new to do I'm going to take
that new to do property and then clear
it I'm going to assign it to an empty
string now let's see what happens
add it new to do here and I click add
you see this the textbox gets cleared
that's because I have teared the model
and then angular takes care of updating
the view again stressing the fact that
when you're working with angular you
update the model and then I need a takes
care of updating the view all right now
this is adding a new to do and we have
done that now let's look at what we need
to do to edit a particular to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
