that you may not notice unless you can
dig into it so that the engine
controller I told you how angular
creates a scope object which is a child
of the Benin scope object so you
essentially have a new scope object
every time you have something like
ng-controller turns out angular creates
new scope object for not just in the
controller it actually does that for a
few more things it actually creates a
new scope object for something like
ng-if and guess what it creates a new
scope object for ng-repeat and why would
it create scope objects for these things
let's take a look I'm gonna open the
inspector here and expand the Indy
controller now here you see there are
these NG tube beads which are basically
new elements that are added to the HTML
your original HTML contain just one div
with a couple of paragraph tags in it
what angular has done is it's taken that
div and it stamped out multiple copies
depending on how many elements you had
in your array so here it's created these
bunch of delve elements now what's
interesting to know is that in each of
these elements angular is actually
creating a new scope alright this is one
scope this is another scope there's
another scope and so on and actually
here's a clue which lets you know when I
angular is creating a scope every time
angular creates a scope for an element
it adds this class equals ng - scope to
that element right what do we typically
use class for use it for stuffing right
you have a CSS element class and then
you apply it to an element ng scope is
not CSS Truman there's no styling that
ng scope is applying this is however
angular giving us a clue that it's
actually creating a new scope object for
each iteration of this in Jeter bead
here ng-repeat is happening six times
for each ng-repeat
element angular is actually creating a
new scope why would it need to create a
new scope angular creates a new scope
vicar's you're using this loop counter
over here a loop variable called obj obj
needs to be a part of a scope object as
with everything
as an angular friends we're basically
referring to scope objects over here now
obj cannot be a part of the main
controller scope why not
because unlike a traditional for loop
we're a little have a war I equals 0 I
less than some number I is the same
variable that contains different values
at different points of time for the
first loop I contains the value 0 second
loop I contains the value 1 and so on so
it's the same variable with multiple
values at different points of time
however with an NG repeat that does not
apply because in ng-repeat it's not a
variable that contains multiple values
it's actually multiple copies of the
same variable so obj contains the value
of the first object in this div obj
contains the value of the second object
in this div and so on and all these
objects exist simultaneously like all
these different repetitions exist
simultaneously so it's not separated by
time so there naturally has to be
multiple obj objects right since they're
all happening in parallel so the way
angular solve this problem is by having
multiple scope objects each scope object
having a property called obj so what
angular does when it sees an NG
repeaters it creates one scope object
for each repetition and once it creates
a scope object it puts a property on
that scope object which is your loop
variable so here is one scope object on
which obj is a property and that's going
to contain the first element here is
another scope object again having a
property obj it's going to getting the
second element and so on so that's the
reason why there are multiple scope
objects one for each repetition
now that angular is creating these
multiple scopes it actually uses those
scope objects to populate some other
handy stuff so there are loop variables
that it uses which can be handy
depending on what you are doing here are
a bunch of variables that you get in
that scope object for that element that
you're using so you have a variable
called Dollar Index which is basically
the iterator numbers it starts with 0 1
2 3 and so on you have a dollar first
which is a boolean which is true for the
first iteration
and it's not true for the rest there's
middle which is true for the middle
element and last which is true for the
last element and you also have even an
odd which alternate between the
different edges and scopes so I'm going
to demonstrate this by using some of
these things so I have obj dot name over
here but now I'm going to create another
paragraph here would say is element
counter so which I want to say element 1
element 2 and so on how do I get hold of
that I get hold of this by using this
hidden variable called Dollar Index so
this is a counter that angular populates
for each scope element that it creates
for the first cup element that creates
angular populates this with zero the
second scope element angular populates
with one and so on so let's refresh the
page there are all these different
properties called dollar index on each
of these scopes alright so for each
scope it has some value further
obviously for the version it has the
value 0 for the second one has the value
1 and so on I could of course add a +1
to this to make it a serial number now
it starts from 1 2 and so on so I can
add more stuff here let's say first this
is dollar first and again angular is
going to have this value set to true for
the very first scope object and it's
going to be false for the rest well
there you go it's true for the first one
and it's false for all the rest and you
can of course play around with the other
variables that I've shown you and they
can do what it says in the tin the thing
to remember though again is that these
are not the same variables that are
changing over time these are copies of
variables and the way angular achieves
those copies by having multiple scope
objects one for each iteration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
