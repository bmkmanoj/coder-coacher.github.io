introduction to JSTOR and we wrote a JSP
page which used a few gstl tags one of
the tags that we used was the use bean
tag and this tag defined an object in
the scope that we required and we use
the set property and the get property
tags to set and get properties of this
bean that here we had defined in the use
bean
before we start this tutorial I want to
make a quick distinction between a
couple of methods of the request object
so here's a quick pop quiz what's the
difference between a request dot get
attribute and a request dot get
parameter this is this is something that
is again confusing for a lot of people
who are just learning so let's let's
spend a couple of minutes to get this
clear request or get attribute is used
to define objects in a particular scope
so let's say I have an object and I want
to store it in a request code then I use
a request start set attribute and then
later I can retrieve it with a request
or get attribute then once a request or
get parameter the request dot
getparameter gets you the parameters
that have been passed on HTTP requests
so let's say I have a page and the
client fills some text boxes or some you
know HTML controls in a form and then
submits the form then the parameters of
that form you know the values that the
user has entered that gets submitted to
our servlet or our JSP as request
parameters so the way it is different
from request attributes is request
attributes are something that you set
and you pull out in your servlet
application parameter request parameters
are values that the user enters in a
form and then sends it over to us our
user enters in a query parameter and
then those parameters get sent to us so
whatever data is coming from the client
side are the request parameters and you
know the objects that we set in our
server side different scopes be the
request or a session a page application
to all those other attributes so if you
look at the servlet
see here requested setattribute let's
let's have a look at the method
signature so the request dot
getparameter takes in a string and it
returns a string but the request starts
set attribute takes in a string and it
returns an object so the difference
being then user a submitting values in a
form it all goes as individual strings
it does not get saved as an object
because you have different text boxes
different HTML controls each value of
each of the controls of the user fills
and then submit goes as a separate
string so all the data that we get from
the client-side are separate strings but
when we are setting the attributes on
the server side say for example in this
line we have set the user object into
this attribute called user so here we
have the ability to set complete objects
it doesn't have to be perimeters it
doesn't have to be strings it can be
complete objects including our own
objects so that's the reason why the
requests start get attribute as a
parameter which is a string but it
returns an object because we can set
objects into the attribute now why did I
talk about this because what we are
learning in this tutorial requires that
we know and understand the difference
between attributes and parameters okay
so let's go back to the JSP that we
wrote in our previous tutorial so this
is the JSP we have a user bean that we
have defined and the scope is request
and a set property and later we are
getting the property in another tag now
the set property tag here has a couple
of other tricks that you can use let me
create a new application and we'll try
and explore this set property tag and
see what other features of the tag that
we can use create a new dynamic web
project JSP project everything else is a
default I'll just leave that now so what
I'll do is I'll
and copy the login dot JSP from here so
that I don't have to start everything
from the scratch I will paste this into
this web content so in our new project
we have this log in the JSP now let me
add some fields here I'm going to remove
the password we don't need the password
okay so I've modified this page and I've
added a few text books it's nothing
really not really major changes I just
have a few text boxes here I have the
user ID the username at a slide one line
to city state and pin code so let's call
this the user registration page now what
I'm trying to do is instead of passing
this to a servlet I'm going to pass this
to another JSP and we're going to look
at how to capture all this user
submitted data inside the JSP and of
course this side without using any
script tags we're going to use gstl
to capture this data so in essence what
we are doing is we are capturing the
request parameters not the you know
attributes we in our earlier tutorial we
had captured the attributes but in this
tutorial we're going to capture the
request parameters that the user has
entered now there are a couple of things
that we need to do in order to capture
the request parameters using J style
tags the first thing is the set property
of the gstl tag makes it very easy to
store all these service parameters if
you have an object that receives all
these request parameters what this means
is say I'm capturing all the user data
here now if I have a user object whose
fields are these values say I have a not
user object with user ID as one of the
member variables user name as another
member variable at this one address too
and all that then J still makes it very
easy to capture all these values and
then place them into this user object
and this is this is very handy in a real
life scenario because you would normally
have a data transfer object anyway say I
have to submit all these values to a you
know a database method which stores this
user details into the database then you
would want to use a data transfer object
anyway so let's create this data
transfer object
and then you can actually create the
other you know the JSP page that
receives this posted data so I'll start
off by copying the data transfer object
that we already have we have this user
dot Java so let me copy this and save
this to our Java resources say paste
okay save the log in the JSP will define
the package
okay so we have the DTO now I'll create
a JSP that will capture this user user
submitted parameters let's say call this
processed RJ speed this function of the
CSP is to process the user submitted
data now it closes the other projects
use it or Java
now here's your here's a log in the JSP
and we are submitting all these values
now in order to in order to store these
values into our DTO I first need to use
the use bean tag and define an object in
our scope that that will be receiving
all these parameters now I will use the
juice bean tag again
ideas user classes are DTO class and
I'll make the scope as requests for now
okay so now in a previous tutorial we
used the JSP colon set property here
we'll be doing the same thing but a bit
different this time so now we know that
this use bean is going to create an
object because we know it's not already
there we know that we have not set this
user attribute in the request scope so
it's going to create a new user
attribute now while it's creating it
executes all the set properties that I
put inside us being tagged so in this
case what I'll do is I'm not going to
set any property to a initialized value
as we did earlier let me pull up the the
earlier example see in this case I had
the set property I chose the property
name of this user object and I gave it a
leave I'm not going to do that this time
so instead what I will do is let me just
copy this so that it's save some typing
so in this case instead of giving it a
value myself I'm going to say hey I'm
not going to pass the value to you this
time instead look it up from the request
parameter because we are already passing
the value over here by the web set this
to a processed or JSP so I'm going to
pass all these values from the form to
processed or JSP so it's there in the
request parameter the way to do that is
by using param here and I need to pass
the value of the parameter itself so in
the login dot JSP the username is called
username so I'll just copy that
and I will send it to the param
attribute so now that we have this let's
do a get property just to just to see
how it works so the same code will look
now just fine I'll just paste it here
save this and run the login dot JSP
okay so I'm not going to pass all the
values here I'll just pass the username
because that's the only one we are
capturing here so if I submit query here
it is processed our JSP has captured the
request parameter so so this is a simple
and elegant solution to capture the
request parameters before we wind up
there are a couple of shortcuts in using
the set property tag the first shortcut
is if the property of the you know the
bean that we have defined if the name of
this property matches the name of the
param
which is the name of the textbox control
which is sending us the data say this
xbox control name and
this property name of the destination
user beam matches in that case we do not
have to specify the parameters J steel
this set property tag of the gstl
automatically maps this name to the same
name in the parameter and if I'm not
passing any value here set property
assumes that I'm I need to get the value
from the request parameter and then it
looks for the request parameter with the
same name if it finds the same name it's
going to set this property so the same
thing would work without even specifying
the param values another shortcut is
this now say all of these parameters
match now I have login dot JSP with all
these values right
so in assume that I have this user or
Java the DTO where I have the same
member variables say I have address 1 as
a string member variable and address 2
as another string member variable city
state pin code all are member variables
with exactly the same name then I
wouldn't even have to give so many set
properties with all the names ah let me
just modify the user or Java here okay
so I've added some fields here to our
ddu which matches the the form text
fields and I've generated getters and
setters for that and in the process tour
JSP I have printed out all those fields
now if I have to capture all the values
that has been submitted in the login dot
JSP
in this method what I do is I'd have to
have so many lines and I would say
property and give each property name I'd
have another line for address 1 and the
line for address to all of them with the
name as user because we are setting all
those values for this user being the
shortcut here is I don't have to do that
if all the values match I can just
remove this this thing and instead of
having all the individual properties I
can just say property is star so what
this means
hey I have defined this user beam and
then I need to get all the values I need
to set all the values of the user beam
with the request parameters so so have a
look at the request parameters and
whatever request parameters matches the
member variables of this user beam just
get those request parameters and set it
accordingly so if we do this then we
don't have to mention each and every
member variable of the user and map it
to each and every request parameter it
will be done automatically and all that
is done by just saying property will
start so I'll just fill in some dummy
values and I say submit here you see all
the all the data has been assigned
accordingly to the corresponding member
variables of the DTO and it's printed
here so this is an easy way to capture
the request parameters using the use
beam and the set property tag</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
