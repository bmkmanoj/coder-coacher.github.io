for this course I hope that you have
some kind of JavaScript knowledge
because javascript is a line which that
we're going to be using to build
applications in angular
like I mentioned angular is a
client-side JavaScript framework so you
have to write code using angular I'm
sorry using javascript every code that
we write in this course is going to be
on JavaScript and of course HTML but
most of that the for dynamic
functionality is going to be chalice
code so I'm hoping you have some basic
knowledge if you're completely new to
JavaScript then this is probably not
that I place this time I would highly
recommend you check out some of the
other JavaScript courses on Java brains
and then come back to this course you
learn a lot angular secondly I'm hoping
that you have some application
development knowledge some kind of
application development it doesn't have
to be on the client set you could be
writing server-side applications in Java
or C++ or Python or whatever but I'm
hoping there is some kind of an
application development experience that
you already have because I'm going to be
covering some patterns here we're going
to be using some patterns which you will
feel right at home using if you have
those applications before so these are
the two basic prerequisites for building
applications using angular and of course
taking this course I do recommend just
brushing up a little bit about HTML are
we going to be writing some HTML
quarters but not that extensively but
again it's a web application should we
need HTML so a basic knowledge of HTML
is also recommended so feel free to just
brush up some of your you know basic
HTML tags if you are if you've been out
of touch or you're completely new to
HTML</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
