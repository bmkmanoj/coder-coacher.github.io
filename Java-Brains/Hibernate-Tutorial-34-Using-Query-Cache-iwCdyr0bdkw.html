second level cache of hibernate for our
user details entity class so the steps
that we followed were first in our
hibernate dot C of G rot example we
enabled the second level cache over here
so we added a property said use second
level cache we made it as true and we
also subside the cache provider class as
the hitch cache provider we added the H
cash jar into a class path and then in
our actual entity we made this entity as
cashable because by default entities are
not cached unless you specifically ask
hibernate to do so once we did those two
steps we were up we were all set to use
a second level cache ignore the cache is
being used by default we don't have to
specifically write any commands in order
to use the cache hibernate automatically
takes care of that for us
so if same you know object is accessed
across two different sessions the second
level cache comes into play and it's
going to give us the data from the cache
now this is fine but now let's say I
instead of using a session dot get what
I'm doing is I'm pulling up data using a
query so let's say I have a session road
create query and okay let me remove this
and I will use the query object in order
to get the same data now what I will do
is a lower query equals session dot
create query and I will write the query
here from user details sure
their user dot and let's verify the ID
again it's user ID user ID equals one
I'm not going to do any parameter
substitution because I want to keep this
example simple now query is something
I'll have to import from Java X or
persistence I'm sorry from hibernate so
let me remove that okay I've got
hibernate I'm importing this okay now
what I need to do is I need to do a
query dot list and it's going to give me
the list of records here is just one
record it's going to give me a list list
equals query dot list
we'll have to import the query I'm in
the list again from Java dot util okay
so this is exactly the same as what we
have done earlier instead of using a
session dot get what I'm doing is a
session direct create query now I will
use the same thing in this new session
so what I'm doing this after after
getting the list of users I'm closing
this session opening in your session and
I'm going to do the same thing so I will
say call this query two and we'll use
the same list that's fine let's say
query to that list okay now how many
queries will run let's check this
session is closed yeah that's because
I've been using the old one the session
- okay so there you can see it's running
to select queries first one is for the
first session and the second one is for
the second session now why is this so
because we have already specified the
cache right
oh here here you can see we already have
the H cache in place now the thing is
that hibernate differentiates queries as
something different we need to specify a
query cache separately I will talk in a
minute about why we need to do that but
see just like we have a you second level
cache we need to have another property
called use query cache and we need to
set that to true as well pretty cache we
set this to true okay so now what we're
doing is we have a second level cache
and we have a query cache now the query
cache is actually different from your
second level cache the results of the
query is not stored in the same place in
the cache as it would store the results
of a session or gate which it has cached
in the second level cache so actually
you can think of this as three separate
cache is in hibernate the first cache is
the session cache which you know which
is which comes up by default everything
inside a session is cached the second
cache is your second level cache and the
third cache is your query cache so in
order to use query cache first thing
which we need to we need to enable this
say use query cache this is already
there we have already provided the cache
provider so we don't need to do that
again if you are not using the second
level cache we're using just the query
cache you won't have to do this
this line is not required but these two
are required because we are enabling the
circuit could the query cache and we are
also specifying what's the provider okay
now when we enable the second they will
catch what we also did was we went to
the entity and we said hey make this
entity cacheable okay the same way for a
query we need to tell hibernate hey make
this query cacheable not all queries are
cached by default just like not all
entities are cached by default in the
second level cache so in order to make a
query cacheable what we need to do is
here after our session read create query
we need to say query dot set cashable
now the say query dot said cacheable is
a boolean takes the value of true or
false I am going to mark this as true so
what I'm doing is I'm telling hibernate
that execute this query but when you
execute the query make it as cashable I
have the query cache enabled over here
so put this results into that query
cache so that I can access it
subsequently now if I run this you can
see that it is still resulting in two
selects even though I have said this
cache will be less true so let me do one
thing I'll go to this query two and I
will set the square to two cashable as
well so I will say query two dot set
cashable not it is true save now let's
see how many queries search queries get
executed there you see there's only one
select query so the point to note here
is that set cashable not only catches
the query results it also tells the
query to look at the second level cache
and see if it's already there now
this set catchable
- the results of this query but since we
had not marked the cashable of this
query it actually went to the database
even though it was already available in
the second level cache now so if I set
this set cashable over here what this
set cashable is doing this it's telling
the query to look up the query cache and
not hit the database directly so so the
quiz you know the SEC cacheable is
performing two rules the first thing is
if the query cache is not already having
the values go to the database pull up
the records and set the query cache and
the query cache is already having the
values pull up the data from the query
cache so this is a way if we can
actually cache the results of queries
just a node to add here we need to use
query cache a bit carefully because
first of all we might end up with a
whole lot of data in a query this is
different from a session dot get of
course you can have associations and
still end up in a whole lot of data in a
session okay but in a query it is very
easy to make the whole system
inefficient just by caching something
which is not really required to be
cached or resulting in a situation where
the cache is getting updated very often
because you're catching something that's
updated often so we need to use this
with care but this is how you would use
it if you want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
