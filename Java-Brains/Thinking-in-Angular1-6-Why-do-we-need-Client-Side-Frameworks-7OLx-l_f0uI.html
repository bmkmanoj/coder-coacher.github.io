angularjs by talking a little bit about
what all these client-side frameworks
are trying to solve what's the problem
they're trying to solve angularjs is one
of several client-side programming
frameworks you have a lot of them out
there you have ember backbone react and
there are a lot more coming up so what
are all these client-side frameworks
trying to do what's the problem that
they're all trying to solve so we
covered by we need JavaScript we have
the Dom tree and any view change that
needs to happen needs to modify the Dom
tree and HTML being a static language
does not do that you need JavaScript to
interact and modify the Dom tree based
on user interaction so that you have
view updates that happen in the
client-side now how does this Dom
manipulation look like so javascript has
an ABI which does Dom manipulation
here's an example from the Mozilla
developer Network for how to change the
color of a particular paragraph tag so
you have this basic HTML code here the
paragraph tag has some text and you have
buttons which I'm an on-click event hook
all right so this calls a javascript
method called change color and it passes
in the color and name and I'm in the
change colour there is a colour which is
accepted and what this method has to do
is it has to get the element from the
Dom tree that it wants to modify which
it does by saying get element by ID off
paraone which is this paragraph it has
the ID param1 and then it gets that node
and it changes the color of that node
alright so this is how a typical
JavaScript Dom manipulation works you
write code to get whatever you need to
manually right there's a Dom tree
already right so you say hey browser
give me that element you get the element
you modified and then the browser
reflects it in the view alright so this
how it typically works as you can see
this is not very elegant code it takes a
while for you to get used to it if
you're in new do it right so here are
some reasons why this code sucks at
least in my opinion
first of all the coat is very messy
right it's not elegant secondly there is
no separation of concerns the JavaScript
code that you've written is very much
tied to the HTML the JavaScript code
kind of assumes that there is a
paragraph element with the ID paraone
because that's how it gets the element
from the Dom right it needs to know that
there is an element there so the cord in
JavaScript is very tightly coupled to
the cord in the HTML so it's harder to
maintain and it's harder to test so we
definitely need something better you
need some way of writing JavaScript code
on the client side without having it be
so messy without having it be coupled to
the done you might say well gosh it
what's the big deal it works right the
problem though is it works for simple
applications but imagine using this kind
of a code to build an application like
Gmail which is very very interactive and
has a lot of functionality so we need
something better what are the elements
on the client side we have the HTML
which is the view that you need to
modify and you have the data that feeds
the view okay
so you have data that populates with you
and we have the logic which takes the
data and controls the view all right so
this should look familiar what we're
looking at is the view model and
controller this is the typical NVC right
so as long as you have this separation
of these three elements the code becomes
easier to write and maintain right so
this is the same problem that
server-side developers have had for ages
all right we've had we were able to live
with having the whole thing live in one
particular JavaScript file an HTML file
on the client side because the
applications were in so complex but over
the years client-side applications have
grown and complexities so you need this
segregation on the client side - all
right so these are the standard elements
and this is the reason why you have a
lot of client-side MVC frameworks right
so a lot of these client-side frameworks
are MVC frameworks even though they may
not call themselves that so this is a
problem that all these different lines
have frameworks are trying to solve and
this is the problem that angular is
solid as well in the next unit you can
look at angularjs and see how angular
starts this problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
