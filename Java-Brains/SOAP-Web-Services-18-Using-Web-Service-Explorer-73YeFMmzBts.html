use to help us in our web service
development we looked at soap UI a
really good tool to test soap web
services in the previous tutorial in
this tutorial I'm going to talk about
one other tool which is really handy in
the sense that it actually comes with
eclipse itself you don't have to install
or download or anything it's already
there in Eclipse to get to this tool
just click on this button over here
which is launched the web services
Explorer if you don't see this button to
go to the window menu and customize
perspective
and here you should have this thing
checked launched the web services
Explorer so it'll be in the toolbar
visibility tab once you have this
checked you should see this button here
just click on it and you can launch the
web services Explorer
so what does the Web Services Explorer
do with true to its name let us explore
Web Services so there's this navigator
panel over here and it says uddi mean
what we actually need to do here is go
to one of these buttons over here yeah
this one which is the visited page now
in when you hover over this button and
say visited page so click on that and
you have a new navigator tab which is
visiting me right this is what we want
click and it shows open missiles so I
can actually open a visited URL to
explore so I'm going to paste my test
mat catalog service pistol URL and hit
go I've noticed that it actually shows
the service it shows the port and I can
expand this and it shows us the
individual operations so I have the
operations here as well and this is the
endpoint right it shows basically
details about the web service so if you
want to test an operation let's say I
want to test this get products v2 I just
click on it and now I can actually send
an input argument now r0 is the only
input argument I can send it's not very
intuitive that this is actually input
argument but you see here there is an
Add button so I can click on it and I
can add an argument that I can send to
the web service enter this argument I
press GO and here at the button you see
there is a response which is this is the
product all these output values are
actually shown over here ok so I can
test some other operation let's try
fetch categories
now fashion categories does not take any
inputs so I just said go and in the body
you see the responses over here so for
simple testing you don't really need to
OPI right you know the facility is
already available in Eclipse
now the Vistal itself is available over
here and what I can do here is import
visitors to workbench right I'm going to
import this Vistal I can give it a name
this test Mart catalog service card
wisdom and here I can choose which
project I need to input the visible to
I'm going to import it to the test my
project that I already have and actually
go now it says that the pistol has been
successfully imported now if you go to
the project Explorer tab you see there
is this vis still file that you've just
important double click on it and you can
see the Eclipse whistle plug-in
rendering the whistle in a nice format
it's a graphical format of rendering the
Vistal a lot of things in the Vistal
that we've already learned are very
clear over here so you can see that
there is a service the service has a
port and then you see all these
individual operations I can click on
them and see the input and the output
for the input I can click and I can see
the types over here so you see there are
different operations and different types
so I can narrow down to each type and
basically I can browse the vessel
graphically right so we have seen the
visit in an XML format here I'm actually
doing a graphical browsing of the same
wisdom so it's handy to see you know if
it's if the visitor is very complicated
it's actually easy to browse through the
Vista and see the different operations
and the types over here so this these
are a couple of tools that come with
Eclipse the very handy when you are
working with
large wisdoms which have a lot of XML
content to it can actually browse
through them fairly easy and the the
first tool that I showed you is a way to
send simple requests and examine the
response without having to install any
external tool like soap UI or anything
of that sort so I hope these tools are
handy and I definitely encourage you to
explore them a bit more again as with
the soap UI there are a few more
advanced things you can do with these
tools just to be honest I haven't used
them in a whole lot of detail but I'm
sure once you explore it you are sure to
find a whole lot of ways in which it
makes your workflow easier so again I
hope this helps and I hope you enjoy
exploring them thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
