nerd XML to make this a springboard
project at least get all the jars that
we needed for this to be a springboard
project we're going to go into some more
details about what these things do a bit
later but for now I'm going to close
this file and I'm going to go to the
next step in building a spring good
application what I'm going to do now is
create a simple Java class so I'm going
to go to SRC main Java and here I'm
going to right-click create a new class
and this is going to be I'm going to put
this in the package I will dot Java
brain start spring boots starter and the
name of this is going to be course API
that okay so this is the main the
starting point for our application and
this is going to be a Java class believe
it or not but the maiden method I'm
going to click public static void main
and click finish
so this is gonna be a Java class which
has a main method and this is where
we're going to bootstrap a springboard
application now why am i creating a
class with the main method you remember
I told you how spring boot creates a
spring application that's standalone
doesn't need a servlet continued it
doesn't need to be deployed on a server
the way it works is by having a class
with the main method that you can start
just like any other simple Java program
which has a main method and this takes
care of everything
this creates that servlet container
starts it and hosts your application for
you that seems like quite a lot so this
is going to be very complicated code
right well turns out it's not so so what
is the code that needs to go here in
order to set up a simple application
start the sublet container and host that
application in that sublet container
well here are the steps step one we
somehow to find a way to tell spring
that this is a spring application how do
we do this there is an annotation which
lets us do exactly this and we need to
annotate
the main class the class with the main
method with this annotation and the
annotation is that springboard
application and this we should have in
the class pad because of the things
we've added to the Palm D'Or XML and
here you go
it's from spring hard Spring Framework
boot auto-configure now this annotation
that tells spring pool that this is the
starting point for our spring board
obligation now what should the contents
of this main method be you need to tell
spring boot to start this application
which is the course API app and then
create a sublet container and host this
application in that sublet container and
make it available right those are the
things that you need well that seems
like a lot of code but turns out spring
wood has a really nice utility which
lets us do this in just one line and you
have that available by a static method
you just need to call one static method
and it's going to do all that stuff for
you so the name of the class the static
classes
spring application dot run so this is
the static method we need to call so
there is a static class called spring
application and that has a method called
run that takes in two arguments the
first argument is the class where you
have the main method that's annotated
with a springboard application well
that's course API app so I'm going to
pass that in here course API app dot
class I need to pass in the class which
is the first argument to run the second
argument to run is basically the
arguments that could have been passed to
the main method so if you want to pass
in arguments to the spring application
run you can just pass in arguments to
the course API app when you run it and
it is going to pass that in through this
so the args variable is just going to be
a pass through essentially what we're
doing is you're calling a static method
spring application run and you're
passing the name of the class where you
have your main method and the second
argument is just a pass through off the
args I'm going to save this and
believe it or not this is our
springboard application he doesn't do
anything but it is it is a spring good
application and it has everything it
needs to create that servlet container
and run it you don't believe me let's
run this so I'm going to click the Run
button over here we're just going to run
the main method off this course API app
and I click this I'm going to run this
as a java application the springboard
app is an extra option that we're going
to get because we are using this spring
tool suite but I'm going to ignore that
and run this as a plain Java application
click ok let's open the console you see
here there's a lot of stuff that's
happening and it's all coming from
spring so you see here let me expand
this we have this nice ASCII art which
reads spring let's is it spring boot and
the version number that I'm using
there's a bunch of stuff that's doing
over here but here you see there is this
one line which says started course API
app in two and a half seconds so we have
the application started tomcat started
on port 8080 so I wasn't kidding it's
actually started the servlet container
so let's verify if it actually has done
that if I were to open a browser and go
to localhost 8080 I get an enter page so
this is an error from the tomcat servlet
container it's an error page which says
there is no explicit mapping for slash
error so you're seeing this as a
fallback so what's happening is I access
to URL and since there is no mapping for
the URL it tries to go to slash error
but there is no mapping for slash error
as well which is why I get an error page
like this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
