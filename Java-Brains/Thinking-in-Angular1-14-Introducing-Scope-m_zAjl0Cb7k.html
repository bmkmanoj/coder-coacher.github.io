what happened in the third exercise so
this should hopefully give you a better
idea the high level of all these
different pieces work she had the HTML
which was a core right and you had the
angularjs script inside it that was the
script tag and we linked it to angularjs
then we used three directors that came
after the box that angularjs we did not
create these directives these came after
the box and we were able to use it note
the naming convention here again it's ng
- which means these are angular
directives okay we use these three
directives in our HTML and since this
came with angular they were applied
angular was able to know what to do then
it saw those directives and it easily
applied the right functionality but here
is a question we created available using
ng in it right we created the R of day
variable and that was an expression in
ng in it but then we used that variable
in a different director we used it in ng
if now how do these two directed stuck
to each other there is one directive
which created the variable and another
directive which used the variable that
was created in the first derivative how
do they talk to each other the way they
talk to each other is by sharing a
common space a common space where all
these variables are declared the space
is called the scope right all these
three directives actually talk to each
other by using the scope when you use a
variable in each of these expressions
right when you use a VD variable in ng
in it to initialize available and you
use the variable again in ng if it was
the same variable because they were both
referring to this common space called
the scope when you create a variable or
you use it it's always pointing to the
scope think of a scope as an object and
the variable as a property of that
object
when angular application starts it
creates this object called the scope
which is going to be this container
where all your variables are going to be
placed all right so that's a common
scope object in G in it created a
variable what it did was it actually
created a property on the scope object
ng-if had did a read from that variable
what did he do it I was actually reading
a property from the scope object so
anytime you use a variable in any of
these directives within the expression
of these directives they're actually
referring to a property of this scope
you don't have to say scope dot R of T
you just have to say R of T an angular
automatically adds the scoped out in
front of it and it refers to it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
