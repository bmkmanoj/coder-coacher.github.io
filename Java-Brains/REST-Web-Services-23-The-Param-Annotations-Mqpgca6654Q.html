adding any new API to the machine
instead what I want to focus on is a
couple more annotations that you can use
to inject some more values so if you
look at the message resource resource
class you can see that all these values
are actually being injected to the
methods in our resource handling class
so we looked at path param we looked at
query parameter are a few more things
you can access from the HTTP request I'm
going to create a separate demo resource
to show you what they are
you're not going to be using them in the
messenger application but they're a good
thing to know because you would have a
lot of opportunities to use them and
access those values from the request so
I'm going to create a new resource class
I'm going to call this inject demo
resource so I'm gonna click finish and
copy over these annotations which I'm
going to annotate at the class level I'm
going to call this inject demo so it's a
separate end point where I can demo all
these different ways to inject values
and I'm going to use plain text here for
the request and the response I'm going
to be rendering JSON so the one thing
that I wanted demo is a lot of the
annotations that let you access these
parameters so we looked at great param
and data ramp there are a few more of
these param annotations that you can use
one example is what's called matrix per
app so let me create a new method over
here get params using annotations I'm
just going to return return an empty
string for now and I'm going to expose
this at the endpoint because
do a get-well expose this at the
endpoint annotations okay so I'm going
to just start on test to make sure this
works now if I access this URL into a
get request well I get the test message
back make sure your header is clear you
don't want to send excerpts JSON because
we're just stealing the plain text in
this in this tutorial so well this works
now what we what are the parameters that
we can access the first one is called
metrics parameter X params
are very similar to query params but
they have a different slightly different
format so it's in query parameter right
param equals value so in the case of
matrix parameter proceed by us and my
colon this is the only difference well
there is actually one more semantic
difference that I'm not going to get
into the details of that but some people
use it it's not as widely used but it is
a way to send parameters in URLs and
jax-rs
and jersey have a way to access matrix
params and that's actually very similar
to the vu axis query params so the way
to do that is using an annotation call
that matrix Prime and I pass in the
value as an attribute and then accept it
I'm going to call it matrix
but I'm and I'm going to return the same
matrix plan and import the same package
and if I try this again
and there you go the value that we send
so this is this is one way in Michigan
pass parameters I don't know if you are
going to be using this but if you ever
use matrix params this is the way to do
this the other parameter that you can
access is header parameters so you see
this there is the header section where
we said you know the content type and
all that stuff you can actually send
custom header values and that's going to
be very handy when we handle
authentication and security and all that
stuff right you can have declined send
custom values in the header right so I
can have something like a custom header
value and then the value being send
could be like 200 or something like that
right so we need to be able to access
the custom headers and jax-rs and jersey
has a way to do that as well and that's
again using an annotation on a method
argument so I'm going to use at
that header pram and then the parameter
name is this whatever whatever you want
right go to the custom value you access
I'm going to accept a string and import
this and then of course if I print this
it's a show up
except the header now if I send this
value let's say s n test value and I hit
Send it's going to get that header
better
so this head eponymous is something that
you might use more that he says more
than the matrix but on so you would
typically use header param to send
metadata about the request like the
authentication token or something like
that and you can create your own auth
session ID as a parameter and send in
some some token value and then be able
to access it by just accessing this over
here right and then you can you can get
hold of that token and then check for
authentication all that stuff so so
that's something that's good to know all
right so the third thing that you can
access is the cookie value so I'm going
to add third annotation cookie / ham and
give the cookie name I can access the
cookie so import this let's look at a
cookie that's already here so I have a
test cookie over here with the name name
and the value being hello so I can
access that over here so I just pass in
the cookie name here it's name and I can
get the value of that cookie so I'm
going to just print that out and if I
access this again I get the cookie value
so we have got three different
parameters we have the matrix parameter
per am and the cookie per arm to get the
cookie these annotations are in addition
to the path param and the query
parameter tations that we've already
seen there's one more that I haven't
covered which is called form param this
is many one access form submissions so
in HTML we
you can have an HTML form and then when
you submit it the values go as key value
pairs right so there is a key which is
the name of the control like a text box
or something like that and the value
being the value of the text box so if
you want to capture requests like that
which is being sent from an HTML form to
a REST API you would use form param it's
not very widely used and you wouldn't
usually submit data to a REST API using
an HTML form so it's not as as widely
used but it is there that's one of the
annotations so these are all these are
called the palem annotations which let
which let you kind of cherry pick the
kind of data that you want from the
request if you know beforehand what the
attribute is and how it is being sent
it's very simple to access that in your
controller just by putting that
annotation and having you know method
argument which gets that data for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
