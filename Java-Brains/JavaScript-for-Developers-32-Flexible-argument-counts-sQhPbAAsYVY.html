is what happens if I call this function
with just one argument now you notice I
have declared the say hello function
with two arguments if I just call that
but if I call it with two arguments the
right argument the right value goes to
the right argument right so kashyyk is
going to go to the first argument that
afternoon is going to go to the second
argument but what happens if I do
something like this can you guess
typically in other languages which are
strict about these kind of things this
would actually result in a compilation
error right the compiler or the Java
compiler would say there is no function
called say hello which accepts just one
argument I just see a function with call
say hello which accepts two arguments
and since you are calling a function
with just one argument it cannot be that
function so it doesn't call it it gives
a compiler error right away but that
does not happen in JavaScript in
JavaScript if you call a function which
you've declared as X number of arguments
but you don't send all those X number of
arguments it sees you send something
less the function still gets called but
now the question is if the function does
get called what is going to be the value
of the second argument which I'm not
supplying there is an argument called
time of day and I'm not sending that
argument what is going to be the value
the value it turns out is going to be
undefined again javascript is using
undefined as a way to guess what the
value would be rather than give an error
we've seen this happen in a lot of other
scenarios and the same thing happens
even here as well
javascript doesn't know what to do there
is no value there so just assigns
undefined and then goes ahead with the
execution so if I execute this you see
it says hello Kaushik it got the first
value but time of day is undefined
because I did not sign this all right oh
okay now what if I add extra parameters
we've looked at but you know ways in
which you can send parameters to the
same function but not as many parameters
as was expected and JavaScript just
assigns undefined to those values but
now what if I add more stuff right so
let's say I
evening as the second argument which is
going to correspond to time of day but
now what if I add one more that you add
42 as a third argument and the function
is not even expecting the third argument
can I guess what happens if I execute
this it's very likely that you're going
to guess this right if I reload and run
nothing happens 42 is essentially
ignored so again a script is flexible
when it comes to variables you know
arguments matching based on count for
our function executions if the number of
arguments you send to a function is less
than what it expects the remaining
arguments are going to be assigned
undefined values and if the number of
arguments that you are sending to the
function is more than what the function
expects the extra arguments are just
ignored
okay so JavaScript is super flexible
when it comes to this it doesn't
complain it just assume certain things
based on these two rules and then it
proceeds with execution this also has
another implication which is that
overloaded functions are not possible in
JavaScript if you're not familiar with
the concept of overloaded functions it
is that you can have multiple functions
and this is in some other languages like
Java or C++ you can have multiple
functions with the same name but with
different number of arguments okay so
you can have let's say an add function
which takes two arguments you can have
another function called add the same
name but which takes three arguments now
if you call add with two arguments the
function that accepts two arguments is
run and if you call add with three
arguments the function that accepts
three arguments is run so the compiler
matches the arguments count if there are
multiple functions declared with
different argument comes this is not
possible in JavaScript obviously because
there is they can be just one function
for the given name depending on the
function you know there is no way in
which JavaScript can have you know look
at the argument count and decide which
function to execute no matter what the
argument count is it's always going to
be the same function
make assumptions on your behalf</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
