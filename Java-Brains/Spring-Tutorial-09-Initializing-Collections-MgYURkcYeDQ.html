about spring support for collection
objects so far we've seen how to define
individual values for primitives as well
as individual values for objects now the
question is what if one of our member
variables here was actually a collection
now how would you initialize a
collection so spring provides support
for that they're actually a three core
interfaces the Java provides you have a
list set and a map all the three are
supported by spring we have a
corresponding tags that we can use in
our XML let's tag the set tag and the
map tag in this tutorial we're going to
quickly demonstrate the list tag and
then the map in the set are fairly
straightforward as well so you can look
at the syntax in the documentation so
what I'll do here is I'll change these
properties
I actually reverted all the changes in a
previous tutorial so right now what we
have is a triangle bean with three
separate point beans so a triangle has
three points and each of those refer to
a separate bean in the spring run XML so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
change this to a a list so instead of
having three separate member variables
I'll just have a private list of point
objects I'll call it points will have to
update the getters and setters first
I'll import the list from Java util and
I will generate the getters and setters
okay so in this case I will have to
update the draw method so what I'll do
is I will look through this list of
points even though I know there are
three I will loop through them and I'll
print out all the points so for each
point in points
I shall print out point target X and 1.8
y okay and I will save this so now I
have a list member variable now when I'm
using my springboard XML to initialize
the strangle object I need to mention
this to be a list so instead of having
three different property tags what I'll
have is just one property diet let me
remove this I'll just have one property
tag name equals of course the name of
the member variable again points and the
value instead of specifying the value
are like includes this outside and I
will have a list tag here so this is
going to be a list and then inside this
list here I'll be specifying all the
individual elements of the list so in
this case it happens to be three
different point objects which is zero
point zero point two and point three so
I will refer to them by using the ref
tag beam equals
zero point close the tag and then
similarly for point two and point three
so this is how I initialize my list so
normally what will happen is if this
were a single value we would have a
property tag and then we would have
either a value or a ref but now since
this is a list what we need to do is we
need to define a list tag and then add
these references inside the list tag so
no matter how many references you add
it's going to be that many elements in
this list and so this member variable
which is a list of points is going to
have that many elements now the thing
here is that we are using the type
conversion of spring so here I have
defined this as a list of points so
spring is going to automatically convert
the type depending on whatever you
specify here now say you had a list of a
different data type here say a list of
integers now if in your list you had
specified value tags and then you had
all those values it would automatically
convert to India's and then you would
still end up with a list of integers
with the values that you've specified so
just make a note of that there is type
conversion that's happening here as well
so now let me save and run the class one
more time well there you go
the points have come up but here what's
happening is instead of three separate
member variables it's reading this off a
list so similarly you can use set and
map data types as well they have the
corresponding XML values you can use
and/or initialize these properties again
this is something that you would not
normally use especially if you have a
huge list you probably get it out of a
property file but it would get it out of
a database but then if you need some
small lists to be initialized then this
is the way to do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
