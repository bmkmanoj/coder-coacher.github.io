on hibernate in the previous tutorials
we have learned how to write entity
classes we have learned how to map the
associations between entity classes and
we learn the different relationships in
the associations now in this tutorial
and in the subsequent couple of
tutorials we are going to look at
another important factor when it comes
to object relational mapping and the
thing that we are going to talk about is
inheritance inheritance is is one of the
important features of any
object-oriented programming and it is
very specific to object-oriented
programming you don't have an equivalent
of inheritance in a relational model so
this is quite a challenge for any object
relational mapping tool to implement
which is mapping your inheritance of
your classes to a relational table how
would the mapping happen um let's take
an example of a vehicle class this is
something that we had used in our
earlier tutorial but we're going to
expand on the vehicle part of the
inheritance we're going to look at a
vehicle base class and we will inherit
this class into a few other specific
vehicle classes like say you know a two
wheeler and a four-wheeler so let's say
I have this vehicle class and then I
extend this vehicle class to create a
two wheeler vehicle class and a
four-wheeler vehicle class so these two
classes inherit from this main vehicle
class now let's say I have objects off
vehicle I have objects off to wheeler
and I have objects of four-wheeler in my
application now how would I save the
data inside these objects to tables in
you know in the database
how would hibernate map this and how I
can configure this is something that
we're going to look at now first of all
why do we need inheritance mapping say I
have have different classes they have
extended the vehicle class to implement
a two wheeler and a four wheeler so
these two are two
separate classes now why don't I just
mark them as entity as well and save
them if it's separate tables hey that
should work because no matter what the
inheritance is of these classes they are
separate classes as such and you can
mark them as entity so I not do that why
bother about inheritance to understand
the need for mapping inheritance let's
take this example I have an abstract
vehicle class and this class has ID name
and the license number of the vehicle we
are saving this information in the
vehicle class now I have two classes
that extend the cervical class I have a
two-wheeler class and a 4-wheeler class
now the tubular class has an extra
property called the steering handle and
the 4-wheeler class has a steering wheel
now this is my base abstract class I am
NOT going to have objects of this class
I will have objects of either the to be
the class or the 4-wheeler class and I
will want to persist them both so one
option is as we said earlier we can mark
these two classes of entities and a
two-wheeler class will go to a separate
table and a 4-wheeler class will go to a
separate table which is fine we can just
use that to process the data but there
are a couple of problems here since we
are talking about inheritance
what is the one coolest feature of
inheritance provided by Java it is
polymorphism now let's say I have a user
user object and this user object has a
reference to a vehicle class and I want
to paly
you know I want to dynamically assign
either a two-wheeler or a four-wheeler
object to the user class so I have a
reference to a vehicle say something
like this now this vehicle is a
placeholder for both the two wheeler and
of course we like an easy as any one of
these objects over here and I wouldn't
know until runtime what it's going to be
now the problem is say I want to
purchase this user class and it has a
reference to say or two wheeler now when
I'm saving the
use a glass to the database how would I
map out this relationship say I have
have three tables here one is the user
user table one is a two-wheeler table
and one is a 4-wheeler table now what
will be the foreign key here what ID
will I save here will I save the ID of
the two-wheeler or will I save the idea
of the 4-wheeler I cannot I cannot have
a funky relationship to both I have to
choose one table and it's not possible
because I have a vehicle class here it
could be either vehicle it could be you
know if the user object that I'm trying
to save has owns a two-wheeler then this
would be a reference to the two wheeler
table where I have saved the tabular
data and if these if this user object
has a four-wheeler then when I'm saving
this I will have to have a reference to
the the record in the four-wheeler table
so this is where it gets tricky I have
you know a base class that's implemented
in my user object and I want to save the
relationship dynamically and I want to
use the feature of polymorphism I cannot
do that if I have you know I treat this
as two separate entities I need to tell
a hibernate that okay this is and
inheritance it's happening here and we
need to map this differently this is
this is one reason why you would want
implement inheritance the second reason
is say for example I changed this
vehicle class later on and I add a
different field here what would happen
is thanks to the Java inheritance these
two classes would automatically get that
field added but when it comes to the
database you would still have only these
columns since you are treating this as a
separate object and a separate table
whatever changes you make here will not
get propagated you would have to do this
manually so considering all these if you
have a strong implementation of
inheritance and you are utilizing all
the features of inheritance that Java
provides like polymorphism and dynamic
assignment of objects and all those
things then it's a good idea to you know
implement the hibernate feature of
inheritance and use the you know the the
functionalities that hibernate provides
for us when it comes to inherited
classes so having said that let's have a
look I
how we can implement inheritance there
are there are a few options that we have
when we can map inherited classes and
the option that we can you know option
that we need to choose to implement
depends on specific scenarios so we're
going to have a look at that so we'll
start with writing these three classes
which is the vehicle the two wheeler and
the four-wheeler and we will not specify
any inheritance mapping and we'll see
what happens I will retain this the base
vehicle class I won't make this as an
abstract because I want to demonstrate
something else here so I will treat this
as an entity class itself for now and I
will write two classes that will extend
this vehicle class so this is this very
simple I've removed all the other extra
stuff that we had going in our previous
examples so it just has a generated ID
vehicle ID and it has a simple vehicle
name property that's that's there to it
there is nothing else here so we'll keep
it simple so these are the two fields in
my vehicle class and I have mapped this
as an entity so without doing anything
else
hibernate is going to treat this as a
separate entity and it's going to create
a table for this now what I'll do is I
will create two new classes I will you
know create the two wheeler and the four
wheeler which will extend this vehicle
class so I'll start with the two wheeler
and the superclass is going to be wake
up
let's see finish now this extends
vehicle now what I lose I'll have I have
another field here call this the private
string steering handle two wheeler has a
handlebar while a four wheeler has a
steering wheel so I just have that as a
demarcation here and solute getters and
setters for this okay save this
similarly I will also generate a
four-wheeler again I'm extending vehicle
finish
okay now I have to get us in setters for
this as well now what happens if I just
let me see if this guy as well so what
happens if I just mark this is an entity
and let let hibernate implement this as
separate entities of course I'll have to
import from Java extra persistence I
don't have an ID here because it's
inheriting from Vega entity again and I
will import this as well okay now if I
just try to persist these two these two
objects then there is something that
hibernate does by default I'll just
demonstrate that with a simple example
and later we'll see why that's happening
so I have a new Baker okay now what I'll
do is I'll create a new two-wheeler as
well okay let me remove user we don't
need that now what I'll do is I'll
create a 4-wheeler as well okay so now I
have a vehicle object have a bike object
a car object so I have a vehicle two
wheeler and four wheeler
now all the three are entities there is
nothing that we have mentioned to
hibernate to tell that we want the
implement inheritance even though the
tubular and four-wheeler are both
inheriting from this vehicle so now what
I'll do is I'll save the vehicle the
bike and the car so I will use a session
dot save works fine
and I will comment the transaction so
that it gets saved and there's one other
thing which will have to do which is go
to the configuration and add those two
mapping classes as well
okay now we are all set so now what
happens if I run this how is hyponym
gonna create the tables now look at
what's happening we have a vehicle table
if they it's not created any other table
it's created just one table called the
vehicle and now it has saved the vehicle
name the vehicle ID and it has created
something course a column called a CD
type okay and what's happened is it's
also inserting the steering handle and
the steering wheel into the same table
it's not created two separate tables
even though we have marked this as an
entity and the other one the two-wheeler
also as an entity even though there have
been marked as entities it's not created
two separate tables instead what it has
done is it has mapped everything to the
base class table itself to the vehicle
now the vehicle itself has the steering
handler and the steering wheel
properties note that this steering
handler was defined in the subclass of
vehicle which was a two wheeler and this
steering wheel was defined in a subclass
of vehicle which was a four wheeler now
hibernate has by default implemented a
strategy for inheritance coil as a
single table strategy which means that
no matter what your inheritance strategy
is in the written hierarchy is it will
create one common table for all the
objects say you have you know you know
you take you have a posh class which
actually implements the four wheeler
class that you have and the posh has a
separate column for it what it will do
is it will also add that column to this
vehicle table so all your children all
your child classes whatever vehicles
they I mean whatever columns they have
it's all going to be added to one common
table for the base class which
this vehicle table and depending on
whether a Seafarer for this bike row of
the bike has a steering wheel I mean the
steering handle so the steering handle
value has been added for this bike
record but the Porsche has a steering
wheel so the steering wheel value has
been added for the for the Porsche
record so for all the bike records that
get saved into this vehicle table you
will not have any value for the steering
wheel and for all the car records that
gets added to this vehicle table you
won't have any value for the steering
handle so the two wheeler records will
have only the steering handle which has
been declared in that class and the four
wheeler records will have only the
steering wheel value which has been
declared for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
