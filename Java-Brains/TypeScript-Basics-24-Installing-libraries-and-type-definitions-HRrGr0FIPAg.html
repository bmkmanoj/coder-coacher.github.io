project is that you can manage
dependencies using it right so I can say
npm install and then you're clack egde
that you can that you need in your
application you can download it and
install it from the NPM repository and
then use it in your code so I'm going to
demonstrate this by using a package
called low - low - is a utility library
for JavaScript which has a lot of
collection and object related functions
it lets you manage collections in manage
arrays it lets you filter arrays map and
things like that there's a lot of
utility functions that you can use so
I'm gonna be installing low - first and
I'm gonna be using it in the typescript
code the reader installed a library in a
node project is by using NPM install the
name of the library and then you use the
- - save in order to save it to the
local directory where you're running and
then make an entry into package store
JSON so that it gets registered as a
dependency so I'm going to install
lodash now I'm gonna do a - - save to
have the low - dependency registered in
package store JSON so you notice what
happens when I hit enter over here it's
going to download the lower - dependency
and it's gonna register it in my back to
start its own over here like this - is
registered with a certain version number
now lure - is available in my node
modules folder and it's available for
use in my typescript project right so
let's say I create a more array has one
two three four five it's a simple number
array I want to reverse this array no -
has a reverse function how do I import
low - but person I kind of knew what the
name of the class was here it's
exporting person I can get that but with
low - I don't really want to selectively
choose and one pretty much everything so
in order to do that the syntax is import
star from
hello - but a couple of things that are
happening here
star basically says I want everything
I'm importing everything from law - and
the second thing here is the from is not
a relative path like you had over here
it was a dot slash person so but lo - I
don't actually have to go to dot dot
slash node modules folder slash low -
they don't have to do that if I were to
just enter the library name as is it is
gonna pick it up from the node modules
folder so this is the convention for
picking it up from node modules now
since I'm importing everything from lo -
I want to be able to use it with a
variable name and I need to give this a
name whatever I'm importing from below -
which happens to be everything I want to
give it a name and I give it a name by
using the as and the name I'm using
underscore here I could call this foo
and now everything is called foo right
now I'm gonna give this an underscore
because that's a convention for lo - now
how do I use this library
well I know that there is a reverse
function in lo - which lets you reverse
at it so I can Zulu underscore dot the
reverse and then array the past in an
array and it is going to reverse the at
is gonna return an array which is the
reverse I happen to know this but
wouldn't it be nice if we were to just
do a dot and then have autocomplete
happen well it doesn't quite happen in
this case because there's a thing the
typescript compiler and the editor the
IDE here actually kind of knows what the
autocomplete for the person class here
is for instance because it has the
source code right here so if I were to
do a food dot over here it knows that
there are two properties first name and
last name because it has the source code
right here it has a typescript code
right here but in the case of low - you
see here what its God is not typescript
it's got JavaScript code that's because
there's really nothing in the NPM
install process that's typescript
related when people through npm install'
lodash
they're probably working on a JavaScript
code right they're probably not using
typescript so the npm install process
gets you JavaScript code and JavaScript
like we know does not contain any typing
information so how is it possible for me
to somehow facilitate this autocomplete
for indium installed modules just like
you have autocomplete for the local
source chord just like a person I'd like
to do autocomplete for underscore as
well and also the typescript compiler
would like to check for types for the
NPM installed API sis well if you were
to use a low - API typescript compiler I
would like to make sure that you're
using it right for instance if you're
passing a string to a function that
expects a number in library near node
modules folder since it starts yes you
won't be able to catch it but we'd like
to catch it in order to facilitate these
things like autocomplete and type
checking for for libraries that you've
installed in your load modules folder
you can use what's called type
definitions type strip has an option of
type definitions which let you define
types in addition to the source code how
do you do that one thing you can do is
do an NPM install off somehow a low -
type script implementation right so in
this in this case you're gonna get the
typescript version of low - and you're
gonna be fine right people who are using
javascript can just install low - and
the people using typescript can install
low - - TS or whatever and you're gonna
get the typescript version all the
typing features are now available to you
even in your libraries the 10 that means
that somebody has to implement low - all
over again in typescript - wasn't
written in typescript I guess so you
would want to write the whole thing
again in a different language to avoid
this what people have done is created
this thing called type definitions this
involves typescript files which don't
implement the library all over again but
it has declarations for all the api's
and you have type information for all
those api's and those type definitions
are available in NPM repository
so you can install the lodash type
definition it's a separate NPM module
it's a separate NPM package three can
install it's not called this exactly but
the concept is you install the type
definition is a separate NPM module and
then you have all the type information
for type script to do its job this type
definition is available under a package
called types and then you have several
libraries under it so lore - happens to
be one of those libraries and when
installed types /lo - i'm gonna do save
dev i want this to be saved as a
development dependency so that it's not
bundled with the final output again this
is specific to NPM not going to cover
this in detail google this if you wanna
learn more but essentially what this is
doing is getting the lodash type
definitions and installing it in the
node modules folder I'm gonna save this
and I'm in package star JSON you see you
have a dev dependencies node which
contains types for lo - all right now
I'm gonna switch to index dot TS and now
if i do underscore dot here you see you
get all the type information for lo -
that are a bunch of functions that you
have available to you and you get you
know you do a control space you're gonna
get those things in order complete and
now there is a reverse function as well
as you can see here and now I'm going to
pass in the array and I'm going to do
console dot log in order to print this
the reverse study and now if I were to
run NPM start tightrope is going to
compile and I'm gonna get the reversed
array back so in a nutshell what did we
do with our MPM install and install the
library and the library goes into the
node modules folder can we use it right
away
so you wouldn't
get the benefit of typescript you
wouldn't get type information even get
type checking because the library is
possibly implemented in JavaScript what
you get
we need to npm install is javascript but
there are certain other libraries which
are called type definition libraries and
you have type definition libraries that
have been created by a lot of good
people out there they have corresponding
type definition libraries for a lot of
the popular JavaScript libraries and
lodash also happens to have a type
definition library and that's available
with this name that types slash lodash
and if you expand this just what was
getting regenerated and these are
specifically in typescript format this
is not a reimplementation of the library
like a cover it just contains the type
definitions and you once you install it
it's available for the typescript
compiler it's available for your ID for
autocomplete purposes and you get the
benefit of typescript not only for your
own code but also for the library city
of install using NPM</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
