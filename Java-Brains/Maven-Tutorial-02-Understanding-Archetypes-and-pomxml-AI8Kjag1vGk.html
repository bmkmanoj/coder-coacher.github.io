create a java application and we also
used it to compile build and package
third application the advantage of using
maven is that maven does a lot of things
behind the scenes we didn't have to
configure each and every step I believe
we just ran two to three commands and we
were able to achieve all these actions
which is creating the source code
directories configuring the dependencies
compiling and packaging
even though maven does all these things
automatically for us it helps to
understand what's happening behind the
scenes so that we can better control it
so we'll have a look at some of the
things that meeven has done for us in
our short example in a previous tutorial
we'll try to understand what's happening
behind the scenes so the first thing
that maven did for us was to create the
project source code template so we
didn't have to create each and every
directory we don't have to create create
the whole package structure and the
source code maven automatically created
the whole template it also created a
simple class for us the second thing
that maven helped us do was to actually
build and package the application so we
were able to compile and package the
code into a jar file so in this tutorial
we look at the first first point here
which is creating the whole source code
structure and you see how many mean does
that so the first step of the process
was to run the maven archetype :
generate command so the output of this
step was that we had the folder
structure and bombed-out XML or not hard
disk so this was downloaded from the
maven repository depending on the inputs
that we provided so what are the inputs
that we actually provided for the maven
archetype : generate so the first the
first input that we provided was the
archetype this is information to maven
as to what is the kind of project that
we need you remember may even came up
with a huge list of our types
so each archetype corresponds to a
particular type of application that you
want to develop there are there are
types for Java EE applications there are
types for say a spring application
hibernate application so all these are
types are available in the main
and repository and each archetype is a
good starting point for the type of
application that you want to build if
you want to build a simple java web
application you would use the web
application archetype and you would take
it from there
once we had chosen the archetype the
next set of inputs that maven expects
from us is the group ID and the artifact
ID these two identify what is the output
that we are generating say our project
generates a jar file now we need to give
a group ID and an artefact ID for that
jar file so the artifact here is the
output of our project if it's in if it's
a web application it would be a war if
it's an enterprise application it's in
here and in our case it was a simple
java application so it was a jar file so
this lets us know what is the name of
the artifact that is the output of our
project and the group ID is an
explanatory ID that we give to group all
these artifacts say I have a big project
- you know I'm actually having five to
six at effects that's output so all
those artifacts would come under a
common group ID umbrella now what about
the version the version had a default of
1.0 snapshot so 1.0 makes sense because
we are creating a new application but
snapshot is used when you want to have a
piece of code still in development it's
not yet released and once you would
complete the development and have a
major release that's when you would
actually mark it as a release so this is
something that you have you can use as
best practice when you're releasing the
code but for now snapshot should do when
we are actually developing so the final
output is package package is the name of
the package where we needed to place our
source code when we chose the archetype
it was a simple java application and
there was just one java class so this
package is actually information to maven
as to what package that class should
belong to depending on the input that we
provide over here the java class in that
archetype will be assigned to this
package so what's the impact of our
inputs here when we choose the archetype
they're actually deciding what is the
project structure this will control the
layout of the files the folder structure
and the dependencies that are required
now the group ID artifact ID the version
and the package will all affect what the
pom dot XML contains now all these
information whatever we add over here
will be entered in an XML call - pom dot
XML let's have a look at what pom dot
XML does so here's a bomb dot XML of our
example that we created in the previous
tutorial let's look at this section we
have the group ID at the fact ID and the
version number so these three are the
key for any particular artifact if you
have an artifact and then you want to
publish it to a repository maven can
identify any artifact by using a
combination of these three keys we also
have a packaging tag here which tells me
then what is the actual output whether
it's a jar or a war or a er in our case
it's a jar and this is again dependent
on the archetype that we have chosen if
we had chosen an archetype for a web
application this would probably be a
wash the name is name of our application
and this is how it would be identified
properties tells me when that the source
code encoding is utf-8 now have a look
at the dependency stack the dependencies
will have a list of all the dependencies
that this project has now in this case
dependency is only with j-unit now how
do you specify the dependency you again
use a combination of group ID artifact
ID and version so say for example J unit
releases a new version so the version
number would change to say 3.8 dot - the
group ID would be the same and the
artifact ID would be the same and if you
change the version number you would be
referring to the newer version so may
even uses these three combination of
these three
to defy a particular artifact in the
repository now if you want to use a
different artifact under the group J
unit you would change the artifact ID
here and you would choose the right
version number so it's like a it's kind
of like a tree this is the highest level
the group ID which has a whole lot of
artifacts inside it and you can choose
the right artifact by mentioning the
artifact ID here and the version of the
artifact here what a scope to scope is
something that tells maven then to use
this artifact you're not you're not
going to look at this now because this
is something that's used by maven when
we are building and packaging the
application ok so now that we understand
how maven uses the group ID artifact ID
and version to pull up an artifact from
the repository now this should make
sense
our group ID artifact ID and version
number should be in such a way that
other applications can consume our
artifact if we choose to release this
and save it in a repository now this is
applicable for other reasons as well say
you do not plan to publish this in you
know the online repository this is
something that you're going to use for
internal consumption may even actually
has an internal repository it has a
repository on your desktop itself now
whenever you actually build and package
any artifact it's going to install the
artifact into the local repository now
say I'm using a different web
application encoding a different web
application which uses this jar that I
have created over here all I need to do
is in the palm of that application I
need to add a dependency saying the
group ID is this the artifact ID is this
and the version is this so what maven
will do is it will first look at the
local repository and see if if there is
an artifact like this available and if
it's available it's going to pull up
from the local repository and if it's
not available it's going to go to the
online repository so to summarize these
are the information available in powered
XML we have the maven coordinates
the identifier of an artifact which
includes the group ID the artifact ID
and the version we have metadata about
the project we'll know what the project
is and what the version is and we have
the build information which says whether
the project is a jar or a bar or any air
and we have all the resources and
dependencies that are required to
successfully build the project which
comes under the dependency stack</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
