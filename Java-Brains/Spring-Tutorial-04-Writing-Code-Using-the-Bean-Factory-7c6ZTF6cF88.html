learned what the factory button is and
we learned about the bean factory off
spring in this tutorial we're going to
go hands-on we're going to write code
which uses the bean factory to
instantiate the objects that we want so
first let me start off with the writing
class with the main method that kicks
off the execution of our application so
I will create a package and the main
class call this drawing application and
I need a main method
in this trying application I will be
drawing some shapes so first let me
create a triangle shape create a new
class call this triangle I don't need a
mean with it for this one
thus triangle very simple as if now
it'll just have a public void draw ok
just prints out that a triangle is being
drawn save this now in my drawing
application first what I lose I'll not
use the bean factory I just say triangle
equals new triangle I'm going to use the
new and I will instantiate it just I was
just as if I would use it without using
Springs so if I see triangle draw it's
going to draw it's going to print that
statement which draws the triangle there
you go it draws a triangle but here we
are not using Springs let's use spring
now in order to use spring I will come
up this out see now we will not be using
a new command here you're not going to
instantiate the triangle object
ourselves will ask the bean factory to
do it so I let instantiate the bean
factory first let's say bean factory
equals new ok I need to provide an
implementation of the bean factory there
are different bean factory classes
available bean factory interface and
there are different implementation
classes I will use the XML bean factory
and the use of the XML bean factory is
that it
it will configure the bean factory using
an XML file earlier I told you that the
bean factory reads the blueprints of the
beans from a configuration file I plan
to use an XML file in this example to
provide the configuration to spring so
in order to read that XML file the bean
factory has to be an XML being factory
so the XML bean factory reads an XML
file so I'll create an instance of the
eczema bean factory so the different
types of being factories depending on
how you specify the configuration you
can use the corresponding bean factory
since I happen to be using an XML file
in this tutorial I will use the XML bean
factory here so the X will be in factory
takes in an argument which is the actual
resource where I have my XML so I'll
create a new file system restores and
this file system resource will be let me
call it spring dot XML up to do the
imports here I will import XML bean
factory from Ogdoad Spring Framework dot
beans dot factory dot XML so this is the
class that I'll be importing and the
file system resource is again a spring
object its spring framework cold or i/o
and the bean factory is from Spring
Framework bean factory okay I'm all
imports in place now I have my bean
factory here now this bean factory reads
from an XML file you need to provide
this XML so let me just go here and
right click create new XML file let's
say other scroll all the way down till
you see this XML note here and I will
create a new XML file plus next we call
this
dot XML since this is the name that I've
given there and I'll say finish okay let
me go to the source this is a blank XML
file now in this XML I need to provide
the blueprint for the being that I need
to instantiate from this drawing app so
I need to tell spring saying hey I need
a triangle object and it not it has to
be instantiated so here what I'm going
to do is first I need to have the
doctype line here in order to get the
doctype line what can do is head over to
the spring java city of downloaded here
you have a project folder so inside this
projects folder you can search for this
XML I will search for application
context dot XML here you get a lot of a
sample examples that we can use I'm just
going to pick one and I'm going to copy
this doctype line in fact will be copy
these two okay so now I have the dog tag
here so we know that this has this is a
spring eczema now what we're going to do
is we're going to define all the beans
that we want have a beans node and
inside this beans node I can define as
many number of beans the one I just
warned one bean in this case which is a
triangle let's say bean ID equals
triangle I need to give an ID for my
bean and let me come to the reason why
in a minute so the other other thing
they're going to provide is a class
class equals org dot gough shag dot java
brain start
triangle typo here okay so this is all
it takes
so now whatever provided here I have
provided two values one is the ID of the
beam and the other is the class of the
beam the class of the beam we have to
provide the table this because the
spring factory needs to know which class
it needs to instantiate the object from
but what is this ID here the ID is the
reference to this particular beam every
beam will have an ID so what's going to
happen is now when I save this in my
application in any P no class in this
spring application I can instantiate a
new beam factory and say hey bean
factory give me the beam triangle and
then what the beam factory is going to
do is it's going to go to the spring XML
and it's going to look for a beam
definition with the ID triangle and it's
going to instantiate the corresponding
class so what's going to happen here is
now I need to say bean factory get me
the beam triangle so what I need to do
is I need to say factory dot there is a
method called gate beam and then this
takes a string argument in which I pass
the ID of the beam that I have
configured here so I can have any number
of beings over here so depending on the
ID I can tell the factory what exactly
is the beaten that it needs to get so
now that this factory you know I 2.8
beam is going to get me the the object
so I need to have an instance which will
catch this objects well three triangle
triangle equals now since it's an object
I need to cast it so the object that the
factory door get beam is retrieving for
me is cast into a triangle object and
then I assign it to my local triangle
variable and then now I do a triangle
dot draw for this local variable so know
that I'm not doing a new triangle that's
what I did earlier
now I'm not doing that now what I'm
doing is I'm asking the bean factory to
get me a bean so since this is a object
that created by spring this will be
inside the spring container but I have a
reference to this object which is inside
the spring container and I'm calling a
method of that object so let's run this
and see how this works
there you go you get a triangle drawn
message so it's run the draw method off
this object that's inside the spring
container now you might be wondering why
are we doing all this you know instead
of having a new instead of using just
one line of code why are we performing
this circus act of getting this object
from spring now the the advantage is not
obvious in this case because triangle is
a very simple class it does not and
really has nothing except for this
method but the point here is that what
I'm providing here is a blueprint for
the object so the more complex the
object becomes the more detailed the
blueprint becomes and the more advantage
you see in this whole method of getting
the object from spring so you can have a
very complicated object and you can
instantiate the object completely just
by defining the whole thing inside the
spring dot XML and once you define it in
one place it can be instantiated and as
many classes as you want and then when
you make a call the object that you get
is going to be perfectly as per your
specification depending on what you have
defined in this spring dot XML so again
since it's a very simple class the
advantage is not obvious but you will
see how this helps in the subsequent
tutorials</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
