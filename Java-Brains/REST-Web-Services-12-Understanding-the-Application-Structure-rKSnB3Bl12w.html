eclipse project we called it messenger
we ran it on Tomcat a page showed up you
clicked on a link and this was the link
and you got a response saying got it
what did you get why did you get it and
I said we should celebrate what are we
celebrating so we'll try and understand
what's happening behind the scenes here
so I told you that this is actually a
URL for a REST API request and what you
see here is a REST API response so there
are a few things you need to know about
this request response so I'm going to
tell you what they are just go with it
for now you'll have to trust me when I
say these things but I'll soon show you
what each of these components actually
are so the first part should be simple
right so this is localhost colon 8080 so
this is Tomcat running on your machine
so whatever you'd apply to the stonk at
the URL has to start with HTTP localhost
8080 simple so far
now messenger here is the application
context you see here this project is
called messenger so we need to apply
this project on Tomcat it will be
accessible in the Tomcat URL localhost
8080 slash the application context which
is messenger right so this is the URL to
access this application so this way
there is no different from any web
application which is how you would
normally access it the question is with
this part of the URL you see here
there's a web app I slash my resource so
what's happening over here so what's
happening is this application is
configured to accept REST API requests
add this slash web api you are right so
any REST API requests that you make do
this application it has been
pre-configured to go to this slash Web
API slash
onwards right so this is the only way
you can access these REST API is that
are a part of this project why is it
configured that way well that's what the
creators of the archetype has chosen
right
so you didn't create this project right
you just copied it from a template that
we downloaded so this template has been
configured to use slash Web API in the
URL for all REST API so I'll show you
where that's configured in a bit but
just go with me here the next part of
the URL is my resource so this is
actually a resource you know what the
resources and REST API right so you have
messages as a resource you have Commons
as a resource so there is a dummy
resource that's been created in this
project call my resource and when you
access this URL you're doing a get
request to this resource URL you get a
piece of text call got it right so this
is inbuilt functionality in this project
I'm going to explain how all these
pieces fit together and what is actually
causing this in build functionality to
work but it's important that you know
what's happening right so you're
basically making a call to a resource
URL the resource name is my resource
right you're making a get request to
this and you're getting a text as the
response okay so with that said now how
this is this all working now let's go
back to this page right so this is the
root page when we started this
application this is what showed up now
where is this coming from let's expand
source main web app now you see here
there is a page called index dot JSP in
right so this is like the startup page
that this project has and we double
click on it well there you go this is
what we saw on that on this page so this
page should make sense it's in Dexter
JSP and this is what sublet applications
normally do they just load index dot JSP
when the book minim in the root context
is loaded so this is what is happening
now what's happening when you click on
Jerzy resource right so when this URL is
accessed what is happening now think
about how these servlet applications
work for a bit now any web application
right so they're all
using the standard Java servlet
technology even if you're building like
a spring MVC application or a struts
application they all have servlets or
filters right those are the only two
ways you can handle requesting your web
application so it leads us to believe
that this project has some kind of a
servlet that does the bootstrap right
there's some kind of a sublet that's
handling this request
now what sublet is that well to find out
what sublets are configured what you
need to do is open web dot XML so let's
open up the buy enough there you go
librar xml to open that up and click on
the source tab let me see here there is
one sublet configured there is a sublet
called Jersey web application and the
sublet classes are GlassFish jerseys or
that servlet container so this is like a
class which comes bundled with the
Jersey jars and there is an init param
let's not worry about that for now but
basically this servlet is mapped to this
URL butter slash Web API slash star so
any request that comes to this
application that has slash web api in
the front
hey servlet handle that URL right so
that's what this web web rat XML is same
so it's basically mapping our Jersey
sublet to slash Web API slash star so
that should explain this Web API part of
it ok so this part is standard in any
jax-rs application you would have
something similar to this what happens
after this is the code that you write
right so this is something that we're
going to do in the next tutorial we're
going to write our own resource handling
classes but this part is going to be
common it's more the concepts are more
or less the same so what we learned so
far in summary our REST API application
is a standard web application right it's
a standard servlet application it has
the jars for Jersey within it in the
classpath right that's the first thing
the next thing is in the web dot XML
there is one sublet which is pointing to
the sublet container class and Jorge and
this servlet whatever this name is
should be mapped to some URL pattern
which handles all the rest ap is right
in this example that happens to be where
baby I slash star so any request which
has that URL pattern will be handled by
the Jersey sublet and what the Jersey
servlet does is basically look at your
code your classes to find out what to do
from there not so I hope this makes
sense
in the next tutorial we're going to look
at what's actually doing the handling of
this my resource see you in the next
tutorial and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
