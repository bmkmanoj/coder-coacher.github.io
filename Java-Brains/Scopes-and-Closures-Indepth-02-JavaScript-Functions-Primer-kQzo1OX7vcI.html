giving some introduction to functions in
JavaScript there are a couple of
different ways in which you can create
functions in JavaScript the first way is
by using what's called a function
declaration this should be familiar to
people coming from other programming
languages this is kind of standard
across a lot of the C family of
programming languages so let's say I
want to create a function called foo so
I would do something like this say
function as a keyword I give it a name
open close and then the curly braces to
denote the function body and now I can
add logic in the function body here I'm
just doing a console that log function
foo is called and now this is a simple
function declaration all right so I've
declared a function I've created a name
to the function called foo so foo is
kind of like a variable and wherever you
use foo in your code it's pointing to
this function declaration the other
thing I should mention is that functions
are actually objects in JavaScript so
what we're doing here is we're creating
kind of like an object for this function
and then giving that object a name
called foo all right so there's another
way in which we can create functions and
this is using what's called a function
expression javascript has what is called
first-class functions in the sense that
you can create a function and assign it
to a variable just like you can create a
string or a number and assign it to a
variable and the way it works is
something like this now have a variable
called bar and I'm assigning to bar a
function okay so I've created a function
in line and I'm assigning that to it and
now in the function I can again have the
function body and I'm here just doing
console that log function bar called
so what this does is lines 5 6 7 what
they do is they initialize a function
right and then assign it to the variable
bar it's not executing the function and
assigning the result to bar it's
actually assigning the function itself
the reason it works in JavaScript is
because functions are actually objects
an instance of a function is actually an
object instance and now the bar is
pointing to this object instance for a
function just like foo is pointing to an
object which is this function now I'm
going to have these two functions the
way to execute the call these functions
are pretty similar if I were to call foo
I would do something like this foo open
close and now I'm calling the function
foo similarly if I was to
bar or I would call this function I
would use the variable that I have
assigned it to and use the same you know
syntax as a bar open close and it would
call the bar function all right
so this is a quick primer about
functions in JavaScript this is handy to
note because a lot of the scope related
concepts that you're going to discuss in
this course are very closely linked to
functions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
