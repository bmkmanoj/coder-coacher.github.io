the directive called ng-repeat which is
very handy for looping over arrays
let me demonstrate that by adding an
array into the controller scope so I'm
going to say this dot my list goes 1 2 3
&amp;amp; 4
right the simple array and what I want
to do is in my index dot HTML
I want to loop through that array and
print those elements by creating our
paragraphs for each one of them for
example right I'm going to get rid of
this ng show and hide so let's say I'm
going to repeat a paragraph let's say I
have a paragraph here called
hello I want to repeat this four times
I'm going to repeat this once for each
element in my list how do I do that I do
that by using a detective called ng -
repeat so ng - repeat repeats the
element that the directive is assigned
to here ng repeat is assigned to the
paragraph type so this paragraph is
going to be repeated multiple times how
do I tell it how to repeat over a list
it's very similar to a far loop do to
say a far I equals 0 I less than this is
very similar so you have an I in the
list so here the list is CT or l dot my
list okay so this is how you use ng
repeat you're basically looping through
the list for having a loop variable and
then you assign that to any HTML element
it is going to repeat that HTML element
that n times
okay so let's refresh the page here you
see Hello is repeated four times if I
were to add multiple elements over here
five six your strength really doesn't
matter if I were to refresh the page you
see shows up that many more times it's
basically looping through this and for
each element it's printing the hello I'm
going to get rid of the string here
okay now this
have to be just one element so this can
be a div for instance in each they can
have multiple elements in it right it's
just going to repeat the whole structure
let me illustrate that I'm going to
change the Stewart dev it's going to be
active and inside this dev and have
multiple paragraphs alright so this is a
hierarchy of nodes right it's not just
one node so this is this is a tree of
HTML nodes now this external div over
here below the controller is annotated
with n0p so this whole div is going to
get repeated as many times as there are
elements in my list so including each
one of these paragraphs we demonstrate
that by refreshing the page so you see
here the whole structure gets repeated
that many times right so it doesn't have
to be just one element okay let me get
rid of these other paragraphs and retain
just this one it's basically a bunch of
divs with one paragraph in each of them
the cool thing about ng-repeat is by
using this as a looped variable by using
I as a loop variable I is essentially
available within that element mark with
ng-repeat for usage so let's say I have
a scripted like this using I this is
perfectly possible and for each
iteration is going to contain the value
of that element like you would expect so
my list is items 1 2 3 4 5 6 so this is
going to get repeated 6 times as we've
already seen but for each repetition I
is going to contain the value of that
list element so refresh here you see
each time it's different
so this is where things get really handy
if you have like a list of objects then
you can actually use I to hold on to the
object and then each element of that
object can be accessed within it right
I'm going to demonstrate that by
actually creating this list of objects
so let's say I have this array and in
the array I have a bunch of let's say
user objects right so have a
9:8 so you have these objects in the
list maybe you're getting it from you
know an external source or something
okay let me populate this I'm gonna
hard-coded with some nonsense values all
right so with this we have a simple
array of objects initialized so I have
this my list which is an array of
objects each object contains name and
age now I can go here now I is going to
contain an object for each iteration so
let me add call this obj for example the
name really doesn't matter what I can do
here is access each property of obj in
this ng-repeat block so let's say I have
name over here I'm going to call this
obj dot name so what I'm doing is I'm
accessing the name property of each
element for the first iteration this is
going to be the object and then obj dot
name is going to be foo the second
iteration this is very object and obj
dot name will be bar and so on so I'm
going to use the edge property as well
so age would be obj dot H I'm going to
have a horizontal ruler which separates
multiple elements since this is inside
the div the HR is also going to get
repeated now if I were to refresh the
page so here you can see each element is
being duplicated and as it's duplicated
I can access the properties of each
individual object so this is how you
create loops in angular</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
