jax-rs for any amount of time you will
know what a message body reader and a
message body writer is at least you'll
be familiar with those words because
it's very likely that you'd have seen
that in an error message body reader not
found for some data type message body
right or not found for some data type
those are very prevalent in jax-rs the
reason why these are essential is the
message body reader in the message body
writer is what converts from the raw
content that gets sent over the request
and the raw content the kid sent in the
response to our Java types and
vice-versa let me give you an example if
you were to send an object as a response
for your resource and you annotate it
but produces application Jason there is
something that has to take that raw
object and convert it to JSON and send
it to the client okay so this conversion
happens thanks to a message body writer
true to its name it's actually writing
to the message body so whenever you need
to send some object in the message body
the conversion to a string to the JSON
tail or XML payload or any other content
type happens due to a message body
writer similarly when you're accepting
input in JSON or XML in a post request
or a put request the content in the
request body right so that request will
have payload that's converted to a Java
type using a message body reader it's
reading from a message body so these two
classes are very important when you are
doing marshaling and and marshaling of
types in Java the one thing that does
confuse people is a difference between
message body reader and message body
writer versus what we've learned so far
which is the parameter we did an
implementation of param converter we
converted a string to a custom datatype
now how is it different from message
body reader and message body writer well
the difference is actually in the name
you see there is message body versus
so that should give us a clue message
body is basically dealing with the
content of the message if you were to
make a put request the request itself
would contain some payload in the
request body right so when you're
updating a resource you do a put request
and the request body is going to contain
the representation of the updated
resource this is different from parents
so we looked at a lot of param
annotations we had bad param query
parameter paramour bunch of parameter
tations we covered a lot of that in the
previous course but basically these are
parameters to the request and not the
content of the request itself right so
hopefully this distinction is clear
message body deals with the content in
the request body and the response body
okay when you're sending XML or JSON in
a put request body and the response
contains XML or JSON in the response
body we're dealing with message body
readers and message body writers but if
you are sending parameters to the
request like the header param cookie
param path param those are the
parameters okay
so we're going to look at a couple of
different scenarios so that this
distinction is clear let's look at a put
request to this URL web api slash users
slash Kaushik now this put request is
going to take some data in the request
body right we are updating the user with
the name Kaushik so what are the
different parameters here so the
parameter is Kaushik which is a path
param light so this is something that
you would pick a new resource by using
the ad path param annotation so this is
param so if you were to deal with this
you would need parameters however the
message body is the content of the
request so this would need message body
readers and message body writers to deal
with in this specific case when you're
doing a put request you're reading a
payload into a Java type so this would
be a message body reader all right let's
look at another scenario here we are
doing a get requests to a comments URL
which is post slash
post ID slash comments question mark
start equals something and size equals
something so what are the parameters and
what's the message body here well there
is a bad param which is post ID there is
a query parameter and there's one more
query parameter is a message body here
there is no message body because this is
a get request and get doesn't have a
message body in it okay
the third scenario we can look at is a
post now let's say we are creating a new
account right so we have a post request
to slash web API slash accounts and the
post body is going to contain the
account information
they're also passing some header
information let's say for authentication
or something like that now what are the
parameters here well there is one header
param and any other parameters well
there's nothing so header param would be
your param converter okay now what are
the message body elements over here
there is one which is the body of the
post request which is the account
information okay so everywhere where we
have these parameters we are dealing
with param converters and everywhere we
have message body we are dealing with
message body readers and message body
writers then there is a request we're
dealing with message body readers and
when we are sending something back in
the response we're dealing with message
body writers I've seen a lot of people
getting confused with the difference
between param converters and the message
body converters which is the message
body readers in the message body writer
so hopefully this distinction is clear
