implicit arguments in functions we've
looked at arguments in function and the
arguments that a function gets when it
executes are those arguments that you've
specified in the parentheses in the
function block right so not only do you
get those arguments you also get a
couple of implicit arguments those are
arguments that come whether you have
declared it or not in fact you cannot
declare it without things causing
problems so there is there are two
arguments that you get for free so what
are those arguments let me let me
explain by an example okay so this is
code if you already seen before I have a
variable called add which is a function
which is an addition takes two arguments
a and B it returns the sum and I'm doing
a console that log
I'm calling ad with 10 in 30 so it
should return 40 which it does all right
nothing new here now I don't want to
create multiple add methods for a
different number of arguments let's say
I want to create a generic add method
which could take any number of arguments
right I don't have an ADD method for 3 &amp;amp;
4 &amp;amp; 5 so how do you create something
like this in the C++ in the Java side of
things there is this concept called Val
args which is variable
arguments you can define something like
a dot dot and it accepts as many
arguments as you pass to it and the
whole arguments you know the list of
arguments that you pass will be
available as an array okay javascript
has something similar but you don't have
to do the dotting the list of arguments
that has you know that was sent in the
invocation will always be available to
you by an implicit argument a hidden
argument that you get out of the box you
get for free and the argument name is
called arguments okay let me do a
console that blog here
and I pass and print this implicit
argument called arguments so this is
something that JavaScript gives for you
right you don't have to declare it just
comes out of the box for every function
now if I were to run this you see there
you get the arguments list you have 0
and 1 and then you have a couple more
don't worry about these things for now
but you do get these two arguments right
have 0 in one point into 10 and 30 now
if I were to add more arguments here
let's say 2 3 4 5 right I have a bunch
of different arguments that I'm sending
of course we looked at javascript
ignoring the extra stuff it's only you
know if what would be the value of a
here it will be 10 value of B here would
be 30 right all these I said would be
ignored well they're not actually
ignored they're still captured in the
arguments argument ok now if I were to
run this the argument list that gets
printed you see here there is all those
values are captured but if you were to
look at the sum of a and B it's still 40
because a is still pointing to 10 and B
still 30 okay that hasn't changed but
the other stuff is still available to
you ok it's in the arguments variable
it's the arguments argument that comes
out of the box so this is the first
hidden argument the you know the default
argument that this is available for
every function whenever you write a
function you can assume there to be this
arguments argument okay there is a
second argument that is available to all
functions that again that's something
that you get for free you don't have to
declare it can you guess what that is we
have already seen this the answer is
that this argument we've seen that there
is a dis argument that was passed to the
function we already we already saw how
this points to the object that the
function was a part of right that is
also an implicit argument but I'm not
going to cover it now
during that this argument requires
detailed knowledge about constructors
and how objects work and it's a topic
for a different day but notice that
remember that there is this arguments
argument which is pretty straightforward
you can you can get that and use that so
here's here's a quick exercise that I'm
going to do I am going to have this add
function add up all the things that are
passed to it all the arguments that are
passed over not just add a and B okay so
I'm going to use this arguments thing as
an array notice that I haven't told that
it is an array I said I'm going to use
it as an array there is a minor
distinction that I'm going to get to it
in a bit but let me use it as an array
I'm going to use a for loop here and we
say var I so I'm going to have an I
counter and now I'm going to have a for
loop for I equals 0 I less than
arguments dot length
I plus plus now have a for loop for the
length of the arguments and I'm going to
have a sum here
and I'm going to do a sum plus equals
are given so Phi and I'm going to return
the sum now if I were to print add off
those values you get the actual sum okay
so it's adding everything up and now
what interestingly since you're not
using a and B here you're using the
argument diagram which is the implicit
argument you don't actually need a and B
and get rid of this there's no point in
holding on to the first two when you're
interested in the whole thing so one
quick note that I should mention before
we wrap up is that I told you that I'm
using the arguments value as an array
but it's not an array that is actually
true the value that gets passed to the
arguments variable is not an array it
does look like an array because you you
know that's what we did right they said
arguments are Phi but it's actually an
object that's not an array it's
basically using the square bracket
operator to look up the values if you
were to try some of the other operations
that would work on an array it wouldn't
work on the objects on the arguments
value so again for the most part for you
know doing something like a given start
length and looking up arguments with the
square bracket operator it's still going
to work so remember that it's not an
array but it can be used like one for
most purposes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
