gonna learn some of the basic features
of typescript will learn about types and
they learn about some of the things you
can do with types so let's get started
okay let's start writing that script
code I'm going to create a new file in
the folder types to basics so what i've
done is i've open visual studio code and
opened an empty folder in my case it
starts with basics create a new file
gonna call this hello world dot t-- s so
the TS is an extension that you denote
for our typescript files so by marking
of ilus TS you're essentially conveying
that this is a type script file but the
cool thing about typescript is even if
you don't know any typescript syntax
potato they're off some of the newer
features in javascript you can actually
leverage that using typescript because
like we covered in unit 1 type strip is
a superset it encompasses the JavaScript
features that have been introduced into
the language as well as additional
typescript features so some of the
really cool new features in javascript
like arrow functions for example work
perfectly fine and type step so let's
say able to create a an arrow function
here
FN equals this is a function that takes
in no arguments and then returns a
string called response so this is
basically an equivalent of writing
something like this it's a function and
then return all right so these two lines
four five six is exactly the same as
line one so this structure is called an
arrow function and this is not really a
type stuff feature it's a feature of
JavaScript that's been recently
introduced but you might be wondering if
you can use this across all browsers
well some browsers may not have support
for it also at this point of time
I think it's mostly supported by all
modern browsers but anyway the point is
this is a JavaScript feature with the
new version of JavaScript but typescript
allows for you to write such code in
your type strip fight so let's say I
open the console and here I'm going to
run the typescript compiler on hello
world RTS go to the compile and render a
JavaScript file here two syllables rjs
and now as you can see it's converted
from my arrow function which is the new
JavaScript feature into a traditional
function so it's typescript compiler
compiling or transpiling something which
is not even typescript it's transpiling
JavaScript some of the newer features of
JavaScript so that's that's actually
pretty cool you can use other things
like let a keyword to declare variables
within a particular context and all that
kind of stuff I'm not gonna get into the
details because this course is about
typescript and not JavaScript but I just
wanted to call that out you can use some
of the newer fancy and shiny JavaScript
features in here
that's good code so that you have the
compiler it's going to transpile it to
do something that's more Universal and
more standard that most browsers
understand all right now on to
typescript the first thing we're gonna
be looking at in typescript is types we
covered how JavaScript does not have the
concept of typing now let's say I have a
var a and then I could give a equals the
number 10 and then I can say a equals
true and a equals an object these are
all valid JavaScript right JavaScript
doesn't care you can assign any value to
any variable there's no concept of
typing but what if you want typing but
if you want to somehow tell that a is a
number and you don't want any other
value assigned to it the only value that
you want to assign to a as a number we
can do that by declaring a to be a
number in type stud typescript loves
type declaration of different variables
so we need to care or something as
variable you can also say hey by the way
this should only be a number the way to
do this is by following the variable
with a colon and then the type here it's
a number all right so this tells
typescript that
a is only supposed to be a number so if
you do something like a equals 10 this
works fine but if you say a equals true
it's gonna fail now let me compile this
and I'll show you what the error was
gonna be so here you see it says online
for type true is not assignable to type
number let's cut this it knows that a is
a number and true is a blintz not
assignable here's a cool thing about
Visual Studio code which is the editor
that I'm using you notice this red
squiggly over here below a it's
indicating that it's an error if I hover
my mouse over it you get the exact same
error that you got in the compiler but
you didn't even have to compile it's
actually doing this type script checks
while you're coding so that's pretty
handy you can catch the errors even
before you compile so this is type
declaration in typescript given a
variable you can declare what type it
should be for example let's say I say
Bar B and this is a boolean now
typescript knows that B is a variable
that's supposed to be a boolean and no
other value I can save our C and colon
string so C is supposed to be a string
so I can assign these values and then C
is and these are all valid assignments
now notice that the Declaration of types
here is what's referred to as a postfix
declaration what you're doing here is
you're declaring the types after the
variable name this is different from the
prefixed of the declaration that some
other languages do something like Java
or C++ you will do something like this
in a so the data type comes before the
variable name so this is prefix in the
case of typescript its postfix the
datatype comes after the variable name
and it's separated by a colon over here
all right so these are types in type
strip I'm going to compile this one more
time
prove that it works and there are no
errors and this is how we declare types
you can do this for any primitive values
so we have a bunch of primitive data
types you can use that for any of these
variables you can also do this for
custom types in classes which we're
gonna be covering in the next unit but
let's stick to just primitive types for
now and I'll show you all the different
nuances there as to this type of
declaration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
