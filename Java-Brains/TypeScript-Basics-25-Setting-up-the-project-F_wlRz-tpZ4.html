a simple command-line utility to kind of
practice all the things that we've
learned in this course it's not going to
be a very complicated utility it's a
very simple github reporting utility
basically what it does is it's a
command-line utility you pass in a user
name a github user name and it makes a
call to the github rest API and gets
some user information and some of the
top repositories for that user starts it
in descending order of the number of
folks basically the the repositories
which are more popular it's a simple
utility which is run on the command line
you pass the user name as a command line
argument and it makes this rustic-y a
call and just prints out some simple
output the idea is not to have something
that is useful the idea is to just
create a project simple project to
showcase the concepts that we learned so
far okay so have created an empty folder
here called github report which is gonna
be my project folder and this is where
I'm going to be placing all the source
files open the console and I'm going to
initialize the project there are a
couple of things you need to do the
initializer first is the NPM in it in
order to make this an NPM project the
second is the typescript in it in order
to get the typescript configuration file
so I'm going to type NPM in it and
there's gonna get me my package dot JSON
and just gonna stick to the defaults and
next I'm gonna do a BSc in it in our
attention eyes the typescript
configuration - - in it and now I have
the PS config dot JSON with the default
options we have a package dot JSON with
again some basic things here I am going
to create a source folder which is going
to contain all my source files this is
gonna be different from what we've been
doing so far we've placed the source
files in the root but not make things a
little bit cleaner and then create this
folder called SRC and in my TS config
JSON I have this property called root
dir as you can see here it's used to
specify the root directory for input
files now I am going to have this point
to SRC so I'm basically telling the
typescript compiler to look at the SRC
folder in order to generate in order to
look at the source files for compliation
and I'm also going to create an out dir
and I'm just gonna call this out and
this is where the output directory is
going to be I'm going to create a new
folder I'm gonna call this out and this
is where the output in SRC create an
index just es like I said the convention
is to have index as the file name for
something that that kind of starts the
execution process that I've created this
index dot TS and just to test this out
I'm going to console the plot of hello
and in my package start JSON
I have start script like we've seen in
the last unit and here I'm going to say
TSC in order to compile the source code
since I have the source input
configuration from the source folder I
have to provide anything else and I'm
going to execute this with node out
slash index dot J's because that's gonna
be the compiled output indexed at es in
the source folder is gonna go to out
slash index dot JSON no just gonna
execute I'm going to save this and run
this with node start its NPM step sorry
the compliation happens and hello gets
printed so everything is good we have
bootstrap this application and we're all
set to start coding it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
