going to talk about cache the cache
feature that's provided by happening
earlier I mentioned that hibernate is
much more than an ORM dual happy need
was started with the Orem problem in
mind and it was started as a solution
for over him but as you know as features
got added there were a lot of other
features that hibernate implemented and
you know it became much more than a noir
M - and one of the important features it
happening provides us caching there are
there are multiple ways in which we can
implement caching and just like with
anything else in hibernate it's
configurable but actually what's
happening is there is a level of cache
that hibernate provides for us by
default without even doing anything and
that is called as the first level of
cache and that's implemented by the
session object so we've already seen
that when you when you say you update an
object that's in a persistent state and
you know you update it again it does not
actually result into two different
update queries it doesn't necessarily
result in two different update queries
hibernate intelligently detects you know
what is the minimum number of queries
that need to be run and based on that it
triggers the update query so it's not
just for the update even for the select
say I do a select once and then there is
no change as such and then I do another
select I do a session or get then hi
Bernie knows that it's already it
already has the data in its cache it
does not trigger a select again so this
level of caching is already there
whether you configure it or not
hibernate automatically provides this
first level of cache but then there is a
second level of cache that we can
implement as well so why do we need the
second level of cache the second level
of cache is needed because a section is
not something that you would you would
hold for a long period of time as we
have seen earlier a session factory is
something that's there for the entire
life of the application but a session is
something that you don't open when you
need to talk to the database and then
close
as soon as you're done talking to the
database so whatever caching happens in
this session will not be there for a
long time so if you want you're
accessing a data that you had accessed
in the earlier session you would have to
query the database of the session is
already closed so you would want another
level of cache that goes beyond sections
so we can implement the second level of
cache and that's what we're going to
talk about in these tutorials the second
level of cache can be implemented in
different ways oneness across different
sessions in an application so which
addresses the problem of hey I closed
the session of the cache is lost so say
you open sessions at different points in
the application what happens is that all
those sessions will have individual
caches the first level caches but then
there is a second level of cache that
applies across different sessions so if
it's not there in the first level of
cache you can it's likely that you find
it in the second level of cache well
this is different sessions in a single
application you can have a cache across
different applications if they're all
using hibernate and they're working on
the same you know the same set of data
you might feel the need to have a cache
that goes across applications so it's
like different sessions in different
applications so this is again something
that you can configure and hibernate and
then the third thing is across clusters
so you have different applications
deployed in different different servers
and they are all talking to the same
database in their tour you know
interacting with the same data you can
have a hibernate cache that supplies you
know cache data for across all these
applications but however you need to
know that say you have you know you have
another application that is not using
hibernate that might result in problems
because let's say for example you have
you have saved some data in your in your
cache now the other application which is
not using hibernate would not know that
there is this data in the cache and it
might directly go talk to the database
so there could be this kind of
you know a problem where you know an
application which is not using hibernate
is totally not aware of the cache might
still end up you know dirtying the data
and you know updating the data in the
database and the cache might be you know
invalid so apart from this as far as
your configuring a single second level
cache across applications hibernate is
going to take care of it happen it will
know that there is an application that's
written some data before a fetch happens
it automatically updates in the database
so that the new fetch has the latest
data but if the fetch does not happen
hibernate will in recently keep it in
the cache and try to minimize the trips
to the database so having said that
first let's have a look at the first
level cache that we that we have in
hibernate again I'll go back to the same
main method that I've had I'm opening a
session and I'm beginning a transaction
so in this area let me get a user object
so I will say user details I'll use a
session dot get the session dot get of
course takes two parameters one is the
class and one is the ID so I'll say user
details dot class and we'll pass the IDs
one so I'm getting the user object with
the IDs one of course I'll have to cast
this because this returns me an object
since I know that it's a user details
object I'm casting this here now I have
got this user object now if I run this
clear this out
if I save and run this you can see that
there is a select query so hibernate is
actually showing a select query to fetch
this user object now what happens if I
you know I assume that there is a
there's a lot of code in between but
here I will say user details user two
equals I am getting the same user object
here but I'm casting it to a new tooth
into a new user details object so what
I'm saying here is that I am getting
this object once okay and then I'm
getting the object not using this
reference I'm actually asking ebony to
get from the database and we're passing
the same primary key I'm saying hey
happening give me this object again now
hibernate knows that it's already got
this this object so it doesn't really
need to go to the database again but
let's see how many queries it runs this
time if I run this they it's still just
one select so the reason why it can you
know get away with just one select is
because hibernate knows that between
this statement and this statement in
between these two statements there is no
code that updates the user data so what
I mean by that is okay let's say for
example I I make this change here the
user dot set username updated user so I
am changing the user property here now
let's see what happens so here you can
see it is doing a select and it's doing
an update but still it's not doing a
select again now it's done an update now
the database record has changed now why
is it not doing a select for user two it
has to get the updated value right
well what happens is since it's updated
an object in the session this object is
already there it's there in the cache so
again there is no need for hibernate to
pull up this value it this user to that
hibernate gates is actually the updated
user object so the point here is that
hibernate intelligently takes all these
things it does not go to the database
unless it's actually required so as long
as you made the change in the hibernate
session hibernate knows that hey this is
the object that I already have so it
does not go talk to the database now the
things the totally change when I'm
opening a new session here I'll use the
same two lines of code okay so I've
closed this earlier session and I'm
opening a new session let me call it
differently also session session two
because open session now I will say
session two dot begin transaction now
what I'll do is by getting the user to
object instead of doing it in the
earlier session I'm going to do it in
the new session okay and after that I
will close the session
okay so I have session one which pulls
up user object and I close it and I have
a session two here which which again
pulls up just user object it's the same
user object and then it closes the
session now let's save and run this
let's see how many queries this results
in so here you can see there are two
queries so what's happening is since
this session is closed the cache is
closed as well so opening a new session
will result in a new query so this is
the problem that we can address by using
cash once we implement cash which is the
second level cache both these sessions
are going to talk to the second level
cache and once we have an object in the
second level cache the session do
is not going to talk to the database as
well it's going to get it from the
second level cache and only when the
object is not in the second level cache
which it's only then that hibernate goes
and talks to the database so this
results in a lot of efficient use of
resources it's not going to talk to the
database unless it's absolutely required</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
