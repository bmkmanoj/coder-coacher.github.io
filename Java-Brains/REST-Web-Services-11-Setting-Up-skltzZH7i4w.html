set up our development environment to
start writing REST API applications so
by the time we are done with this
tutorial you will have your development
environment set up you will have a
simple project which is a REST API
application you'll be able to deploy
that in Tomcat you'll be able to make a
REST API request and return a REST API
response you think it's a bit too
ambitious for a single tutorial love
let's see of course the first step is
you have the Java EE version of Eclipse
you open a new workspace and when you
create a project what you would
typically do is download the jars right
so since we're using Jersey we need to
go to the Jersey website and download
the jars but here's the thing about
Jersey right if you open their website
which is Jersey dot java.net if you look
at the download section over here it
says Jersey is mainly distributed via
maven there are ways to get the jars as
a separate download but they have made
it so easy to use Jersey with maven that
that's the option I'm going to go with
and that's trust me that's much more
easier than downloading all the jars in
case you're not familiar maven is a
project management utility that project
management isn't what your boss does
right like timesheets status updates and
meetings so this is Java project
management so when you're creating a
project in Eclipse for example you have
a Java project and there are things you
will have to do in that project like run
it add dependencies you know take a you
know team at idle the life cycle and all
that stuff so maybe there's something
that actually manages that there's a
separate course on an introduction to me
when on the Java brains website I've
linked it in the video description as
well as on the webpage itself so take a
look if you're interested but again like
I said you know if you're building
enterprise applications there's really
no excuse to not know maven so how would
you create a maven project well maven
projects are created using command line
primarily but since you're using if
you're using the latest version
Eclipse Eclipse has support for maven so
what you do is in a clean workspace
right-click and say new project and
again if you're using the latest version
of Eclipse you should see maven as the
entry here so you can say I want to
create a new maven project and click
Next now let this be the defaults and
now here you can choose the type of
maven project that you want to create
right so you're selecting an archetype
archetype is basically like a template
right like a preset project which you
can use to create your own projects so
you want to create a simple web
application there's an archetype for
that you just choose that archetype and
you have a simple web application for
you to start working on right you need
an you know app with the EJB there's an
EJB archetype so similarly there should
be a Jersey archetype so type Jersey in
the filter you might see this entry I
have two entries here but the one that
we are interested in is the second entry
Jersey Quick Start web app if you don't
see this when you filter by Jersey that
means that this archetype is not
registered in your development machine
so you have to register it how do you
register it you go to add archetype
button and here you enter the values for
the lot type so the first field is
called archetype group ID and for this
you enter the value org dot GlassFish
dart Jersey dollar types next you have
the archetype artifact ID and for this
you enter Jersey - QuickStart - web app
and finally the archetype version well
the version as of today as I'm recording
this video is 2.16 so this could be
different depending on then you're
watching this video so you could choose
the latest version or you could choose
2.16 to follow along finally the
repository URL is you can leave it as
blank and hit OK and this should
register this archetype
so that when you go back to the screen
again and search for Jersey or Jersey
QuickStart web app you should see this
enter you this is basically what we have
registered right the group IDs are
GlassFish jersey at types the artifact
ID is Jersey QuickStart web app and the
version is 2.16 this is exactly the
value that we've just entered okay so
now that this is showing up this is the
archetype that we will use to bootstrap
our project so I'm going to hit next and
now it asks me for my project details
right so what we've entered the group ID
and the artifact idea is far the
archetype but now I'm creating a new
project that says what's the group ID an
artifact ID for your project so I'm
going to choose a group ID org dot car
shake dot Java brains and artifact ideas
messenger so you can think of group ID
as kind of like a package ID an artifact
ID is the name of your project or the
artifact version I can leave it as fine
as zero point zero point one packages
arkasha Java brains messenger this looks
good so I'm going to click finish now
what the maven plugin in Eclipse is
going to do is it's going to get that
art type and create a project out of it
using the exact same template and it's
going to call it messenger and give it
the package name Akashic the Java brings
so it's going to create this whole
project exactly the way the archetype is
design now here you see it's downloading
all the artifacts and creating the
project I'm going to pause this video
till this whole thing is done okay so
now maven has finished downloading
everything and the messenger project is
right here now if you look at the
markers tab and you don't see any errors
well you're one of the fortunate ones I
get this weird error when I use the
archetype so it basically says the
superclass httpservlet was not found on
the Java build path this shouldn't stop
you from running the project and once we
get the project up and running I'll
explain what this error isn't
chewing up but basically you have a
project right this is as the archetype
said it's a web project now we need to
run it how do you run a web application
well you need a sublet container right
so let's go ahead and create a server in
Eclipse so go to the service tab and if
you're creating it from a blank
workspace there shouldn't be any servers
available here I'll just click this link
to create a new server so I'm going to
choose Apache I'm using Tomcat 7 click
Next now I need to browse to the Tomcat
installation directory so I'm going to
click browse and I have Tomcat available
in my Java folder so I'm going to click
that
this is Tomcat 7 and I click open and
you have the Tomcat installation
directory over here now I choose
workbench GRE that should be fine I
click Next
I want the messenger added to the server
and I click finish and now you have
Tomcat here let's run it right-click and
click start ok so now you have Tomcat up
and running now let's see if this
messenger has been deployed and is
working fine so I click run as run on
server ok always use the server please
and finish and there you see a simple
web page showing up at localhost colon
8080 slash may I'd says this is a Jersey
restful web application yay now we have
a Jersey application up and running this
is very simple ok now there is a link
here which is Jersey resource just click
on this and see what happens we see you
get a text called
got it so you might be surprised but
what's actually happening here is by
accessing this URL you're actually
making a REST API request and this got
it is actually a REST API it responds so
within a space of 5 minutes or so I
think you managed to create a REST API
application
ran it on Tomcat and made a request and
got a response so I let you celebrate
and in the next tutorial we'll kind of
try and understand what's going on
behind the hood before we wind up I'll
just give you a quick explanation on
this error right so the superclass HTTP
sublet is apparently not found in the
build path so the reason it's happening
is maven like I said it's a project
management utility what it does is it
downloads jars for you right so you
didn't have to download the Jersey jar
right so it downloaded it for you
so if you look at the Java resources
folder over here and the libraries there
is this folder called maven dependencies
and if you expand this you see there are
like a bunch of jars which you didn't
have to go ahead and download but it
just showed up that's the magic of maven
so you see all these Jerzy jars over
here so it makes it very simple but the
reason maven makes it simple is the
maven artifact sorry the maven archetype
needs to have a list of all the jars
that the project would need and this
archetype is apparently missing the
httpservlet class in this path but
thankfully HTTP sublet is provided by
Tomcat which is why it's not much of an
issue but it is a pain to see this error
in the markers tab we're going to make
some changes to this project which is
going to lead to this error going away
but for now don't worry about it you
have created like I said a RESTful API
application made a request and got a
response let's celebrate and I'll see
you in the next tutorial thanks for
