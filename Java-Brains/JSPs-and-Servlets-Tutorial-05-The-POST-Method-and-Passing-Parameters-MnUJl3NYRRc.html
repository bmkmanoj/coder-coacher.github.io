previous tutorial we wrote a sublet and
use XML configuration to you know
provide information to Tomcat about the
servlet now in this tutorial we're going
to look at parameters which the sublet
can use to give more customized
execution paths so let me open up the
XML sublet that we created in our
previous tutorial I was too lazy to do
this in the earlier tutorial but let me
do that now instead of a system dot out
let me print something out to the
response so that we have a more
interactive way to check this so I will
get the response object oh one thing
I'll do is have set content types
I will come to what I'm doing here by
the set content type method
create a new printwriter and i print
some text
now that you do okay so I have printed a
Hello a user message run this okay it's
automatically deployed so I don't have
to deploy it again say run as run on the
server
it says hello user so let's say I want
this to change depending on who the user
is and willing to take a parameter to
this served the value pass parameters is
by they're actually two ways one is
using a URL parameter and other way is
using a post parameter so depends on
what method you're running if it's a if
it's a get method like what we're doing
now we're calling the method by typing
out the URL so if we're doing that then
we use URL parameters to pass such data
will come to post parameters later so
the way I would pass URL parameter is
with a question mark and say username
equals Kaushik now if I pass this
nothing happens nothing changes it's
still going to call the Duquette method
and it's still going to print this so
the only difference is that the
parameter that I pass here which is the
user name would have been sent to this
do gate using this request so it's up to
me to pick that value from this request
object and do something with that so
that's what I'm gonna do next so what
I'll do is I'll take
this name so I'll say string username
equals I call this method of the request
object called the gate parameter so in
this I'm going to pass the name of the
parameter that I've sent in the URL so I
have that value stored in this username
variable here now it's as simple as
appending this value here I save let
Tomcat reload this
okay there you go now I'll access this
again now see what happened this
parameter the value that I am passing
here is being passed to this to get
method through this request object I'm
taking that request object and I'm
getting the parameter that I want which
I know I am passing with that and then
I'm going to print this so what if I
change this name here that name is going
to get passed over here so no matter
what I pass here that is going to get
passed through the request object and I
can access it over here so this is very
convenient so you can you can actually
have a number of parameters I know I can
I can say I can put an end here an
ampersand character and then say your
user ID equals something and I can
actually call another request or gate
parameter I can have another string here
and say request dot getparameter user ID
and then I can capture this ID as well
so this is one of the ways in which you
pass parameters to the servlet method
there's another way we can do that and
that is by using a post method so let's
do that
close this
in order to pass a post parameter we
need an HTML and we need a form so let
me create a simple HTML here HTML file
simple form
okay I'll leave it at the defaults
okay so I have my simple HTML here
remove the titles remove that in order
to make a post request I need to have a
form in place so let me create a simple
form I need to give an action which is
the target that gets executed when I
submit the form so I will pass this
servlet path because this is where we
are actually reading the we're reading
the path of the parameter that's
submitted
okay so in this I'm going to create a
simple Xbox fit a name as usually
now why am i calling this username
because whatever value is typed here and
submitted in this form is going to go to
this servlet as the parameter so
whatever I type here will go as
parameter username okay now just have a
submit button
let's save this
okay I'm an extra form here this is
actually still calling the doone-gate
because when a form is submitted
it actually defaults to a getter method
so in order to make it a post I will
have to first specify this form as a
post request and I also have to
implement a do post right now I only
have a do gate but anyway let's test
this once and make sure the gate method
runs fine
run as and run on server okay now this
is this HTML is coil and then have here
simply textbox and the submit button
just type something and say submit query
okay so as you can see here the XML
sublet path which is the path for an XML
sublattice coil and then username equals
ABC the sent as kid parameters so it's
actually you know rendering this text
okay so now in order to submit a post
request I need to make those two changes
one is change this form to submit a post
read this and then implement a do post
first let's do the do post it's actually
very simple all I have to do is copy
this method and this change the name of
the method because everything is
signature is exactly the same so just
make this to post
so let us change the text so that we
know that the post method is called so
this is hello from the post method this
is hello from the get method see this
and the phone in order to change the
method all I have to do is write a
method equals okay as you can see that I
actually auto fills that you know the
two options that we have here and get in
both visit Eclipse doing the auto
complete
so I say method equals post save this go
back here you don't see any difference
because there's nothing changed in the
UI what's happening is that the form
method has change review which you
obviously cannot see in the front end
but I will submit the same text let's
submit query okay I believe the Refresh
has not happened to let me go ahead and
do a refresh so that you know the page
reloads and I'm going to do a submit
query now okay now we can see say hello
from the post method so we know that the
post the new post has executed but one
prominent defense that you see here is
you don't see the query parameters in
the URL so the request has gone inside
the request HTTP request body so you
don't actually see it in the URL this is
the main difference between our get and
post method so in the get method you
actually see the you know the parameters
in the URL and the post method it goes
to the part of the request body so you
don't you don't explicitly see it so
yeah from here you can you can actually
write more parameters you know if you if
you have more parameters in the get
method you'll actually see that in the
query URL and if you wrap it in the post
method you don't actually see it but of
course you have to have multiple
inputs are multiple UI entities here
which submit those parameters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
