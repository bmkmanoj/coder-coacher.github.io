used the application context in our
program in order to initialize the
spring container and we've used an XML
file in order to configure it we have
done this only once in our in that
application and we do a get beam only
once and then the related beans to this
bean that we are trying to get has been
automatically populated by spring so the
triangle even though it needs these
three objects over here it does not do a
get bean because spring automatically
populates it depending on our
configuration in our spring XML the
normally you would not need to do a get
beam anywhere else just doing in the you
know at the start will initialize the
container and you're done but there are
some situations where you would want to
use this context that we've initialized
here you would want to use this we are
not to provide access to that context to
a bean for example now say let's say the
triangle bean that I have here needs the
the context that we have initialized
here in order to do a get bean let's say
instead of configuring the wiring of the
triangle object to these points in the
XML file I want to do a get being off
point a B and C now why would I want to
do that I'll give you a simple scenario
there of course many reasons why you'd
want to have access to application
context though it's bad practice because
you've got to bind your code to spring
but the application context itself
provides a lot of features that we
haven't seen yet and you might want to
use those features but I'm going to give
you a simple example I want to use a
application context gate bean in your
bean instead of directly wiring them up
in the spring XML now let's say I have
defined this triangle object as a
singleton so what's going to happen the
spring is going to create this triangle
object then the container is loading and
it's not going to create any new
instances now let's say the dependents
the beans that the triangle object is
dependent on if they happen to be
prototypes and let's say I want these
beans to be created newly every time
that will not work because the
dependencies of the triangle
we'll also be satisfied when the
triangle object is created and since
triangle is a singleton points a B and C
will also be created along with the
triangle which is when the container
loads and they will be initialized so
even though these points happen to be
prototypes even though I define points a
B and C as prototypes in my spring dot
XML they will be initialized only once
because the parent triangle is
initialized only once this since it
happens to be a singleton now if I want
to create new instances of point a B and
C whenever I need it in the code then
one way to do this is by using the
context dot gate beam and then I can
call the point a B or C and then get a
new point a B or C if I have defined
this as a prototype so that is one
reason why you would want to have access
to the the application context and I'll
show you in this tutorial how we can
actually get access to the application
context and then the usage there are
different usage scenarios and we won't
cover that but we'll just have a look at
how we can get the context in the first
place so this is a context that we need
to get of note that it's initialized
only once let's past the spring XML
configuration only once but then you can
get the same context object the
reference to the same context object
using this method so in order to get the
application context we need to implement
an interface called application context
aware so if any beam implements this
interface then this beam can become
aware of this application context it can
use this now of course I'll have to
import this this is in the Spring
Framework dot context package now we
find them in this I've left to implement
a method now if I add the unemployment
rate methods here I will get a method
called set application context and this
is you know giving me an application
context now let me call this context ok
so now what I will do is I can I can
capture
this application context over here I can
have a context member variable and I can
capture this application context so what
I'm going to do is I'll create a member
variable here drive it application
context initialize it to null and then
here in my setter
when I get the context what I can do is
I can do a this start context equals
context now what's going to happen is
it's going to set the member variable to
the context that spring is going to
provide so what spring does is when it
loads all the pins behaved a you know a
singleton or a prototype then it sees
there any bean implements this
application context aware then spring is
going to call the set application
context and it's going to pass the
application context to this method so we
can capture this context and save it as
I remember variables so that it's
accessible from anywhere so say I have
another method here I can do a context
or gate beam and I can initialize it so
it could be as simple as getting my
member variables using gate beans
instead of using the spring default by
ring so this way it's it's pretty handy
so just like the application context
aware there are a few other aware
interfaces which gives information about
the container to your bean and what you
need to do to get such information is to
implement the Krait interface and then
implementing the interface will mean you
have to have a setter method and spring
is going to automatically pass that
information in the setter method so we
have interfaces like application even
publisher aware we have bean classloader
aware and things like that I will show
you one other aware interface which is
called as the bean name aware so you
would want to use this if you want to
know what is the name of the bean that
has been configured in the spring dot
XML now we know that triangle has been
configured as triangle itself but in
order
the name what we can do is we can
implement this being name aware so we
need to do the import as well as
implement the methods so it's going to
be just one method if you say I add and
implemented methods it's going to give
you with up with a setter again so you
will get the name of the bean as the
parameters will call this bean name and
here here I can have a member variable
and then I can print out the bean name
as I just print out a beam name just to
demonstrate being Lemus bean name so
here you can use you know some code you
can set a member variable and then you
can use it anywhere in the in the bean
in the game this class but just for
demonstration purposes I'm just going to
do a system dot print now if we run the
drying application you're going to get
the bean name and the bean name has been
set to triangle note that I have printed
in the setter itself so what it's
actually doing is it's actually making
this call to the set bean name before
the code executes so we saw that the the
print statement for the bean name was
displayed before the program executed
before we call the draw method so vile
intial IDing the bean itself spring is
going to automatically call the write
setters depending on the interfaces the
aware interfaces that you implement so
this can be done for any number of beans
in your spring XML as long as the bean
implements these interfaces spring is
going to look for all the beans that
implement any of these aware interfaces
and it's going to call the setters and
pass the value that you actually want
and then you can do what you want that
that value you can have it as a member
variable or you can use it in the
execution but you can
have access to those values if you want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
