you're going to get to watch me build
this contact application and add
features to it as we go we're going to
be making REST API calls using the JSON
server endpoint and we can be gaining
this code up and adding some more
features the first thing that I want to
tackle is to move this dollar HTTP GET
cord from the controller to the service
you remember we created this con type
data service with a nice service which
gives you the data and I want to still
use that kind of flow the contact
controller calls the contact data
service and when the contact data
service to make that dollar HTTP target
and get the data right this is similar
to a lot of server-side programming
patterns where you have the service make
a call to the data layer or the rest
layer now how do I move this code from
here to the service let's say I take
this out copy this out and I don't need
dollar HTTP over here and you go to the
contact data service where instead of
having a hard-coded list here I'm going
to have an empty array to start with
they're going to place the score over
here and of course going to need the
dollar HTTP injected and again do not
have to deal with this references I'm
going to say war self equals this so
it's basically doing the same thing the
hard-coded list did I knew we had a
hard-coded list which had at the start
contacts person calling it a self
instead of having self dot contacts and
calling HTTP GET I'm just going to make
this request and then there is a den
which is self dot contacts equals
response to date as I'm populating this
with the right values now here is the
problem I am calling this input this
code back over here so this is what was
happening before contact data service
dot contacts the problem however is
contact data service dot contacts at the
very first load is going to be undefined
you don't have a property called
contacts you have to have the controller
we'd far there is to be a call to
complete we did that by using a den over
here right so we populated the data by
waiting for the rest appear to complete
if you also want to have the contact
controller wait for that is still able
to complete how do we do that well
here's how we need to do this now first
what I'm going to do is wrap this into a
method so I'm going to say get contacts
right it's going to be a function and
now this function is what's going to
make the rest API call up here I'm going
to have self dot get contacts which is
going to be a function and inside that
function I'm going to make this request
okay
now inside this function I'm doing HTTP
GET and then once the responses are done
I'm going to get this value right now
this will still not work because think
about what the return off get contacts
this return of get contacts is undefined
you're not returning anything what you
want to do is that are done this self
dot contacts right this is what you
wanted or done what I actually need is
this I don't even need the contacts
property because what I'm doing here is
taking that value and putting it over
here would this work let's see can you
refresh the page and it doesn't work the
reason is that this return is actually
returning this function the function
that you passed to the then it's not
returning from the get contacts function
which is what this controller is calling
now how do we get around that the thing
is you cannot really do this pattern
because this is an asynchronous call you
have to have a promise pattern over here
so what you could do is have the get
contacts return a promise and then have
this controller say that contacts dot
then and then set this right so imagine
if this were to be something like this
me move this out get contacts and then I
do a dot then function with a data and
I'm going to have the star contacts
equals data if the get contacts function
would be smart enough to return a
promise and then have this happen that
would be great right of course I'm going
to have to do a war self equals thus and
then self dot contacts this would work
fine but unfortunately our kit contacts
function is returning nothing it should
ideally return a promise how do you have
this return a promise before we tackle
that let me ask you a question now we
use know that Delta HTTP duck it is an e
synchronous function and it returns a
promise and that promise has a dent
function now my question to you is
what's the return off the den function
may be say promise start then a new pass
in a function as an argument right what
is the dot then return what it returns
is actually another promise because this
then is also asynchronous if you go back
to the analogy of your teammate handing
you a piece of paper saying okay there's
a long-running function that you've
given me direct your next set of
instructions on this piece of paper so
that when I'm done with my long-running
function of line executes the steps on
that piece of paper now what if you want
to give more instructions after your
teammate is done with the instructions
on the piece of paper well it turns out
every time you hand over a piece of
paper with instructions back to your D
main a teammate is going to give you
another piece of paper it saying okay
after these instructions are done what
next to do right so every time you hand
over instructions think of your teammate
giving you a fresh piece of paper it
says okay what next right similarly this
then is basically set of instructions
for direct EP does get to execute but
it's done now this also has returns a
promise and now that promise also has a
den method let me break this down I'm
going to have this war promise one
equals the first call and now I can say
promise
one right this turns out returns another
promise so I'm going to say war promise
two equals crumbs one dot then and now I
can say promise to that then and I can
pass in another function so what the
flow of execution is going to result in
is the first that get happens and then
this function gets executed and after
this function is done this function gets
executed and guess what happens if you
accept an argument over here whatever it
is in return and this first function is
passed into this second function I know
this is confusing but if you were to
just implement this once it'll all make
sense
so let's actually go ahead and implement
this what I'm going to do is rather than
have this promise to have it then over
here I'm going to actually return
promise to and now when I'm doing this
get contacts what I have left over here
as a result is promised to and I'm
setting it then on top of promise too so
the data that gets passed into this
function there's going to be there done
over here so then this gets executed I'm
putting up that response getting the
data object and then and that gets
passed over here to the second then and
you're passing it to contacts you're
setting it on top of context let me save
this and execute this once and there you
go we still get the values but now
what's happening is it's it's moved to
the service again to quickly recap
dollar GDP it returns a promise right
that promise has a dent function where
you pass in an argument as a function
and that gets executed after the first
step is done now this thing function
happens to return a new promise and that
promise also has a dent function now
let's say you pass a function to that
dent right when does that function get
executed when this function is done so
you're essentially chaining up functions
to execute one after another and each
time you pass a function to be
acute 'add it's returning a new promise
the most important thing to remember
over here is that these are not these
lines of code are just setters they're
setting functions on the promise you see
here there is a dollar GTP dot get it
says okay I know what to do
the returns a promise you pass a
function to it then which is also a
setter and this is okay I'm going to do
that later
and you can have a bunch of these stuff
which are just setting things to be done
and you're done with your execution over
here then the code actually completes
those long-running steps all the
functions that you have said are going
to get executed in order so this is
truly is synchronous the promise gets
returned and a function is set on top of
it doesn't mean that the function is
executed it's just wild in what needs to
happen and then when the clong doing job
is completed those functions get called
one after another I do understand that
this is not very simple to wrap your
head around or the only solution that I
have is to maybe watch this video and
try out a couple of HTTP call and
hopefully this will all make sense after
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
