called a bicycle mechanic all right so
I'm going to say function or you just
call it mechanic and probably just has
name okay and then let's say this start
name equals names I'm basically creating
a function that's meant to be a
constructor alright so I'm going to say
bar just gonna call him Mike is new
mechanic I need to pass in the name as
an argument to the call I'm just going
to pass in the name Mike and love the
desk we have a mechanic's instance with
the name Mike now what I want to do is
give Mike access to the inflate tires
functionality I want Mike to be able to
inflate the tires of any bike that's
given to him okay right now the inflate
tires functionality is in the bicycle
object so every bike actually knows how
to inflate itself but what I want to do
is provide that capability to the
mechanic as well so what I can do is
give a function to the Mike instance
right I can have a function called
inflate tires so I can say Mike dot
inflate tires equals and say bicycle one
dot inflate tires alright so we know
that inflate tires is a property which
happens to be a function basically
taking that function instance and then
creating a new property on mechanic
object and giving that name inflate
tires as well so I can call my dot
inflate tires and I basically run this
anonymous function that's over here now
what happens if I call my dot inflate
first if I were to do this what would
happen what would happen is that this
function would get called all right so
just to focus on the part that I've
highlighted here the fact that it
happens to be inside another object is
emitting
now because it's being executed in the
context of the mic object so all that
you have left over here in the mic
object is what's highlighted here which
is an anonymous function which does this
dot dial pressure plus equals three all
right so now then this function gets
executed in the context of the Mike
object what would be the value of the
distance here remember what I've told
you when you say object reference dot
function and that function is using the
this reference that this reference
points to that object instance so in
this case this will refer to the Mike
instance right so this object Mike
object that's what that this is going to
refer to when this function gets
executed in the context of the Mike
instance now we have a problem this dial
pressure in the case of Mike is going to
be undefined right so there's no tire
pressure property on the mechanic so it
is going to be undefined so undefined
plus equals three is going to give not
number value so when I say my dad
inflate tires it's going to try and
execute the inflate tires on the
mechanic itself which is not a good idea
and it's not going to work so what I
would like to do is be able to pass in
the bike object that I want Mike to to
inflate the tires off right I want Mike
to be able to inflate the tires of any
bicycle that's passed not just one
particular bike and definitely not try
to apply that operation on himself now
what I could do is change this function
to say rather than it referred to this
just I accept the bicycle object as an
argument and then change the tire
pressure font the fact that it's
referring to this means that it can
execute only in the context of a bicycle
it cannot execute anywhere else and
that's where we have this problem right
but let's say this is not feasible let's
say I don't want to change the function
itself I still wanted to refer to this
but what I want to do here is when I'm
calling the inflate tires in the context
of Mike I want to somehow circumvent the
behavior that JavaScript has by default
you know this referring to itself
I want to substitute the value I want to
send a new object and say hey JavaScript
interpreter I'm calling this function
and that function could potentially use
keyword whenever it uses the dis keyword
I want you to bind the disky word to
this other object rather than the
default that you normally do right I
want to somehow tell the interpreter to
use another object far using the desk
keyword and the way to do this is by
using the forth way of calling functions
the fourth way to call a function is let
me actually put this over here so that
it's isolated out from the other
discussion that we've been having let's
say I have a function foo okay so this
is one way to call the function another
the fourth way to call the function is
by using a property on the function
object you remember when you have a
function true we have a function foo
this is actually an object right foo is
actually an object and it has some
properties one of the property on the
foo is a function call call yes you
heard that right
it might interest your brain a bit at
least you did mine when I first learned
about it so let me repeat that again a
function in JavaScript is an object
right and that object can have
properties turns out every function
object in JavaScript has an
out-of-the-box property which happens to
be another function right so that
property is called call so I can say
food art call and I'm going to get
another function that's that comes out
of the box now what does this call
function do well true to its name it
lets you call the function foo so I can
do something like this
and it basically calls foo so this line
line 36 is exactly the same as just
calling the function itself line 37 okay
so this does exactly what this does just
calls the function so now you might be
wondering who in their right mind would
do something like this when you can do
something like this right rather than
just say the function open close why
would you access a call property on the
function and execute that which is
essentially doing the same thing as just
calling the function directly well the
reason the call property is important is
that it takes an argument which could be
an object okay I can pass an object over
here now what does passing an object
the call property do what it does is it
takes this object and binds this object
whatever you pass over here it takes it
and it binds it to the distance on the
function foo so now what's going to
happen is if you happen to have a
distance in the function foo let's say
this dart ABC equals d EF right so you
have some code over here like this
now when you pass an object to the call
property of the function the JavaScript
interpreter does two things it calls the
function like you would expect it to but
when it executes the function it binds
that this reference or that function to
the object that's passed as an argument
to the call function so now whenever you
access this in this function this is
bound to the object that's passed so you
can basically choose what object you
want that this reference to point to
this is different from the other three
methods that we've talked about where
that this reference is based on a rule
right it's implicit given a method you
know exactly what this reference points
to in the case of executing as a nominal
function without any context this refers
to the global if it's in the context of
an object with reference to the object
if it's new it refers to the newly
created function you don't have a choice
there but here you have a choice about
what object with this reference points
to you can choose whatever it is that
you want okay so hopefully this makes
sense if not you know feel free to
rewind and watch it again this is an
important way in which you can call
functions by binding the dis reference
to an arbitrary object an object of your
choice all right now now that you
understood this let's look at how that
applies over here an object which is a
mechanic and I want to call the inflate
tires function on that object and I know
that the inflate tires function uses the
distance to get hold off the bicycle to
start pressure it needs to inflate now I
want to change this to pass in a bicycle
who started pressure one inflate and not
inflate that I pressure off the mechanic
itself which doesn't make any sense
so in order to do this I need to
change what the distance binds to or
here for just perfect because now we
know how to do that
we just need to do the call method on
the function that we are calling and
pass in the object that we want to
change all right so let me actually run
this you clear this out and I am going
to not call this for now and I'm just
going to reload and run over here and
now if I access bicycle one you see it
has all the usual stuff it as a tire
pressure freeing and I have inflate
tires I can of course call the bicycle
one dot inflate tires and inflate the
tire pressure off bicycle one by three
and now it's 31 now let's let's look at
the mechanic I have a mechanic called
Mike who has the name property and it
has the inflate tires property as well
now if I were to call Mike card inflate
tires what's going to happen this
inflate tires is going to try and apply
the function on the Mike instance the
Mike does not have a tire pressure
property obviously so if I try inflate
tires its going to say Mike dot tire
pressure plus equals three which is
going to get undefined plus equals three
which is going to be not a number if I
were to try this and access Mike object
again you see tire pressure there is now
not number because it tries to add three
to the tire pressure off the Mike object
it doesn't make sense what I want to do
is call Mike dot inflate tires this
function but bind it to bicycle one I
want to inflate the tire pressure of
bicycle one so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to get the function instance
and I'm going to use the call property
of that function and in this call
property if I were to call it directly
it's going to be exactly the same as
this right but I don't want to call it
directly what I want to do is bind this
to bicycle one so I'm going to say
bicycle one here and now if I were to
call it guess what happens if I refer to
the object Mike it's still undefined
which wouldn't have changed anyway but
if I were to access bicycle one
you see here the tire pressure is now
increased it's 34 compared to 31 it was
before all right now I can change the
tire pressure of any bicycle so let it
get bicycle to the tire pressure is 33
so I'm going to ask Mike to inflate the
tire pressure of bicycle two now all
right so I'm going to say Mike dot
inflate tire start cause of bicycle 2
which binds the dis reference in this
function to bicycle two
now if I were to access bicycles do you
see the tire pressure has increased
alright so this is the fourth way in
which you can call functions which is
using the dot call property off the
function you're trying to call and you
can bind different objects to it so
let's quickly recap the four different
ways in which you can call functions and
what did this reference means in each
case so here's what we've looked earlier
these are the four different ways in
which we can call functions now that we
know the fourth way I'm going to add
that here food call and then it can take
an optional argument which is what did
this binds to all right so these are the
four ways so hopefully this was clear I
definitely encourage you to play around
the test write a few functions call them
these different ways of calling
functions and see what the distance is
in each case okay before we wind up this
video I should let you know that this
reference is one of those really
confusing concepts in the JavaScript
programming language and even a lot of
the advanced developers fail to
understand some of the nuances are to
this reference so if you've been
following along and you feel fairly
confident in understanding what we've
been talking about so far you should be
proud and give yourself a pat on the
back and if you feel that you have
confused about some of these concepts I
definitely encourage you to revisit the
relevant portions of the video and
hopefully to make more sense the second
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
