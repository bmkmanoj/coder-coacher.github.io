we did property lookups and objects if
the object did not have the property
that was requested it was kind of hiding
off the request to the prototype object
and checking the prototype object had
the property that you were looking for
so it's kind of something like this so
you have an object here and you're
asking hey object dot property right
some property of your choice you're
asking to see if the object has the
property the object has it it would
return it and if it doesn't have it what
you could do is actually look up from
the prototype and say hey prototype do
you have it and now if the prototype has
the thing that you're looking for it
would give it back as though the object
itself had that property and we ended
they we ended the video with the
question why is this there why is it
even doing something like this the
advantage of doing something like this
becomes very clear when you realize that
there could be multiple objects that get
created from a particular function
called as a constructor and then it does
when there are multiple objects that are
created from a knew of the same function
they all share the same prototype so
let's say you have something added to
the prototype right so the first thing
you're going to do is find out a
function that you have an employee
function over here and then this is the
prototype for the employee function now
you say new employee you get an object
this object type property is the
underscore underscore proto property of
course is this object now if you were to
say the employee dot prototype dot and
then define a method here define a
function as a property right now if you
access an employee and you're looking
for that property that you define in the
prototype you're going to get it right
because as long as this object does not
have that property it is going to look
up and get it from the prototype the
advantage of doing this over here is
that let's say you create another object
off the same employee function now even
this object is going to get that
property because it's defined in the
prototype every object that gets created
using the new keyword on that function
is going to get that behavior so this is
a way in which you can create behaviors
that apply to multiple objects as long
as they're created from the same
constructor function
in order to illustrate that I'm going to
create an employee function a couple of
objects and show you how this works
right I have a fresh firefox tab over
here with a blank page and up here I'm
going to create a function we call this
function employee
this is a constructor function have
denoted the e capital to indicate that
and up here what I'm going to do is I'm
going to create an employee object let's
just use the name for a noun so let's
say this takes in a name as an argument
and here I'm just going to say this dot
name equals name so I'm just setting the
name here and this is my employee
function it's meant to be called in the
constructor and whatever name you pass
in there is going to be assigned to the
name property of the object that gets
constructed fairly simple employee
object just one property all right so
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create a couple of employee objects
which they say of war MP 1 equals new
employee this is the way to create an
employee object because I'm calling this
employee function with the constructor
mode and I'm going to give this the name
of gym and now EMP 1 is an object with
the property the name gym now I'm going
to go ahead and create one more object
emp2 I'm going to set the name to Pam
and now if I were to access EMP - I have
another employee object with the name of
Pam so I have two employee objects over
here now what if I want to create a
common property across these employee
objects that is going to contain the
same value like some kind of a function
property let's say I want to create a
function called play pranks and I want
both EMP 1 and EMP 2 to have a function
property called play pranks so one way
to do this is to modify the constructor
object and say this dot play pranks
equals and that function so whenever you
do a new employee the employee object
that gets returned is going to contain
that extra function property but then
that is not the best way to do this
because now since we have two objects
here both those objects are going to
have a unique copy off the same function
so if you have a hundred different
employee objects they're going to be 100
copies which is not good so what I'm
going to do in
let us create that function on the
prototype of employee
so if you look at the employees
prototype object this employee dot
prototype right here you see there is an
object here and we can set things on
this object so let me go ahead and do
that I'm going to create a plugin call
so this is an anonymous function which
just does console that log of prank
played but I'm assigning it to a
property play pranks on the employees
prototype object now I can call this
directly from here play pranks and I'm
going to get that function executed but
that's not the idea if you want to
execute this function from the employees
now guess what happens if I were to say
in p1 dot play pranks what's gonna
happen is the JavaScript engine is going
to check if emp1 has a property called
play pranks and it does not because
right now we have MP 120 is just one
property which is a name so what it's
going to do is it's going to look up the
prototype the underscore underscore
proto and guess what the prototype has
this function so it is going to call
that instead now if I were to execute
this I get the console log message what
happens if I were to access this in emp2
I get the same function executed but how
many copies of the function were there
there is just one because I've said it
on the prototype so the good thing about
this is no matter how many objects you
create out of the employee constructor
you are going to have this play pranks
ability on all those objects because the
object does not have the property out of
the box you're not setting it in the
constructor so when the function is
looked up on the object it differs it to
the prototype and the prototype has the
property of set it here and the
prototypes function is going to execute
and it looks as if the object has that
property even though it does not write
so this is the reason why the prototype
lookup
is pretty handy you can define behaviors
and have it apply to every employee that
gets created so I hope that means insert
a couple of things that I want to
mention before we wind up the first
thing is that this affects all employees
that are created afterwards as well all
right so let's say I create one more
imply here and I can do EMP three-dot
lay pranks and it is going to work as
well all right because it is still
pointing to the same prototype now the
other thing that I want to mention is
that this lookup happens dynamically at
runtime so let's say I have a greet
function and I want to do EMP do dot
greet this is not going to work because
Cree does not exist on EMP to are on the
prototype but I can actually add this to
the prototype at runtime so I can say
employee dot prototype and now I have a
greet function on the prototype and now
if I were to say EMP to door greet I'm
going to get that function in each in
each employee ok so this is kind of
different from the traditional model of
classes that we look at in some of the
other programming languages if you think
of prototypes is kind of an equivalent
for classes this is very diverse in a
class model you will have to define all
the behaviors upfront before the
execution but here in the prototype
model you don't have to do that you can
put things on the prototype at runtime
and the minute you add that extra
property every object that was created
from the employee as a constructor even
the ones that were created before you
added that on the prototype would still
work because the prototype lookup
happens at runtime</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
