that I declare over here so I have this
first line which declares the readable
foo and then somewhere down the road I
want to use that variable foo okay now
if I were to ask you with this variables
declaration required what would the
answer be the answer isn't that clear
the answer actually depends on what
you're doing with that variable
afterwards this is not the case in some
of these stricter programming languages
you know in languages like Java or C++
without declaring available you cannot
even use it I mean you get a compliation
error but in the case of JavaScript it's
a little bit more you know it depends on
what you're doing with the variable now
let's say I just print this okay just to
console that log or foo
all right so this is a variable that I
have declared but I haven't defined how
many given it a value so the value is
undefined if I were to reload and run
I'm going to get and the fact now what's
gonna happen if I don't declare this
let's say I skip the declaration step
and I just do cancel that log of foo
okay if I were to reload and run see
what happens you get a syntax error it
says expected expression and got
parenthesis but basically the idea is
it's trying to find out what foods and
it doesn't find it it's available that
doesn't exist so declaration this is
required because without this didn't
work right with this it seems to work
fine so can I say yes declarations are
required in JavaScript now let me do one
more thing let's say I remove the
declaration which rather than printing
the value of foo I say foo equals 10
okay I'm not declaring foo but I'm just
assuming the variable to exist and then
I'm assigning a value to it now we saw
before we used foo without declaring if
we got an error right now let's see what
happens if I run this nothing happens
which is interesting
let me print the value console dot log
off foo reload and run I get the value
10 so it turns out this time the
compiler the interpreter didn't complain
right I'm still using food without
declaring it but this time the
interpreter seems to be okay with it
actually created a variable called foo
and I was able to print that value later
right so what's going on here the
difference is in the nature of the
operation when I just did this I just
did console that log of foo what I was
doing here is a read operation whereas
when I do full equals then what I'm
doing here is a write operation so if
you use a variable without declaring it
it's okay to do a write operation but
it's not okay to do a read operation if
you do a write operation on a variable
without declaring it it works fine but
if you do a read operation on a variable
without declaring it it gives you an
error okay so this is actually the
distinction between the read and the
write operations it influences how
JavaScript looks at undeclared variables
so that's one major difference now you
might be wondering if this line is
creating a variable called foo now there
is this Weibull being created the answer
is in the global scope but in order to
really examine what's going on here you
need to wait a few more videos when I
talk about how this cop hierarchy works
but remember that there is this
difference if you declare variables you
can do both read and write operations
just fine
but if you don't declare variables you
can do write operations in which case it
creates the variable for you but you
cannot do read operations because in
this case it does not create a variable
it throws an error</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
