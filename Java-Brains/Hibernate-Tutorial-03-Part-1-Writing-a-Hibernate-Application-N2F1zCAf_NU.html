groundwork required to configure a
project to use hibernate we created a
new project we added the hibernate
library and we added the JDBC library so
now we are all set to write code that
uses hibernate now before we start let's
look at what we would need to do in
order to save an object to the database
if you're not using hibernate because
this is this the scenario a current code
in this tutorial we're going to take an
object and we'll use hibernate to save
that object to the database now what
would we need to do if we're not using
hibernate in order to save an object to
the database assuming we are starting
from the scratch we don't have anything
in place and except for what we did in
our previous tutorial which is we
included all the required jars and we
have a project now if we are starting
from scratch what would we have to do if
we're just using JDBC drivers first we
will have to do the JDBC configuration
we need to tell JDBC which database we
are actually interested in we need to
give the you know the IP the port number
and the user ID password so this kind of
configuration has to be done for the
JDBC to allow it to connect to the
database okay next we need to write the
model object which is the object that we
want to save let's take an example user
object you know this is the example that
we took earlier in order to save the
user object first we need to have the
object in place we need to write the
class so this needs to be done next we
need to have a service method that
instantiates this model object we need
some method which provides the values to
the object and creates an object in the
first place which which is required to
be saved the next step is the database
design now I have a user object and I
need to save it to the database before I
do before I write code to save I will
need to have a table in place in my
database which which holds this user
object so depending on the fields that I
want to save I will have to create the
tables
and have the corresponding columns so
that I can save the object data into
that table the next step is to actually
write the DAO layer we need to write
code which is a method which takes this
object and it generates the sequel
queries it call it uses the JDBC
connection and it creates a connection
it runs the query and it inserts the
data to the database so these are at a
high level the steps required in order
to save an object to the database if you
were not using hibernate now let's see
how hibernate changes the whole picture
first of all the JDBC database
configuration yes this is still required
even if we're using hibernate because no
matter what framework you use you would
still need to tell that framework what
the database is if there is no frame
work can automatically find it out so we
need to tell hibernate what database we
are interested in what database
hibernate needs to connect to in order
to save the data so this is done in
hibernate by using the hibernate
configuration file it's an XML file that
we will write and this will give
information to hibernate as to what
database it needs to connect to secondly
the module object we will need to have a
module object because hibernate needs to
know what object it needs to save and we
will have a mortal object and we will
configure it in such a way that
hibernate knows what needs to be saved
and how so this is again something that
will you know it will be more clear when
we start writing the code but yes the
model object needs to be written and we
will configure hibernate to you know get
data out this model object by using
annotations the third step which we saw
as the service method so the service
method will have an instance of the
model object and normally what it would
do is it would pass the model object to
a data layer which uses C DB C instead
in the hibernate way of doing things the
service method would pass the object to
hibernate ap is the
method would use hibernate API
statically or pass it on to a data layer
which uses hibernate ap is so it's
actually the hibernate API switch do the
save of the model object database design
it's not needed we'll have a look at how
this is done you don't really have to
create a table for every object as long
as you configure the model object the
right way hibernate creates the tables
itself and finally the last point which
is creating the data layer where you map
the object to queries this is the
biggest challenge when it comes to
writing data layer code for converting
objects into a relational model so this
major step is actually not needed when
they using hibernate as I mentioned here
the service method directly calls the
hibernate api's and the hibernate api's
take care of saving the object we don't
have to write this dao method where we
take the objects pull it apart write
sequel queries execute them all that as
totally bypassed when we using hibernate
so to summarize what are the things we
need to do first we need to write the
hibernate configuration in order to
provide the database details and other
configuration to control the way
hibernate works the second step we need
to write the model object and we'll be
using annotations to configure the model
object so the hibernate knows where to
save the model object third we need a
service method which uses hibernate in
order to save the model object so our
service method will probably be a simple
class with the main method we will
instantiate some test objects off the
model that we have written and we will
use a hibernate API to save those to
save those objects and these two steps
can be easily skipped so let's start
coding the first of the three steps is
to write the hibernate configuration
file so I'll right-click new file I will
call this configuration file as
hibernate dot C of G dot XML so this is
the default name for the
vennett configuration file if you stick
to this name then you would not need to
specify anything to hibernate but say
you're using a different configuration
file then you would have to pass the
configuration file name so that
hibernate knows where the configurations
are the easier way is to just stick to
the default so that hibernate searches
for this file finds it and then you know
looks up the configuration details I
will save this hibernate configuration
file in the SRC folder say finish ok the
configuration file is blank right now we
will need to type in all the details
that we need to provide to hibernate
like what our Postgres database details
are and other things to get a head start
what we can do is we can pull up some of
the configuration files that have come
with us with a hibernate download so if
you look up the hibernate directory that
is this project folder and inside this
project folder you have all these
example code so what I do here is I
search for hibernate dot CFG or XML
there are there are a lot of
configuration files so let's let me just
open one of these so here you can see
this is an example configuration file
with all the required all the required
information so what we need to do is we
need to just change the values according
to what we have so in this example they
are using the h2 database so in this
case we will have to just replace this
with our Postgres database details and
of course if you're using h2 you can use
most of the values here as is so just
let's select all copy this and paste it
here note that some of the some of the
guy you know the search results might
not have all of the details let's look
at this one yeah as you can see here
this does not have all of the details so
in this case it's not a good idea to
pull this out and copy it look for XML
files which have
database connection settings JDBC
connection pool all these things so you
can easily make it out by looking at the
file contents make sure you take a XML
file which has all these contents so I
have this file here I'll leave all the
starting information as is now here are
the database connection settings so I
need to provide the database connection
details for my Postgres database so how
do I get the driver class and the
connection URL on all these details
again a Google search should give you
all the information required for the
database that you are connecting to so
what's the first value we have
connection driver class so this is the
driver class in our JDBC driver in my
case I think it is yeah here's a driver
class it is r dot post risk SQL dot
driver so it will be or dot the drive
it's a small case and the oh we have the
driver class set now what is the
connection URL again a quick Google
search told me that the connection URL
for Postgres is this
so JDBC : Postgres colon double slash
host :
board slash database so in my case since
I have it on my local machine the host
would be local host if you've set it up
on a different machine then you would
have to give the IP of that machine now
port by default for post press is 5 4 3
2 again depending on your database you
will have to look up the port number the
database itself that we are connecting
to let me create a new database I will
call this
hibernate and go to hibernate DB so I
will have to create this database inside
my Postgres installation so that I will
use this database and all my tables that
I'm going to create in this program will
be inside this hibernate DB database so
here I have my PG admin console so it's
a new database hibernate DB I'll leave
everything else as a default and say ok
this will create the database for me
ok now the user ID and password is what
you would have mentioned when you were
installing the database in my case the
user IDs Postgres and the password is
password ok now we're done with the
database connection settings now
hibernate will know which database to
connect and what driver to use and since
we have already specified we have
supplied the driver jar hibernate is all
set to connect to the Stata base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
