Java you know that one of the most
common uses off methods in an object in
a class is accessor methods right so you
have getters and setters those are
probably the most common method you
would write in a language like Java so
how would you have accessor methods in a
language like JavaScript let's let's try
that out let's say I have a bar person
equals I'm going to have the same first
name property which is my first name and
last name property which is my last name
simple object now let's say I want to
create a method on this to get the full
name right first name plus last name now
I can just create a temporary method
here which is say get full name there's
going to be a function has to be and
let's say I return a simple string for
now call not implemented yet now in
order to access this what I would do is
I would say person dot get full name and
this is going to return whatever the
method the function returns here it's
happens to be a string so I'm going to
have a powerful name variable which
holds on to that and then I can do a
console dot log off full name and it
should print not implemented yet because
we haven't implemented that logic now
let's add the logic in order to get the
full name ok so what would that logic be
I would need to do a first name plus
last name right that's what would get me
the full name so how would I do first
name plus last name I would do person
dot first name plus have a space here so
that this looks good
and then I'm going to do a person dot
last name so what happens is this
initializes the object with these
parameters and then then the person dot
get full name is called this function is
going to execute and it's going to get
person that first name person that last
name add that up and return it and
ideally full name should have full name
with those two strings add it up let's
run this
well I do get the full name so it looks
to be good looks like it's working but
there is a risk involved in the scored
this code is fragile it's there are
things you can do to break this very
easily so can you guess what
what's the drawback of doing something
like this the first question that I get
from people when I explain to them about
this piece of code is that they get
confused about the order of initializing
this stuff okay so when they look at
this line the first question that comes
to their mind is hey I'm accessing
person but I'm doing this inside the
initialization block of the person
object so is there a chance that the
person object isn't ready when this line
gets executed to that question I would
say the answer is no it does not have
that problem this works perfectly fine
the reason why this works perfectly fine
is this line line number five gets
executed only after this line is
executed line number nine is executed
okay this initializes the function but
it doesn't actually execute it okay line
five gets executed only when person dot
get full name is called so there's no
risk of you accessing a person object
that is not fully prepared right you can
access the person object while the
person object is being constructed
because all that this block does the one
that I'm highlighting here all that it
does is it takes a function and assigns
it to a property doesn't care what's
inside the function what's inside the
function matters only when the function
is being called so by the time the
function is being called the person
object is fully initialized so you don't
run into the risk of using an object
that's partially being in july's that's
not an issue what I'm talking about is a
different issue the issue is that you
are depending on the name of the
variable inside the object now this
works
fine we have tested it I am executing
this it works perfectly fine but now
let's say further down the line there is
some other piece of code that does
something like this person equals open
course ok now I lose the object because
that was what was assigned to person I'm
assigning a new object to it so the
object that I initialized from lines one
to seven there is now gone but since its
objects objects are potentially you know
variables pointing to a location in
memory what if I held onto that object
using some other variable now let's say
I have another variable here bar person
2 equals person and now I have person
initialized to an empty object now the
object that I initialized before still
exists but the name of the variable
that's pointing to that object is person
2 so since these variables are just
pointers I should be able to do person 2
dot get full name it should work
shouldn't it think about what happens
when I do this when I do a person to
that get full name
well its person to this pointing to this
object it's no longer assigned to person
it's assigned to person 2 now so get
full name is going to access this
property of that object it realizes the
properties of functions which can
execute it now what is the line that it
executes it executes return person dot
first-name the space this person that
last name now it's going to find what
person that first name is what is person
their first name here person is an empty
object so person dot first name is
undefined it's gonna add space to it
person that last name is undefined so
the output that you're going to get back
is undefined space undefined let's try
that out
have console the log person to target
for the full name and let me remove this
console that log if I were to run this
you see you get undefined undefined what
it should have written return was still
kashyyk otago right because that's the
first name and that's the last name but
the thing is get full name function is
hard-coded
to point to the person variable so
forgetful name to work there has to be a
variable called person pointing to that
object if person points to a different
object nothing works right the function
breaks so that's the reason why I said
this is fragile code right it cannot
have the person variable change so in
order to make this less fragile in order
for this code to work even though you
are you know you're okay with the person
will be being changed
you should stop depending on the person
variable but you cannot hard code the
name person here because that's what
could potentially change and cause this
to break what you need to do instead is
to be able to say I don't want to get
the person variables first name because
that could potentially change I just
want the first name off the object that
I am a part off right whatever the
object the get full name is a part of
that objects first name right so that's
what you need to do here okay I want the
self objects first name in here I want
the self objects last name
in order to have referred to the self
the object of which the function is a
part of there is a special keyword and
that keyword is called this so this is
the keyword which is used in a lot of
different languages like C it's C++ and
Java JavaScript has some similar ways of
using this but there are places where it
changes drastically but in this case I
think it's more or less the same instead
of seeing person dot first-name you see
this struct first name and then this
start lasting so I don't explicitly
depend on as
specific variable I say depend on
whatever the instance that I'm a part of
now if I were to print this it still
works because I don't care what person
is pointing to I'm not using that in
this function could point to anything
else
I'm always referring to myself so this
this keyword is an important concept in
the case of JavaScript especially when
you're working with functions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
