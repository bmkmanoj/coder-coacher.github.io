you can display a value in your HTML so
we have this out of the variable that
we're using the conditionally you know
add or remove elements from the Dom but
now what if I want to just show the our
update let's say I'm going to have like
a message here I would say so
so yeah paragraph tag here and then we
are off the day is then I want to show
the out of the day here
how do I you how do I get this plan you
are actually short on the Dom I don't a
conditionally show an element I want to
actually show the value of that element
right how do I do this the way to do
this is as you can guess it's another
directive right so I'm going to add this
directive over here in another paragraph
here let's say I'm going to add the the
art of day over here alright I want to
show the art of day here the way to do
this is by using a directive in that
element called ng - bind right ng bind
lets you bind this HTML element to the
value of a particular variable or an
expression so in this case I want to
bind this paragraph to the value of our
update so I'm just going to put our
update here and then let's refresh this
you can see the paragraph as the value 9
if I just want to have this inside this
paragraph I can actually move this in
then of course I cannot have a paragraph
inside a paragraph because their block
elements so I just change this to a span
so that it doesn't go into a new line so
just change this to span as well and now
it just shows up in the same paragraph
so this ng bind can be applied to any
element that can contain content so here
you know we tried within a paragraph
we tried it in a span you can even put
it on a div and whatever is the value is
going to be the content of that div you
can also have expressions here it's
gonna evaluate it for some reason you
want to add one to your hour of day and
display that it just adds that in this
placeit right so it evaluates
this expression in this case this
expression is just a variable so it just
shows that variable the syntax is
something like this you add in G bind as
an attribute to add to an element and
then you assign the value with the
variable name in the expression and what
angular is going to do is it's going to
take that content it's going to take the
value of that variable
it's obviously going to do a scope dot
again remember any variable reference in
HTML is automatically a scope dot name
okay so it's going to get that username
in this case trying to get username from
the scope object and it's going to put
it in this pan right so something like
this username if username as the value
Koscheck it's going to add cosh it into
the h1 paratext has lorem ipsum text
it's going to add that content into the
paragraph okay there is a shorthand for
this which is the double curly braces
anytime you want to add the value of a
variable into the element you just add
it up locally braces in which case you
can put it in any arbitrary location
here I'm putting it in the span and this
is just the same as doing an indie bind
for that vehicle it's exactly the same
thing there is one minor difference but
that shouldn't influence the output when
the VA bill is actually resolved here
are some expressions examples so 22 by 7
actually does mean 2 by 7 divides 22 by
7 gets the number and then shows that in
the expression 1 plus 1 is going to
evaluate it and then show the number 2
so it does mathematical expressions
evaluations as well as variable value
resolutions right that's angular is
going to do that I haven't put that
value into the DOM and again all these
expressions are evaluated against the
scope just like these three directives
we saw refer to the scope even
expressions refer to the scope object
alright so I'm going to quickly
demonstrate the double curly braces and
show you an advantage over here so here
I have a span with ng bind is RFD so
instead of doing this ng bound over here
what I'm going to do is just do the
double curlies
our day right so it's just going to put
this element this value inside the span
because this just happens to be inside
this fan refresh this there's not going
to be any difference but the cool thing
here is since this farm at this double
curly format doesn't need an element you
can actually put this in the paragraph
directly along with this text you
remember the reason why we did the span
was because we had to have an element to
do the ng bind to it alright so if I
hadn't done that let me actually get rid
of this now let's say in this paragraph
R of T is and then there's nothing here
right so let's say I did ng bind over
here in G by be closed or off
ding all right now what will happen now
angular would Express would evaluate
this ng bind I would just say okay this
paragraph needs to contain the value of
R of T so it would just take all this
content out and just put the R of T so
you would lose the Scanjet friends let
me refresh this and I'll show you what I
mean you see that angular just replace
the content of this paragraph with
whatever you had in ng bind which was
why I had to create another element over
here with the span right so I had to
create a span here which is ok this is
what's going to contain R of T and you
know this is going to be an empty or
empty span container because no matter
what you put in there angular is going
to replace that with the R of T value
right this is why you had to have this
HTML element but now with the topic
curly braces I don't have to do this
anymore
I can just add the double curly brace
your and then R off they now angular is
going to just retain this as is and it's
going to take this value n put it in
here directly right so if I were to
refresh this so thus this content
remains as this and angular is just
adding this over here right so this is
double curly it's frequently used
because of this very purpose that you
can just actually put this anywhere and
it's just going to add it to the HTML
directly the other thing to remember is
that this is probably the first instance
of you seeing an angular feature which
is not a directive so far everything
we've seen there's a directive as an
HTML extension
right ng app in the unit and
and deprive this is probably the first
occurrence of a non html-based
feature that you get to use an angular
just something to note this is double
curlies it's very handy when you want to
add these kind of arbitrary values</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
