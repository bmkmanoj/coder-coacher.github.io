another look at our wisdom so I have the
sharp info service we're still open
because that's kind of like the simpler
of the two and look at this section for
the operations so you have two messages
which are defined in the operation so
there is an input message and an output
message and this ties in with our Java
class here
sharp info and this is the method which
is which corresponds to the operation J
I have the input and you have the output
right so think about this for a minute
is there a possibility that the output
might not happen we know that we need to
provide an input for an operation or a
method to get call but is there a
possibility that the output message
might not be returned now think about it
in the Java world is it is it possible
that this string might not be returned
as a return type of this method well
it's possible when this method throws an
exception right we haven't thought about
that eventualities so now what happens
if during the execution of this method
there is an exception that's thrown and
this line never gets executed so in that
case a string is never returned as a
part of this method and the output
message is never constructed right there
is no message to return as a part of the
output instead there is an exception now
what happens in that in that scenario
well we're going to examine that in this
tutorial by actually throwing an
exception and we notice here that the
gate sharp info takes in an input
property and depending on the property
it returns an output response and if the
property is not something that this
method recognizes right now this method
recognizes just two it looks at the
Sharpe name and since if it's neither of
the two it just returns invalid property
now what I want to do for this method is
if the input property is neither of
these two that I'm checking over here I
want to actually throw an exception
instead of just returning a string so
I'm going to make that change by just
making this as null and I'm going to add
an else block here if it's
neither of these two then I want to
throw a custom exception so I'm going to
create a new exception of my own so I'm
going to try take your new Java class
and I'm going to call this invalid input
exception and the superclass is going to
be
java.lang exception
finish
so when I'm writing an exception class
for a web service for a soap web service
there are specific things that I would
need to do I'm just going to walk you
through the things that I'm doing here
specifically for a web service exception
and then we'll see how that affects the
response from the web service so the
first thing I'm going to do is have a
string of private string error details
so I want to store information about the
error as a string and then I'm going to
have a constructor
that takes in two arguments one s a
string reason which is the reason for
the error and then the second argument
is the error details so I want whoever
throws this exception to be able to
provide me with these two details okay
one is the reason why the error happen
and then the second is information about
the error itself now the reason is
something I'm going to pass to the
parent exception this is this is usual
stuff right this is what you would
normally do for an exception the error
details is something that's special over
here so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to have this dot error details
equals edit details so I'm going to
capture information about the error over
here and what I'm also going to do is
I'm going to have a method public
you
get fault info so I'm creating a
specific method called gate fault info
in which I'm going to return this error
details that I'm capturing
and this is my exception so most of it
should make sense except for this get
Fault info and me returning the error
details and we'll understand that when
we actually see the response in action
so I have created a custom exception now
right nothing too fancy just except for
this method it's pretty much you know
the run-of-the-mill exception so I'm
going to use this exception now in my
sharp info so I'm going to throw this
invalid input exception then the input
property is not something that I
recognize okay so I'm going to
see-through
invalid input exception and it has a
constructor that takes two arguments
right the reason as well as the error
details so the reason is going to be
invalid input and the details about the
error is going to be I'm going to just
print back the property that I've got
and say I don't understand this property
okay so I'm going to say property
is not a valid input
okay so I'm going to okay forgot the new
here now since I'm throwing this
exception I need to add it to the
declaration so I need the method to say
this method throws an invalid input
exception okay now if I save and publish
this I'm not doing anything else right
I'm creating an exception and I'm
throwing that exception in the method
and since Java requires it I'm also
declaring that this method throws this
exception and now I'm going to publish
this
now if I open up the mister I'm going to
open this in a new tab so that we can
see the difference
one difference is fairly obvious in the
operations there is a third message here
so this is the hidden message that have
been talking about we haven't seen this
so far but we are seeing it now and the
reason for that is that we have declared
this method throws this exception so the
vessel that gets generated automatically
knows that there is a possible filed
that gets generated out of this
operation and it actually declares it in
the mr. so filed is the webservice
terminology for exceptions if something
goes wrong you get a fault message okay
so we have an input message which needs
to be sent for the operation to execute
if the operation executes successfully
you have an output message that's
declared over here and if the operation
fails and we get an invalid input
exception which is the exception that
gets declared we have a fault message
okay so a couple of questions here now
what happens if it throws multiple
exceptions now this method could throw
another exception right so in that case
there will be another fault message so
you can actually have multiple fault
messages so it's not just two messages
that an operation has it could have
multiple messages depending on the you
know the output as well as the
exceptions now the filed message itself
is referring to the invalid input
exception type so just like the input
and the output messages refer to types
the fault message is also referring to
this type so let's take a look at this
type now I'm going to open up the schema
location here again
and if you see here there is an
additional complex type called an
Mallard input exception and it has two
elements the fault info and the message
okay
so everything is pretty much the same
that looks the same way as a standard
output message but the thing is this is
specifically for error scenarios so the
invalid input exception message
specifically thrown specific
specifically returned when an invalid
input exception is actually thrown in
the code so let's test this out I'm
going to use the tester for this
and now if I have a valid input
you get a valid response which is good
but now what if there is an invalid
input now if I execute this method with
this invalid input what I get is an
output that looks like this so this is
the slope response from the invalid
execution so what we have here is an
element called
s : fault so there is a fault element as
per the wisdom we have a fault code
which is s : so we haven't done anything
about this yet but notice the fault
string false string says invalid input
which is the value that we have
customized and then the detail has
invalid input exception so this is the
new type that was generated because of
our exception class and notice that it
has again two values here one is the
message which says invalid input again
but the fault info is what we have said
we are echoing back the input that the
user has entered invalid is not a valid
input right so this is the message that
we are printing so this is this is
basically what the response is going to
be but at this point of time you're
probably wondering why I haven't hit
this button right why I have not
submitted this invalid input in the
tester the reason is if I submit this
notice what happens if you actually get
an exception trace we are not getting
the message that I showed over here so
what's happening well what's happening
here is the GlassFish tester is actually
showing us the exception trace instead
of the fault message because it thinks
that it's actually handier for us as we
are Java developers to actually see this
stack trace but it's probably not a good
idea to show the stack trace as a part
of the soap response because you
remember a soap response has to be
technology independent and ideally a
soap response needs to have something
like this it needs to have the filed and
it needs to have the fault message so
this is actually what the endpoint would
provide but what we see here as a stack
trace is actually a limitation of the
GlassFish tester so how do we see this
message then how do we actually make
sure that the foiled message is actually
getting displayed fine
that we're going to use a couple of
tools that I'm going to explain in
detail in the next tutorial but you know
assume that this is what's the value
that gets generated and you know we've
seen how get this kind of an exception
from a custom exception class okay so
the gate fault info is what's getting
called by the framework to get the fault
information that we have said over here
and that's what's getting displayed in
the output okay so we're getting the
fault info over here so in this tutorial
we looked at how to create a custom
exception and how to throw that and get
a filed message as the output rather
than the standard output message of
invalid input right so we are having a
custom exception gets converted to a you
know a fault soap message in the next
tutorial we're going to explore some of
the tools that let us see this kind of a
soap message directly without having to
go through the GlassFish tester I am not
sure if there's a way to turn this off
and have the GlassFish tester show the
you know the fault message but I don't
want to bother with this right now
because I'm going to show you some tools
which kind of give you sub messages
directly so that we can actually see
