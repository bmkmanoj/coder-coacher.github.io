here with the configuration if you
remember what we did in the previous
course we had a WebEx ml but a couple of
things here
so you see here there is this Jersey web
application that's set up by a sublet so
we created a sublet which pointed to a
class called servlet container which set
the application up okay the second thing
that happened here is the init Balam
which stole the application where the
resource classes are you know that the
resource classes are classes math let
the ad path annotation so you had
something which told Jersey where to
look for those resource classes and the
third thing there was mapping to a
particular URL pattern right so the
sublet map to Web API slash star so we
know all our REST API is are exposed to
at slash web api slash star okay so
these are the three things that happen
over there now what are we doing here
with this new approach we have an
application right it's a class which
extends the base July X W SRS core
application now the extension itself
define your application right so you
created a class in your class path which
extended this application class now this
is all Jersey needs to define your
application right the second thing was
where resources are so right now we
don't have that configuration it looks
at all the classes in your class path
and if there is a class which has ADD
path annotation it picks it up and the
third thing is the URL where your APS
are mapped to and that's the Sanitation
application path annotation with Web API
so this is the equivalent of mapping a
servlet to slash web API slash star so
basically fix all the resources in your
class path and exposes them at Web API
slash onwards okay so these are the
three things and it's I hope you agree
that this is a significantly simpler way
of doing the same configuration okay now
let's look at application right if you
look at the Java Doc's for application
you see here
the class application defines the
components of a jax-rs application and
supplies additional metadata what's the
additional metadata we are supporting
here it's this Web API ok a jax-rs
application our implementation supplies
a concrete subclass of this abstract
class so what we see here as application
is actually an abstract class and what
we have as my app is a concrete subclass
off this abstract class even though this
class is abstract there are no methods
to implement right we don't have any
methods here however there are methods
that you could implement there are a
couple of methods here one is called
get classes and the get classes method
gets a set of route resources for your
class
now we didn't specify what resources we
want configured in our jax-rs
application like I said it just does a
class but scan gets all the resources
that have been mapped with the ad path
annotation however if you want to
exclude some resources or just include
certain resources you could implement
the get classes method in this class ok
so let's say you want to implement the
get classes method you would basically
override the default implementation and
then here what you do is you return the
set of classes that you need ok so I'm
going to return
and let's say I returned nothing right
so basically this overrides what
application does by default and there
are no resources registered if I want
only certain resources registered so I
create a new set of classes and then add
the classes that I want ok so this is
how you override the default behavior
and exclude certain classes if you want
but if you don't implement this by
default all the classes in the class
path that have the add annotation the
add path annotation are going to get
considered so there's other methods here
which are get singles in get properties
that we are not going to look at at this
time we're going to revisit that later
but this hopefully gives you an idea of
what's happening here this application
is an abstract class that you're
providing a concrete implementation off
and this with the annotation is all you
need to bootstrap a jax-rs application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
