so far we're going to switch focus to
the profile resource we're going to
create a new resource for profile and if
you remember the api's that we talked
about for a profile are the resource URL
for profile being slash profiles slash
the profile ID and the collection uri
being slash profiles the resource for
profile profile resource that we're
going to create in this tutorial it has
a lot of common stuff when compared to
what we've seen with messages right so
they shared a lot of the common things
there are a few nuances that I want to
highlight and that's the reason I want
to cover this in this tutorial but let's
cover that and then in the next section
we're going to move on to some advanced
topics so I'm going to create a new
service called profile service which
kind of contains a lot of the same
things that the messenger service has
right there are just a few small tweaks
the one tweak that I need to make one
change that I need to make here is in
the case of the message map look at the
database class dart Java for the message
map it makes sense for the kief of the
map to be long to be the ID but in the
case of profiles I don't know if that's
true anymore because for the profile you
need to look up based on the profile
name not by the ID because that's our
API is our design right we have profiles
slash profile name not the ID so that's
the first thing that's different among
these two so instead of having a long
here what I'm going to do is I'm going
to convert this to a string so I'm going
to set the profile name as the key and
the profile instance itself as the value
let me update this as well so that this
works fine so the meth the profile
service is going to be very similar to
the message service except for this
minor fact that the key is actually a
string so this how the profile service
is going to look like so we have a map
of string and profile which is what I
get from the kid profiles which is
basically the static instance so that
Avery profile service instance exists
the same map now I have the gate
profiles method so the list of methods
do match right so there is a get out
profiles which returns a list of
profiles there's a gate profile which
sticks in the profile name not the ID
here it takes in the profile name and it
does a profiles get off the profile name
is again looking up a map there is an
add profile method which takes in the
whole profile instance again it does the
set of ID because an ID is still needed
or it's not really needed in this case
but you would need an ID in a database
so I'm kind of following that I'm
setting the ID here to be one plus the
actual size so every time the ID
increments but then when I put this
instance to the map and not putting the
ideas the key and putting the profile
name is key and then I'm passing in the
profile instance of course I return the
profile here update profile does the
same thing it's taking in the profile
instance well here this has to change
I'm sorry so this has to be profile
target profile name
if the profile name is empty you return
null if not you just put that profile
name as a key and then set the profile
instance is a value and then return that
profile remove profile takes in the
profile name again so everywhere there
is an ID in messages message service
there is a profile name in the profile'
service and once it takes the profile
name it test profile start to remove off
the profile name so very very similar to
the message service except for the fact
that you have ID for all these lookups
in the message service and you have
profile names as you look up over here
I'm also going to do a constructor over
here because we need something to get us
started off I just have the simple
constructor it just puts to the profile
map the key thing my name car check and
creates a new profile with the ID one my
profile name which is Kaushik and my
first name and last name so this is the
convenience constructor that we have for
profiles so I'm just initializing this
so that there is one profile in the map
for us to start off with okay so this is
the profile service nice and simple now
we going to create a resource so I'm
going to create a new class profile
resource in messenger dot resources
finish and I will create a new instance
profile service
and now let's map stuff so we need the
ad path annotation which is mapping to
slash profiles and I'm going to set the
the other stuff to be the same consumers
and producers because it's always going
to be JSON for this blur now let's look
at each of these methods right so there
is a get messages which is a get four
slash messages which returns all
messages it needs to be an equivalent
for profiles you close these other guys
okay so there's going to be ad get and
method it's basically pretty much the
same we have a list of profiles being
returned from the profile service and
I'm getting calling a method called get
profiles and this is map to slash
profiles okay first method is done let's
look at the next one this is a post on
slash messages again adds a message
which takes in a profile and it calls
the add message off the service and then
returns whatever it returns back so
similarly there's going to be add post
and a very similar add profile method
which takes in the profile which is like
in the post body sends to the profile
service to add profile and then returns
the response right very similar let's
look at the next one put for our message
ID let's let's go in this order the way
we covered it right so next is get get
for message ID does a get message but
the path paramdham message ID and it's
the ID which is sent to the service
similarly we need to have a profile name
as the path param it's not profile ID
here it's not
equivalent of message-id right so we
have the profile name over here and
that's what needs to be mapped so let's
do a get and the path is going to be
slash profile name in curly braces
because that's what we need to map
at the method itself is fairly
straightforward you have the gate
profile main port but Bram if the kid
profile which takes in the path
parameters the profile name if you
already declared and it accepts it as a
string
remember a profile name is a string we
don't have conversion in this case and
I'm just passing that string to profile
service dot kit profile ok on to the
next one we have put so output basically
does the update write an update message
again Dixon the message ID and the
message sets the value and then update
so it sets the ID if it doesn't already
have it even if it has it it just sets
the idea because you want to make sure
that the ID is from the back parent and
it sends that instance to update message
you need something similar but in this
case you're doing profile name so I'm
going to do ad put and then part is the
same and now let's write net and the
method there's again very similar
anything is in this case bad param is
the profile name accepting that string
and what I set in the profile instance
is the profile name not the ideal write
the profile name is what set ID still
expect the user to send the ID in this
case you can generate IDs or figure out
IDs it shouldn't matter but basically it
sets the profile name here and it
updates the profile since that instance
to the service very simple so far let's
look at the next one delete till he
takes in the message ID and then it
sends that ID to remove message right
it's an ID in this case this will be the
profile name in this case not too
different the path is still the same
this to profile name
the method is a very straightforward
we have delete profile sticks in the
profile name as the path param gets that
as an argument and sense that to remove
profile to the Moodle profile instance
from the map and guess that said let's
run this and see how it works okay so
this is the URL the profile URL
messenger slash Web API slash profiles I
have set the content type header I'm
just going to do a get request to the
collection URL it should return the one
profile that I have right it's in the
list you can see that brackets square
brackets over here if I want to run that
profile alone and just do profile name
here I do a get for that I just get that
one without an array it's just one
instance off the profile now I could of
course post do this I'm going to copy
this and I'm going to post to slash
profiles raw paste this here remove tidy
we don't want this I'm going to call
this admin user and the profile name is
admin its end
now it's let's created a new instance of
profile the ID to let me add one more
I'm going to call this admin to user to
and profile name is admin to its end
let's created this let's do the get on
profiles again it should return all
three and it does let's delete one let's
update one first I'm going to pick admin
to as the record that I want to update
good admin to well get should return
that record now I'll update this now I'm
going to change this to put
I get the request body over here and I'm
going to remove the profile name because
I want that to be inferred from the URL
with the IDB here we'll change this to a
new value and it's send its updated this
now if I do a get on admin tool it
should return this updated value now
let's delete this click on delete as the
method
nothing required in the request body
let's submit and I get to afford no
content now if I do a get on profiles
again admin this remains but the updated
record is now deleted with ID 3 that's
gone now so that's a quick look at
another resource just so that you get
comfortable with the idea of these
different types of instance resource
URLs when you have the ID the second you
have something like a name which is a
custom resource URL instance so with
this we have two resources in place
we're going to talk about the comment
resource URL much later but for now
these two are pretty much working for
the standard credits in the next
tutorial we're going to take on a couple
of advanced features like filtering and
pagination so see you then and thanks
