going to try solving this in jelous
seven so I'm going to create a new class
here called unit 1 exercise solution
Java 7 and I'm going to have a mean
method here and what I'll do is copy
this over so that we can replace these
comments with actual code all right now
the first thing I need to do is to start
the people list by the last name now I'm
going to do this in Java 7 how do I
start a list well you have this utility
called collections dot SART and of this
has a method which takes in two
arguments one is the list that needs to
be started and one is the comparator
there's also another signature which
basically takes this in which starts a
list in ascending order based on natural
ordering but what we need is to create a
custom order you want to have a custom
order in based on the last name which
means if we're gonna have to implement
this comparator so I'm going to choose
this option I'll first pass in the list
people and now I need to pass in a
competitor
now competitor is an interface right I
need to create an implementation of that
interface and pass an instance of it I
could create a separate class and then
say new off that class which implements
competitor but I can just create an
inline anonymous class here instead so
I'm going to say new competitor and now
this is going to be an anonymous inner
class what does this need it needs if I
were to add the unemployment it methods
here just needs one method called
compare and I need to implement this
compare method now this competitor is a
generic method now the T here is of type
person so I'm going to pass that as an
argument a generic argument which means
that these two will be person objects as
well now I need to implement this how do
i implement a competitor that compares
the last name and make sure the last
name
is ordered in ascending order so what I
can do here is I can return o one dot
get last name dot compare - OH - dot get
last name so I am basically leveraging
the compared to operation on the last
name string and I'm comparing these two
instances that I'm getting over here so
when the collection starts art gets to
action and tries to start the people is
basically running each combination
through this competitors compare method
say okay given a person oh one and the
person OH - what is should the sorting
order be and we have set this based on
the last name okay so now that I started
this the people list should contain the
sorting based on the last name here now
want me to check if this is what is to
actually print it which it turns out is
step two over here so how do I print all
the elements in this list well notice
here that I've actually mentioned to
create a method that brings all the
elements in the list so I'm going to
create a method called print all and I'm
going to pass in the people list now
print all needs to be a static method in
the same class I'm going to create that
here and the implementation here is
fairly obvious and going to have a for
loop here people pee in sorry person pee
in people I'm going to do a system dot
out dot println of pee now this is going
to call the two string method of person
and we have a fan you know a nice to
string implementation which shows the
object in a nice format so this should
be good I'm going to go to the solution
again here so this is step two we're
just to print all people let's execute
this and make sure that this is this is
working fine so if I were to run this up
here you can see it's printed all the
people but notice that the last name has
been started I know the first
Brandi Carlile Cara Lynn Dickens so it's
sorted based on alphabetical order so
step one is done and step two is done
now for step three we need to create a
method that prints all the people that
have the last name beginning with C so
we have to filter out anybody who does
not have the last name beginning with C
now what I could do here is create
another method which say is something
like this say I do a print last name
beginning with C and then I can pass in
people now if I were to spell this right
if I will implement this method here
just going to be another static class
it's going to be pretty much the same
here instead I'm going to have an if
condition here when I loop through and I
check if the last name does indeed begin
let's see so I can say something like
this if B dot get last name dot starts
with the letter C only then I print that
person all right if not then I don't put
that person so that's this method and of
course print al is unaffected knob let's
run this and up here you see it's
printed the list but the second time you
notice it just prints two elements which
is Carlisle and Carol this is good but
as you can see this is not the best of
methods this is very very inflexible if
you want to print people with the last
name beginning with D that means you're
gonna have to create another method it's
not ideal so what we'd like to do is
have a behavior passed in do this method
so I can have some kind of an object
that acts as a filter right you're not
really specifically mentioning what that
filter should be you can write a method
here which is basically the same as
print all but rather than print all its
let's call it print sum and then you
have some kind of an object here which
indicates what that list should be in
the case what you need to filter out or
what you need to read
so let me try that let's say I say print
instead of beginning let's see I can say
Brent conditionally and then I can have
some kind of a condition here now
condition needs to be some kind of an
interface let me actually create an
interface you're not created in line
here and say interface condition and
then let's say this condition interface
has a boolean test which takes in a
person P so it's basically looking at
its a method which looks at a person and
says whether that person should be
included or not for something like you
know printing the last name beginning
with C this test method basically checks
if that person's last name does indeed
begin let's see now I can use this
condition to check if that condition
holds good for P so let's say I do with
something like this if condition dot
test off B then do a system dot out dot
println all right now I can use this
instead and now I'm can create I can
pass in a new implementation of this
condition interface once a condition and
now I need to implement the
unimplemented method which is the test
so here what I'm going to do is I'm
going to say after done P dot get last
name that starts with C so it's
basically the same as what we did before
but rather than the method itself
containing explicitly what needs to be
done I'm basically putting that into a
condition object write condition being
an interface and then I pass in an
implementation of that interface which
has a method call test and it basically
says okay this test passes only if the
last name begins with C now that if
that's the condition that's fast well
that's the condition we get selected
this method doesn't really care just
prints a list conditionally no matter
what that condition is now you could
have another
deletion which you could say called
print conditionally again which you know
checks for the first name that begins
with let's see with let's see see
alright now I can run this again but at
a different condition so if the same
method still works see I do a first name
beginning with C now let me add some
messages over here let's say system dot
out dot println this is printing all
persons this is all persons with last
beginning with C and I'm going to have
one more with the first name beginning
with C so all that changes is the
condition and this print conditionally
method doesn't care it just executes the
condition and it runs that for each
person in the people list and if that
condition is met it is print it so you
can pass in different condition
implementations to the same print
conditionally method and have it print
different stuff so let's run this now
here is printing all people which prints
everybody this is printing people with
the last name beginning with C witches
cattle I'll and Carol and this is the
first name beginning with C which is
these two persons alright so this is how
you can implement this exercise using
Java 7
you have passed in a behavior by
implementing an interface and you
created that interface if you know that
in Java 8 you can skip the
implementation and use lambdas so let's
try that out I'm going to create a
different class here I'm going to say
new class and this is unit 1 exercise
solution Java 8
and pace this here and just change the
name and of course I don't need the
interface here because it's already
defined now let me make sure this works
fine so this is still the Java 7 way
right the still works fine now let's
change all these things to lambdas now
here let's start with the step one step
one is to start the list by the last
name need to move this stuff here but
what are we what do we do here
we are calling collection start with two
arguments the first argument is the list
to be sorted the second argument is an
implementation of the comparator if you
notice competitor is basically an
interface which needs the implementation
of the compare method and since there's
only one method here but guess what
competitor is a functional interface
since it's a functional interface you
can actually pass in a lambda instead of
this inline anonymous inner class and
it'll still work collections doesn't see
the difference just things it's an
implementation of competitor while
you're actually passing in a lambda now
how do I pass in a lambda the lambda
here is basically an implementation of
this function over here it's basically a
compare method which takes in two
objects just person 1 and person 2 and
then it returns this expression with the
last name being compared last name start
compared to the second last name so
let's do that and we have a function
which takes in two arguments person 1
and person 2 I can do person P 1 person
P 2 but since collections knows the type
of this let's see this list people which
is a list of person right there's a
generic type here already so we don't
actually have to specify the person over
here so let me remove that in a bit but
what does the lambda expression look
like lambda expression is copy this p1
that get last name dot compare to Peter
get last name right this is all that's
happening in the body
now since type inference works I can
remove these types and this will still
work p1 and p2 are obviously of type
person the compiler figures that out
so this is it we have passed and
implementation of the comparator to
collection starts our and we just do
this in one line let me actually run
this so this happens Sarge the list and
then the next set of lines actually
prints it this method should still work
if I were to run this as you can see the
first section that is started based on
the last name all right
let's implement step 3 creating a method
that prints all the people that have the
last name beginning with the letter C
now what did we do here we call the
print conditionally method where we pass
in the list of people and then you had a
condition that was an inline anonymous
class implementation now condition is
also an interface it has one abstract
method which is best so we could use a
lambda here instead of the selected
block which is the anonymous inner class
so this could be a lambda and what is
that lambda it's basically a method
which takes in a person object and it
returns a boolean whether that person
object has a last name that begins with
C or not so this takes in a person
object since it's just one argument here
I don't have to put the parentheses
right it's just one argument so again
that's optional and what's the body but
the body should return a boolean says if
the last name begins with C so it's
basically B dot case last name dot
starts with C all right and now I can do
something similar for printing out
people who have the first name that
begins with C it's very similar except
that the last method here changes I'll
copy this over it's just going to be the
first name here all right let's execute
this and this the first thing we've
already seen for last name beginning
with C we have these two and for the
first name beginning with C we have
these two people so that's all good now
here's another thing we can do and of
course we can do this optimization in
the Java 7 version as well so you have a
print all and we have a print
conditionally but print all is basically
a print conditionally that has a
condition set to true always right so we
don't really need these two methods so
I'm going to get rid of this
print all so all these going to be
printed conditionally which means that
I'm going to have to call print
conditionally to print everybody but the
idea is what's the condition
so always true so I'm going to say P
takes in a value which is different the
person then always returns true right
this is a very simple lambda expression
which is a simple implementation of the
condition class so here you see for
something as simple as this the
implementation is just one word this is
one of the shorter lambdas that you can
write now what's gonna happen is this is
going to create a lambda expression
which acts as an instance of condition
that always returns true so it's going
to do condition that tests on that
lambda expression and guess what it
returns all the back just return stroke
so system they're all read print all
these execute and we can print all the
people so let's run this again to make
sure we get all the people and we do so
here you see we have made the code very
very terse it's not as long and complex
as the anonymous inner class over here
the only argument that people have had
about this kind of a code is that the
lambda expression is not familiar it
takes some getting used to but having
said that aside and of course this
familiarity leads to you being a bit
more comfortable with these lambda
expressions the more you write it the
more familiar you gonna get and then the
advantage of it being short and crisp
really stands out so this was an
implementation of that exercise in both
the Java sameen approach and the Java
eight approach so feel free to play
around with lambda is a little bit more
see where you have opportunities to use
lambdas where there are functional
interfaces being accepted as arguments
and trust me it's really fun so this
wraps up unit one and with unit 2 we're
going to look at some more features that
Java eight introduces when it comes to
using these lambda expressions and some
more shortcuts you can use in your code
to make your code a little bit more
readable so see you in the next unit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
