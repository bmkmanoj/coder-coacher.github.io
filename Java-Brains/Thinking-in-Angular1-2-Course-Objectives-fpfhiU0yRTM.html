here's what I want you to take away from
this course first of all I want you to
kind of understand the what and the by
of angularjs so I'm not really going to
cover the what part of it right we I'm
gonna explain why it is angularjs but
I'm also going to explain why angularjs
was even created what is the problem
that it's trying to solve okay then
we're going to understand the
fundamental concepts there is a lot of
conceptual learning that you're going to
have to do before you really grasp what
angular is trying to do so I'm going to
cover all those concepts so that you're
familiar with what you're writing when
you're writing code
oh I'm also going to be covering the
best practices and recommendations this
is especially important because angular
has been around for a while it's been
many years since it was released and
there have been multiple versions of
angular and there have been a lot of new
features that I've introduced in those
different versions and here's the other
tricky part there have been features
that were introduced in the older
version which are actually discouraged
from use right so there are certain
concepts that were present in the
earlier versions of angular and they're
actually still present today but the
best practices do not recommend using
those features so what I'm going to do
is kind of cover the learnings that the
angular community has hired over the
years and can present the latest best
practices the latest recommendations
about how you need to build applications
using angular and then finally this is
probably the biggest objective that I
have in mind when I design this course I
want you to be able to learn to think in
angularjs so this is the reason for the
title of this course thinking in
angularjs one in a way it's a tribute to
one of my earliest programming books
that I've read which is thinking in C um
the reason why I've called this course
that way is angularjs going to requires
a new way of thinking in order to really
effectively use it right so there is a
certain amount of paradigm shift that
needs to happen so if you're taking this
course I'm assuming you come from one of
two possible background
a you have a complete server-side
background getting into front and web
development for the first time or B you
have some front-end web development
knowledge but not exactly angular
knowledge and you've build applications
using things like jQuery or Yui or
whatever and you're kind of getting into
angular for the first time so in both
these cases there is a little bit of a
paradigm shift that needs to happen
until fairly recently the most watered
question on Stack Overflow far the topic
angularjs was how do I think in
angularjs if I come from a jQuery
background and there were so many people
who watered it and there were so many
good responses I'm going to link to that
in the later video but it is actually a
problem because angularjs requires a
different kind of thinking and I've
designed this course in such a way that
I'm going to cover that foundation first
I'm going to help you think in a
particular way in order to learn
angularjs so that once you get that
basic thinking right the rest of the
stuff that you need to learn becomes
fairly simple and one of the biggest
complaints that people have with
angularjs is that it's hat it has a
fairly steep learning curve but this in
place by learning how to think in terms
of angularjs but rather having that
paradigm shift you can have a much
easier learning curve than some of your
other colleagues who had to go through
all this stuff before having the
concepts the fundamental concepts
reading so in a sense this is not going
to be a QuickStart course right be
nothing just is dive in there and start
writing code and this is especially the
case because angularjs is a little bit
different from some of the other
frameworks that you have encountered but
stick with this once we get through
these basic concepts the rest of your
learning is going to be very very easy
and you will hopefully realize that this
was worth it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
