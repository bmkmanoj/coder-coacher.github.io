ng model examples a little bit in more
detail we looked at the text box in the
last tutorial you're going to look at a
bunch more things you can do with ng
model and a bunch of other input
controls that you can use it with so I
have created a separate directory here
called ng model examples this kind of is
similar to the clock app directory where
we have index dot HTML which links to
angularjs and AB Dodge is angularjs is
the same old angular javascript file
we've been using AB the GS is currently
empty so we can start filling that in so
I'm going to start by creating an app
here which is war equals ng model
examples and then the second argument is
of course an empty array for now and I'm
going to do ab dot controller let me
just call this examples controller and
then I'm going to have this PF function
which I'm also going to call the
examples controller and my function will
be something that needs the scope all
right and now I'm going to create a
bunch of input controls over here we've
already looked at the standard input
type equals text already so let's say I
have a entry model equals text string
all right by the very fact of me doing
this of course I'm going to put this in
a controller I'm just going to use the
ng control around the body doesn't have
to be adding me anywhere controller
equals I believe I call this as examples
controller
then the app is ngmodel examples all
right now that this have a controller
and the app wild in and just pairing
this input tag
I have bound this input to the scope dot
text string so that then we add value
here when we update the textbox angular
is automatically going to update the
scope over here notice that I'm not
doing a dollar scope dot text string
equals an empty string edit that in the
last tutorial but it's really not
required there won't be a text string
property on the scope when the
application starts but the minute you
type something here the minute you enter
something in the text box
that's what angular says oh I've got
this new value that I need to bind to
the scope so it creates a scope detects
string property and then binds it to
that first character that you enter and
it's going to use that same property
from then on so this is all you have to
do to bind a textbox but now let's look
at some other inputs how about something
like a checkbox so I'm going to do this
input type equals checkbox and then I
have ng-model
equals have a boolean value here and
then I close the input tag and now by
doing this I've actually bombed the
value of this checkbox to a scope
property called boolean value right so
let's uh let me refresh the page and I'm
going to open the phrase actually have
it so this is ng-model examples and here
is my textbox and here is my check box
but again unless we display this it's
hard to tell so first what I'm going to
do is I'm going to have some captions
over here this is the textbox tag in
front of each
all right all right this is better now I
have a text box and a check box but I
want to display what the school property
is bound to so what I'm going to do is
we're going to have this other paragraph
over here click inside this I have a
paragraph text input and then I'm going
to bind it to text string all right so
now that I have this binding we have the
input controls updating the property on
the scope and an angular beam angular's
can update the view whenever the scope
property changes so now let's refresh
this it's type something over here you
can see that the text input is being
updated right now let's see the check
box you see here by checking it the
value has now become true and the
unchecking it the value is now false and
this is also automatically bound so in
the sense the model that you bind to a
check box is going to be a boolean value
it's going to be a true or a false but
as the model that you bind to a text
input there's going to be a string all
right
the other thing for you to note is this
may not be very obvious until I
highlight this you notice there is no
value here for the text string and the
boolean value it's basically empty this
is the default state because like I
mentioned until you enter something in
these input controls the scope property
will not be there when I angular sees
ngmodel it's not going to go and create
the property on the scope it's just
going to wait till you actually interact
with that input once you add a key you
know once you do know in the text box
once you enter a key to type something
you see that's where the property gets
created and once the property gets
created then it does add this over here
similarly for the check box there is
nothing here the boolean value is not
even a property of the scope but once
you check this it shows up and now if
you uncheck it becomes fall through the
property is already there all right so
these are two controls let's add a
couple more
I'm going to create a date control which
is a html5 control but angular supports
it and if you're using a browser hold an
older browser that doesn't support html5
angular has polyfills which still let
you use it so I'm just going to create a
date control over here which is an html5
control hold this date input and the
name is going to be date value all right
refresh you see here
the date control shows up and I can do
this kind of a lookup and populate the
data and as you can see the value is a
date object it's not just a string which
says 9/5/2013 ders it's very handy when
you need date input but I'm also going
to show a radio button but there are
other things you can do other controls
you can use and it's more or less the
same concept you use the ng model the
radio button is a little bit different
and I'll show you why in a bit so I have
this input type equals radio and then
let's say I have ng model equals radio
value right so the thing about a radio
is you need multiple controls because
that's the concept of a radio you have
multiple options to choose from
so what you need is a bunch of different
inputs with type equals radio so say
this is option one and option three now
we notice here for all these different
options I have used the same ng model
this is bickers these three radio
controls are a part of a single control
I want the user to choose between one of
these three options and no matter which
option they choose I want it to go to
the same property on the scope I don't
want different
properties that's backing these
different options no matter which one of
these they choose they want to I wanted
to go to radio value and then I can
examine radio value to figure out what
the user chose now however I need to
tell angular what value to put into
radio value where in each of these
options are chosen in the case of a
checkbox is fairly straightforward the
checkbox is checked it's a true check
box is not checked that's a false but in
this case for each of these options I'm
going to need to provide a value so I'm
going to use the value property and I'm
going to have a number let me actually
make this an opt so it doesn't have to
be a number it can be a strength so I
have options 1 through 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 over here
and I'm going to display that over here
is the radio value alright so I'm going
to refresh this now here are my radio
buttons I have option one option two an
option three and as you can see the
radio input is empty right now
as with other controls angular does not
create the property on the scope unless
you use the control so the minute I
click on option 1 you notice the value
of option 1 got added to that property
so you see her
option 1 has the value opt 1 and that's
the value that goes into the ng model
which is the radio value so as I switch
to option 2 it's the same scope property
that gets updated with this option
option 3 gets the same scope property
that gets updated so by looking at this
one scope property I can figure out
which of the radio buttons were selected
all right so this is ng model in a
nutshell but before we wind up I showed
you earlier about the on-click
attribute and how that will not work and
angular has an ng-click similarly you
have an attribute called on change which
triggers when there is a change in the
input text box and that will not work
with angular so you have an alternative
director called ng - change similar to
unclick an ng-click you have on change
ng change so let's say I run an ng
change equals textbox right so this will
actually lead to angular calling a
method when the textbox changes right
any time I type in something or I press
the backspace or anything like that
right the value of the textbox changes
the ng change properties method is
called right so ng changes by a bound to
this method so it's going to do a scope
dot text box change so I'm going to iron
that method now on the scope I'm going
to have a dollar scope dot X box change
there's a function just printing a
message here but this basically have you
Biden a function to a change handler so
now I'm going to save this and refresh
and when I type in something you notice
here the console statement got triggered
anytime I type something there are new
console statements that are being
triggered and doesn't have to be a new
character I can press backspace and that
also triggers that change method to be
called it's a handy handy method the
other thing that I want to leave you
with is you don't have to have an NG
model bound to just one input control
you can have the same ng-model bound to
multiple input controls and I don't know
why you would want to do this but you
can actually have a bunch of text boxes
which are all bound to text string right
that's the same model property it's the
same scope property that's backing
multiple inputs now what happens when I
do this I'm going to refresh the page
you have a bunch of text boxes now no
matter where I enter a key you notice
all those text boxes are automatically
getting populated the reason this is
happening is when I type something in
one text box it updates the scope object
and the scope object is actually the ng
model for these other text boxes so the
angular framework is going to update the
value of these text boxes to the value
of that scope object
p'tee right this is two-way binding so
this is what's happening so this is
actually really cool again to demo and
it it's it's basically angular doing all
this stuff without you having to do a
whole lot just bind it to the same
property and then wherever you're using
the property either as ngmodel on an
input control are ng bind using the
angular expression angular takes care of
updating those controls so there are
some concepts of input that we covered
in this in this tutorial I definitely
encourage you to play around with these
controls and also look at the angular
documentation there's a lot more you can
do with this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
