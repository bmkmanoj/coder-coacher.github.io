previous tutorial we learned what a JSP
use and how the Tomcat container
converts JSP into a sublet compiles it
and then deploys it so that every J's is
actually corresponding to a sublet and
behind the scenes now in this tutorial
we're gonna explore the few concepts of
J's peas a little bit more in detail
um the first thing that you're going to
do is the open up the code that we wrote
in our earlier to do it in this is very
simple Java code we're just using
primitives and then getting out simple
operations things get a little bit
tricky when we do a little bit more
advanced coding so let's try that out
and create a simple JSP page and the
intention is to display the time in the
JSP whenever the user accesses the JSP
this place dependent time in the system
so let me go ahead and create a new JSP
file above this croc third JSP okay what
the body yes and x-ray simple order all
I did was create a new data or chip and
then rent one you here so I will use the
JSP tag equals you did simple enough
that shows an error what's ever
since it cannot be resolved to a type so
I can obviously have to import the date
class from the java.util package now
where do I do that
I cannot import it over here I cannot
have a stripper lock or here and then do
a import I cannot do that because we
learned in a previous tutorial that
whatever code we write inside the script
block who is inside Omnitech in the
converted
server and that method is what is it
if we call happy here even request so I
obviously can put the input signal here
because that will also go into a method
and you will get it come back later now
they do I put this import the place
where you put the import is this first
line that you see over here then is this
GSP tag similar to what we've seen here
but then it is followed by an @ symbol
and then there is the stage word over
here and there are a few attributes we
have language equals Java or content by
because Texas you have character set
page encoding so you can look at these
attributes a bit later but let me tell
you that the import that we are going to
do here is one of the attributes that we
need to enter over here it is like
language in French and type import is
another attribute to the sky so what I
do is I do an import equals and I enter
the package name you know and the class
which I am going to import yes so I will
import java.util update safe now it is
not shown error and this does not give a
compilation error also they need is
pretty than this
there you go The Times printed now what
are these others attributes over here
and what is this you know JSP tag ad and
page doing so this is actually something
called as a page directive every JSP
page can use a page directive and um you
can use a speech directed in a video a
page and specify some properties in
values that are applicable throughout
the page here there are a few properties
if you have said language equals Java
means that all the script types if you
can have inside this page will contain
Java code but it's obvious because we
are developing Java code and it's a JSP
after all it is actually optional I
think Java is the tea party you don't
have to answer it it says because
we use it design and then that's what
this updated look at the next one
clinton type equals text HTML this is
saying that the output of this the stage
B page is in text HTML format this is
similar to what we added in our sublet
let me open in our salutatorian I added
this line of code here
you don't need an expo in to the detail
about what this code is but let's do
that not I added a response that set
content type is text slash HTML so what
is this doing this is actually moving
the same thing as what are the page
directive effect in type is doing what
it says is that the output of this
request
finnaly district with scores in the
output is coming so this whole output is
in text HTML format so if there is a
guide if I enter a tag here fee
he is of course boiled but the text
within the stack so the text inside the
stack gets rendered on board so this be
it will be converted as HTML tag so the
browser which is accepting this request
knows that hey that you like this HTML
so I should not print this be as it is I
need to convert the text in between B
starts to boil so that's what the
content type says that a different
content types
we are going to go into more detail
about technique knives in the later
tutorials but at a high level this is
what the pension type tells so phase
encoding is again something that we're
going to go in detail in the later
tutorials
import is something that we just saw we
can import Java classes and namespace
lists using this input type who's using
the import tab and this as I told you a
page director will be there inside as a
state is the headed heading of the JSP
page will be there at the top and this
will be applicable to the entire days
between so anything that needs to be
said globally for the whole page that we
set here so now what Tomcat does is it
sees that okay I have an import tag here
so what it does is it puts this import
java.util Dante that the very beginning
of our converted submit class so all
these are tools for Tomcat to convert
these you know these directives into
code so if you look at the servlet code
over here it would have an import at the
top I'm not going to go into that you
can probably text this out a cell there
are quite a few in each directors we can
use we are not releasing on before here
but there are a few others you can you
might land up in situation where you
have to use a lot of page directive and
then this line could go on forever so in
that case there is there's another thing
you can do you can actually remove this
from this line environment new page
directive so that
be as simple as opening a directive here
page and then we are imported so this is
same as what we did before so all you
are doing is you having a new line and
then you are adding this so again if you
have a lot of imports or you have a lot
of page directive tags here then you can
I'm sorry page directive properties here
then you can split it up into different
tags so that it's easier to maintain the
code and before we wrap up this tutorial
let me make another note page directive
is just once the directives that have
supported inside phase B so this I after
the JSP tag is actually a directive that
so this means that whatever
no I'm you're setting here this for the
whole page and it should not be inside a
script block so there's one other thing
one other feature which is handy um
there's something called as an include
that so in order to demonstrate time let
me write another JSP page here create a
new JSP file and call this hello body
will be the same other user let me know
all these things I don't hear anything
here apart from the text and they say
this is actually a valid takes to even
have to have any of those directives and
while what it does is Tomcat this easy
okay they're just a little bit of text
here so let me just put this inside the
print statement so it just puts a hello
user in Philippines statements are
similar but now what is a new tune
they do and include directive includes a
response from another page into the page
where you're putting the single direct
so let's say I want the I have a very
good utility it is speaker which says
some hello text of course a very simple
case here but let's say I have a complex
code behind the scenes and then it's
building out a message and I want to
include that message here but I don't
want to clear all the complex code
inside the JSP so all I can all I need
to do is I just were and include file
equals now here I have to give them they
will let a path so this is in the same
directory as the holidays people the
same that if a is clocked at PHP so I
just have to say slash hello dot JSP
then what happens the JSP will get
compiled and don't get what it does is
it takes this directive and says hey
this guy wants the contents of a garage
JSP to be embedded inside the state's be
page so what it does is it executes the
color or JSP sublet gets the response
and it does not directly pass the
response to the user what it does is it
generates a response of clocked or JSP
as well and whenever we have the stack
it embeds the response of hello Roger is
being into the response of property
speak so then save and run the session
they will follow you there is generated
by a different chased by color or to
speak and the rest of the response is by
clock logistic so we've seen two of the
commonly used directive
ads there are a few others which I'll
probably cover in the subsequent
tutorials
but this should give you an overview of
what
director practice and a couple of usage
scenarios the pub you can use that
inside exp files</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
