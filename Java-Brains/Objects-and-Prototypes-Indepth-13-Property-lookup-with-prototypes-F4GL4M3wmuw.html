that we have learned about prototypes by
trying out a couple of objects and the
Firefox console and then we look at what
prototypes do by even there so let me
create a function like I did before
function foo which is going to be an MD
function and now for dot prototype
should be this prototype object okay so
if I were to create a new object or new
obj if I were to create a new object
using the Foo function now new foo ovj
is going to contain an underscore
underscore proto property which is going
to bind to this prototype which is food
our prototype in order to validate this
here's one thing I can do I can set a
custom property on food or prototype and
access it from mu foe object dot this
thing and since they both point to the
same object I should be able to access
them the same way so let me create
something on the prototype object when I
say foo dot prototype dot let me create
a property called test equals this is a
prototype object off foo then you make
it the because there is only one
prototype object so this is the
prototype object of for and on that
prototype object and creating a property
called test and I'm assigning it to this
string now if I were to access food
prototype dot test I'm going to get back
the string but I'm going to go the other
way I'm going to go to the new foe
object it was created because of foo and
I'm going to do the dot underscore
underscore proto dot test and let's see
if that works so I have my new fool
object dot underscore underscore proto
now this is going to give me the
prototype object of flow again and now
here I can do a dot test and guess what
the same string shows up which proves
that those two objects are the same so
fool dot prototype
is equal to
new flow object dot underscore
underscore proto all right they're
pointing to the same object it's the
same object reference now
now that we've proved what we learn in
the previous video let's look at vide
the prototype object is even there and
you remember we are talking about a
simulation of some kind of a template
some kind of a blueprint for objects
what we want to do is have a central
location where we define the behaviors
for a bunch of similar objects and those
objects either have you know behaviors
on their own or if they don't they refer
to the central place where they look up
behaviors so here's how it works let's
say I call a property on this new flow
object it's just another object right so
I could say see new who object dot hello
now what do you think gets returned here
now this new for object does not have a
property called hello so if I were to
access a property called hello what
you're going to get back is undefined
obviously but what's happening here what
the JavaScript engine does here is
actually not very obvious when you refer
to a property on an object right when
you refer to any property on any object
when the JavaScript engine does a couple
of things it first looks at that object
and sees if it has a property that
you're looking for if it has it it's
going to give it to you directly okay so
let's say I have a new foe object dot
hello equals deaths now new for object
has a property called hello where what
axe is that I'm going to get back that
property very simple however let's say
I'd remove that thing let's say I delete
new for object dot hello now if I were
to access new for object it does not
have the hello property and now if I
were to access it I'm going to get back
undefined but it actually does an extra
step it first checks the object itself
since I said you have a property called
hello and the objects is no here's an
extra step that it does if the object
say is no it goes to the prototype
object off that object and then asks the
product
if it has a property with the name hello
so basically what it's doing is it's
going to new for object dot underscore
underscore proto property which is this
object the prototype object and it then
asks the prototype object hey prototype
object do you have a property with the
name hello now what is the prototype
object - well it's going to say no as
well because new for object dot
underscore underscore proto does not
have hello right it has a property
called test it does not have a lot we
haven't created it but if it did have a
property call hello this would have
actually returned that value so think of
it as looking up another object to see
if the property exists if it doesn't
find it in the core object now let's say
I said the property you for object dot
underscore underscore proto got hello
this value is from the proto type I'm
sending the property on the prototype
now if I were to access the property
from the prototype it's obviously going
to get me that value but here's the
surprising part if I were to access this
on the object itself JavaScript engine
is going to first check the object says
it doesn't find it then it goes to the
underscore underscore proto object and
say okay underscore underscore proto
object do you have hello and that object
says yes oh it's going to get that value
so check this out
case what value got return the value
that got returned was the value on the
prototype okay so this is some kind of
differing off responsibility the object
has it it gives it if it doesn't have it
it differs it to the prototype object
which is the underscore underscore proto
object and if that doesn't have it only
then does it say okay I don't have it
right that's what what happened over
here but now rather than setting that on
the object itself I said it on the proto
object then that still worked okay now
let's look back at the proto object and
it also has a test property right so if
I were to access new foe object dot test
guess what gets returned
well the engine is fresh when I check
new for objecting say hey do you have a
property called test what's the answer
going to be the answer is going to be no
because this object does not have a
property called s once the engine gets
the answer no from the object itself it
then goes and checks the underscore
underscore proto property which is the
other the prototype object it says hey
prototype object you have a property
called test and the prototype object
says yes it's going to take that value
and it's going to return it so when I do
a new for object or test it's going to
get back the value even though this
object does not have a property called
test all right so if I were to access
this we're just going to get the
prototype object's property however if I
were to add this property on new for
object guess what happens the engine is
going to find this property on the
object itself and it does not even look
up the property from the prototype so
new for object could have a property
call test which contains a completely
different value and when I do new for
object that test that's the value that
gets returned not the prototypes because
the object a hazard it doesn't even go
and look at the prototype so the waiter
said this thing is a new foo object dot
test equals let me give a completely
different value here like 10 and now new
foe object has a property called test
and the new few object and discourage
score proto property has a value called
this is the prototype object it's a
string I've ever to access this what I
get back is the objects value it's not
going to look up the prototype this is I
get 10 back all right if I were to
delete this from the object and now I
access it what am I going to get back
the prototypes value all right so this
is the kind of look up that happens with
prototypes and it is kind of implicit in
the property lookup that you are
familiar with with JavaScript JavaScript
engine is actually looking up multiple
locations if the property does not exist
in the core object that you're looking
up from just that we don't realize it
because it's so transparent now if you
get something like this we access
something like this and you get back a
value it's really hard to tell if it's
on the object itself or it's from the
prototype the only way to figure that
out is by actually examining this object
and saying hey do you have a property or
is it looking up from the prototype okay
so this is this is
fancy but why do we need this what is
the point of having this kind of a
lookup examine that in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
