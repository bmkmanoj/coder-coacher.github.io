interesting concept called in vacations
the idea behind in vacations is you can
prepare a request and you can put in all
the things you need that request to do
right you need to know where the target
is you need to know what the request
format is what the body of the request
is for that it's um you know get method
or post method all that stuff so the
idea is to create a request object which
contains all the information about the
request it's it's ready to go the only
thing is it's not made that request yet
so you hold on to that object and you
can pass it around and have some other
code just issue the request without
knowing what that request is without
having to know the details of that
request
so that's invocation you create an
object called invocation which contains
all the details about a request and then
you invoke it somewhere else so let's
see how that happens so in order to
demonstrate this invocation feature I'm
going to create a separate class I'm not
gonna edit this class I'm going to
create a new Java class and I'm going to
call this invocation demo I'll choose a
main method I'll click finish alright so
the scenario that I'm gonna run is let's
say I want to create a request to get
all messages by ear so we've designed
this REST API endpoint with this API
right so there is a slash messages and
there's a query parameter here equals
and you pass in the year and it's gonna
return all the messages per year now
let's say I'm gonna make this call in
this class but I want to offset the
responsibility of creating this request
to one other method okay
now let's say I create this method
called prepare request for messages by
year and this method let's say it
accepts an integer which is a year and
it's gonna prepare this request for me
right so that's the idea I don't want to
have the logic for preparing this
request to reside in the main method I
want to offload that response
philsie to another method and have that
method prepared their question give me
back the fully prepared request so that
I can just execute it right I still want
to have control over ven that request
gets executed but I don't want to have
information about all the request
details believe this piece of code which
is you know the main method okay when I
load this out so now what I can do is I
can create this method here I'm gonna
say it's a public wide and leave it as
wide for now and change this later all
right so this is the prepare method
Dickson input argument which is in here
now I'm gonna choose I'm gonna create an
instance of this class because mean is a
static method so I'm gonna do a demo dot
okay so I make a call do this method and
I pass in the year and now I want the
request to be prepared now what I'm
gonna do is copy over a couple of lines
of code from the existing example
because these are things I'll have to do
anyway I'll have to create a client and
I have to create a target so I'm just
gonna copy these things out and I'll
remove the last line I don't need the
messages target I'm just gonna have this
begin line so but this I have a target
for the messages URI now what do we need
to do here we need to get messages for a
year and the format for the URL is slash
messages krish mark here equals and the
year right so we have the target for
messages already so what we need is to
add a query parameter squidy param
method and this is how you do query
parameters in your jax-rs clang right so
the query pam that it takes in two
arguments one is the name of the query
parameter second is the value so I add
that here so that the query parameter
deed to the request that I'm making and
I can add more stuff to this request
right I can do a dot request and I can
pass in the media type
the media type application Jason and
once I'm ready with my request what I
would have typically donnas I'd have
done a dot get because this is a get
request I do a dot get in order to send
that request but here's the thing I
don't want to make the skit request here
the idea of this whole prepared request
method is so that I prepare the request
in hand back the requests in already
status right I don't want to make that
REST API call here I just want to
prepare the request so what I do is
instead of doing a get I use this other
method which is called build yet and you
see here it returns invocation so I'm
going to choose that and then I do a
bill to get I get the invocation object
which is the request that's ready to go
right you see here there are a bunch of
other signatures for different other
methods so now I just return the
invocation and I change the method to
return an invocation type now in my main
method I can get hold off this
invocation object again an invocation
object is basically the same as the
request that we've seen so far but we
are just short of making the actual
request okay now I assign this to a new
local variable and I'm gonna call this
invocation
now this invocation object is now ready
to ready to execute right it's ready to
invoke now I do this by doing an
invocation dot and you see here there's
a method called invoke and it returns a
response object which is what we want
right so this is the step which does the
actual HTTP request right so when I do
an invocation or invoke it is use the
REST API call whatever the rest API call
is that was prepared earlier and it's
going to return the response that you
need now I'm going to just print call
this response and print it here I'll
just print the status so that we make
sure we get 200 at least
execute this well there you go if we get
the status 200 so it's exactly the same
as what we've learned so far by making a
get request it's just that we are doing
it in two steps one step to build the
request and the second step to execute
it this is very handy when you have
services are some utility methods which
prepare requests and hand them over to
the actual method which needs to make
them this is just another handy tool in
your toolbox then dealing with REST API
