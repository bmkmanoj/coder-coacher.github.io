place what we need to do for the course
API has a lot of common overlaps with
what we've done for the topic API so I'm
going to speed up the process of me
creating this API and I'm going to
highlight the places where things are
different I'm going to start by copying
over the complete topic package and
creating a new package for the courses
and now I'm going to rename the classes
themselves then I'm going to open the
course entity class to make sure the
elements are right right now I have the
ID name and the description which is
same as the topic what I'd like to do is
add some kind of a link between the
course and the topic for instance every
course should have a topic member
readable which contains the topic that
the course belongs to and similarly you
might have a topic entity containing a
list of courses that belong to that
topic so we're going to do that later
but for now I'm going to treat this
course as a separate entity pretty much
the same member variables the ID name
and the description the repository would
refer to the crud repository of course
and string in which case the course
service is more or less the same it's
referring to the course repository I'm
going to call this the course repository
as well similarly I'm going to rename
these methods this is going to be a get
all
courses call these courses now course
repository defined all populates the
courses hurry all right now I have
renamed the course service and we know
that the repository is done so let's go
to the controller now the controller is
where we need to change the mappings
right now we're copied we've copied from
the topic controller where the URLs are
actually add the route what we like for
the course controller is to have URLs
under topic for instance the route of
the course URL is not going to be slash
courses it's going to be slash topics
slash the topic ID and then slash
courses so that's what we're going to
change over here so I'm going to copy
this over so the get all courses URL let
me first change the topic service names
it's actually course service here
alright now I'm going to change the URL
for the get all courses to be topic /id
slash courses in this case now what I
need to do is when I get all the courses
I don't want to get everything that's
available in the system I want to get
all the courses that belong to a
particular ID so what I would need to do
is accept the path variable which is
going to be the topic ID and I want to
get all the courses for that topic ID
I'm going to go change the signature of
get all courses here and I'm going to
pass in the ID and here I need to be
able to call the right method and pass
in the topic ID and get only the courses
that belong to that
right now I'm calling find all that's
not good enough
how do I solve this problem how do I get
only the courses that belong to a
particular topic let's put this on hold
for now let's tackle all the other
methods which are actually relatively
simple and we'll get back to this one
later let's start with the gate course
and the course controller method is I'll
get course over here path would be topic
/ topic ID / courses / course ID and now
actually we call this topic ID and this
is just ID now I'm not really worried
about the topic ID because I know that
the course ID is the primary key so all
I need to get of course is that ID so
that's all I care about so this is
really I can ignore that now I'm going
to call core service don't get course
passing in the ID and this has a call to
course repository dot find one of the
ideas so this way it works exactly like
how a topic repository would work just
like you can do a topic repository that
find one of the topic ID here I'm doing
a course repository that's find one off
the course ID so this is actually super
simple this should just work let's look
at the next one let's look at add course
now I am going to make a post request to
slash topics / topic ID / courses / and
now this is the course ID and in the
request body I'm going to accept of
course
now here's what I could do I could just
pass in the course and just have the add
course to a course repository god save
off the course and it would just work
seamlessly right in just like into a
save off the topic you do a save the
course
here you're creating a new course by
making a post request to this URL
however you notice here that I'm making
this post request to a particular URL
where the topic ID is this so what I
would like to do is not enforce the user
to pass in the topic information in the
course object what I'd like to do is
create that myself I just want the user
to say this is the ID this is the course
name and the course description and I
fill in the topic based on which URL
they have made the post requests to I
figure out what the topic ideas and then
I posted to that so in order to do that
I need the course object to contain
topic information so right now if you
look at the course class it doesn't have
anything that ties it to the topic is
just a course it's independent it has
its own ID name and description now what
if I want to tie it to a particular
topic well what I can do is create a
member variable over here private
topic and not with this I have tied this
course to a particular topic instance
and now I can create the getters and
setters for this at the very end and now
what I'm also going to do is take in a
topic ID and set the value to this topic
so I'm going to say this start topic
equals new topic I'm going to construct
a new topic with the ID being the topic
ID that an empty string is a name and an
empty string as the description so what
i'm doing here is when i'm constructing
a course i'm also taking in a topic ID
along with the other member variables
and i'm creating a new instance of topic
which has that topic ID and of course
this is actually an invalid topic
instance because the name in the are you
know description is blank but it should
do i'm just creating this instance over
here alright now what i'm going to do is
in my course controller when I'm adding
the course the first thing I'm going to
do is make sure that the course dot
set topic is to a new topic which again
contains the topic ID and then an empty
name and an empty description import
topic and now I need to get topic ID
from the path variable so I'm just going
to copy this I'm basically saying hey
spring and Missy get me this and give it
as a method argument and this is going
to be topic ID so but this I'm going to
get the topic ID based on the path param
and whatever is sent as the request body
for the course I'm going to set the
topic on it like I'm going to ignore the
topic that's comes with the request I'm
going to set a new topic and I'm going
to make sure that the topic ID is this
based on its Boston and now I can save
the course and now the add course does
what it's supposed to do it just makes
the save and it has a topic but just
kind of incomplete but for the sake of
the course itself it knows what the
mapping isn't that's odd what matters
when I did this for the first time it
somehow felt wrong because when I'm
creating a topic on the course this
topic again like I mentioned is not a
complete instance it has only the topic
ID which is a write value with the name
in the description or MD I was worried
that when I did a save of the course it
might go to the topic and make the
change to that topic and make the name
in the description of empty but
thankfully it's not going to do that so
the reason of of me creating this topic
and setting it here is just so they get
the mapping right for the topic ID so
this is going to work fine alright so we
have the add course now let's do the
update course now the update course is
again going to be to a particular ID
well actually I have made a mistake here
the post is not going to be to the / ID
the forces just post additionally to
slash courses the update however is to
topic / topic ID / course this / ID all
right now here I'm going to do the exact
same
thing on the course that we've gotten
here
I've personally the path variable for
the topic ID as well now I'm going to
take in a course in the request body I'm
going to set the topic on it based on
the path variable like we did before and
I'm going to do a core service dot
update course let's look at this method
that big cores basically say is course
repository save so what I'm going to do
is skip the topic over here
just going to pass in the course and I'm
going to remove the ID because we don't
really eat that alright and finally we
have the delete course which is going to
be a delete on the resource URL for the
course
I just same as what and I'm going to do
a core service dot delete course off the
ID so it basically just removes that
course it really doesn't care what the
topic is all right so we've got the get
course the add course the update course
in the delete course ready what's left
is the get all courses now how do we do
this also we have created this course
class where I've added this member
variable called topic now how does the
spring data know that this is something
that needs to map to the topic table
granted there is a topic model over here
which has the entity but it's not really
the only way you can map things in a
relational database you could have
multiple ways of doing it now how do you
tell spring data that this is something
that's basically a foreign key to a
primary key on the topic table until
you're basically looking at a course
table
having a key that map's your primary key
to the topic how do you do that so you
can answer both these questions in the
