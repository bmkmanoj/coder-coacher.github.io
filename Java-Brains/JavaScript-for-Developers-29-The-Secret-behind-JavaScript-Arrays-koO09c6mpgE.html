with you an important secret about erase
it's not really a secret everybody knows
this but it sounds cool this way so
let's say you have an array and you want
to find out what the length of the array
is how many elements are there in the
Uruk so how would you find it one way to
do this is let's say I initialize this
reader and run so I have my array and in
my console if I type my array I have the
array being printed in order to get the
length of the array I can actually use a
property of the array called length so I
can say my array dot length there you go
gives me 3 now if I were to add an
element to this array so let's say I do
my array off three now equals foo and I
access my array dot length it's
increased to four so the length keeps
updating depending on how many elements
are in the array at any point of time so
you know for sure that when you access
my array dot length you get the length
of that array now that's the my array
dot length remind you of something how
does that thing work another clue what's
the name of the unit in which you're
viewing this video
if the unit is objects now why am i
talking about arrays in an opportunity
bout objects well what's actually
happening is an array is actually an
object every JavaScript array is
secretly a JavaScript object it just has
some special properties to it okay but
underneath it is just an object so when
you are accessing my array dot length
you're basically accessing object dot
property so a lot of the things that
we've covered before work the same way
when it comes to objects for instance I
can have a var my array two equals my
array so I have a new
variable called myarray - which is still
pointing to the same object the same
location so I can say my array 2 of 3
and I should get back through because
it's still the same location now can you
do some of the other things that you
could potentially do with it
like print the whole object now let's
say I print my array you see here I get
the complete object but here's the
interesting part so click on this link
here which when you hover your mouse
over array which was a puzzling now
click on the link and if I were to
expand this we see here it's basically a
bunch of key values just like you would
see in any object you have a key called
0 the property call 0 with the value
hello property call one with the value
world property - the value js property
through the value foo
ok and then there is also a property
called length with the value 4 so this
is actually an object underneath and the
array indexes are actually properties in
order to demonstrate that let me show
you something here so if I were to
access my array of 0 I get the value
hello but now what if I told you that
this is actually my array is actually an
object with a property named 0 let me
prove that by doing this my array and
I'm going to use the square bracket
operator and I'm going to pass in the
string 0 look what happens I still get
hello how can I use a dart notation here
I obviously cannot because you remember
what we talked about if the property
name happens to be a number you cannot
use the dot notation you have to use the
square bracket notation so that's all
you are doing here when you are creating
an array you're basically creating an
object where the property names are just
numbers okay so that's the reason why
and you know an array is actually being
driven by an object underneath and since
then
beam's happen to be numbers out of the
box you cannot use the dot operator you
have to use the square bracket operator
and this is a square bracket operator
you're familiar with when it comes to
objects but now your question would be
if that were to be the case if this my
array is actually an object which has
properties named 0 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 that explains
how this line works my array off 0 &amp;amp;
string but how does this work I'm not
passing in a string here I'm actually
passing in n number or does this work
the reason this works is actually
JavaScript converting that 0 which is a
number to a string automatically right
this is another instance of type
coercion where JavaScript looks at your
object reference here which is an array
and it says okay this developer is
trying to access a property off an
object and the property name happens to
be a number so the JavaScript
interpreter converts that to a string
and then looks it up for you right so
there is this implicit conversion that's
happening so keep that in mind whenever
you're accessing an array you're
basically accessing an object where the
property names are numbers that's all
there is to it
now since this is true here's another
interesting implication of it there is
no restriction as to what name you can
give to a particular index so let's say
you have my array here and you have four
elements so you can access up to my
array of three if I were to access my
array of four or my array of four with
strings you get back undefined which
shouldn't be a surprise what happens
when you access a property that does not
exist on an object you can undefined
it's exactly the same thing here but
let's say I set the value here you know
my array of four equals bar now it works
fine you can access my array and it has
those values if this were truly names
and not indexes so to speak I can pick
any name turns out I can so I can say my
array off
400 right there's no stopping mr.
property mr. name so I can set the value
to index 400 and it still works
so let's what happens if I check the
status of my array notice what's
happening here that is index 0 1 2 3 4
and then there is 400 if you look at the
length property of this array now it
says 401 so the length doesn't count how
many elements you have how many
properties you have in the array object
it counts the index of the last element
right the greatest element as a number
and then it adds 1 to it because it's a
zero based index so the length in this
array is 401 ok it's an interesting
implication to keep in mind but yeah in
essence arrays are freeform you can
assign any property the only limitation
is that whatever you assign has to be a
number for it to be treated as an array
index you can you know a sign of an I
know a property which is not a number
it just gets added as a separate
property because it's just an object
right so I can say my array of foo
equals ABC okay now if I were to print
my array I get a property called foo
it's just sitting there along with the
other number indexes but notice the
length hasn't changed it's still 401
okay
so if you want to treat an array as an
array always choose the number
properties but you can treat it as an
object and add more properties to it and
that's where you know you realize that
it's actually an object underneath</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
