properties to an object right we have
different ways of creating an object
with certain properties now what if you
want to remove it let's say let's take
this example of a person object have the
first name in the last name of course I
have a middle name which is null and the
age which is 25 because that's how old I
am no but let's say we have ages 25 and
now I don't want the age to show up in
my object because I don't like the value
25 all as age property on my object I
want to remove it okay how do I remove a
property from an object consider if I do
something like this let's say say
personal age equals undefined okay as
you might do this now what are the
implications of doing something like
this now let's say after I do this I
access person dot age what would be the
value we will be undefined so this is
perfect right so this is exactly what we
want
if the object did not have the age
property personal age would have been
undefined
now the object you know has the age
property but I've said the values
undefined so still person at age is
undefined so it's almost as if the age
property isn't there so have we removed
the age property is this is this good
enough well it turns out it's not good
enough because even though the person at
age property returns the value undefined
if I were to access just the person
object look at the object I'm going to
get I'm going to get an object with four
properties the last property here is age
undefined so it's not that I've removed
the property from the object the
property still exists I've just said the
value of that property to be on the file
okay so as long as you're accessing
person dot age it's fine it's exactly
the same as if the property wasn't there
but if you are accessing the object
itself then the facade falls apart right
so you can see that the age property
does exist and it has the value
undefined so this will not do look at
the difference between these two objects
person that age
has the value undefined in both cases
but they are not the similar objects
they are one of them has the age
property and we actually set out to
remove the age property not leave it in
there with the value undefined so the
way to remove a property from an object
is not by using this not by doing
objective property equals undefined
instead you use this keyword called
delete so you say delete object dot
property okay this is the actual the
right way to remove a property from an
object now if you were to do this person
that age would still return the value
undefined but if you access the person
directly and see what other property is
there you see that the age property is
disappeared doesn't exist anymore
because it's actually removed it's been
deleted from the object so whenever you
need to remove a property from the
object you always use the delete key
word you say delete object dart property
and then the property goes away</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
