gonna be using in this project so here
is the github API that I've accessed at
API github.com slash users slash
username this contains information about
the user that I'm accessing I have login
information here the users name number
of repos number of followers and all
that stuff and you also have the URL for
getting more information about the repos
so here I'm going to do a slash repos
and you get an array or JSON array and
each element is gonna be information
about the repo so you have the name here
you have HTML URL and there must be some
information about the number of forks
yeah so there is a fork count over here
these are the values that we're gonna be
accessing from this API now in order to
get started what I'm gonna do first is
create a bunch of classes to classes
really do mirror the structure then I'm
gonna get back as data from the API so
we're gonna call the user API and get
user information and we're gonna call
the repository if you and get repository
information I want to save those objects
as objects of a class I'm going to
define two classes one user and one repo
in order to in order to specify the
structure of the object that I want to
create so I'm gonna go ahead and create
those classes now I'm going to create a
new file call this user dot es and
another file repo dot es but these two
are going to contain the two classes
that I'm going to create now so create a
class user and I'll save some basic
information here like the login name
which is a string of full name which is
another string
number of free posts which is a number
follower count which is another number
right so some very basic information
that I'm saving over here next I'm going
to go to the repo and I'm gonna create
class here which is the repo class and
this is going to be the name of three
for the description and the URL and I'm
gonna have a couple of number fields
over here one is the size of the repo
which is something that github returns
that I'm just gonna save here and then
the number of Forks which is also
another thing that I'm gonna save now
each user has a bunch of repositories
right so I want to save the instance of
the repositories in the user class so
I'm gonna have a repos field which is
gonna be a list of repositories an array
of repositories that I'm saving over
here so in order to do this what I'm
gonna do is I'm going to export these
classes and export the class user from
user 2ts and I'm gonna export the class
repo from repo RTS and in my user IDs
I'm going to import repository Visual
Studio code has some cool importing
features so you see here when I click on
this it's gonna give me this lightbulb
icon I can click on it and it's
importantly poor from dot slash repoed
yes please thank you very much
now I have user dot es importing repo
class from report es and one of the
properties of the user class is an array
of repos
ok so now that we had done this I can go
ahead and make a call to the github API
I can of course put the code right in
index 30s but I won't do that I'm gonna
create a service class which is going to
make that
stay P I call so I'm going to call this
github API service dot es and this is
going to be a class github API service
and this is going to contain a method
which is going to make that API call</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
