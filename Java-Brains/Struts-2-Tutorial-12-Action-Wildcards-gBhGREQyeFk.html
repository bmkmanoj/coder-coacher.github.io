this tutorial I'm going to talk about
action wildcard mappings and starts to
what wildcards allows us to do is to
have a single action mapping that
addresses multiple action names and I'll
illustrate that with this example over
here so here we have a search form
action map to a search form the JSP now
let's say I need to have an action
mapping for search form and let's say I
have an action mapping for a search page
search tutorials search seminars or
whatever so as long as I know that they
all start with search and I need the
same action to address all those
different combinations what I can do is
I can replace this with a wild-card so
instead of search form I can have a
search star so what's going to happen
now is any action name that starts with
search we get search for more such
tutorials or whatever it is still going
to consider that and it's going to
affect this action mapping so search
something will result in redirection to
a search form dot JSP so let's see this
in action
okay so I've deployed the application
with the changes I've made with this
wild card and now I'm going to access
the earlier URL which is the search form
that action what's going to happen is it
will redirect the user to the search
form the JSP bickers it fits the spy
card it's a search star so the advantage
here is no matter what you enter over
here with a search page it's still going
to redirect to search form door JSP so
you have essentially a single action
mapping that takes care of multiple
action names just because of this volka
and this does not have to be at the end
it can be anywhere I can have a star
over here the star at the beginning so
it's simple wildcard matching so no
matter where you have the star as long
as it matches this pattern it's going to
consider this particular action
there is however one catch when it comes
to wildcard mappings and that is how
does the framework handle conflicts if
there are multiple wildcards that match
the URL or the action that the user is
trying to enter now to give an example
I've actually reverted this back to the
search form the way it was before now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to add
a second action mapping over here which
has the white card alright so we have a
search form which does not have the
wild-card it's the complete action name
and then we have a second action which
includes the white card now the question
is how does this conflict get resolved
now if I enter search form now let's
change this of course we have the same
result so we won't have a difference let
me call this search tutorial or GSP and
I'm going to just make a copy
okay so I have a search farm page and a
search tutorial page okay so now if the
user enters the action name search
tutorial we know for sure this does not
match it goes over here but if the user
enter search form would it be this
action or this action that gets invoked
the answer here is that it starts to
checks the mapping in the order in which
you have entered the actions so it
checks from top to bottom
first checks the first action that's
specified and then the next action and
so on so which means that if it's a
search form
it's going to check this one first and
it's going to execute this particular
action redirect to search form now if I
had flipped this now if this action was
mentioned first and then this action was
mentioned second that case it would be
the first action which was this action
which would get coil and it would result
in a redirection to search tutorial dot
JSP
so what this means is that when you're
specifying your actions which wild cards
you have to start with the more specific
ones first because stretch two is going
to check from top to bottom so that
means that the names without wildcards
if at all there is an overlap the names
without Wildcats would be at the top and
the names with wildcards would be at the
bottom and the ones with more wildcards
would be way down another cool thing
about wild cards is you can actually get
hold off the part of the action name
that matches the wild card now let's say
you have a search star over here now
depending on the value over here which
is matched to the star so you want to
change the result you actually have
something like that going on already so
if it's a search form we have a search
form the JSP now let's say you want to
make it a bit more generic if it's a
search tutorial it's a toriel dot JSP
that's a search seminar it's a search
seminar or JSP so what what we need to
do is
depending on the value that gets matched
you want to redirect to a different JSP
so it's not a you know catch everything
that starts with this okay it's
different than from that what's
different is depending on what is
actually caught in the wild card you
want to have a different JSP so the way
you can do that is by accessing this
value the part of the name that matches
the white card and then using that in
the result and the way to do that is
I'll replace this with one but then
these curly braces so what I'm trying to
tell structures whatever is matched or
here needs to be substituted over here
so what's gonna happen now is I don't
need this anymore
I don't need this mapping search form to
search for more JSP because this
actually takes care of that if I'm
passing a search form it's redirecting
to search form the JSP from passing
search tutorial it's gonna redirect
research tutorial dot JSP and you know
anything else
if I pass any other text over here it's
going to try to redirect to that
particular JSP of course we don't have
anything else so other actions would
result in an error but the thing here is
that you can have this kind of a
multiple mapping with just one action
mapping okay so I can remove this now
and this is going to take care of both
the search form and the search tutorial
so let me save this and we'll try to run
okay so i'll enter again the URL that we
were using before search form direction
it redirects to such form the JSP and if
I change this to tutorial today like so
search tutorial or JSP so this is the
mapping that we have actually achieved
multiple mappings with just one action
mapping so if I say search form it's
going to take that form and it's going
to substitute over here and it's going
to redirect to search for JSP and the
same thing for tutorials now you might
be wondering what's
one doing over here the one is to
indicate that there is just one wild
card over here now you can have multiple
white cards no let's say I have a
another wild card over here now if you
had to substitute the the ticks that
match this Y card you would have to use
a one and if you had to substitute the
text that match this wild card you have
to use a two since we have only one wild
card in this example we just using one
so if we had multiple white cards you'd
have to use the corresponding number
again starting from left to right so
that's the significance of this one okay
so this is actually very handy again as
I said if you have some kind of a
convention where you have a particular
action name going to a particular action
class and then going to a particular JSP
so in that case you can have one thing
that you know that addresses the mapping
of all those things as long as it's
sticking to this convention and of
course I forgot to mention this is not
just for the JSP that you can plug this
in you can plug this in to the class as
well so let's say I have this this one
so have a get tutorial going to tutorial
action now let's say I want to have a
mapping for get anything should go to
that something action ok so I have a
good seminar going to seminar action get
books going to books action so again
what I need to do then is have this
start over here so that it maps all the
gates and then the class would be of
course I have to plug in the value that
matches this thing so this would be a 1
in curly braces so this wild card and
then the substitution can work for both
the result as well as the action the
class name itself so of course you have
to be you have to have that particular
action over here so we do not have that
in our source so here we have only
tutorial action for our get so in case
you have multiple actions and you want
to have that mapping happen
automatically you can use Val cards to
have that happen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
