variables and values can be interrogated
what do I mean by that now in the case
of Java or C++ a variable can contain
only one type and it's very clear what
type the variable contains because you
can look up the declaration and see what
type it was declared in s we have int a
no matter where you use it always has to
have the type integer right so it's
obvious what the type is but now in the
case of JavaScript there is no way of
knowing it right so it's basically when
you're looking at a variable the type is
basically what type it holds at that
point of time it could hold a completely
different type later so it's important
to be able to find out what type the
variable is it's not static you have to
be able to figure it out dynamically so
how do you find out given a variable
what is its type the fee to do this is
using an operator called type auth that
comes with javascript in order to
identify what the type of variable is
you say type off and then give it the
name of the variable you can also do
this with a value you can say type off
and give it a value and it's going to
give you the type
let me demonstrate that so let me clear
this again and take all these things out
have a war a equals 10 and let's say I
do console the log of type off hey so
I'm not printing a I'm printing type off
a I want to see what type it is so if I
right click reload and run you see the
type of a happens to be number because
that's what I have assigned to it now I
can change the type and say I can say a
equals hello and now if I print the type
of a it should be a string so right leg
and reload and run there you go it is a
string so let me do that with a couple
of other types that we've already seen
so I'm going to assign
a boolean
and then I'm going to assign null and of
course I can actually print the type
before I allocate any value so I let's
say I say a equals Sten here and then I
do type of a before the definition so in
the very first line type of a is
undefined then you define it with
multiple values with these individual
values and then we can interrogate the
type and it should show those types so
let me clear this out and write like
reload and run so they go those are the
different types the very first line is
undefined because there hasn't been a
value defined then I have a number so
number shows up then string then boolean
and then this is the tricky part
this should ideally show null right here
you see it's showing something called
object we haven't covered objects yet
but this is one of the things that has
frustrated so many JavaScript
programmers including yours truly this
turns out as a bug in JavaScript type
off null should ideally be null because
like I said null is the data type which
contains the value null but in the
initial implementations of JavaScript
turns out they chose type of null to
return an object and even though now the
creator of JavaScript and the team that
worked on the initial versions of
JavaScript admit that it is a bug they
cannot fix it because it could
potentially break older code that
depends on this behavior so this bug
still exists in JavaScript today so
watch out for it if you say type off
null it's going to return an object so
how do you figure out if an object is
you know if a variable is null or not
you can compare it to the value null I'm
going to talk about comparators in a
little bit but this is a bug that's out
there so watch out for it
anyway we're talking about type off so
that's what the typeof operator does
it's an operator that follows a value or
a variable and then it gives out what
the type of that value or variable is as
long as it's not null in the case of
knowledge we return an object</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
