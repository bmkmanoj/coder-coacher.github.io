previous tutorial we saw one advantage
of using application context over the
bean Factory and that was for using
messaging and internationalization
features in this tutorial we're going to
look at a second advantage second
feature the application context object
provides which is event handling there
are three core elements when it comes to
event handling are not just spring but
generally any event handling consists of
three core components one is the event
publisher the entity which publishes the
event second is the event listener the
entity which is actually listening for
the event and the third eye' entity is
the event itself you know it's a class
that contains information about the
event which the publisher publishes and
the listener listens to so in the case
of spring event handling
there are interfaces so the spring
provides an application listener
interface so if you are writing a class
that needs to listen for events it has
to implement the application listener
interface then you also have the
application event publisher interface so
if you're writing a class that publishes
events you want to use the application
event publisher interface and then the
third thing is the class application
event so if you're writing your own
events custom events then you would want
to extend this application event and you
can write additional functionality or
additional metadata about the event so
we'll start off by writing a class that
listens to all the spring events that
are published and later we'll want to
create our own event and we'll learn how
to publish that event so the first thing
we need to do is let's say I want to
write a class to listen to all the
events what I do is let me create a new
class I'll call this the my my event
listener
finish now my eventlistener needs to
implement the application listener
interface so the application of this mo
interface is provided by spring it is in
the spring framework context package now
when I implement the application
listener interface I need to implement a
method and the method is on application
event so this method is called by spring
then any application event is published
and this method takes in a parameter
which is the application event object
itself and now spring is going to send
the application event object to this
method so what I need to do is you know
whatever code I write over here will get
executed upon every event that is
published in the spring framework and of
course the event itself is passed on
every call so in order to test this what
I will do is I will just write a simple
system dot out dot println and I will
just print the event itself so I will
see event dot to string so okay this is
the event here I'll call it even so
whatever event is being published this
method is called right so the event
itself is passed as a parameter to this
method call so I will be taking this
event object I will do a to string and I
will print that into the output so let's
save this now of course as with all
other beans I will have to declare this
as a spring bean and that's all I need
to do to register this as a valid event
listener so can you spring XML but now
that we have learned annotations I will
use the ad
component annotation to define this as a
spring beam and of course since I have
this inside this are Kaushik java brains
package and this package has been
registered to do component scanning this
will be registered as a component just
because of this competent tag so let me
save this now I don't need to do
anything else what this class will do as
of now is to catch all the framework
related events we have not published any
events of our own so it will catch all
the framework related events and it will
print them to string so let's run this
now and see what happens so here you can
see there is an event call that has been
printed here you see there is this
context refresh event that has been
published and our event listener class
has listened to this and it has printed
a two string so here you see the startup
date and the root of the context
hierarchy so basically what this message
is saying is this message is the two
strength of the context refreshed event
so the context has been created and
refreshed and that event has been
published by the spring framework and
our listener class has listened to that
event to scored that event and it is
gonna do string and it has printed that
out so this is a simple way in which we
can listen to events but now what if you
want to publish your own event so there
are two things we need to do if you have
to publish your own event first we need
to have an event class we need to write
your own event class or you can of
course use an existing event but in this
example I'll show you how to write your
own event class and then after that you
need to have that even published in one
of your other beans so let's say in my
triangle being our let me take a circle
here in my circle bean now let's say in
this
a draw method I want to publish an image
and let me call that event as a drive in
C so the first step is I have to create
a dry wind class the second step is I
need to publish that in my draw method
so let's do that now I will first create
a new class I'll call this the draw
event and the draw event has to extend a
class called application event so the
application event is the base event
class that spring provides so whatever
custom even see you write it has to
extend this application event class so I
will extend application event get the
import done now when I do the extend I
will have to add a constructor so in the
constructor we'll make sure that the
super is called so the constructor of
the parent application event is called
we don't need to do anything here but
what I'll do is I'll override the two
string and I'll print my own custom
message so that our listener can catch
it because we are doing an event or two
string in the listener so what I'll do
here is I will override the two string
I'll write my own true string in the
draw method I mean in the draw event
class and then I will see if that string
gets published and it's caught by the
listener so I will write a public string
to string and return let me say draw
event occurred okay so this is my event
class it's as simple as that so it has
an ordered into a string which I will
you know I have a custom message here
and I look for this message when I'm
listening
so let me close this okay so now that we
have an event we will have to publish
statement so I intend to do this in the
circle as I wanted he told you I have a
draw method here and I will be
publishing the seventh in the draw
method so this is where I should publish
so in order to publish an event I need
to have an event publisher spring
provides an interface called application
event publisher and we can use that
interface in order to publish events so
I'll create a member variable private
application event publisher publisher so
I will import the application event
publisher so this publisher has a method
to publish events so I can do a pub sure
dot publish event and this takes a
parameter as the application event and I
can publish my draw event here so what I
Louise alphas create a new event see
draw event equals new drive event and of
course I have to give this class which
is the class in which the event has been
created because you can see the drive
and takes in the source as a parameter
for the constructor okay so now that I
have this draw event I can publish this
drive event by passing it to the
publisher that publish event and then
this even gets published but now the
question is this we have a local and
variable called
publisher which we have defined here now
how does this value get set we have to
ask spring to set the publisher do this
so that we can use the publisher in
order to publish shipments now how do we
get a handle to the publisher so in
order to get a handle to the publisher
what we do is whatever class is the
source of even publishing we implement
an interface called application event
publisher aware I will import this so
what this tells Spring is I have this
class here which needs a handler on the
publisher object so that I can publish
events so when it sees when spring
container sees any beans that have
implemented the application event
publisher aware interface then it
provides the publisher object to such
beans and the way it does that is by
because I'll have to add the
unemployment add methods there is only
one method here which is the set
application event publisher and this is
the method that spring is going to use
to give us the publisher so let me call
this publisher and the code here all I
have to do is I already have a publisher
member variable so whatever publisher I
get from spring I just need to allocate
that to my local variables so I will
just say this dot publisher equals
publisher so basically the concept is
simple when we have a bean that
implements the application event
publisher aware interface it can be
guaranteed that spring is going to call
this method and it's going to provide a
publisher handle and what we need to do
is just take that publisher object and
assign it to a local variable so that we
can use that publisher object to publish
as many number of events as we want and
actually behind the scenes what's
happening is this publisher that spring
is going to give us is actually the
application context you see the
application context is an object that
implements an application event
publisher so when we say the publisher
that publish event we are actually
calling a method of the application
context you could as well do application
context art publisher and then get this
done but what we are doing by using the
application event publisher interface
highlights one of the best practices
we've already talked about coding to
interfaces we need to use interfaces for
all our dependencies and spring actually
implements this philosophy throughout
all the various design components and
the internal workings of spring follow
this concept as well so as you can see
here the application event publisher
functionality is implemented as an
interface and you don't have to worry
about the core object that actually
contains the code to run this all we are
worried about is using the publisher
interface to publish an event we don't
have to know this but this is what's
happening behind the scenes it's
actually the application context that's
handed over to us in the guise of a
publisher but we don't have to worry
about it we just assume that it's an
object that implements the application
event publisher interface and then it we
can use that object to use the publish
event method and we can publish our own
event so now this is all it takes to
publish our own events now we have you
know a piece of code in our beam in a
spring beam that publishes a custom
event this is an event that we have
written and we also have an event
listener that's listening for all events
so earlier we got you know a container
event when the you know the application
context will initialize but now we are
publishing our own event in our you know
spring beam now let's have a look at how
this works if I run this well there you
can see drive in the code message is
printed so what's actually happening is
the context is initialized
okay so the context message comes up
over here then our code runs it's
drawing a circle and then it's printed
out this message so this is the contents
of the draw method what we've also added
to the draw method is an event
publishing code so we have published the
dry wind were here and then what happens
is our event listener is going to listen
for that as well so this method is
called and the dry event is passed over
here and then we are doing an event dot
two string which means that this method
is called and our custom code is
executed in our custom event and that
you know that message is output over
here so this is an overview of how we
can use the event handling functionality
of spring and we can catch events we can
listen to events which are published in
the container and we can also write our
own events and publish them has been
