to be doing when you create a typescript
project is to create an old project you
use something like NPM to initialize an
old application it's gonna have its own
package store JSON and then from there
you're going to start your typescript
application so in order to do this I'm
gonna demonstrate creating a simple node
project but a simple example types your
project the Vita initialize an old
project is by using NPM init NP eminent
is going to create the package.json file
that's required for the purposes of
creating a node artifact I can give it a
name you can give it a version and then
you can publish it to the NPM repository
so in a minute just gonna walk through
it's going to ask a couple of questions
about what the package name should be
what the version should be you with the
authors and all that stuff and you can
type in the values I'm just gonna hit
enter and accept the defaults
and at the end it's gonna ask me if
value is okay I hit enter and now it has
created this package start JSON file
over here
alright so this is the default package
to JSON file what you can notice here is
there is this thing called name which is
the starting point for your application
so no matter how complex your
application is it's very likely gonna
have a limited set of starting points
most of the times just one you have a
single starting point to run your
application and that starting point is
going to pull in a bunch of resources a
bunch of source code files from
somewhere else so the common convention
is to have the root file the starting
point file be index Dungey is what you
can do with the typescript project is
create the starting point file called
index 30s which then compiles over to
index start J's which is what is going
to be executed all right so I'm going to
demonstrate that by creating this file
called index dot ES and index dot EF is
going to import the person class from
this thing over here I'm going to call
this person that yes so that it's better
named and now here I'm going to take
this out the person that ES file is just
going to export person and in my index
dot es I'm going to import person I do
that by using the import keyword the
name of the class from dot slash person
and now I have the person class
definition I'm going to create a new
variable called foo create a new
instance of person and let's say food
that last name
just some random values over here and
I'm gonna do control that log fool not
very meaningful but it's a good good
enough proud program to demonstrate this
so now what I can do is I can compile
TSC I can just say DSC and I'm gonna get
a couple of files in the out directory
you can get rid of deaths this is from
an earlier compilation I have indexed
rjs and percentage is now what I can do
is create this workflow where I can
issue one command to both compile the
project and to run index genius alright
so now what I can do is I can say node
out slash index dot J's and I'm gonna
get the program executed but I don't
want to do this I don't wanna run this
every time and I don't want the people
who are running the application to know
that they need to run this command the
convention is to use something called
start alright so you see here there is
this node called scripts in the package
store JSON file which lets you run
scripts through NPM and one of the
things you can do is create script
targets so let's say I create this
target called start and I put in a
commander with your what I can do now is
missing comma what I can do now is run
the command NPM start and what NPM is
gonna do is it's gonna look at the start
property in package store JSON and
whatever command you have over here it's
gonna run that alright so if I run into
him start it's gonna run the - - -
command that I have over here and it's
gonna give me an error but this thing
can be a valid command and NPM start is
gonna run it alright so here's what I'm
gonna do I'm gonna run the typescript
compiler alright and then I'm gonna do
the and to indicate that there is a
following command after this this is a
Linux way of chaining commands one after
another and now what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna say no
and then out slash index dot JSP or the
console rather than writing the
typescript compiler command and then
executing the resulting file what I do
is and en start guess what happens it's
gonna run the compiler and it's gonna
generate the output and it's gonna
execute that up later it's gonna execute
the index touch yes this is just one
command is gonna do everything right
this is a way in which you can kind of
mix things consistent across projects no
matter what the project is no matter
what the compiler you're using and what
the output file is NPM start there's a
convention which lets you just start the
application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
