the types
that's called implicit typing here's how
it works now I have three variable
declarations over here right let me get
rid of the functions you don't need this
now we have three variable declarations
a B and C with the types number boogie
and string and they have been assigned
these values let's say I get rid of
these variable declarations so type
declarations rather and I'm just gonna
make this be the assignments right here
so a gets the value of ten B gets the
value of true and C kids
value with just the string hello
so I've replaced the previous code which
contains type information with this code
which does not contain type information
but it just has the assignments alright
now what if I assign a boolean to a
we're here line five what if a senator
is a boolean earlier when he was
declared as a number it wouldn't have
worked because he is a number that
should knows the raise a number now we
are assigning true to a is not an overt
that sugar is gonna complain but we have
gotten rid of this we have gotten rid of
the declaration that he is a number now
what happens when I assign true to us
but guess what typescript still
complains and look what it's doing and
saying the value that is actually
compiled us show you the error message
see it says the value the type true is
not assignable to the type number how is
that possible where have we declared
thus VAR equals number we haven't done
this turns out typescript is doing
what's called implicit typing it's
actually looked at line one where you
assign the number ten to a and it says
okay I got it
it needs to be a number because it looks
like you're assigning a number to it so
it marks internally that a is a number
you don't have to declare it right you
don't have to say equal number
as long as you're assigning a value type
implicitly knows that the type of the
speedy but is a number similarly B if
you hover your mouse over it
notice that it says boolean C can you
guess what it says a string because the
assignment itself gives typescript a
clue about what the type is and
typescript horizontal type strip says
okay now if you've committed to these
variables being these data types number
boolean and string so every time in you
have it be anything else it's going to
complain automatically right so this is
how do the Box behavior it happens the
same way if I assign a number to B or
something else to see right it works
this is quite implicit typing and this
applies in a lot of different places so
let's say you have a function called
greet which returns a string you have
declared it and then you're going to do
is return good morning right it's a
function called greet returns a string
that you have declared as a return type
doesn't accept any arguments let's say I
have a war greeting equals greet I've
noticed that greeting is a variable that
has been implicitly assigned a strength
because the function declares that it's
returning a string all right so this is
implicit typing - actually goes a step
further when the function makes it very
obvious what the return type is and here
you see it's actually returning an
inline string so it's fairly obvious
what the return type is it works even if
you don't have the return type
declaration on the function right even
if you do this move your mouse over the
variable and you can see that it is a
strength this will not work when the
assignment is in a different line from
the Declaration now let's say I do this
get rid of this bar greeting the
separate line for the declaration and
say greeting equals
creet all right now let's look at what
happens to greeting it has a weird name
called any it's not a string anymore
right now I can say greeting equals 10
and it's gonna work fine typescript is
not gonna complain all right so this
implicit typing works only when the
assignment is in the same line as the
Declaration you have to have wire
variable name equals something and the
type of that something is going to be
the type of the variable that's the only
time when implicit typing works for
variables it doesn't work if it's the
assignment is in a completely different
line works the same way for these kind
of variable declarations as well let's
say I have a soirée and then somewhere
over here I say equals stand well he is
not a number anymore he is again the any
type right so now let's look at what the
any type is in the next video but
hopefully this concept of implicit
typing makes sense
that's typescript kind of helping you
out then the value is being assigned at
the same time when the variable is being
declared</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
