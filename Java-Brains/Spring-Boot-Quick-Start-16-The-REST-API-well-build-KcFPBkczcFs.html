first few things that you need to think
about is what the resources of your REST
API our REST API is usually deal with
nouns as entities or resources you have
to identify that first in order to
establish the contract for your REST API
the resources are the things in your
domain so in the case of a course API
topic there's a resource once you've
identified the resources you can then
look at ways in which the consumers can
access the resource using different HTTP
methods this is standard rest for the
sake of our course API we're going to be
identifying three separate resources we
have the topic the course and the lesson
for the scope of this course
the Springwood QuickStart course these
three resources should do we are going
to have a bunch of ways in which you
access these resources either to get it
or to update it those ways are
influenced by what the method you're
using for accessing them so the HTTP
method influences what you do with these
resources but the resource itself is are
the constants right they're the entities
or the nouns in your system so in this
unit we're going to be adding the
controllers and the mappings for just
this one resource the topic resource and
like I mentioned before we're going to
be using a hard-coded list of topics in
the subsequent unit we're going to
connect to the database and have this
read from actual database tables but for
the sake of this unit we'll just do a
hard-coded list and we're going to do
just the topic now if you just focus on
the topic what are the resource URLs and
what are the HTTP methods in the
operations that you can perform on a
topic resource well these are again
standard rest conventions you can have
different ways of doing this but the
standard is what's usually recommended
so the standard is to get all the
resources you make a get request to
slash topics so this is the plural which
lets you know what the resource is and
this
is the root URL for that resource so the
root URL for courses would be slash
courses root URL for lessons would be
slash lessons and when you make a get
request to that root URL you need to
design an API to get all the resources
for that for that URL so we can have
things like query parameters which
influence paginations hardening and all
that stuff but the root URL should be
same as the resource name but plural or
we can also have a get request to an
individual element which is basically
topics slash the ID of the element and
it could get that particular element
alone so let's say you have a topic
called spring and then the ID of that
topic is spring so you can have a get
request to slash topics slash spring and
it's going to get you only the topic
related to that particular element only
that element will be khair gotten back
as a as a response now these are the
gates you can also do up or post to
slash topics in which case you actually
create a new topic again this is a post
request to the same collection URL that
you saw before which is the plural and
the post body is going to contain the
details about the new topic when you
make a post request to slash topics with
that post body the API should ID to
create a new topic by looking at that
post body and then finally we're going
to be doing a put request to slash
topics slash ID which is basically the
same as this one the individual ID and
it's going to update the topic again
you're going to do a both a put request
but put body containing the topic
information and then it's going to
update whatever is at that place so you
can have a slash topic slash spring make
a put request to that with the post put
body containing the new information that
needs to be put into the spring topic
it's going to go and update and then
actually there's one more we have the
delete which can be issued to slash
topic slash ID which is the individual
element again and it deletes that
particular topic if you make a HTTP
request to slash topic slash spring you
should basically look at that in your
API and remove that particular topic
from
- not from the database so these are the
API is that we're going to be building
in this course again
from a hard-coded list but this should
give you an idea of how to build these
spring MVC controllers and methods so
that you have a fully working REST API</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
