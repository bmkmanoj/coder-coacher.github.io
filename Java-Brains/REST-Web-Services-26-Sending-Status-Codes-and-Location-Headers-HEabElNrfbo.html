how you can get
or the response that we sent back if you
see the responses that we've been
sending back we've been sending the
actual content of the response right so
when you want to send a message as a
response we just return the message
instance and we depend on Jersey to do
the conversion and change it to JSON so
what if your returning is just the
response content now what if you want
control the world what the status code
is or what the header values are there's
really no way to control that here if
you're just returning the content as the
response as they're done of your method
so I'm going to show you how you can
control that in this tutorial so let me
give you an example of a create message
API right so right now I can do a post
request to slash messages and it's going
to create a new message right so I just
hit Send it created a new message with
ID four and you notice the status is 200
because that's the default
status code that Jersey uses and you
notice the headers there are some
standard headers but if you remember our
design discussion for the create message
API we said a couple of things we said
that the response should ideally be 201
created 200 as the success status code
and whenever something succeeds whether
you can return the 200 status code but
there is a separate status code for
creation of a resource so since we are
creating a resource here we should
ideally use that status score and that
status code is 201 created now how do we
change this the second thing we
discussed was when a new resource is
created we want to send the resource URL
back in the header right we wanted to
create it header which had the resource
URL for this new resource that was
created which is of ID 4 so we would
have ideally like to return the whole
URL slash messages slash 4 right it will
be convenient to the user if that's
in the header you want to do those two
so let's see how that's done so this is
the method which creates a new message
and right now I'm just returning the
message and there's really nothing you
can control as far as the header and the
status code is concerned in order to
control the entire response what we can
do is we can turn from this method a
separate instance of a separate class
called response so we don't actually
return the message itself what we return
is a class called response right an
instance of something that's called
response now how do you create this
response now this response is from the
core package now to create a response
you use what's called a response and
builder and that's what lets you modify
the status code and lets you modify the
headers and all that stuff so to use a
response builder what you do is use
response the static call dot you see
there are a bunch of methods over here
but I'm going to use this status see
here I can actually set the status to a
particular status value I can provide an
integer or I can set a separate status
I'm going to choose this so I do respond
to that status and to set the status off
to a one I use a status dot created you
see here there isn't this is a statuses
enumeration which has a created value so
this uses the 201 status code right so I
do a response that status off status dot
created and then I do a dot entity so
I'm returning the entity pack which is
this message service dot add message
right get a new message I'm going to use
that and set the entity dot and I do a
build
okay so now what's happening is I'm
creating a new instance of the response
using the response builder and the way
the responsibilty works is it has all
these methods like status entity which
lets you add these extra data to the
response and then when I'm finally done
I call the build method to return an
instance of the response now I can use
this to return so this creates a new
instance of the response right now I'm
going to save this and let's see what
happens when I create a new message now
I see I get 201 created because that's
the status that I have set over here so
this is actually an easy way to return
both the entity along with the status
right I can choose the status that I
want I do a response that status choose
the status that I want and I do a dot
entity and choose the actual return
content and then I do a dot build right
what I can also do is I can do a dot you
see here there are like a bunch of stuff
right I have a cookie I can set the
cookie I can set the encoding that I can
set the x-bar so there's a whole lot of
stuff here so the idea is to set all
these different things and then call the
dot build as you can see this is using
the Builder pattern if you're familiar
with that so you add all these different
values to a builder and then you would
do a dot build so it's gonna build a
response instance with all those values
and then in your resource method you
just return that response instance and
Jersey is going to set all the right
values in the actual response that gets
sent back ok ok so now we have the
status code let's look at the header
value you want to create a location
header which has the URI for the newly
created message right now let's say
there is
message with ID for you want to set a
header value called location and the
value being the whole you know
localhost:8080
messenger messages slash four we want
the URL for the newly created resource
to be a part of the header now one way
we could do this as you see here there
is a there is a header value or the
method over here which which lets you
set any arbitrary header key and value
so you could say the key is location and
the value is the whole URI as a string
but there's actually a better way so if
you look at the methods that are
available here of course you we've
picked response status status not
created but if you see there are
actually some shortcut methods for some
of these standard status code so you see
there's a created method right so you
need a response dot created it lets you
send a location back right so if you
send that location back whatever that is
you're basically looking at a couple of
things so this line does a couple of
things one since you're using created it
sets the 201 created status score and
since you're sending the location it
adds that as the location header and
sends it back right so this is a quick
shortcut to setting both the status and
the location right since you would
typically do this all the time like I
said it's actually best practice to set
both the status code 201 and the
location header of the new resource
whenever you create any new resource so
this is a shortcut that's provided for
us now we said created now what's the
location that we said right so created
actually expects or URI so I'm going to
create a new URI we need to send the URI
back okay
so to send URI back I would need to know
what the ideas so I'm going to say slash
messenger slash Web API slash
messages / and then I add to it the new
message dot get ID why am i doing
messenger / babe API because the URI
takes the the server context as the root
right it's it starts with localhost
colon 8080 so I need to set anything on
words as a part of the URI so I'm
preparing a string and passing into the
URI constructor so it creates a new URI
and I said that to the created method
and this throws an exception so I'm
going to add throws because I'm sure
that this is going to be a valid URI at
least I think it is so I just throw the
you know exception in the in the method
now I'm being lazy but let's see how
this works first all right now let's
make this request again now if examine
the header you see it's worked fine
right so there's a location header with
the entire location of this new instance
it's 83 so it creates that ID 3 I do
this again
I get ID 4 which is really cool but look
at this code for a minute this is really
really bad right
so I'm actually hard coding the name of
the application I'm hard coding this
hard coding messages and I'm throwing an
exception this this is horrible right we
don't want this you want to change this
now what's a better way to get the URI
information far this resource now what I
want to do is I want to be able to say
whatever is the URI that the message
resources map to just get that and add
the ID to it right that's all you need
so you don't want a hard code this over
here you want the URI information for
this resource how would you get URI
information for this resource let me
tell you you already know this answer at
least if you've been watching the
previous tutorials can you guess how to
get the URI info well it's actually very
simple it is add context
you are i info if you remember in a
previous tutorial I had demonstrated how
you can get the URI information as one
off the injectable on text information
let me open up the inject demo you see
here context
URI info is able to get the URI absolute
path that's what we want so that's
perfect
so let me use this to get the URI info
so that I don't do all this horrible
mess right I'm going to remove this I
still use the spun start created I need
to send the URI
information how do I get that and you
see URI info that Jersey is going to
inject for us has a get absolute path
okay now the get absolute path should
let me actually do a system dot out dot
print off the URI in folder get absolute
path okay okay
now if access this well I get the actual
URI for slash messages now I need to add
the ID to it right so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to say string new ID
equals string dot value off
okay so I'm getting the value of this
new ID okay what I need to do now is get
the URI info that get absolute path and
add this new ID to it right so I this
you are either get absolute path there's
actually a URI okay so I need to do a
two string and then I need to add the
new ID to it and then I need to do the
convert the whole thing back to a URI
again well this is actually beginning to
look bad as well right so how do I add
something to an existing URI well
thankfully it's made very simple so you
see here you are I don't get absolute
path this class URI info not only has a
get absolute path which returns a URI it
also has a get absolute path builder
which actually lets you build the URI
with the base being the absolute path
that we've already seen okay so I'm
going to do a get URI in for that get
absolute path builder and then I'm going
to do a dot path new ID so basically
what this does is it gets this URI and
then it adds this new ID to it and then
I do a dot build
okay so this is going to give me the URI
that I want sign it to a new local
variable called URI and that is what I'm
going to send over here and that's it
this should work again to clarify what
we're doing is we create the message
right
this is straightforward now we need to
return response dot created off the URI
which is the URI for the new message and
return it back now how do I get hold of
the URI the first thing with it was use
the add context to get the URI info
instance URI info is a handy jax-rs
object which lets you get URI
information true to its name
now the URI info class has a get
absolute path method which returns the
URI off the absolute path but what you
need here to send to response not
created is not the URI for the absolute
path because that's just messages what
you need to return is messages slash and
add to it the new ID of the new message
that was created right so to add
something to a URI you would need to do
a URI to string conversion add this new
ID to that string and then convert the
whole string back to URI which is a pain
so instead what you can do is rather
than using a URI that get absolute path
you do a URI dot get absolute path
builder which is actually a URI builder
this again uses the Builder pattern and
the way you add a path section to a URI
is using the dot path right that path I
had in the new ID so it does a slash and
then the ID so you can add chain bunch
of stuff right you can do a dot path or
something and then dot path or something
dot path or something and then finally
do a dot built in this case all I need
is to add the ID so I just do a dot path
of the ID and then do a dot build now I
get the URI that I need to send back so
I do a response dot created off that URI
and it should return that response ok so
let's see if this is worked fine
I'm going to send this request again and
this is still continuing to work still
has the location header let the complete
location and none of the hard coding
over here right it is at least a bit
less messy than it was before with all
the hard-coded values and all that stuff
and since we are not doing any
conversion of you our eyes we don't need
this throws as well right I can actually
remove that so this is how you send the
location value in the header as well as
the status code okay so there are a
bunch of other convenient methods for
different kinds of status codes so there
is a response dot accepted for the
accepted status there is a not modified
for not modified you know you have like
a bunch of there's a response to okay
with returns 200 status code there's a
bunch of other stuff right so this is
what you would use for those standard
you know status codes which you use 100
times when you're building recipe is for
those unique ones you do a response that
status and then you send the status
which is the unique status that you want
okay so hope this made sense check out
the source code again I'll upload it on
github and I'll see you in the next
