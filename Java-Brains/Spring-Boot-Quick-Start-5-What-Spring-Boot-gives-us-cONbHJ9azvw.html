that it says well this is a good
starting point right it makes certain
configuration choices it makes certain
decisions for you and says okay start
with this and then see what to do then
change things if required it features
the convention over configuration
concept if you had to do a hundred
different things in order to configure
something that says again let's look at
the eighty percent use case and have
that be the default only if you are off
the twenty percent if you want things to
be a little bit different only then you
can figure it if you belong to the
eighty percent the majority use case no
configuration necessary just works for
the eighty person use case out of the
box the thing that spring boot gives you
is a spring application you can generate
a spring application from Springwood
right you can use spring go to create
the spring application the spring
application is going to be a standalone
application what do I mean by that
typically when you build a spring
application you're building a war file
you're building a web application that
you'd apply to a tomcat container or
some other sublet container but spring
would what you get is a standalone
application what you get is something
that you can just run and have it start
a web server you don't have to find a
servlet container to deploy to I'm going
to talk about the difference between the
two and by spring event for this
approach in a little bit but the output
that you can get but Springwood is just
ready to run right there you don't have
to find a sublet container configure it
apply it and all that stuff none of that
stuff is required right just run a
command and it transit standalone
application it's also production ready
and again I've mentioned this a couple
of times before you don't have to do
anything extra to get it ready for
production you can just take that and
apply to production house run</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
