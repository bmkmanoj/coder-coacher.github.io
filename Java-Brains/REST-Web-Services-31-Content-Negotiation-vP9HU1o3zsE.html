you to an interesting concept called
content negotiation content negotiation
is a way in which a client can ask a
server for a particular content type in
the response you can also send content
in different content types to the server
by telling it what that content type is
it's kind of like a negotiation a
conversation that happens between a
client and a server for instance here
the client could say hey I am sending
you a JSON request
I need a JSON response back so make sure
whatever response you send me is in JSON
format now the server could support JSON
responses and say okay you need this on
I've got JSON and it sends JSON back or
it could say I have no idea what JSON is
so it returns an error message so that's
kind of like the interaction that
happens between a client and the server
it's a negotiation so to speak and
that's the reason why it's called
content negotiation your client can ask
for a particular content type and the
server can examine that and return the
content type that the client is asking
for if the server happens to support it
now how does a client ask for a
particular content type the way desert
is by adding a specific value in the
header of each and every request that it
sends so there is this accept header
that can be added to a request and the
value of that header is the content type
that it needs so if the client wants
JSON it's going to add an accept header
in the request and the value is going to
be application slash JSON and that's
what the server reads to identify what
it is the client is asking for so let me
show you what I mean by that now if I
were to make a get request to our
current API the way we've implemented it
you get JSON back that's because we are
not really supporting any other content
type apart from JSON we said we're going
to use JSON and that's all that our API
support right so this doesn't haven't
added any accept header here right it
just I just make a get request and I get
a response back in JSON now let's say I
wanted XML response right so what I can
do is I can actually go and add
to the header so I open the header and I
add the accept key right so basically
I'm sending an extra header value called
accept and I can pass in a value and I'm
going to pass in the value text slash
XML because I want XML output right now
our application does not support this so
if I hit Send I'm going to get a nasty
error which is HTTP status 406 not
acceptable so it's basically saying this
request is not acceptable because the
server doesn't really know how to send
back data in XML okay so the reason why
this is so is because we don't have
support for EXO now you see here we have
a producer's annotation which is
application JSON that's the only thing
that this API can produce now what we
could do is enhance this and say I'm
going to support XML as well right so I
can actually send in a bunch of values
to the producer's annotation right so
there is a value property in the
producers annotation which takes in a
list of values so I'm going to send text
XML here so again the producer's
annotation earlier it was just accepting
JSON now I'm passing in two values one
is media type diet application Jason and
the second value is media type dot text
XML and honestly this is all I have to
do now since I have the right now
marshallers and unmarshal arrggh for xml
and json this is just going to work up
to the box right now if i were to make
the same request again there you go
I get XML because now I have declared
the API to support both xml and json and
now what the server does is again this
is a feature that comes out of the box
with jersey it's looking at the accept
header write it I'm passing text slash
XML here so it's looking at the accept
header and saying okay now if the client
is asking for eczema do I support XML is
going to look at the producer sanitation
yes we do support XML so it is going to
call the right and Marshall er to
convert
the return object from the Java object
instance to XML okay so I can change
this to application JSON and I should
get Jason back I do okay
so this is how you support multiple
content types in Jax RS you basically
have a producer sanitation with those
multiple content types
now you might be wondering what's the
point of all this might not support all
content types all the time because if
there is no support all we are doing is
throwing an error right so if client
asked for some feared content type that
you don't know they're going to get an
error anyway so why did we do this why
did the framework designers require you
to declare the media types that you
support in the produces annotation the
reason why they did this is and this
isn't obvious from what you're seeing
here but what you can do is you can use
this produces annotation to pick and
choose what method executes depending on
what the user has asked you for example
you look at the path annotation right
depending on the user's request you
access different methods you have
different methods in your server run
based on what the request is right
similarly you can have different methods
in your API run depending on what the
user is asking for you can have a
separate method which produces JSON and
a separate method which produces text
XML and then depending on the value in
the accept header jax-rs or Jersey is
going to call the write method and
that's when it gets really cool so I'm
going to demonstrate that I'm going to
return this to the original state
application Jason for both produces and
consumes so this is at the class level
annotation so this applies to all
methods in this class but now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to override the
get messages method okay so get messages
as a get request on slash messages and
it returns all messages right now I'm
going to add the consumes and produces
annotations to the get messages of
course I can remove the consumes
annotation because this does not consume
anything now we have a producer's
annotation far get mess
which is now JSON and this overrides
whatever value had specified and the in
the class header right now that happens
to be JSON too but here's what I'm going
to do I'm going to take this whole
method and make a copy of this okay and
I'm going to rename these I'm going to
call this one as get JSON messages and
this one is get XML messages I'm going
to change the producers for the XML
version of this method to text
underscore eczema okay so what i'm doing
here is i'm i basically have two methods
mapped to the same URL
let's get method on slash messages but
they have different produces annotation
one method produces JSON and another
method produces xml now I'm going to
distinguish between the two by adding a
system.out.print tune I'm going to print
JSON method calls over here and in the
XML version of this method I'm going to
print XML method call okay now what's
going to happen is depending on what we
request from the client the write method
gets mapped okay so that's where you
have the power you can basically have
different pieces of logic run if you
want depending on the accept header so
let's test that out
I do application Jason look at the
console you see there's a JSON method
calls
if I change it to text slash XML and it
send now you see XML method is called so
basically these two methods are mapped
to the accept header and this is all
being done out of the box by Jack's
address and Jersey all we have to do is
map it to the right produces annotation
and this is not just for what the client
wants from the server it's also a
property for what this what the client
sends to the server so let's say we're
doing a post request or a put request
you're creating a new message for
example the post body or the put body
needs to contain the payload for the new
message and it has to be in a particular
format XML or JSON now how does a client
let the server know what format it's
sending that data in this is again
another header value this is called
content type header we've already used
this before in this course so when you
send something to the server you pass in
this content type add a value so that
you tell the server what format you're
sending your content in so this actually
maps to the consumes annotation so all
we've all that we've seen for the
produces annotation when it comes to
content negotiation applies for the
consumes annotation as well now let me
give you an example of trying to create
a new message I'm going to make a post
request to slash messages I'm going to
take this XML format of message and I'm
going to send that in the post request
right I'm going to say content type is
text slash XML what do you think is
going to happen you remember when we did
not support XML in the producers we
asked for example we got an error
message similarly when we don't support
XML then the server's trying to consume
something when we send XML we're going
to we're going to get another message as
well so you see here the server gives an
error so this I'm not going to belabor
this I'm not going to write the consumes
annotation to support this as well but
the same concept applies you can have a
single consumes annotation with multiple
format so that the API can support those
formats are you can have multiple
methods for each of those consumes so
that you can have different
let's handle different formats alright
so in the end what it comes to is you
have a server you know you have your API
with different methods not only are
those methods mapped to your path and
HTTP methods they're also mapped to the
content type so if you have three
different methods accepting different
combinations of input and output content
types
what the you know what the rest API
framework what jax-rs chooses to execute
when you get a request depends on what
the request wants to send and what the
request expects as a response so if
there is something that expects just XML
it's going to pick method to here but if
a request accepts JSON and it really no
imminent return JSON or XML it picks
method three okay to summarize the
client has two different values that you
can pass in the header one is accept to
tell the server what format it can
accept and one is Contin type to tell
the server what format it's actually
sending messages in and then in the
server you have two annotations one is
produces to tell what output the method
can produce and consumes to specify the
format of the request that it can
consume now what you need to remember is
when there is a request map from the
client to the server what content type
is specified in the accept should match
what the method can produce and what
content type is specified in the content
type header should match what the method
can consume I hope this makes sense now
what I also want to highlight is that
the media type that we've been using
we've been using application JSON or
application XML a text XML they're
actually not enums they're just static
strings right so you look at the media
type class it's basically a bunch of
static string definitions right so
they're constants which are mapped to
strings in HTTP so these are strings
that you see everywhere in an HTTP
protocol so this using media type class
is just a more
way to refer to these strings rather
than have these magic strings lying
around so this is something that you
should keep in mind we've been using
these constants all along but it's
interesting to note that they're just
strings underneath so I hope this
concept of content negotiation made
sense thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
