profile resource
part of it let's move on to filtering if
you remember we talked about the message
API needing some kind of a filtering
mechanism you don't want to do a get
request to slash messages and get all
the messages in the system every time we
need to be able to filter the messages
and there were a couple of options that
we talked about
one was filtering by year so there was a
year parameter messages question mark
year equals example 2050 and that
requests the gate requests to that URL
would return all the messages in the
Year 2015 alone right so that was one
way of filtering the second thing that
we discussed was pagination we had slash
messages and then two parameters one was
the starting point and one was the page
size so the starting point would control
where the page would start and the page
size would control what the size of the
pages so that would let users page need
a group of messages so we can implement
both of these filtering concepts now so
let's get started before we implement
the API itself we need to have the
backing service methods so I'm going to
do that first and open the message
service door Java class and I'm going to
add a couple of methods over here so you
see there is one method here which says
get all messages which returns all the
messages so we're going to have a couple
more methods and here are the two
methods there's one call get all
messages for a year and there's one
which is get all messages paginated so
the first method takes in the year as a
parameter and the second method takes in
the start location and the page size
this parameter you don't have to worry
about the details of you know the
implementation details of these two
methods but I'm just going to go over
them for the sake of completion this is
not jax-rs right we want to learn how to
build a restful api in the resource but
let's quickly go over what the service
does it's basically looking at our
stubbed list of messages and filtering
based on the criteria so get all
messages for your Dixon here is an
argument right it creates a list which
is a blank list to start off with which
is what
Don I'm also creating a calendar
instance because that makes it really
easy for comparison and all I'm doing is
I'm doing a for loop and for each of the
existing messages I'm going to setting
it to the calendar instance so that I
can compare the year from it and then
I'm going to do a calendar Gettier and
passing in the year as an argument so
this portion gets the ear of that
calendar instance and I'm going to give
the year I'm going to compare it to what
we have got as an input argument I'm
going to see if it matches well then
that's what we need to return so I'm
going to add it to the list so that I
keep going keep comparing each and every
message and if your matches are added to
the list and then in the end I just
return the list right nice and simple
oh let's look at the next method the get
all messages paginated accepts two
arguments starting point and the size
this one is actually much more simpler
so I'm converting the message toward
values into a list and I'm just
returning the list dot sub list your sub
list is standard a list API in Java
which takes in two arguments one is the
starting starting point and the ending
points I'm just doing start and start
plus size and I also do some validation
if start plus size is greater than the
entire size of the list then I just
return an empty list not not too much of
higher handling and all that happening
over here just some of the basic stuff
required to get the service working and
again this is not the focus of this
tutorial we're going to focus on how to
get those query parameters and make a
call to these methods and these methods
are just there for testing purposes all
right so I'm going to save this and
let's now move to creating the actual
resource and open up message resource
start Java and this is where the REST
API part of it starts okay so now let's
look at the method which gets all the
messages so this is a gate annotation
for a method at slash messages so this
is what's doing the job
right it's just doing message sellers or
get all messages so what's happening
right now is something like this you do
a get request to slash messages and you
get the messages right so what I want to
be able to do is use a query parameter
your equals 2015 and be able to get only
the messages for the Year 2015 or any
year for that matter so this is the
method that gets all the messages now
can I have another method to get
messages based on here over here in
addition to this can I have yet another
method to get messages based on
pagination the starting point and the
page size
can I have like three methods for
getting the messages though
unfortunately you cannot because no
matter what happens even if I do this
right so I have a query parameter here
if I make a get request to that it's
still getting all the messages it's
still being mapped to this method so no
matter what parameter I enter over here
it could be absolute nonsense but it's
still you know it could be something
that's unmapped and it still calls the
same method so we don't have a choice
right we cannot have three methods based
on the query parameter options that we
want so whatever way parameters we pass
in Jersey is going to call the same
method what we can do though is then
this method executes we can get hold of
this query parameter right whatever
value is being sent over here we can
actually get hold of that in this method
and based on the value we can do
different things and return different
stuff so how do I get hold off the query
parameter value over here well the
answer is we have already guessed it
it's using yet another annotation the
annotation is called add query param
manah date to the method argument and
just like you have the annotation far
the path parameter well it works very
similarly for query parameters let's say
you won
the year as an integer I can do int year
the name doesn't matter but I'm
basically annotating an argument with
the annotation add query parameter query
parameters in an attribute which is the
name of the query parameter that you're
mapping so in this case it happens to be
here so this is all it takes
and of course query parameter on the
same package and now what Jersey is
going to do is when there is a get
request to slash messages it's going to
see okay this method has a great
parameter mapping if there is a query
parameter here equals something then
it's going to take that value and it's
going to send it as a method argument if
you are just doing a slash messages
without any query parameters this value
is going to be zero okay so that's what
we are going to check to see if we need
to filter by year or we need to get all
messages so I can do something simple as
if your is greater than zero then what I
want to do is return message service
that get all messages for your and I
pass in the year if not I do a message
service dot get all messages it's as
simple as that
now let's save this and let's make sure
the application read applies and now if
I do get messages whether you get all
the messages if I do a year equals 2015
I get both of them because the year is
2015 if I do your as 2014 you shouldn't
get anything well that's right you're
not getting anything I'm actually not
gonna enter messages for 2014 to show
that this works but you can try that out
as well all right so that's query param
and how you access it in a REST API
method okay so now this is this should
make the other instance really simple as
well now let's say I want to do a start
equals two
and size equals one okay so these are
again query parameters now how do I
capture this how do I handle this
scenario but again no matter what you
pass in it is going to call the same
method so you will have to use the query
parameter annotation for the same method
over here so I'm just going to add more
parameters here and we have two more
query parameter for start and size it
works the same way so we're just going
to have more if conditions here if star
does greater than zero and size is
greater than zero what we're going to do
is route on message service and we're
going to call the other method right in
the pass and start in size and we wrote
on that not that end sorry all right so
again I'm just doing a verification here
based on what is being sent if not if
both of these are zero that means these
query parameters are not supplied then I
get all the messages all right so I'm
going to save this and try this again if
I do this I get nothing
well let me try one and one I get the
second one this is zero based so what
I'm going to have to do is go back and
change this to equals because that's the
only way you can get the first element
again minor detail all you need to worry
about is that you're getting these query
parameters I change this to greater than
or equal to 0 because this is 0 based
list all right so I'm going to try this
I get the first element I do size equals
2 and I should get both the elements and
I do all right so this is in summary a
way to get query parameters and access
them in your controller method in your
resource method
and typically what you would do is have
all the query parameters in your method
and they can choose what is being sent
right depending on what's being sent you
do different things that return
different things but it's basically the
same method because it's the get method
being called to slash messages so it's
going to Georgie's going to end up you
know choosing the same method you just
do different stuff based on the extra
information that you have one of them
being the query parameters that's being
passed
I hope this made sense and I'll see you
in the next tutorial thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
