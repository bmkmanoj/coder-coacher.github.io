discussion of undefined versus null and
see how it applies to a specific use
case in the case of objects you remember
I told you about undefined versus null
how undefined is when a value hasn't
been set to available but as null as
where an empty value or a non value is
set to available so in the case of
objects there are certain implications
that you need to think about and
remember you remember I had showed you
that when you are referring to a
property of an object where the property
does not exist on the object currently
the value that you're going to get back
is undefined okay so for instance let's
say I have this person object where you
have a first name and the last name now
this is my first name and last name now
if I were to access person dot age what
would happen this object does not have a
person dot age okay so there's no age
property what you would get is undefined
right because it does not exist and this
is the way the JavaScript objects work
if you're accessing a property which
does not exist doesn't throw an error
all you get is undefined now let's say
there is a middle name property on this
object let's say I want to have a middle
name property and again suppose I don't
have a middle name right so in that
scenario if somebody were to access
person that middle name for my object
which does not have a middle name what
would be the value that get that they
get they would get undefined right now
the way for me to communicate that it's
not understand undefined I actually
don't have a middle name what I can do
is I can set a property called middle
name and set the value as null again use
the analogy of not initializing a value
and initializing a non value age here is
not set so it is black because it's
undefined because the value hasn't been
set there as for middle name the value
has been set to be an empty value so if
somebody were to look at this object and
say person that middle name they would
get the value null
so they would know that it's not that
the object is missing a property called
mill name it is that the object has a
property called middle name which is
empty okay so this is another important
distinction where you would use
undefined versus null if you have an
object which does not have a property or
seeking it's going to get you undefined
so in order to convey an empty value you
can't just leave it there you have to
put a value in there which is a non
value and that non value is not which is
an ideal value for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
