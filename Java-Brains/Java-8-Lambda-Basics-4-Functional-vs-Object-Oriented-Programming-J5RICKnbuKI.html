functional programming I should address
a an important question that I do get
when I talk about lambdas do we really
need functional programming we have been
calling with object-oriented programming
for many many years now this isn't that
good enough why do we need functional
programming it's a fair question and we
have actually been coding for many years
and there are like many millions of
lines of Java code that are out there
using just object-oriented programming
and yes you can do pretty much anything
you can do in Java using just
object-oriented programming so
functional programming doesn't really
let you do anything new that you
couldn't have done before what
functional programming lets you do is
really write better code more readable
code and so more maintainable code
because if you think about it at the end
of the day all we are doing is writing
machine code right machine instructions
and there is a reason we don't write
assembly language code because it's hard
to write and it's hard to maintain the
more complex your application code
becomes the harder it is to write code
using that kind of a syntax and which is
why you have all these other programming
paradigms think of functional
programming as another programming
paradigm which lets you write code which
is elegant in certain situations we are
not going to be done with
object-oriented programming Java is
inherently an object-oriented
programming language and it will
continue to be so this think of function
programming is another tool in your
toolbox
to use then the situation is right when
the right kind of problem surfaces okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
