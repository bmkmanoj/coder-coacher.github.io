our previous tutorials we have explored
servlets in considerable detail and in
this tutorial on whether you're going to
have a look at jsps in order to
understand J's piece we need to have a
good understanding of servlet so it's
recommended that you go and check out
all those tutorials first and then start
with this one so what a J's piece before
we look at what JS bees are I like to
point out one potential problem of using
servlets to be honest using servlets you
can develop any web application we have
all the required technology to do that
so you can capture any user requests in
a URL and then you know assign a
particular servlet to handle it and then
any HTML code that you need can be
written in the servlet by using the
printer writer we've already seen all
these things but there is one potential
problem here let's take an example
website I have my website open here
where I post all these tutorials and
dance under the name Java brains what
does it take to render this kind of a
website this kind of a page in HTML so
we can look at that by doing a right
click and go to view page source might
be different depending on the browser
but the functionality is the same now
look at the source of the simple web
page this page has just one simple
tutorial if set of links here and then a
comment box now this has a whole lot of
code apart from the HTML code itself and
then the HTML code itself is it's pretty
huge look at this it goes on and on and
on now imagine writing all this code
inside a servlet you'd have to have so
many print methods and then each one of
these lines will have to be passed and
there could be chances where the you
know the the string would break
say for example I need to pass the stuff
in code how did I do that I would have
to escape all these special characters
so while it can be done it is it is a
pain to do it and more than the logic
which is required to run the sublet the
you know the code which is required to
print all these HTML text is going to be
huge and it will be it will be held to
maintain some subnet like that so one
way to solve this problem is to use jsps
so this problem of putting all these
HTML text into java print statements was
acknowledged and that was how the
concept of J's piece came up what
happens in J's piece is it instead of
using servlet and Java code and have
HTML text inside that it works the other
way around you have HTML and you have
Java code inside of HTML so for example
say I have this as a HTML I have
designed it using pure HTML code no
println and all the stuff required now I
can just print this title using Java
code all these others will be HTML I can
just print this date using Java code so
what happens is only the dynamic
portions of this web page will be
rendered in Java code and the static
contents of this web page will be in
HTML so we won't have to print each and
every HTML line using println statements
so in summary that's what a JSP does and
that's how it's different from servlets
now let's do let's create a quick JSP
and see how it looks i will expand the
simples of the project here I need the
GSP inside the web content just like I
have a HTML here I can have JSP files
also inside the web content so I'll
right click here new you should see a
JSP file option here if you do not see
that again same as earlier you should
see that in the web folder so click on
this JSP file
again I want this in the web content I
will call this as test dot JSP since
we're just testing what a JSP looks like
leave this as a standard default finish
okay now we have our JSP here now how is
it different from our HTML we had a very
similar code in our HTML as well
see this is our index dot HTML which we
generated using the Eclipse wizard so as
you can see there's a lot not a lot of
difference between the two they're only
a little bit of code over here at the
top apart from that it's it's all the
same now let's run this JSP I'll right
click on it run as run on server it'll
deploy and start Tomcat and I have my
window here and hey I see the title here
because that's the title which is there
in the JSP but there's not a lot
happening here so let me write some text
ok so I've written a simple h3 tag with
some text just to test that this working
I'll save this and run this JSP
you can see the sticks display so this
is so far it's no different from a
simple HTML now the V differs is you can
write Java code here as I've told you
before
so let's write a quick Java code now in
order to write Java code we need to
somehow mark it as Java code so that it
does not render it because otherwise in
ethics that you write here will be
rendered as HTML so the marker for Java
code is this set of tags the first tag
that we're going to talk about is this
less than percent and percent greater
than so whatever code you write inside
these two tags will be rendered as when
it will be executed as Java code so I
can write code here like int I equals 1
and J equals 2 and okay and then I can
also have K equals I plus J basic Java I
think nothing special here but the thing
is that this can run inside this file so
this will be executed save this refresh
this there's actually executing but
we're not printing anything so we will
not see any difference so in order to
see this being executed what we can do
is we can actually print the output of K
here for example into the into the ha
you know HTML or the output J's because
over here so how do I do that I can I
can use out dot println
value off-key yes okay
okay now if i refresh this this output
comes up so here is our first advantage
of using jsps we have a print output
value over here so we can whenever you
want to print some value you don't have
to get the print writer and all that
stuff that you would do in a servlet you
can just use an out object and this
outer object is of type GSP writer and
this taker has a println method and
whatever you send over here is going to
get rendered over here all this is fine
but we can do this in a servlet as well
of course we need to initialize the
print writer okay here we have it our
earlier servlet
we just have to get a response to get
writer but then after that we are doing
the same thing we're just doing the
writer dot println it's the same thing
over here now what's special about je
space then give one additional feature
of JSP is that since this is such a
common thing out dot println is such a
common thing since we are writing HTML
text we would use that a lot so if the
output is not a dynamically calculated
value it can be outside these tags and
it will automatically get rendered we
don't have to do an out dot println
every time but say if the value is
actually dynamically calculated like in
this example then there is a shortcut to
do this out dot println so let me show
you that shortcut I will remove this the
sign we will use a different way to
print the value of K so the initial text
over here the value of K is the static
text we don't have to put this inside a
script block so let's just type this
here
okay plain HTML this will this will just
get rendered as it is okay now how do I
print the value of K here there is a
shortcut we use the same script tag and
inside the script tag I just use equals
and the variable name so let's save this
and refresh say what the value of K is
displayed so this is a shortcut you can
use for every for any value it doesn't
have to be really believe in a static
value here say I want to print three let
me get something else 34 I want to print
directly then I just pass it there it's
it's going to come here this can even be
an expression instead of using all these
I can just say equals one plus two save
and the value of the expression will be
calculated and rendered so this is a
this is a very good way to print values
which are dynamically calculated say you
have a script block where you do all
these calculations and you just want to
print the output the part where the the
output is dynamic you can enclose it
inside these tags and then read print
that and then you can you know go ahead
with printing static content over here
and then it automatically gets appended
and rendered so see this how it works
as far as user is concerned they just do
not see the difference it's as if there
is this one continuous stream of text
that's coming in HTML okay now before we
conclude this brief introduction to JSP
I'll show you one more tag that's handy
there is a declaration bag which is
again the same script tag but with an
exclamation mark after that now what
this declaration tire does is say you
wanted to clear a method then you can
put this inside this declaration tag and
this method will be available to all
these script tags you can have n number
of script tags like this very execute
code now this declaration method will be
available to all these script tags so
let's say I want to define a method here
saying the public odd I just have ADD
method which takes two integers I'll
save this now this method will be
available to all these script blocks now
I can I can actually open another script
block here and say key equals
add off a big number and another big
number and then let me copy this don't
have to type this again now let me add a
new line here I don't want that to come
in the same line so I'll add a break
another advantage you don't have to do
out dot println break just put the break
outside the script tag it will get
rendered now this time I will pass the
value of K itself save it and refresh as
you can see this time it's currently
printed that BR and then the value of K
this time is the addition of those two
numbers that have put over here what's
happening is even this grid block is
referring to the other declaration
script log here I can have as many
functions as many methods as I want and
it's directly calling this passing these
values and I'm printing out the value
using the this script output tag</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
