contact / address book application to
have this directory here called contact
app but I have two files indexed or HTML
and fjs so this is where we're going to
be building our application there are
some very minimal Corddry you know added
over here so your index dot HTML is an
angular application with ng-app equals
contact app I'm pulling an angular from
the CDN the version I'm using is 1.5 out
8 and I also have AB dot is linked now
AB dot GS has a simple module contact
app to match this ng app and then I have
a controller called contact controller
which is currently empty now I'm going
to be using that controller in a div
using ng-controller contact controller
as ctrl and then I'm going to close the
div okay this is a very bare-bones
application and now we can actually open
this in a browser and make sure it works
but then like a talked about before
you're not going to be opening this from
the file system we can be using HTTP
server to serve this file so open the
command prompt you can open your
terminal and a separate window navigate
to the directory that you have this
application in so right now I have
contact app as a directory so I'm going
to navigate to that so that I have these
two files over here and now I'm going to
start the server HTTP - server so I just
type that command this is the node
package that we in start in the last
video so when I hit enter HTTP server is
going to serve this directory over
localhost colon 8080 so I can copy this
URL and open this in Chrome here you go
this URL is springing up position ml
which right now just say it's my contact
app as we would expect it to there's
really nothing angular that's going on
but we can actually change things over
here so just let me make sure angular
works with my usual oneplus one
to make sure it shows - if I hit refresh
and I get the value - so angular works
next what I'm going to do is add some
data we want the address book to contact
application to have some contacts and
the best way to actually see the
contacts is by hard coding some data we
lot coded for now and then we can change
it later so I'm going to say this dot
contacts equals NR a so this array is
going to be an array of objects and the
each object is going to contain the name
some kind of a photograph a link to a
photograph and then some details like
the phone or whatever else we need so
I'm going to see this with some fake
data that I pull up from the internet
and now if you're wondering where I
might possibly get fake user data from
there's a really nice API for it so it's
an API dot random user dot me it lets
you generate a fake user profiles
none of these are real but they work for
our purpose they look real so I'm going
to paste this thing I ran fake user API
and got some JSON payload I have pasted
that over here and this is our array so
each has as you can see here there is a
gender name location email some login
information we don't need all this stuff
but that's what the API generated oh
there's some fake phone numbers picture
which works really well so we have this
rich information for a bunch of users I
have generated this for ten users and
they should work for us so I have a list
of contacts seeded in the controller so
this exists on the controller scope now
what I can do is go to my HTML loop
through those contacts and print the
names I'm going to start with just
printing the news I'm going to have a
tip I'm going to ng-repeat / ctrl dot
contacts and I'm going to have a span
inside which is going to have an
expression nine Euler expression and I'm
going to print for each contact let's
say pin the name right contact that name
that first plus that last so
is going to be contact dot name dot
first and have a space here to separate
the to contact our name the last and I'm
going to close the span and of course I
need to close the ng-repeat develop
spell
now the desk ID fresh the page and I get
a bunch of names over here which is
perfect now I'm going to add bootstrap
to make this look a little bit better if
you're not familiar with both bootstrap
is it's a CSS framework that has some
pre-built styling that you can use all
you need to do is ID the CSS and use
those CSS classes and you're good to go
you have this plain default bootstrap
look but it's at least much better than
the default CSS in the browser so let's
add bootstrap now so I add bootstrap by
going to the URL get bootstrap calm and
here I click on download bootstrap and I
can pick the value from the bootstrap
CDN so here is the latest compile and
minified CSS copy that over and put it
in the head just add that over here and
that should be it
I can also copy the theme so let me do
that I'm gonna copy this theme over and
that as a separate CSS as well and now
we have bootstrap in now I'm going to
refresh the page again and this is what
it looks like a bootstrap not a lot of
improvement but we will get there so I'm
going to add some bootstrap classes to
make this look good I'm going to have a
class equals contain over here so that
this looks like a container and for
these list elements I'm going to add an
actual list so if I go to bootstrap
components here you will see something
called the list group which looks like
this so all this needs is the structure
you need a UL and an li so I'm going to
separate this and have this PR you lnn
li
so this is going to be the list group
and I'm going to close the list group
and within each element there's going to
be any like so this dev is instead going
to be Li make this be a part of ng
repeat so rather than ng repeating over
a div it's gonna ng repeat over a list
alright now let's go back and refresh
there you go
this looks much better now okay now that
I have this let's move on to actually
showing the contact information now this
is just a list of contacts I'm going to
show the contact details so in this
controller itself what I'm gonna do is
in fact let me wrap this inside a 402
plus equals row so row as another
construct and bootstrap which lets you
build rows as the name says I'm actually
blazing through these at these items
because would strap is really not the
focus of this course but if you're
interested definitely check out the
bootstrap documentation and the siding
classes here but if you're not following
along you don't have to worry about it
too much just note that there classes
that style things differently all we
need to think about is the angular code
which is just an NG repeat with
repetition of the names alright now we
have this div which is closing this over
here and now what I'm going to do is add
another div just another rope we're just
going to contain the details another row
over here then I'm going to print the
details off let's say one Conda right
we're going to take the first contact
over here the first element in this list
and we're going to print this person's
details so again to print the details
I'm going to pick one more component in
bootstrap which is called a media object
so this is what a media object looks
like you have a div with the class media
you have another div called media left
and the media body inside it and copy
this over into index dot HTML and format
the code so this
is going to be the details section here
in the media left I'm going to have let
me comment this out actually or me to
move this so I'm going to say picture
and here I'm going to say this is the
body okay just some simple markup to
make this HTML styled in a particular
way now if I were to load this so here
you can see there is a picture and a
body nothing really happening over here
so we're going to fix that so what do we
need to do you need to add a picture and
we need to add a body and we need to
print this far the first element we
can't do this for every element over
here which is going to pick the first
element so there's going to be this
start contacts off zero okay so first
thing we're going to do is print the
user's name over here so this is going
to be the first user's name the first
person's name so which is going to be
ctrl dot contacts off 0 dot name dot
first and I'm going to have to do the
same thing for the last name so I'm
going to add a space over here and then
it's going to be 0 and print the last
right cover to refresh this well they go
the first person's name is now showing
up but you see how tedious this is I'm
gonna have to go ctrl that contacts of
0.6 actually very tedious so what I'm
going to do is grab the first element
into a scope variable alright so this is
where the cutter ends at the very bottom
okay now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to say this dot selected contact
right so this is going to be the
selected element that's what to display
the detail display is going to show
right right now this is just going to be
this dot contacts off zero okay now with
this
this becomes fairly straightforward so
I'm going to say rather than this I'm
going to do ctrl dot selected contact
this becomes a bit easier to type
nothing changed over here alright so
this is a media heading I'm going to add
a bunch more over here let's see what
other details we have for this contact
we have the location and the date of
birth phone and cell so we are going to
add the location over here it's X
location let's see what the properties
of the location are Street city state
and postcode alright so I'm going to say
a location dot Street city state that
you do and I'm going to print the
postcode here so this is a paragraph
which is going to contain the user's
location all right now let's save this
and refresh you have users address I'm
going to repeat this far the phone as
well terminal T this dev here phone and
I'm going to print the users phone I'm
just going to print the cell right so
this will be selected contact Tod
that's all you need for this one so
we've got the user location and the
phone now for the picture so this C data
actually comes with some random pictures
so the picture has a large medium and
thumbnail I'm going to print I'm going
to pick the medium right so it's picture
dot medium so we're here in the picture
an image tag SRC equals selected contact
dot picture dot medium and since this is
an angular expression I'm not going to
use the SRC I'm gonna use the ng SRC
which is an angular tag in order to get
dynamic pictures alright so now let's
refresh this and of course I'm going to
have to do this so that it fetches the
value and there you go we have a picture
we have the users details and this is
working fine now all I need to do to
show another user is to just change this
over here
so rather than zero let's say I'm going
to do six and now the seventh user is
going to get pulled up and their details
are shown alright so all I've done here
is basically write some markup in order
to get the users information you have
seeded the data and them users and we
are just showing it right nothing really
significant implemented so far okay it's
very straightforward what we'd like to
do next is to be able to click on these
things and then show the user far
whatever we clicked on how do we do that
we do this by actually having an
ng-click
on these lis so I'm going to do that
next I'm going to say ng - click equals
ctrl dot select contact and I'm going to
pass in the dollar index because that's
what will give the indication of what
element in the loop
says all right so now I'm going to go to
a bar Jas we have to build that method
right the method is select contact so
I'm going to say this start select
contact this is going to be a function
which is going to accept index as an
argument and all it's going to do is
just what I've done over here but rather
than have it assigned to a hard-coded
contact it's going to assign it to the
index so that that thing that was
clicked on is actually selected right
I'm going to refresh and we'll now I
click on something the contacts all
those things change and we get that
users information right pretty cool and
this is really the basic wiring that we
need to do to show a list and a detailed
view again nothing here should come as a
surprise this is just some of the basics
that I hope you already know in the next
tutorial we're going to enhance this and
I'm going to use a scenario where we
need to actually share data right now
there's just one controller let's add
another controller here and figure out
how to actually share data there's a
problem that we will need to solve that
so see in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
