this is how you register anything in
angular you first create a module what
is an angular module an angular module
is kind of like a phone book where you
make a note of how to get in touch with
different things so think about what you
do in a phone book right you create
entries for your friends or family or
whatever and you have their number next
to it so you basically registering their
phone number and whenever you want to
reach out to them you look at the phone
book and you know what number to call
right so an angular module is something
similar you create a module you create a
new phone book for all your angular
elements and whenever you're using an
element you register it and so when we
using a controller like this mean not
only do I have to write this function I
also have to register it in the angular
module okay
so here are the steps that we need to do
first we need to create a module second
we need to register this function as a
controller in that module and then we
get to use it an ng controller all right
so let's look at those steps one by one
now how do I create an angular module
you create an angular module by telling
angular that you want to do so angular
by the very fact of us adding it in the
script exposes a global variable called
angular so there is this global variable
called angular that is available to us
all right let me demonstrate that by
just clearing out all this other stuff
here I'm also going to clear our ng
controller or save and refresh this and
open the console and now here what I'm
going to do is in the script I'm going
to say console log the object called
angular so this is not something that I
declared this is available to us because
we included the angular script but the
angular script does it makes a global
object available called angular with the
name it's available with the name
angular so let me save this and refresh
the page well here you see there is an
object available see there are a bunch
of
properties aren't that's pretty cool
we're going to look at that later but
there is this thing called angular
available to you all right so now what
you need to do is you need to tell
angular that you want to create a new
module you want to create a new
phonebook video register your controller
and the way to do that is by saying
angular dot module this is a function
this function takes in two arguments the
first argument is the name of your
module you're telling angular I want to
create a new module that I'm going to
say well what's the name of your module
I'm just going to call this my hat
alright so this is the name of my module
the second argument is an empty array
don't ask me what this array is yet I'm
going to explain this a bit later but
just go with me here and the second
argument to creating an angular module
is always going to be an empty array for
now it's going to change later but
assume for now that it's just an empty
array and that's the second argument now
with this you have pretty much told
angular you want to create a new module
and angular is going to create a new
module called my app and the angular
duct module function is going to return
that module so I'm going to hold on to
it I'm going to say war module equals
angular dot module all right so this
statement creates a new angular module
it creates a new phone book for angular
to register stuff and it's going to
return that module object now by doing
this I have an empty module of an empty
phone book now I need to register my
controller so what I do is I register my
main method so let's say I write this
method here but now I need to register
it over here the way I register it is by
saying module dot controller now this is
a way to register controller this takes
in two arguments one is name of your
controller it's going to call it main
ctrl and the second argument is the
function that you want to register in
this case it's going to be mean because
the name of the function is main so the
first argument is the name that I want
to create for other controller I need to
register everything under a name right
here in a phone book you enter a number
under a particular name so that's what
I'm doing here I'm creating a unique
name and I'm registering this
function under that name and now I have
a controller registered now angular
knows that whenever I'm referring to
this name main controller it knows which
number to call it knows which function
to excuse this main function
so no matter anywhere near wherever in
your angular code you refer to main ctrl
angular knows exactly what function you
are referring to so in this case I'm
going to use the ND controller now and
I'm going to assign this to main ctrl
which is the name that I've registered
the controller as and now angular is
going to know which function to execute
it can execute this function when it
encounters ng-controller there is one
additional step you have to do though
then you have an angular application
you basically have to tell the angular
application what module you are
referring to right so now you have
created a module over here you could
easily create ten different modules and
each of those module could have you know
100 controllers in them right so it's
you are basically looking at different
phone books now when you say I want to
refer to an entry in a phone book over
here our main controller angular is
going to ask hey which phonebook are you
talking about
here we just have one phonebook here we
have just one module but stir you have
to let angular node which module you're
referring to when you're referring to a
controller and the way to do that is by
having ng-app
point to your module so in this case the
name of the module is my app so I'm
going to say ng app equals my ass so now
angular knows which phonebook you're
talking about it knows which module
you're talking about
now when in this angular application
when it refers to a controller when it
sees ng-controller equals something it's
going to look at this modules when you
look at the my app module and see if
there is a controller registered with
the name main ctrl and it finds it it's
the main function so it's going to
execute main function alright I'm going
to save this and let's refresh the
browser and here you see main called is
executed and this is angular doing it
thanks to this ng controller
you might think that this is a very very
roundabout way to execute a function
during the page load all you had to do
is just add this consult of log and it
would have executed right the thing is
by making this a part of the angular
system you get a lot of benefits you get
to use the framework if you just had a
global function he actually would
execute but then you wouldn't get any of
the angular features we are working with
the framework so you need to plug our
code into the framework and this is how
we do this we plug our function into the
framework by creating a module and
registering it as a controller then
using it using ng controller</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
