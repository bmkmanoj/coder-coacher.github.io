two tutorials ago I mentioned that there
are two ways in which we can write web
services one way is to write the java
class first and generate the wisdom out
of it
and the second way is to write the
contract first which is the whistle
first and then make the Java class after
that and in the previous tutorial we
took a look at the wisdom we try to
understand all the different parts of
the vessel and we learned what they mean
and how they all work together so does
this mean that if we are doing the
contract first development that is the
wisdom first development we write the
wisdom first manually a take a look at
this vessel here I mean we do understand
a lot a lot of these different tags and
different sections now but it's still an
XML mess it's an XML mess that we kind
of understand a bit off but it's still a
mess imagine opening up a blank page in
a text editor and typing all these
values from beginning to end I mean this
is really tedious you nobody got time
for that we need a shortcut so the
shortcut is to write the Java class
first yes you did hear that right I'm
saying we are going to go with the
visual first approach by writing the
Java class first how does that make
sense well the thing is if we write the
Java class first we do get a nice XML in
a nice format right the GlassFish is
going to do all the work and I just want
to give us this XML you're not going to
lock down on this XML yet we're going to
write the class and generate the XML
just so that we have a starting point
and then once we get the XML we're going
to tweak all the different parts of it
so that it is just to our liking and
then we're going to lock down the XML so
we are actually doing the Vistal first
but then just to get all this verbose
XML generated for us we write the class
first okay I hope that makes sense so we
have kind of done that we have written
the class we know what are the
operations that we need and we have
generated the Wizzle but this Vistal is
not finally
we want to make some changes to it you
want to make we want to tweak all these
defaults and once we are happy with the
the the final wisdom we're going to lock
that down and then we're going to
customize our java class to match that
list all most of the times this is what
we would end up doing in a real life
scenario nobody's gonna sit and type all
these things from the scratch we want a
starting point and the starting point is
our java class okay so now that we have
this class and now that we have
generated this missile let's see how we
can customize a lot of these things a
lot of the customizations arise from
these annotations itself of the
webservice annotation is taking a lot of
defaults we haven't done anything to
tell the webservice annotation to say
hey these are the names that we need now
we're going to do that when you do a
open parenthesis and control space on
the web service there are some
parameters that you can enter over here
so let's take this parameter which is
the name so you see here the name has a
Java doc here it says it is the name of
the web service used as the name of the
digital colon port type okay
so if you look here there is this port
type which is the product catalog that
is getting picked up from this name but
let's say I configure it the same name
equals and I'll call this test Mart
catalog so basically I'm overriding the
default I don't want the service name to
be product catalog I wanted to be test
might catalog now let me save and I'm
gonna read apply
on GlassFish so I'm going to republish
okay it's done now let's see what
happens if i refresh this now you see
here the port type has changed it is now
called decimate catalog so this makes
sure that even if we change this class
this vessel is not going to change at
least this line of the vessel is not
going to change so no matter what you
call the class this line is going to be
the same right so that is basically the
intention of all these annotations you
want to make sure that these visible
names don't change if you change
anything of this class as long as you
keep this annotation the same it's going
to remain the same so let's look at some
of the other properties of this Vistal
so i do a control space again you see
here it has something called as a port
name so i'm going to call this test mart
catalog port and it also has what's
called as a service name okay i'm going
to use this i'm going to call this test
mart
catalog service okay now let's see what
happens when i publish that these two
changes
I'm going to fresh the page and notice
that we get a 404 light if we get a 404
because this URL is no longer valid so
notice that this URL is actually the
name of the service sales product
catalog service but now what we have
done is in our code we have gone ahead
and changed the name so this is our
actual service name now let's change our
URL
I'm going to paste this new service name
and access this Vista now the ego our
Vista has changed home to a different
URL so this is you know this is an
important reason why you would want to
get the service name first so that you
don't make changes to the URL you don't
want to change the service name after
people have started accessing your
service now let's see we have two more
properties which I want to use now there
is this property called target namespace
now what is the target namespace mean
let me go to a new line here what is the
target namespace mean now the namespace
is kind of like a package in the Java
world right - the namespace is used in
an XML world has an equivalent of a
package in the Java world
so when you say namespace you're
actually grouping all the xml types
together okay so you notice that this
whole Vistal is encapsulated by a
definition stack so all the information
that we saw earlier right we saw types
messages poor binding and servers all
these things are encapsulated inside
what is called as a definition stack of
the definition stag has a target
namespace now this namespace ensures
that all the types that are defined in
this Vistal are not going to be
overridden by another whistle of the
same type or another XML of the same
type so you want to isolate all these
types to a grouping right out to a
package so let's say you have this right
you have a message name as get product
categories now let's say you're working
with a whole lot of XML and there is
another message with the same name that
would be problematic so you want to
group these things together into an
equivalent of what we call as packages
in the Java world so you want this
namespace to be unique so this namespace
is again auto derived can you guess
where this is getting this value from
well it's getting the value from this
package right so since it's an
equivalent of a package we also have the
namespace getting Auto derived from our
package so it's taken our package name
and it's reversed the order
so it's Java brain start kashi gorg its
our packages anyway using a format which
is the convention which is the reverse
dns so it's kind of requested back so
it's taken the you are so we want to
change this so we can specify a target
namespace now let's say i get the domain
test medCom so i'm going to call this
HTTP colon slash slash test might calm
okay so this is going to be my target
namespace let me save and republish
and when i refresh this you see that the
target namespace has changed to this mod
comm and you see that everywhere right
it's not just in the definitions so in
there types there is a namespace
mentioned as well and that has also
changed to test matcom we haven't
examined details about the types yet we
are going to do that later but notice
that these namespaces have all changed
so that's a good thing we can control
the namespaces just by this target
namespace property of the web service
then there is one more property here
which is actually there are two more
we're going to talk about these two a
bit later so let's keep this aside for
now let's look at the properties that
the web method annotation provides you
already seen the exclude property we can
actually exclude a web method from being
published as a web service as an
operation of a web service by using this
exclude is equal to true property so the
action property allows us to give a name
to the action so let's say I am calling
this fetch categories okay we're going
to take a look at how it affects the
vessel in a minute
so the other property that I want to
change is the operation name so the
operation name is again something that
takes the D file as the method name I
can specify my own operation name here
so I'm going to say fetch categories and
I'm going to republish this again
now if i refresh the page you can see
that a lot of things have changed here
so if you look at the operations the
operation name is now called fetch
categories and then the soap action is
quite a fetch underscore categories even
if you look here the operation is fetch
categories in protectionists which
underscore categories don't worry too
much about what these are actions in all
that I'm not going to go into that in
detail now but notice that these these
annotations in these properties have a
direct effect on what these visual types
are named right so let's say you want to
call it retrieve you can you can call it
whatever you want as long as this
annotation is the same so this is how
you can customize the web methods so
we've looked at some of the basic
attribute of the web service and the web
method annotations there are a few other
annotations which let us configure the
input and the output types but we need
to look at types in a bit more detail to
kind of use that and customize that so
we're going to look at that in the next
