constructor way versus the non
constructor way of creating objects in
JavaScript using another example another
cliched example I'm going to create a
bicycle object which has a couple of
properties on it and I'm going to create
a couple of objects using both just
simple functions which create everything
on its own and then return the object
and then using a constructor mode of
calling functions using the new operator
so let's do the simple visit it's it is
my bicycle and it's an object which has
these three properties the cadence of
the bicycle the speed at which it's
going in the gear that it's in right so
this is a simple bicycle object now you
don't want to do this in line and you
don't want to create properties manually
you want to have a function which
creates tests now let's say I create a
function without using any constructors
it's a simple function which initializes
the object and returns it back it takes
three arguments which are the cadence
the speed in the care write all the data
that you need to initialize in that that
are in that object and then return it
back so let's say I call this the
colored function create bicycle let's
say this is my function right I'm going
to write a function call create bicycle
which takes in three arguments and then
it prepares this object need to accept
those three arguments over here the
cadence the speed and the gear and now I
have an opportunity to create the spy
skill object so let's say I create a var
New Mexico equals an MD object and then
now I can set things on this new bicycle
and I finally now that this object is
ready I need to return this
I mean return new bicycle right simple
function which creates this object in
this structure and now I can call this
with anything any parameters I need in
it I'm going to get that back so rather
than do this rather than set up the
object in line with Keaton's fifties b20
and gear for I can call this create
bicycle function
with those parameters cadence with T the
speed 20 and then the gear 4 and the
desk and I have my bicycle with those
properties right is a simple method
simple function which creates an object
alright so I can actually create one
more using the same function because
that's the advantage of having functions
right so let's say I create a cadence of
20 speed is 5 and the gear is 1 this is
bicycle one this is bicycle - let me run
this and now if I were to print these
things on the console bicycle one is
this object and bicycle two is this
other object and we've got two objects
thanks to this create bicycle function
which is like a factory it creates
objects now this is one way to create
objects and this is something that you
would have been familiar with before you
learn the concept of constructors
constructors makes this simple so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to create
another function for creating a bicycle
but this is going to be a function that
gets called in the constructor mode so
let's say I call this function I'm going
to call this bicycle constructor this is
not a good name for a constructor
function I'm going to tell you by soon
but just consider this to be the name
for now and this is the function which
is going to get called in constructor
mode ok so let's say I want to have
another bicycle it's a bicycle three
that gets that calls this function but
in constructor mode and the way to call
a function in constructor mode is by
using the new keyword now that you use a
new keyword on a function this function
is now being called in constructor mode
so when you anticipate a function to be
called in constructor mode you need to
write that function differently because
then a function is called in constructor
mode we learn this Java Script adds two
lines of code to that function there is
one line at the very beginning which is
something like this
or this equals empty object and the very
last line
is something like this return this
alright so JavaScript adds these lines
it doesn't literally add these lines and
it's not like these lines actually get
executed but for all practical purposes
you can think of it as there is a
variable this that gets created before
your first line of code kit it gets
executed and there's an object
initialized and at the end of your code
this that object that variable is
returned back so now you look at this
and compare it with this it's more or
less the same you know if you have the
first line and the last line that
happens automatically for you all you
need to do is just add these things in
the middle so I'm going to copy this and
I'm going to paste this here and now
this is not going to work because
there's no such thing as new bicycle you
call it new bicycle for the object but
now here since that's happening
automatically and it's given the name
this I need to use the name this instead
of the name new bicycles I'm going to do
that and change these to this and now
let me clear this out and then choose
reload and run there print bicycle 3 you
see there is the new object that got
created have cadence 50s between E and
gear 4 which was thanks to this so this
is essentially the difference between
the normal way of creating a function
which constructs objects within creating
a function that's supposed to be called
in constructor more if you know that a
function is supposed to be called in
constructor mode you essentially assume
that these two lines are already there
then you just have this in place the
thing that you need to remember though
is there is nothing about the function
itself that tells you that it's supposed
to be called an constructor more the
fact that a function is being called in
constructor mode is not a property of
the function but the property of the
value column you can call a function
using a new keyword and then that
function gets called in constructor mode
what you can also do is keep the new
keyword in this English case this
function does not get caught in
constructor more it gets called in a
regular more but if this gets caught in
a regular mode it will not work because
you're not really returning anything
here right so for you to take this value
and return
back you are basically depending on
JavaScript to do that for you and that's
JavaScript aside when you have the new
keyword right so there is no property on
the function itself which indicates that
it's a constructor the constructor mode
in JavaScript just happens to be ugly in
which you can call a function any
function so it's important for you when
you're writing a function to somehow
give a clue to other programmers that
this is a function that's meant to be
called as a constructor and not as a
regular function right if somebody calls
as a regular function it wouldn't work
and they would know why so you have to
somehow give a hint and the convention
that people have come up with for
constructors in javascript is to not use
camel case but use regular case with the
first letter caps so rather than have it
be a bicycle something like this bicycle
constructor you you you always start
your constructors with the cat key first
letter all right and since this
indicates a constructor I can actually
clear out the constructor word so
essentially it just becomes the thing
that you're creating so if I were to
copy this and paste this over here so
this will work just as well so this is a
constructor that creates a bicycle
because that's the name of this function
and it also happens to start with a
capital letter all right so this is the
clue that gives other programmers an
idea about what this function is about
and how to call it you are supposed to
call this in a constructor mode and if
you look at this function at least the
way you're calling it over here this
seems very similar to the class-based
object initialization in Java or C++ in
Java or C++ when you say something like
this new bicycle you're essentially
looking at bicycle as a class name right
that's not the case here it is still a
function even though this line looks
misleadingly like the class-based
initialization you are still calling
just a function bicycle just happens to
be a function but functions which need
to be called as constructors in
JavaScript are by convention named in a
particular way with the capital letter
and names the function just indicating
what it is that it's constructing
remember that this is just convention it
doesn't prevent you from calling this
like any other mode and it doesn't
prevent you from calling this
as a constructor we'll see what happens
if you do either of these two things in
the next tutorial but here's a spoiler
it will not work this way I understand
why is not worked in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
