tutorials we've already seen what are
the advantages of having spring act as a
container for our beans in this tutorial
we're going to look at one more
advantage and this is something that
spring provides for us it provides us
that the callback methods for the
lifecycle of the bean you can have a
method in your bean that gets run when
the beam is being created and you can
have a method in your bean which runs
when the bean is about to be destroyed
so you can tap into these callbacks and
write your own code to initialize the
bean or to do any cleanup activities
after the bean is destroyed so we'll
have a look at that but before we do
that there's one more point that I would
like to say here we have written this
code here which initializes the
application context and we get a bean
from the application context but we
haven't actually closed the application
context here in order to close the
application context we need to use
another class which is called the
abstract application context and that
registers a shutdown hook for your Java
program so that when your main method
ends then the you know the hook is
called and then the context also shuts
down this is something you have to do
only for SC applications if you have say
a web application context or you're
integrating with an enterprise
application the spring context will know
when to end but if you are writing a
desktop application then you will have
to register this hook so since this is a
Java simple Java desktop application
I'll be registering the hook and I'll be
doing this so that we can demonstrate
the callback methods the destroy
callback methods later so all I need to
do here is I need to first change from
application context to an abstract
application context now the abstract
application context again has the same
signatures so this is something that I
inherit from context art support now
this will have the same signatures I
don't have to do any other changes here
it will still do a get bean but then
what I can do here is when I mention
izing itself I can do a context dot
there is a register shutdown hook
method for this context so I can make a
call here so that the shutdown hook is
registered and when the application ends
the spring context also knows that it's
time for it to close and destroy all the
beans so now that we have done this when
the program ends when the main ends a
destroy is called for all the beans if
we configure it that way so now we will
look at how we can configure init
methods and destroy methods on all the
beans now I have this triangle bean over
here now let's say I want to call a
method then the bean is initialized and
I want to call another method in the
penis to be destroyed so what I can do
is there are different ways in which we
can do this we look at a couple of
methods in this tutorial and then we
look at a few more in the subsequent
tutorials so let's look at in it first
in order to have a method that get
initialized when the beam is called what
I can do is I can implement an interface
called initializing being have to import
this from bean store Factory now this
interface else spring that my bean needs
to know when it's being initialized so
I'm telling spring at this bean needs to
be called a method of this bean needs to
be called when the beam is being in
chillax now initializing bean has a
method that needs to be implemented so
if I say add the unimplemented methods
you get a method called after property
set now what this is going to do is I
can write any code here and then this is
the method that spring is going to call
when it's initialized when all the
properties have been set so first of all
this implements initializing bean is a
marker for bean to know that a method of
this B needs to be called after
initialization and then what is the
method to be called this is the one this
is again provided in the interface
itself so if you can implement it you
can write any code here and this will
get executed when the bean has finished
initialization okay so now I can write
some code here I will just write a
system dot
our dot println let's say initializing
beans in it add that called or triangle
okay just a simple friend statement now
this is all that I need to do I don't
need to do anything else
so I implement initializing bean so that
spring knows that this beam has to be
when it's initialized a method of this
beam has to be coil and the method of
course is the default after property set
so I can write code here and this will
run when the when the when the beam is
initialized so let's run this we'll save
this and when I run this you can see
that the initialization method has been
called before you're getting your print
statement so this is the first piece of
code that gets executed inside this bean
similarly for capturing the destroy
phase there is another interface called
disposable bean and I'll have to import
this as well if the disposable bean
again has a method that will be called
when the beam has to be destroyed so if
you add the animal printed methods then
you can see that there is a destroy
method so if a bean implements a
disposable being interface then spring
will automatically call a destroy method
of that bean before actually destroying
the bean so here I can write any code
and that will get executed just before
the ping gets destroyed so any cleanup
code and anything like that will go
inside this method so I like in print a
simple message here just to know that
it's running so I will call this
disposable beans destroy method called
for the triangle okay let's run this
again and make sure it works fine
let us so first initializing beans init
method is called then the flow of
execution goes ahead and then we have a
disposable beans method coil so this is
happening then the application ends
because we have registered the the
sharone hook so when the main method
ends the shadow hook gets coil in spring
containers say is okay it's time to wrap
up and it's going to destroy all the
beans and then that's when the destroy
method gets called so no matter how many
beans you have in your container
whatever beans implements these
interfaces the corresponding methods are
called so you can have a bean that
implements only the disposable bean in
that case the bean needs to have only
the destroy method it doesn't need to
have this one and then this destroy
method gets called only on the
destruction of the bean and similarly
only this one gets called on in it if
you implement only the initializing B so
this is one of the ways in which we can
write in it and destroy methods the
disadvantage of this method is you are
implementing interfaces that are
specific to spring so you see here it's
from our blood spring framework beans so
these are specific to spring and you
have to modify the class now let's say
you don't want to modify the class you
don't want to write some interfaces you
know and implement interfaces that are
specific to spring you don't want to
bind your beans to spring itself then
what we can do is there is another way
to do this let me remove this so I'm not
implementing any special interfaces I'm
going to comment
this whole section ok so I'm not doing
anything specific to spring okay
laughter them for these imports as well
so what I will do is I will just write
two simple methods okay that has nothing
to do with spring itself but these are
methods that I want to run on in it end
destroy so let me call this public void
my in it okay so this is my separate
unit method which is not at all related
spring and now I will have some cold
inside this in order to do some
initialization work so I want this init
method my in it to run when the beam is
initialized so there's another way we
can do this and this is by configuring
it in the XML itself so what I do is I
go to the spring XML and in my triangle
beam definition what I'll do is I will
have in it method value and I pass the
name of the method let's save this so
what's going to happen is spring is
going to see that this init method
definition is there now this is the
method that spring is going to call for
this beam alone then beam has been
initialized so now let me run this again
so here you can see the my init method
is called for triangle so this has been
registered as an initialization method
in the spring XML so if you do this
there's really no need to you know
implement anything so this is just a
simple Pocho and I just have a method
here again this is not spring specific
while I'm doing this in my XML I am
mentioning what's the method that spring
has to run as an init method and if this
value is found by spring then for this
bean it's going to run this method upon
initialization same way I can write a
destroy method as well so whatever
method I write
okay so let me call this worried so you
have some cleanup method that needs to
be run and this is again not bound to
spring what you can do is in your spring
dot XML you can write another tag here
destroy method equals cleanup say this
okay it's you uppercase so now I have
specified an init method and the destroy
method in my spring dot XML for this
being so what's going to happen is it's
going to be the same as what we saw
earlier but instead of having an
interface of spring that's implement
here we're going to have simple methods
that are called by spring because we
have configured it to do so so let me
have another print statement here a
cleanup method called for triangle so
you have the initialization and the
destroy method that we have defined so
it's going to have the same behavior
firstly knit method is called and then
the flow of execution and then the final
cleanup method now instead of
configuring the init method and the
destroy method for every bean so let's
say that this is a common practice in
your application that initialization
methods are always called my init and
the cleanup of the destroy methods are
always called cleanup in that case you
don't have to configure this for each
and every bean what we can do is we can
configure it globally across all the
beans and what spring is going to do is
it's going to look for a method like
this if it is there it's going to call
it otherwise it's gonna ignore it so if
you have a standard where you say for
all my beans in it method is going to
have a common name and a destroyed
method is going to have a common name
that case you can configure these init
methods and destroy methods at a global
level and you don't have to configure it
for each and every bean like this so the
way to configure this at a global level
is by putting the configuration over
here there is this bean stag which
encloses all these bean definitions over
here I can have a default init method
and a default destroy method so I just
say default init method equals my init
and default destroy method equals
clean so if we do this then we don't
have to mention it add a beam level I
can remove these values and it's
configured a globally so this is going
to apply for all the beans now later if
I add my unit or a cleanup method for
these point objects that's going to call
them as well so let's run this once
again to validate well there you go the
same methods are being called now what
happens if I enable both we saw two with
two ways in which we can have this
initialization and destroy callbacks
right so one is by implementing a couple
of interfaces and have a separate set of
methods for those and then having these
methods of our own and then configuring
spring to call them now what if we have
both actually both of them get executed
we'll have a look at the order so let's
say I revert this back implements
initializing bean and the spa's little
bean now fix the import and of course
I'll have to implement the methods so
I'm gonna uncomment these two methods
and say so now we are doing both first
of all we are implementing the inter
lysing beam and the disposable bean
interfaces and providing those methods
so that spring can call them
additionally we are also implementing
two separate methods and we are
configuring spring to call them in the
XML file so now what's the order in
which they're going to run now if we run
this so here you can see first
initializing beans init method is called
then the init method that we have
configured as coil then of course the
execution flow and then the print
statements and then again when it is
closing first the disposables is called
and then our method is called so
initializing bean and disposable being
take priority those are the methods that
get called first and then after that
whatever init method and destroy method
that we configuring the spring dot XML
those get called later there is a third
way in which we can do this and that's
by using annotations we're going to look
at it a few tutorials down the line but
these methods also come in handy you can
use them in order to do initialization
and cleanup bulk for your spring beans</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
