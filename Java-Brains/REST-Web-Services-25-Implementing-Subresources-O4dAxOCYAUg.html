API if you remember
the root resource it follows the message
so it's messages / message ID / comments
so you want to look up comment ID 20
under message ID - it would be messages
/ - / comments / - it there are a couple
of ways you can implement a resource
like this and I'm going to use this
opportunity to showcase a really cool
way to write resources which is called
sub resources this is not something that
I've seen used very often but it's a
really cool way to build resources
especially when you have nested
resources like this and I'll tell you
why and it's a good thing to know let's
look at the resource first we have the
message resource and as we already know
this resource maps to slash messages so
for any comment URI
since it starts with slash messages what
we could do is add all the common DPI's
in the message resource right so since
it's slash messages /id slash comments
it starts with slash messages so since
this class handles anything starting
with slash messages I could do that over
here right so I could do something like
a get for this path slash message ID
slash comments so the whole URL would be
slash messages slash message ID slash
comments and let me add a test method
that I usually use all the time so it
just returns the hard-coded string test
right so if I were to do a get request
to messages slash some random message
slash comments it should get me test and
this works fine this ID can be anything
since we are not we are totally ignoring
the ID it could be anything and it just
calls the same method so well that's one
way to get this working we can have all
the comment API is over here but it's
not really ideal because look at the
name of this class this is message
resource you don't want to have comment
API is over here right now imagine we
have like
and shares as well so all the comment
API is all the like ups and all the
share API is are going to be in the
message resource which is not really
nice so we want to create a new resource
called comment resource and have the
comment API isn't that want to create a
new resource called like resource and
how to like API is there and so on and
then instead of having all these methods
over here with slash message ID slash
comments slash whatever there could be a
bunch of methods right so instead of
that if you could somehow tell jax-rs to
say whenever the path is slash message
ID slash comments whenever it starts the
dot don't execute an actual method over
here instead hand over the
responsibility to this other resource
that would be ideal
right you see here I've created a
comment resource which is currently
blank that's in the resource package
well turns out we can do just that and
that's the concept of a sub resource so
away the sub resource concept works is
you still have the root resource but
then you say after some point in the URL
you want to delegate the responsibility
to this other resource right so you need
to somehow had a hook from the main
resource to that other resource how
would you do this well the way to do
this is instead of you need to have a
method here and you need to have the
path annotation to the method but
instead of having the method return some
value which is sent back as a response
what you want to return is an instance
of the resource that you want to
delegate to right so in this case let's
remove the get here we want this to
happen for all methods not just forget
right because it could be a post or a
delete or whatever so when this path
matches then return comment resource not
a string
and resource and I'm just going to call
it again the name really doesn't matter
so what I want to return here is a new
instance of the resource that should
actually do the work right so I'm going
to say new common resource ok so I'm
creating a new instance of this resource
now what's going to happen is no matter
what HTTP method is accessed over here
you really notice that I've removed HTTP
method annotation so no matter what the
HTTP method is then this path matches
what Jersey is going to do is what
Jack's are is going to do is it's going
to execute this method and it's going to
see ok the return type is actually
another resource so it's going to look
for the actual method in this new
resource right so this is really cool
now we can actually add all these
different api's in this resource so
let's try that out so I'm going to add a
path over here because this is a
resource but the path here doesn't have
any value right I'm going to just do a
slash because I want the path to be
inferred from here so I'm going to
create a method here for get and I'm
going to say public string let's go
create the same test method ok but in
this case I'm calling the sub resource
over here now let's let me
change the store your sub resource so
let me know what's going on and I get
this new sub resource so that's what's
happening here
Jersey is mapping this to this method
and it sees this is a new resource now
it's going to take the remainder of the
path that it's mapped and send it to
this now the remainder of the path well
there is nothing here so it's the
remainder of the path the slash so I say
okay this handle slash which is good so
this is the route far again because this
is a get method it's going to say ok
this is the match and it's going to
execute it right so the very jaws he
handles the URL is basically adding up
the path which mapped over here to get
the comment resource plus the path to
the resource plus the path to the
methods right it's very similar to this
so here the way Jersey map's resource
you arises gets the path at the class
annotation and adds to it the clip a
that the method level annotation so in
the case of a sub resource what happens
as the class level path for the route
resource plus the method level path for
the sub resource plus the class level
path for the sub resource plus the
method level path for the sub research
so it adds them all up I don't know if
it's confusing but I hope I hope this
this flow makes sense I'm just going to
add one more over here so that this is
clear so I'm going to do a let me let me
do this I'm going to do comment slash
comment ID right now there is nothing
but let's map to that right I'm going to
do a get to path and what's the path
going to be it's going to be messages
slash message ID slash Commons / comment
ID so this is in the message resource
messages slash message ID slash comments
right so this part is already mapped now
I just need to map the comment I
I'm just going to add so this is slash
so this is fine I'm just going to add
slash comma daddy yeah okay
now I'm going to add another method here
public string this too
these are very bad names please don't do
this I'm just doing this now because I'm
lazy to type the actual names I'm just
going to return okay
read apply and let's test this so this
should work I'm going to access this URL
pattern it should return the new value
and there you go
you got the updated method right so this
is how the addition of these URLs happen
in the sub resource
the other cool thing is since this is a
delegation you get all the parameters
over here right so you have two
parameters here one is the message ID
one is the comment ID the comment ID
should be straightforward here I'm just
going to use at path Prime what we want
is the comment ID because we are mapping
it right here I'm going to say long
comment ID and I'm just going to print
that
and it should import this it should get
the common tidy proportion from the URL
and return it in the response let's
verify that and you get that now how
about the message ID let's say I change
this to two right now I want to get the
message ID how do I do that because the
message ID is mapped in the parent
resource it's not mapped over here well
the good thing is you can actually
access the parent resource path
parameter as well in the sub resource so
all I need to do is I'm just going to
copy this and use yet another path param
for message ID okay
notice that this message ID is not in
this path annotation it's actually in
the Parent Resource path annotation but
since this is the call which actually
led to this method being executed this
param is actually available to this
method as well okay so I'm going to add
this alright let's see if this works and
there you go this works so you have
access to the entire URL even though the
mapping of certain portions of the URL
happen in the parent resource so this is
the concept of the sub resource that I
wanted to talk about it's pretty
powerful this lets us have separate
api's and separate resources so that we
don't put all of them in one resource
just because the URL starts with slash
messages you can actually delegate
different resources so you can easily
imagine a message ID slash likes to just
return the like resource it creates a
new instance and Jersey is smart enough
to say hey what I've returned is the new
resource so it's going to look at that
resource to see what's the method to
execute okay so I'm not going to go over
the details of the implementation what
I'm going to do is pause this video and
flip to the implemented version
just going to walk through what I've
done for the comment resource and here
it is all done
if only I could code this fast in real
life well anyway there are a few changes
I've made the first thing is I've added
a new model called comment right it's
very similar to message just has the
standard four fields the ID the comment
message itself
I know it's called message but it's
basically the content of the comment
that creates a date of the comment and
who actually wrote the comment right in
that sense it's very similar to message
the next change I've made is the message
model contains a map of the comment ID
and the common instance right every
message has a bunch of comments so a
message instance has a map of a comment
ID to the comment instance now what I've
also done is I have marked the getter
for comments the get comments getter
I've marked it as XML transient because
I don't want the common data to show up
when the message instance is pulled up
in the API I don't want the list of all
the comments when you access a message
so you want the comment list to be
ignored when the message instance is
being converted to XML or JSON and the
way to do that is by marking it as XML
transient this marks it has you know
ignore for XML conversion but even JSON
conversions you know honor this so this
should exclude the comment list from
both XML and JSON representations that
was an exchange the change that I did
for the service I created a new comment
service which is basically getting the
same list of the map of messages but I
have equal in methods for crud right I
have get all comments which takes in a
message ID it gets the message instance
gets the comments for that message
instance converge the values into
analyst and sends it back there is a
gate comment which accepts the message
ID and the comment ID which gets the
message and then does you know for the
comment map it pulls up the write
comment based on the comment I
add comment again gets the message based
on the message ID and adds the instance
of the comment to it update comment
again gets the message and updates the
comment instance remove comment gets the
message again and then removes the
comment instance which as this ID right
so similar service it's just said
there's one extra step to get the
message first and then deal with the
comment all right now the final thing is
the comment resource which is a sub
resource that we already seen so now
what it does is it has these producers
and consumes at the very top because
it's stealing with JSON all the methods
inside it has an instant's off the
comment service it's a new instance and
now it maps all the methods like like it
typically would fire a root resource
what we are doing is we are using this
as a sub resource in the message
resource so this part gets added to
every URL that you see over here you
have get in post for the root resource
you have put for slash comment ID which
is method your slash message ID slash
comments slash comment ID over here I'm
able to get the path param are the
message ID and the comment ID I just
call the right business services over
here right so the red delete comment
calls remove comment and then the get
for a specific comment ID calls the get
comment off the comment service so I'm
not going to go into a lot of detail
here I'm going to you know share this
code so that you can explore this and
see what's going on should be fairly
straightforward the thing that you need
to take away from this tutorial is the
concept of a sub resource and I hope
that has made sense using this all you
need to do is return an instance of the
resource and map it to the path and the
path gets added right that's all you
need to know for this tutorial
alright so I hope that made sense and
I'm going to share this code in the
website so make sure you go to the
website URL and check the code out we'll
see you in the next tutorial thanks for
