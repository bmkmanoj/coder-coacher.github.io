I'm so excited to be here I got to
travel all the way from Seattle
Washington Washington to be here with
you guys today by a show of hands I
would love to know how many of you have
actually heard of Nordstrom okay great
so a lot of people actually heard of
Nordstrom how many of you have actually
done a lot of online shopping lately
all right great so today I'm really
excited to be here to talk really about
lean UX and how we've been able to
transform Nordstrom a hundred and
sixteen year old retailer to really
think forward about experiences focusing
on the customer and utilizing the
practice of lean startup lean UX
techniques to really move it forward so
just to kind of give you a little bit of
an update about myself I am really
supporting a team of about 45
individuals and the team is responsible
for the customer experience all the way
from the app to the actual store
experience as well as all the way
through any digital property that we
have in any part of Nordstrom so you may
ask Nordstrom it's a hundred and sixteen
year old retailer you say and I came in
coming from Starbucks just working on
the Starbucks app we had a small team
kind of building that experience my goal
was to really come into Nordstrom and
try to transform the opportunity that we
had in front of us with the stores
themselves being an opportunity to sort
of look at the channel specific
opportunities for customers so I'm gonna
tell you a little bit about Nordstrom
really the company itself started in
1901 and that's a long time ago
a gentleman by the name of JW n or John
W Nordstrom came with $5 in his pocket
from Sweden his goal was the American
dream and he partnered with Carl Wallen
and they really were trying to figure
out how do they break in to the industry
how do they build something that was all
about customer experience
so they partnered together and they
actually opened a shoe company right in
Seattle and it started with the promise
to ensure that customer experience was
at the very top of the focus and so lots
of years went by in the 70s the company
grew to a hundred million dollar revenue
and stores continued to grow we have 357
stores where across 40 states and were
in Canada and Puerto Rico as well so
it's continuing to grow there's lots of
momentum and just in 2016 the company
reported a 14 billion dollar revenue now
these things all sound really exciting
and good but something interesting
happened in last 10 years a lot of us
have been shopping as you guys told me
earlier today that you've been shopping
online you know about Nordstrom there's
a lot of great places to shop right now
there's a lot of e-commerce experiences
there's a lot of Technology that's
enabling things that have never been
there before
so think about this I walk into a
hundred and sixteen year old retailer
wanting to build new practices with lean
but they've never done it before and the
transformation of retail is real I live
it every single day I wake up in the
morning I look at the news I try and see
what is happening with our customers
what is happening in the market and
what's happening with technology but
just as Michael said in his previous
talk a lot of what we do when we start
these processes and programs is to try
to get sponsorship so one of the things
that I'm gonna focus on today is a
little bit about how do you actually get
sponsorship in companies that are this
large and enterprise focused so I want
to talk to you about the agenda just to
give you a full overview I thought
Michael did a great job talking about a
lot of the practices and the processes
but we at Nordstrom my goal is actually
to consistently connect with a customer
to find ways in our experience to make
sure that we're solving customer
problems and that's really what my job
is every single day I want to tell you a
little story that actually got me
excited when I joined Nordstrom and it
really talks to me about why user
experience and the customer focus
and solving customer problems really
comes together so picture Alaska maybe
50 years ago a gentleman comes in with
two tires into a Nordstrom store puts
the tires on the table and he says I
want to return these the customer
service person the salesperson says
absolutely he reaches out gives him some
money and says thank you what does that
mean what does that mean right in that
moment it means that the customer came
in with a problem what had happened is
there used to be an automotive store
right where that particular Nordstrom
was the customer felt frustrated and
said you know I have these tires the
store existed before now it's a
Nordstrom that's story that like actual
piece has been the focus or the heart of
the company for so many years and so a
lot of people ask me what is the main
goal when you're working at Nordstrom
and my main goal is to serve the
customer where he or she is at at every
single moment I don't think about the
customer in one channel I think about he
or she in all channels and I have to
think about the loyalty of that customer
as well and using lean UX using those
principles that Michael spoke about
prototyping sketching being able to
interact with your customer consistently
these are the ways you can actually
focus on the customer day to day so
really quickly we went through a little
bit of the history I'm gonna talk a
little bit about UX design and what it
means to me and me at Nordstrom I've run
design teams for a long time for about
15 20 years and in a large enterprise
fortune 250 company you really need to
make sure that you're adding value every
single day when you're working in a
discipline that doesn't necessarily have
you know clarity I've been working in
this field specifically UX design for
about 10 years and at a company that's a
hundred and sixteen years old it's
important to try and talk to your
leadership about what it is and the
value that you bring not only for the
customer but also from a revenue
perspective how are you utilizing
technique
that can bring in revenue delight and
surprise a customer at the same time the
other aspect is really what is lien and
why do we use it and why I bring that up
is there's a lot of great principles
there's so many things that you can
learn about we've taken a toolkit of
things that have worked for us and I
want to talk to you a little bit about
the things that have worked and some
challenges we faced as well and then how
do you as a leader as a manager as a
developer just as an individual bring
this home when you go back to where
you're at and then we'll do some Q&amp;amp;A I
talked a little bit about these two
entrepreneurs that really came from
different upbringings and created
something quite amazing the thing that's
happening right now for us is you know
we've got these stores and there are
great footprints there's merchandise
there's beauty there's fashion Nordstrom
being a fashion retailer bringing in
merchandise at every given point we have
a lot of people focus in that energy and
then we have an entire organization
technology and UX and business that's
about transcending how are we going to
connect with the new customer how are
you going to make sure that the
Millennial the gen Z is understanding
and connected to our brand and to be
completely clear how are we solving at
every given point a customer problem so
we're really talking about a set of an
omni-channel experience and what I mean
by omni-channel is we know that when a
customer shops in one channel he or she
shops in another Channel it's just that
simple we have data that supports that
and we understand that a journey starts
from one place and can go back and forth
to other places how many people have
ever shopped online and then come back
to your mobile device and then maybe go
on into a store in particular if you
guys ever done that you know some of you
all of you okay great we as customers
are completely focused on ensuring that
our experience can transcend every part
of a brand's experience we expect that
when we walk into a store if we've given
our information that company knows who
we are we expect when we go on our app
that that company recognizes us and
gives us loyalty to you to them
and then we also know for a fact that
when we transact regularly we expect
things to happen for us that's uniquely
different than if we shop somewhere else
so these are the kinds of things my team
is laser focused on and how do we win on
top of all the other e-commerce places
that are out there and you guys know
that there's several of them that we're
competing with so this is just an
example of where my team spends a lot of
time on the web as well as the mobile
app but certainly in the stores and
that's an interesting conundrum because
if you think about it a customer if they
do have a store nearby they have the
opportunity to go in and connect with a
salesperson that's another whole
paradigm that we have to shift to
because 116 years guys that's a long
time for selling clothes in a store but
now people are continuously moving to
the e-commerce engine so we have 20% of
our revenue is coming from e-commerce
where I'd say thirty years ago that ops
obviously was not the case so my team's
job is to try to find fast efficient
quick ways to test it iterate and
experiment to get to our customers
sooner and faster so before I go into
this slide I want to kind of let you
guys know that when I came into
Nordstrom 3 years ago one of the reasons
I was excited was totally that tire
story I mean let's be honest that's a
great story but also because I had the
opportunity back in the day to work in
the store when I was 15 and I was a
pretty young girl and I got a chance to
understand the business understand what
was going on but ultimately the
challenge for Nordstrom right now is
really to figure out how to become user
centered in a new way so what is UX I
think you know UX is really solving
customer problems to really create these
seamless interactions these delightful
experiences the ability for a customer
to feel like you know them as a brand to
feel like they're getting something from
you as a result of participating in this
exchange and the majority of the time
that we spent at Nordstrom is describing
this exact slide so I will admit just as
Michael said in the earlier talk
sponsorship is crucial for Lean Startup
to actually function and work so I
started as a senior manager
Nordstrom and nobody really knew what UX
was they walked around saying okay we
know you design stuff we know you kind
of you know make technology go a little
bit slower and faster and you've got
some research whatever but they didn't
understand it so my first step was to
work with my team to go to our
leadership and actually knock on the
door Eric Pete Blake Nordstrom and say
let us talk to you about the New Age and
what we're trying to do with technology
and experience and we brought them into
our process we had them co-create with
us and they were open to it because
again a hundred and sixteen year old
company that's going through massive
change is open to people coming in and
bringing that change to them so I want
to just emphasize the fact that the
openness to the culture change
absolutely coming from the top and you
take several different angles you start
by bringing them into the experiences
around customers so we have a couple of
labs usability labs that we call them
where our customers come in and we do
paper prototypes so we sketch things out
and we actually have the prototypes
available for our customers to use and
we invited our leadership in to watch
our customers go through that process
those tactics just as Michael said
really balance out the question of you
know what is it that we're doing for our
customer so that's an important factor
the other part is if leadership is not
open to that one of the things you can
do is try to knit it back to the results
so how are you efficiently using these
processes to actually make a result
faster than you would before at
Nordstrom when I came in and this is
really exciting because going to the
other tracks over there I'm hearing
about these innovative development
techniques that I'm excited we could
potentially use now Nordstrom but three
years ago our entire stack was very very
old outdated and they call it spaghetti
code and we're working through that so
we had these monolithic huge feature
cycles that took several months and we
couldn't utilize these principles but we
walked in and we said we need to
modernize that stack so we can actually
start utilizing the iterative flow of
technology and UX together so those are
two things that actually helped push
forward this
formation at Nordstrom and I want to
make sure you guys know that we're still
learning we're still growing there's so
much opportunity for us to continue on
that path so like I said before a lot of
our leadership and others sometimes
people say do you are you an artist
- do you draw things I get that but I
don't understand kind of what do you
mean by UX and for those of you who know
or don't know really it's it's a process
it's about understanding the customer
pain points it's about utilizing
iteration and prototyping and connecting
with the customer all throughout that
journey and absolutely it's about having
that artistic expression the brand
expression but it's a combination of it
all coming together and the one thing I
want to say about user experience is so
closely tied to technology in
development there has never been a time
where I haven't felt so connected to my
developer when they come up with an
interaction model or an experience that
actually enhances the customer
experience even more so it's it's this
dance between development design and
product management and it's a process
not an art so a Nordstrom you know we
really have a brand that's been
sustained for a long time and we also
have products that really shine from an
experience standpoint we also know that
we have to understand just generally
what's happening in the industry in the
market with our customers so we do have
a group of individuals that go out and
pull insights these are things that you
know generally you can find at any point
if you connect with a market research
organization but we really use it to
help define some of our experiences and
so values around the brand around what
does the brand really mean it means
inclusion it means connection it means
fashion how do we bring that into our
experience when we're talking about user
experience interests so what is what's
hot right now what kind of experience
can we shine a light on that's going to
be uniquely different and a
differentiator to our competition we're
always thinking about that user
experience as well and then from an
insight standpoint it's so crucial for
us to continue to understand the market
the trends that are happening not only
from fashion but technology what are
people using what is the next social
media that we need to get connected to
what is the next thinking that
we're not aware of right now from our
Jen's ears what are we doing that we
need to push ourselves further and then
understanding the whole market landscape
so these are things that we also include
in our study too so Michael did a great
job of talking about the process one of
the things that I wanted to kind of show
in this diagram is really that it's a
continuous sort of evolutionary loop
like an infinite loop if you will and it
really does start for us with research
so I had the opportunity to come in at
Nordstrom sort of halfway through the
research teams beginning and what I mean
by that is we have a team of researchers
that actually take customers in and
utilize prototypes paper functional
developed prototypes and actually ask
them questions based on these
experiences and that has helped us
really seal the deal with our
development teams because way up in the
funnel when you're actually showing a
paper prototype or something that's not
fully developed you're saving the
company's time you're saving the
company's money and you're saving your
development teams time as well and
you're learning and iterating all along
the way so we're lucky because I put two
labs usability labs right near our
executives so that way every time they
kind of walk by they see customers
coming in and they see these focus
groups looking at these experiences and
it gives you an indication of this
cultural shift that we're actually
asking our customers to co-create with
us sketching you know I think a lot of
us think that when you start with a
design you really start with a
full-fledged high fidelity kind of
experience I really encourage just like
Michael does the ability to sketch to
prototype in a very low fidelity format
it has helped me save probably millions
of dollars for several companies and it
also gets other people to understand
that it's an interaction it's not about
the design at the end that's one part of
it and then testing and then launching I
think I'll go deeper into these areas
particularly from an e-commerce
perspective we've just now started doing
some very simple tests that have helped
us move quicker and then we know that
when we launch we're never done it's a
circle cycle that goes all the way back
and at any point our customers voting
with their clicks voting with their
experience and we listen to that and
watch it and that's one of our biggest
challenges to continue to do as we grow
and change alright so how many have ever
had a hamburger and fries okay or a
steak I know I know I've been there I
have two kids there they're five and
seven they're super impatient I don't I
think they're like generation glass
they're the ones that literally came out
of the womb with the screen in front of
them so we sit down and we have we have
lunch and there's these two bottles of
ketchup
right so the glass one where you're
trying to open it even like that the
tops really tough to open you turn it
over and you're just hitting it back and
forth you know I know that the slogan is
you know wait for the something about
you know waiting is a good thing but we
know a fact that our customers in
general don't want to wait so Heinz did
a very interesting thing they obviously
change the bottle format they made a
more functional they increase the size
of the design the logo changed there's
so many things that they have done in
this model that it even impacted their
brand right so the good things come to
those who wait but now it's actually
let's meet our customers where they are
their fries are hot their burgers hot
they need to get that ketchup out as
soon as possible so this is another
example of what UX does a hundred
percent it's the design of this bottle
for sure but it's the functionality it's
the ability to use it and that's what
software is all about and if you guys
can guess it starts with a customer
problem the customer could not get the
ketchup out of the bottle fast enough
so clearly Heinz made a choice to move
it forward so I kind of illustrate that
it's kind of a fun example but really
when you're thinking about user
experience and technology melding
together it's about having the customer
in mind at every point I love to call
this slide really the three legged stool
for those of us who work in an
enterprise organization and have the
opportunity to have product and user
experience and Technology together one
of the things that I love about the talk
Michael gave is these teams that kind of
come together as one and you're hearing
themes about that a lot today in the
conference and I can't emphasize that
enough when you have your product user
experience and Technology team together
really as this three-legged stool you
have this opportunity to bring forward
such great innovation and ideation also
as a UX designer or a UX researcher
you're constantly bringing a customer to
the forefront at every given point and
your product team member is consistently
trying to figure out how the business
metrics are gonna make sense and of
course your technologist is making
everything work beautifully and ensure
that you're building it for performant
experiences so this is how we work at
Nordstrom we co-locate we spend a lot of
time together with our product teams
with our technologists and it's really
important because it helps us push
forward on the lean experience and
tracks I can't emphasize this enough I
think I think we know that UX is
everywhere everything you touch
everything you feel that's actually
functional and useful has had some
thought put into it and it's important
to recognize that when you're trying to
make a point with a leader you're trying
to figure out which process to use but
it really is about functionality and
making sure that your brand can shine
with that functionality so why lean you
know I I think that we've had a chance
at Nordstrom to experience some
opportunities for this working and some
opportunities where we we need to go
back to the drawing board I talked to
you guys a lot about you know the
classic style of UX at Nordstrom which
is this you know massive awesome product
it's this huge vision that takes six to
nine months to get done super
predictable yes we're gonna ship it on
the hop of these dates and times super
slow there is no way we are gonna make
it if we're this slow there is
absolutely no way and that's my job is
to come in and say we need to go fast we
need to make sure that our teams are
equipped with the right tools to make it
happen so we can shift to lean UX and I
thought Michael did a great job of
describing why and the reasons beyond it
behind it and to me you know this most
viable product it's it's a great notion
of trying to figure out the right key
features to put into test quickly and
he's not wrong that is not easy to do
because absolutely every product manager
every leader wants to just pummel and
put more things into that first MVP and
it's the job of the product and UX team
and researchers to really try and make
sure that you focus on what the customer
needs at that moment and there you're
actually creating that software in that
way it is less predictable and that's
challenging
big company because we like to know
dates and we like to know how much money
we're spending on everything and so that
takes the ability of leadership sitting
down with them talking through this
process and actually describing why this
is actually faster and that's one of the
things that we continue to do on an
ongoing basis and that's one one of my
jobs the the less predictability and the
fast speed kind of help because it's a
good dialogue like we're gonna get
something out faster we may not know
exactly the date but it'll be between
these time periods and we're gonna do it
when our customers vote and say that
it's the right experience so that's sort
of like letting go if you if you will
for a company that's been very sort of
programmatic
and making sure that everything is on a
schedule and list so we know that the
hyper speed of technology is just is
going bonkers where we're all
experiencing ourselves and it's why
we're all here but a company like
Nordstrom it's one of the things that we
continue to try to iterate with our
leadership and really the other aspect
of making sure that we continue to bring
our customers through the journey it is
not about showing them at the beginning
showing them at the end it's literally
having them with you along the whole
path helping to co-create the experience
along the way and then really the idea
about creating these monolithic big huge
feature sets where you're gonna end up
with something the customer doesn't even
want we are trying to avoid that like
the plague and it's actually proven to
be very helpful because most of the time
when you have an MVP and you have a
hypotheses
I mean 90% of the time I'm wrong which
is I love to be wrong I love to fail my
hypotheses all the time it's a lot
cheaper to do that with a with a very
small group of features that you focus
on versus a huge monolithic experience
so I'm a big fan of Eric's he's
obviously an entrepreneur that has done
some amazing work and again really talks
a lot about Lean Startup the only way to
win is to learn faster than anyone else
I don't think any of us you know a lot
of us have like a lot of assumptions
about what's gonna happen in the future
of retail I read probably every magazine
every particular site and there's a lot
going on around technology all the
different aspects of what we could do
but the one thing that I will say that
we
continue to push is speed speed matters
and it matters in a way that we can't
really quantify right now because we're
already late and so getting ahead of
speed is one of our biggest challenges
at nordstrom which is why I love her in
heels on a skateboard it always makes
sense to me okay so the road to product
when I was at Nordstrom and I first
started about a year and a half in we
had this opportunity during holiday time
I don't know how many guys spent a lot
of money on e-commerce during holiday a
little bit okay few of us yeah get
online you start shopping and we have
this idea and no one had any funding no
one had it on the roadmap but it was
something our customers were asking us
for and we called it our first MVP and
it was about the ability to e gift each
other so if I wanted to send a gift to a
friend the only way to do that is with
it with an actual gift card right now at
Nordstrom er back last year and so we
wanted to create an experience where you
could actually choose the item and send
it to a friend so we created this model
we had four people in the group a
technologist a product person a UX
person and then an analytics individual
and we set them off and we said you have
two and a half months to figure this out
and it was an experiment right we didn't
know if we're going to launch it we
didn't know it was going to happen but
we allowed them to have the research
team at their will so they built paper
prototypes that was the first thing they
did they got it in front of usability
and every single assumption that they
had was wrong and so they had to
continue to go back to the drawing board
where by the end about two weeks in they
were able to partner with the
technologist to build an MVP which was
the most viable product at that time and
the e gifting experience actually
garnered a lot of revenue for the
holiday period it wasn't on the roadmap
nobody had put it on there but it came
from an assumption and a set of
hypothesis that we had about our
customers and so why I tell you that
story is that you don't necessarily know
where these ideas come from but it's
important to embrace them when they come
from the customer put a team behind it
and try to test that hypotheses the
beautiful thing about that team that I
was excited about is they had this sense
of entrepreneur
shit they had this innovative energy and
then it sparked a light because you know
did did that experience garner like the
amount of revenue that we had hoped
maybe maybe not but what it did is it
changed the culture it actually changed
the culture of that team and they got
excited they said wow we can actually
ship software pretty darn fast if we
want to we could do it in like quicker
than we've ever done it so that ignited
a bunch of different things that started
happening within the organization where
leaders started seeing if you actually
put small nimble teams together you give
them some free rein you can actually
ship quickly and it's only the things
most viable to the customer that makes
sense so we've we've seen a lot of these
MVPs happen sort of under under the
radar and companies like Airbnb virgin
have all done these things for a long
time and what I love about these stories
a lot of them are similar where you
didn't really know what you're gonna get
but they started with something that was
very focused on the customer so Airbnb
started as you guys all might know with
the two founders really not having
enough money to start their own company
and they rented out their San Francisco
loft and then started realizing when
they posted pictures and got people into
it for a design conference people are
interested and it was like their little
MVP was sort of a concierge MV MVP and
that gave them an indication an insight
that said this is something really
important and they went for it
Dropbox created a video that actually
talked about what Dropbox is the
interests increased and people started
signing up zappos.com is a shoe
ecommerce shoe company and they
similarly started taking pictures of
shoes posting it on a website and then
shipping the shoes to customers in a
really quick manner and then they are
now all I'd say billion-dollar if not a
billion dollar businesses and so what
I'm what I'm trying to emphasize is that
big companies that started small already
have this in them right Virgen had one
plane that went from one location to
another and now they have a fleet but
large companies can do this as well as
long as you have a team that can start
building the culture utilizing these the
MVP experiences to showcase that so I'm
switching over to learn and
why I love this slide it really talks a
lot about the opportunity to spend time
with your customer there is user
research
there's user personas experience
journeys and I think Michael you had a
lot of great things around prototyping
and deeper studies in this and then the
fourth one is around hypotheses which
that is the area that I'd say the
refinement from the Nordstrom
perspective at least on my team is
something we're working through so like
I talked about I support a team of
researchers and really it's about
getting our customers into our labs or
in the store or in their environment so
we can ask them questions about
experiences that we are building before
we actually design them and so we have
just just as you can imagine customers
coming in from all walks of life all of
our inclusive personas are part of that
and we really want to utilize their
information and their data to make sure
we're building not only the right thing
but we're on the right track from an
indication standpoint so we use
interviews we use focus groups we put
paper prototypes real prototypes in
front of them and then we validate we
sit we say is this really the right
direction for the experience so I think
what I really want to say is you know if
you can imagine being at 116 year old
company a lot of the leadership
sometimes thinks they know the customer
really well and they and some of us
build unfortunately for the customer
that's ourselves so if I'm creating a
website you know I like to shop I love
it you know my sister loves to shop we
all do so I'm starting to build
something and the challenge with that is
you don't have a separation from
yourself and the software and so crucial
is having user personas and so this is a
task that I put in front of our team and
said no longer will we talk about these
experiences in our own words they will
be in the words of the user and so we
actually went out and did a study with
market research and we defined who our
customers are we tried to put together a
set of actual personas and we did and we
showcased them around the whole company
and our goal was to make sure that our
product teams our business teams and our
leadership you
realized the actual personas instead of
themselves that in itself helps you
define experiences that are uniquely
different that you would have never
thought of and it also allows the
leadership to realize wow the customer
is continuously changing so that's a big
unlock that we were able to kind of jump
into and then experience journeys like I
spoke about before our customers are
experiencing the Nordstrom brand or
e-commerce in different ways they're
coming into the store they're using
their app there's so many different ways
and you don't shop the same way you
shopped on Friday that you shop on
Tuesday it's completely different and so
our job is to make sure that we don't
think of every single experience as the
same every time it's a set of
experiences so you come to an e-commerce
site you want to just play around and
discover for a while or you're coming
there and you want to transact that's
all you're gonna do on a Sunday night
let's say right before Christmas you're
there to pick up a set of things and put
it in your wish list and get it done or
you're there to be inspired now that
could be one customer so that's our
challenge is to continue to talk through
from that omni-channel experience where
our customers mindset is the empathy
making sure that we get that through and
using the personas to help drive that
journey so when I spoke about hypotheses
you know this is a scientific term that
we like to use especially at Nordstrom
because the hypotheses is really there
to test our assumption and a lot of
times you have a hypotheses that you
want to test you don't necessarily know
how to test it and the challenge is
being able to describe the experience to
the customer to make that happen so what
we try to do is we really try to define
our test case scenario of what we're
trying to test every single time so in
the e gifting experience is being able
to create a very seamless way for
customers to gift to each other and that
it's done over ecommerce and that was
the key thing how do we test that how do
we iterate on it and the interesting
thing is you put it in front of
customers once and your hypotheses could
be adjusted and changed because of the
result that they bring you and you
continue that cycle kind of going
through
so what what I also want to talk a
little bit about is you know the phases
of design that we go through and in
particular to Nordstrom one of the
things that I've been excited about is
bringing on team members that can do
sort of full stack design if you will so
they can do all the way from sort of
interaction or information architecture
all the way through the visual design
piece it allows for speed it also allows
for development and designed kind of
move faster and it gives us a chance to
sort of push forward on different
experiences whether it be mobile whether
it be desktop whether it be other kinds
of virtual reality and aspects of that
so I'm sure a lot of you've heard about
interaction design and the need for it
but it really is about following the
customer through a set of flows and this
is an aspect that I think is really
important when you're thinking about
lean because again it's it's not getting
to the high fidelity it could literally
be a sketch of all of the flows of
customers going through a wireframe that
you can jot down so you can put it in
front of customers that actually saves
you a lot of time I will admit I've made
the mistake several times of having a
very high fidelity experience ready for
a customer to test and they don't
understand the structure of it they
don't understand why it's even in front
of them and so if you start with a
sketch it's start with interaction
you're able to sort of see the flow and
allow your customers to vote so we are a
pretty visual company I mean it is a bit
as a brand it's a fashion destination
and so we need to have that marriage
right between interaction between
information architecture and the visual
piece of it and the challenge that I
face on a daily basis is the software
has to be performant too it can't just
slow down the customer and that's sort
of the difference between a graphic
designer and user experience I'm always
trying to think about how do we make
sure our customer is never feeling like
things are going slow but it's beautiful
and delightful and so that's my
challenge is being able to have an
experience and and that serves the
customer also in the delightful way but
in a performant way so they can get
their job done or the task done that's
at hand
so testing um can I get a time check
we're good 15 okay so so testing has
been an interesting part of Nordstrom
you can imagine you know with those
monolithic like six-month periods of
times when we didn't ship software
differently we didn't do a ton of
testing and the testing would always
sort of be outdated right you get a
little bit of information and then all
of a sudden everything changes
technology is different now we have an
opportunity to really use a be testing
sort of on steroids because we have all
of these opportunities to pull in new
feature sets new experiences into our
software the challenge though is that
it's a new muscle I mean a lot of us
have that come from the outside
understand it but it's really being able
to educate our organization on what the
value of that is and what it means to
really do it right and so as a team as a
group we actually have to sit down and
talk about the test what the purpose is
and really an a/b test having a control
experience and then having something
that changes in it which is the B and
sort of measuring against each other so
if you're changing something in the
checkout flow and you leave the other
you know experiment the same how does it
adjust and change and what we're
learning is that we need to get to
statistical significance we need to
learn about what the customer is drawn
to and we also recognize that small
changes mean big wins and also big
challenges so we are learning just as we
go and that's that iterative process
where you've already gone through all
the usability testing you've brought the
customer in to co-create and now you're
shipping software so we typically take a
small percentage of a new feature change
and we show it to our customers and we
measure it against the control and we
can do ABCs we can do a lot of different
testing and so this is the world we're
living in now I know a lot of other
ecommerce sites have been doing this for
a long time but it's now moving that 116
year old
Titanic into really okay we're shaping
we're changing we're actually adjusting
to the customer as he or she is voting
usability testing as I spoke about you
know that's space in general a lot of
people say well I don't have the the
funds to build a team out for usability
I'm not able to get labs where I work
I'm going to start
and I think to to Michael's point if you
guys had a chance to hear his
presentation you know there's a lot of
ways to get customer data there's
there's so many different ways and
structures to do it just do it because I
don't know how many times technologists
and UX folks have built experiences that
don't have the customer problem in mind
and they end up not serving the need and
then they have to go back to the drawing
board and it makes it really challenging
not only from a business perspective but
also for them from a cultural
perspective and then analytics I think
this this sort of marriage of these
three aspects is something that we're
trying to bridge together it's it's a
challenge because we've been siloed for
a while but it is important to say all
up testing how can we utilize that to
really unlock things so clickstream
analysis what are people actually
tapping on what are the experiences that
are getting the most traffic all of that
matters and how we develop our
experience from a lean perspective so
this is a bit of a case study and it
describes a little bit of the the real
reality of where we're at and some of
the challenges that we face with
utilizing some of the principles around
lean so this was about would see in May
and even in sort of the January time for
him this year we had this idea that our
customers brought to us and they brought
it to us in a very real way several
different times in a lot of different
studies and shopping is pretty it's
pretty personal it's something that
matters it's not a task where you know
exactly what you want every time there's
there is that but a lot of times you
want to know what from an outfit
perspective goes together so if I have
this dress how do I know what other
pieces are gonna go along with it and so
that was born this idea of dynamic looks
and so what we did and I'll tell you the
story about it and I'll show you a
little bit of this video and you can
find it on our mobile web experience
actually but it came with it was an
assumption and then it became a
hypotheses that customers really do want
help understanding how to outfit
themselves they they want to know other
products they're interested in discovery
but it has to be relevant to them at
that time so we decided we would take a
team a small group again
product UX and technologists and we said
let's go after this idea now they had
several opportunities to bail and not
have this happen and I want to make that
really clear like it's actually pretty
hard in a large organization to
implement this lean practice unless you
have sponsorship so myself and my
colleague and the leadership we all got
together and we said we need to give
this team room to be able to experiment
this experiment could fail and actually
we should allow it to that's the beauty
of utilizing lean so once we got kind of
the air cover gone and the e gifting
thing that happened six months ago we
have this culture okay let's go do it so
the first step was we were going to
start measuring this get this in front
of customers and we realized really
quickly that outfitting is actually
pretty complicated it's it's not
something that makes sense to people
that haven't worked in the fashion
industry how do we pull in machine
learning all of those things we didn't
have any of those capability but what we
did have is people because Nordstrom is
a company about our people and in the
stores you go in and they can
merchandise things right away for you
like this dress goes with these shoes in
this jacket as well so we thought well
we don't have all the capabilities from
a machine learning perspective but how
about we take a couple of merchandisers
and have them put together a set of
outfits and then continue that cycle and
so that was an idea that came from the
product manager because he thought of
how to do this in a really quick
efficient way and so we got sixteen
hundred outfits created with all these
different permutations and were all
manual and that was a new experience
we'd hope to do it machine learning we
couldn't do it in time so that was one
piece the other part of it is our
software team our team at developers
wasn't able to put this into their
roadmap at the time and that was a
challenge because our technology
resources are constrained and we're big
enterprise we're trying to do all sorts
of things so we actually had to find a
new way to develop this and gets put
right into the software experience at a
point where was a bit risky but we
talked to our leadership and said this
is going to be an unlock for us let's
start testing this so we went through
all the cycles of usability we started
with a sketch we had our customers of
vote we learned a lot through that
process and we finally came up with this
concept where
you're able to go to a product page
scroll down and you can see the
different items that go along with that
particular dress so I'm just gonna play
this there's no audio let's see if I can
get this to work so you're shopping and
you see this dress and you see all these
things that go along with it
and you can see the touch target for the
mobile experience is really important we
tested all those aspects of it this
clutch you know is now part of this
experience and that shuffle at the top
which is really helping us say what
other looks go along with this we
realized our customers in talking and
usability also working with them after
the fact really were interested in ways
to understand the whole outfit as a
whole none of those things we would have
known if we hadn't done early on
usability testing and also this would
never have really gone out there if we
didn't have a very small MVP that we
focused on at the time so why I bring
this up is in in the real cases it
actually takes a lot of courage and it
takes a lot of ability to kind of look
beyond the day-to-day of the practice it
takes a culture shift it takes your
leadership being open to this
opportunity because you're going through
incredible change and it takes a small
group of people to prove it throughout
the journey so we have several examples
of this working and some several
examples of us failing with it as well
and we don't really have time for
failure but we have to be open to it and
so as a company we're now really talking
about we need to fail fast we need to
innovate we need to make sure that we
test iterate and optimize and so it
takes again it's this marriage between
leadership the team and the whole
company going through this process and
we by no means are there yet we have a
lot of room to grow but it's definitely
possible to bring these things home so
from from a development standpoint
because I'm so passionate about making
sure this makes sense from a developer
standpoint to is it's really important
from from that perspective to have
developers participate in this
and we bring our developers five minutes
okay we have our developers part of
every aspect of this from all the way up
front usability sketching developers can
have a lot of fun sketching with us but
also bringing products to life right
that's the key thing to have them be
part of that and we I consider them my
comrades throughout the whole journey
and then the other aspect is from a
developer perspective a lot of code that
you write or that's written I mean that
takes time takes energy takes money and
we want to make sure that before we ask
a developer to build anything
it's data-driven this is going to be a
factor that's going to help the customer
in this way and so it's crucial for us
to do that with our development team and
then lastly making sure that we help
them either attend usability sessions or
bring customers in to look at their
software and that really can help drive
the engagement forward so to end I just
want to say that I think lean UX has
been an incredible unlock for Nordstrom
it takes all of the aspects of the
organization to be open to it but it
definitely is a possibility to really
make things go fast and really change
one hundred and sixteen year old
retailer to be in the new century and
I'm super excited about it so thank you
very much
thank you very much mm-hmm sorry a few
questions through the app here one is
how long did it take to convince
leadership to become sponsors yeah
that's a great question so what I would
say is that it didn't take long for them
to understand what the practice is
because it's it's a it's a great
opportunity to show them I think showing
storyboards start showing designs
showing that aspect of things really
help showing software and how its
developed is that the first thing it
took us probably about six months to
really get them to see this as an unlock
and then the second level of six months
after that was when they saw us as a
strategic influencer but we had to prove
ourselves so it's all about being able
to story tell and talk about what
exactly could be helpful and then it's
about results ultimately business
results
yeah it's about six to nine months I'd
say which I mean I think other companies
probably their ability may be shorter or
longer but that doesn't mean that we
weren't able to do all this stuff it was
about getting them to a point where they
could speak about UX and lean the way
that I speak about it and now that's
that was my goal and that's where we're
at now
have you explored design Sprint's at
Nordstrom and what were your experience
design Sprint's so those five five
things
yeah so we you know it's a great
question I think we do have we've done
them before and they've been extremely
valuable for us because they allow us to
sort of focus and direct it so some of
those MVPs that I talked about we did
design sprints for that because we
didn't have time and so that's how we
were able to like optimize a number of
people and the amount of time to
actually get a potential MVP out there
so we do it quite often we don't do it
on like actual experiences that have
mostly we do it on areas where we don't
have a lot of information and we need to
gather it really quickly so the e
gifting example and also dynamic looks
cool one last question
what would be the next step after paper
prototyping is it wire framing or
development you know it really depends
and I think there's a lot there's a
process for for everything that goes
through
from an academic standpoint that I think
is really important to follow as low
fidelity as you can stay until you know
for sure that the concept is worth
moving forward is my suggestion for us
we I mean there are times when and I'm
still working through this as like I
said this is not a perfect science some
of my team will start with a higher
fidelity prototype and we end up losing
time and energy and we have to prove
that out so my suggestion would be you
know as quickly as you can get from a
sketch to a wireframe to an interaction
design and there's a lot of prototyping
tools that are really quick and dirty
that you can invest in for your teams
and that has been an unlock for us so
we've in the last six to nine months
invested in a bunch of new tools that
make us a lot faster which isn't a
developed piece of code that's that's
really where you want to be pretty sure
at the end pregnant thank you thank you
so much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
