being here this is a talk on Kotlin it's
a it's a very introductory talk how many
of you here have heard of cotton used
cotton okay so hopefully when you leave
everyone uses cotton just go back and
take boss we're going to rewrite
everything in cotton why cuz it's
awesome there you go that's the best
reason to rewrite something because it's
awesome
I'm joking by the way anyway
Colleen give you some background it was
started by us in 2010 us being JetBrains
back then we used to walk back then we
still if you've heard of JetBrains we
make developer tools and we've got two
sides of the business one side is mostly
Java and all of the IDE are built with
Java and the other side is net and the
Java stuff is all using Java so it make
tools for all different types of
technologies and languages etc but we're
still using mostly Java to write it and
we needed a language we need language it
was a little bit more concise than what
we had we need a language that was a
little bit more expressive toolable and
interoperable with all of the support
and source code that we had which back
then was ten years of source code right
right now jetbrains at 17 years old so
we we have a lot of legacy code and we
want the language that was pragmatic now
at the time we looked at multiple
languages we discarded them for
different reasons some of the things
you'll see are probably very similar to
Scala and you'll ask me why didn't you
just go with Scala Scala is not a
language that is easily toolable we know
because we created tools for it and it's
not a language and at the time it wasn't
very fast now it's a little bit faster
but it wasn't very fast then and also
Scala is a very powerful language in
that it allows you to do absolutely
anything you want pretty much we thought
that that could backfire at some point
so we eventually decided to create our
own language so first and foremost Colin
was born out of need
pretty much like all of the tools at
your brains it's been developed under
Apache 2 license on github ever since
what is Kotlin it's a static language I
always forget to mention that it targets
the JVM JavaScript and we recently
announced also native so native is
already the first demo technology
preview is already available you can
download it I got it running on a
Raspberry Pi which is quite nice without
any of the JVM or anything and it works
quite nicely current state it was
released in February 15 2016 1 point 1
was released this year that was a 1.0 we
have right now that slide is outdated in
fact this is this is called goto is a
very agile conference right there you go
so next time I won't forget we've got
40-plus developers working on college
that makes it the second largest team at
JetBrains
right Jeff brains were around seven
hundred plus people 40 38 35 or so our
IntelliJ IDEA Kotlin or no IntelliJ core
and then the other ones and Colin is
kind of like the second largest team
right now at Jerry's right so we have a
lot invested in in Colin over 100
committees it's used in more than 10
products now at JetBrains
any new product that we create
essentially is using Colin even our new
dotnet ibe
is written in Colin Java and.net who
would've thought and I don't like name
dropping unless it really benefits us so
I will and so there's some external
companies that are using Kotlin as well
such as Expedia NBC News Digital Netflix
Amex and a few more ok those are just
some of them right where can you use it
so anywhere essentially Colin was you
know we create desktop tools and servers
so we created Colin to be able to create
desktop tools and servers but you can
use it on any platform Android it's
compatible with Java 6 so you can use it
and it had a lot of uptick in the
Android platform because of some of the
new language features that it brought
that Java 8 has brought to the JVM but
still struggling on some aspects to
bring to Android given that it's very
similar to Java C sharp JavaScript
groovy and pretty much put every
language out there except brain F
whatever
it gives you a good ramp up time so the
idea wasn't to completely move away from
what you know but kind of use some of
the knowledge that you know to be
familiar with the language so I can
promise you that if you know Java C
sharp JavaScript Scala groovy all of
these you'll pick up Kotlin in no time
but that's on purpose and
interoperability a big thing for us we
wanted a language that was interoperable
with all of the codebase because we just
you know this isn't Silicon Valley you
can just shut down for six months and
rewrite in JavaScript we needed to
interrupt with all of the source code
that we have so we play a big part in
terms of making sure that everything is
interoperable how can you use it very
very open right we make developer tools
obviously we want you to use our tools
but Kotlin is extremely open you can use
it with anything you want you can use
the command line you can use maven
Gradle cobalt which is a new build tool
similar to great on inspired by Gradle
build using Kotlin and IntelliJ IDEA
and does anyone still use ant I mean we
do it J brains but I'm I thought we'd
probably the only people in the world
okay
it's to us and Android studio eclipse we
make a plugin for Eclipse and NetBeans
we also make a plugin for net week okay
that's it let's see some code any
questions so far nothing I'm so good at
explaining nobody nobody even had any
questions now oh I'm sorry about that
yes what platforms are we targeting for
native right now it's called Raspberry
Pi iOS but we're going to target iOS
we're going to target OS X and Windows
yeah probably they have some issues
Linux already some of it works so any
it's going through the LLVM so anything
that works on that and so I don't know
it does the flicker rate here the dot
that's bad right it's bad so I wonder if
it's the let's try this
if I can do something about it that's
much worse right
oh is that better
and we didn't even need a new cable
let's make that thirty okay that's
better right cool
awesome so file new project now I've
done this talk a couple of times which
is an understatement
and so there's various versions of it
out on the web but I always like to give
my audience something new because then
it's not fair not fair on you it's not
fair on me so we're going to do
something slightly different so let's do
my app for Chicago and Colleen comes
with a very small runtime very very
small really small like 700k also and a
standard library
so here's Kotlin ignore all of those are
the files that was just in my source
folder so I'll say sample and I create a
file type main print line hello Chicago
and that's about the only different
thing you're going to see in this
presentation over all of the different
ones that are out there
the name Chicago that's it okay I mean
come on what did you expect me to now
I'll do something's in different orders
and that way it'll be slightly different
okay so I'll run that and hopefully if
that compiles we'll get hello Chicago
there you go fantastic right
don't hold back your emotions either and
of course you can debug as well and I
can do things like you know introduce a
variable here and say variable message
and then set a breakpoint on that and
debug this and get all of the stack
traces and everything so essentially you
get all of the refactorings and all of
that out of the box right you get all of
that with Kotlin the tooling is
top-notch trust me
I'm not biased but I know by the way I
work for JetBrains okay so one of the
things that you're going to notice
immediately is that there is no object
there's nothing right so this is kind of
like a just a file with a main entry
point so that is the equivalent of in
Java you would have a class and then
public static void main the entry point
for calling is just a function called
main that matches this pattern okay so
with Collin that's a good thing that I
don't need to have all of these
different functions as static methods of
static objects I can just have functions
in a file kind of like JavaScript and
you move away from this idea of having
like these utility classes and helper
classes where you have all bunch of
functions that you're adding because you
don't know where else to put them right
that problem completely disappears it
was doesn't disappear now it goes over
to files now you've got all of these
different files and you don't know where
to put your functions but hey we got rid
of some characters in the process so I
can have another function that says
print message and then say message
string and then print line message and I
have string interpolation so a message
is okay right
so you know calling the function is very
straightforward just print message and
hello now a couple of things to notice
is we're following the pascal notation
where you have the parameter name and
then the type okay and string
interpolation as I told you you can do
other things here for example do more
complex things here's like say length
and through operations you can do if
else whatever inside of that as well yes
question
I think there are reasons behind it in
terms of tooling and making it easier in
certain aspects the ID question is why
did we choose that notation as opposed
to the John job also we wanted there was
a there was a it was actually
interesting to eat someone said oh these
new languages you know putting their
types after the names yeah except this
was done like 40 years ago right
it kind of is in line with those people
from the JavaScript community of you
think functional programming is this
brand new paradigm that's just been
invented okay anyway I'm not going to
criticize the JavaScript maybe I should
know I should right so let me show you a
little comparison one of the things that
we try to do with Colin is make it less
more concise write more concise than
Java now that's not saying a lot I mean
it did you know Java is quite ferbos but
to give you an idea let me go ahead and
create a customer class so I'm going to
create a customer class here and then
I'm going to call it a Colin and I'll
say customer right and it's going to be
a class and I'm going to remove all of
this I don't need that and I'll say well
name string and let's go ahead and
actually create a Val ID int and var
name string and we can leave it at that
right so this is essentially creating a
class that has two properties and Colin
there's no such thing as a field as such
right these are two properties it has a
property which is called ID which is
read only because it's prefixed with
it's got a vowel in front and it's got a
property called name which is readwrite
and this is also acting as a constructor
right so I can express all of that in a
single line now I'm going to go ahead
and add something here modify called
data right so that does a few things
what does that do well let's go ahead
and create a Java class and we'll call
it customer Java right and we'll do
private int
I D and this is going to be read only
it's not read only is it what is it
final initialize add constructor
parameter okay private string name add
constructor parameter and then we're
going to go ahead and create getters and
set up for this for this one we're going
to create a getter then we're going to
come here and create a equals and
hashcode and then we're going to come
here and create two string and then
we're going to come here and create a
what else can we create override methods
clone okay so that's Java
that's called it okay so we try to be a
little bit more concise now of course
you're going to say big deal IntelliJ
does that for you yes it does so
essentially we're putting ourselves out
of business
no the point here though is that you
don't know if this code is actually just
standard template default generated by
IntelliJ or your favorite IDE or if it's
called something different or when you
add a new field or a property you have
to go and update that right it's a whole
lot of boiler code that you don't need
all of that is just essentially there
for you with this single line now I did
single the data is what's added the two
string they're equals the hash code and
the clone otherwise it would just be a
standard class with two properties okay
any questions
right now let's close this off ok so
what else do we have
so functions functions are very simple
as I said they're top level we have
parameters that you've seen you have
default parameters so this is again
about cutting down boilerplate code so
if I have two functions that take two
different types of parameters one of
them for instance is optional I don't
have to create overload I could just
pass it a default parameter so in this
case I have a function with three
parameters the last one has a default
value of Smith if I don't call it
without passing that value in it's going
to default to Smith right given I have
default parameters I also have naming of
parameters so I can now call parameters
using a name as a prefix so here I say
that the default and optional parameters
as you can see has three parameters and
I say that the second parameter is X and
the first parameter is y so I can change
the order of it as well one of the good
uses of naming parameters is if you have
a code base where you have functions
with a lot of parameters that you can't
refactor you have to call it because
it's third-party or whatever it gives
you insight in fact if you're using for
instance IntelliJ with Java you might
have noticed with the latest version it
also gives you kind of like a hint
inside the IDE giving you information
about the the parameter name okay
then again going to conciseness so
notice that the default return type in
Kotlin is actually unit which is similar
to void except it's an object so I can
query on it as well and we'll see what
an object is if I don't supply the
defaults if I don't say unit by default
it assumes it's unit so that would be
the equivalent of void in Java if I want
to return a type then I would just put
the type here in this case I would be
returning an INT one of the things big
and calling again is type inference as
much as we can infer we'll try to infer
so if I want to create a parameter I
don't have to say you know I'll create a
parameter called my int which is of type
int and it's equal zero I don't have to
do that I could just say var my end
equals zero I don't have to be explicit
about the type the compiler will infer
it and we try and do the same everywhere
so here for instance I have a function
that's on a single line essentially what
I'm doing there is just saying x equals
x times two so it knows what type X is
and therefore it will return a type
integer I don't have to put the braces
or do things like return return return x
times two and do that that would be the
longer way to do it right if it's just a
single expression that the function
returns which many functions can be then
I can just do it on a single line in
that sense okay you can have functions
with multiple parameters any number of
parameters right and this gets quite
powerful when you start to talk about
some higher order functions which we'll
see in a minute as well so here I can
pass in a a b a b c as many things as I
would like now one of the things that we
try to remove in cotton is nulls right
how many of you love knows it's like
JavaScript there's always someone in the
room that loves JavaScript there's one
person they love note how many people
love JavaScript now this poor okay same
parts on the love note still have
JavaScript at all so in column we we
remove now by default the type cannot
have the value null so when I declare a
string here for instance of Val my
string well this is caught this is Java
maybe I should do this in common so if I
say var var var my string equals blah
blah right and I say var my string so I
can modify it equals no right it says to
me you cannot assign to a non null type
right I can have null if I want but I
have to be Excel it that this is can be
nullable which is
basically adding a question mark at the
end so that means that this type is
nullable so now I could do my string
equals no right now when you're working
with Collin you usually try and avoid
notes because you know what's the point
of null if everything is going to end up
being if not now essentially but since
we need to interoperate with Java we
have to work with the concept of nulls
there is a lot of the code that you're
consuming is Java and Java can return a
customer and that customer can be
nullable right so how do I work with
notes so here you can see that I have a
typical Java code right if customer not
null if customer gets first name is not
null if customer gets first name starts
with an A you know names with a are not
allowed in the this is a security
exception which is like the password
algorithms on some websites so customer
service in Java is like that
now with Kotlin I can do something a
little bit easier so what I'm doing here
is saying I'm using this customer in
Java but notice that there's no null
checks because it's assuming that is not
null so I don't ever have to check for
null
it's giving the developer the option of
saying this type that you're consuming
from Java isn't nullable or not right if
it is not able I can actually say this
type is not able and now I have to check
for null so you see that here it's
giving me an error and saying you can
only do safe calls now instead of doing
that if customer is not null then
customer dot first-name I can just add
this question mark which is like the
Elvis operator and it just says if it's
not null then call this if it is now
then don't call it right makes it more
concise if I want to shoot myself in the
foot I can also do that and says I don't
care that this is now call it anyway but
this is a very important thing because
when we first initially did this we saw
okay the idea is that anything that I
consume from Java is not able right
potentially nullable so I will import
everything as nullable what would happen
we ended up with code bases of question
marks everywhere so we thought okay that
doesn't work
why don't they annotate code bases and
say okay an annotation processor will
run and see if it's not nullable then it
will mark that this question mark is
obsolete this check is obsolete and
therefore you don't need it makes it a
little bit cleaner it didn't work out in
the end either so the last option was do
whatever you want right you know best
whether the type that you're consuming
is nullable or not if it is you add the
question mark if it's not don't add the
question mark and you don't need any
extra checks so working with Colin you
usually try and avoid nulls
but working with Colin and Interop
scenario you do have to sometimes deal
with know some other things that we try
to do to make it a little bit more
concise so casting here is a person now
notice that I have an open class here
because by default classes in call in
are final
that means you cannot inherit from them
unless you explicitly mark them as open
and I have a class employee which
inherits from person and the employee
has a property vacation days I have a
contractor that doesn't have vacation
because what we all know we don't get
vacation or at least paid ones here I
have a function that takes a person and
it says if the person is employee person
vacation days is less than 20 notice
what's missing there the casting right
it's automatically casting that's why
this is in green you probably can't see
it but it shows up in green it saying
that it's automatically cast this to a
person an employee because it you've
already told me you already made the
check and this isn't it's immutable so I
know that it's not going to be modified
by some other thread therefore I can
automatically cast this for you and it
does the same thing often with nullable
types as well now in terms of
constructing a lot of times when you
create classes again we try and be
concise here
you have the constructor in the actual
same line as the name of the class
definition right but you also have
secondary constructors so if I want
multiple constructors I can have them we
just call them constructor with
different parameters and then call the
base constructor if you don't have
secondary constructors and you want to
do some initialization code you also
have that option as well you create this
block called init and inside init you
initialize anything you want with the
constructor but again often you find
that this isn't really necessary
so dependency injection how many of you
know dependency injection right
dependency injection one of the issues
with that is that when I'm initializing
code I have to make sure that it's you
know it's going to be initialized at
runtime so often when I declare type
that type has to be nullable when I
declare it because I can't initialize it
with anything we have things for that
for instance late in it which is a
modifier which I can say you know
customer val customer and and that would
just insert well the syntax doesn't
matter but it's the point being is that
you can just say this is a late in it so
I don't have to make this nullable I
don't have to have explicit code to
initialize this in the constructor and
that goes to another level as well with
delegation so here is an example of
delegation now show you two examples the
other one will go back to interfaces
typical interfaces that you're used to I
have a repository and then I have a pipe
a generic type record get by ID that
returns a tea or get all the returns
list of tea the most incorrect ever
implementation of repositories but
that's what we all see in the wall and
then I have a customer a controller
class that takes a repository now
normally what you would do here is this
would be declared here and then you
would say you know repository vow
private field equals repository right
initialize that and I would have to put
that in
in it or whatever in calling we have
first-class delegation so what we say is
that this value is kind of mixed into
this class and delegated to whatever is
passed in here is a parameter so notice
that I have this function get all and I
have get by ID and I'm not prefixing
that with any field I'm not doing my
private repository field dot get all my
private repository field dot get my ID
because it's represented by this line
here it's saying those method calls are
coming in from the parameter we're
passing in as a constructor so it's kind
of like a mixin if you're familiar with
the mix-ins in ruby it's mixing in that
functionality inside the class right now
the question that might arise here is
what happens if I have four different
the dependencies being passed in where
do I know what method belongs to what
get yourself a nice IDE killing though
if you have four normally that is
another sign which is that class is
probably coordinating too much so you
need to break that issue down in a
different way right don't pass in too
many dependencies into your classes
otherwise they still become God classes
right now we've talked about
constructing what about deconstructing
deconstructing again we have things to
try and make it more readable and more
expressive so here for instance I have a
function that returns a pair initially
we used to have tuples
so UO topples so you have you know
tuples of three values of four or five
then we reduced it to two pairs and
triples and anything beyond that a data
class because once you add more than two
or three parameters you lose the
semantics of what you're trying to do so
if you need more than three values
revert to a data class which is very
easy to define but here I'm returning a
pair how do I give that some semantic
meaning so I could do something like for
element in elements print line element
first and second that doesn't give me
insight into what that first and second
element is but I can deconstruct
and I can say for city country and
elements then print country print city
very similar to what you encounter in
JavaScript okay and you can do the same
when you're creating a type or anything
and now in fact Kotlin also has throw
away variables so if you've ever played
with Haskell for instance you can
actually deconstruct things and some of
the the value that you're getting you're
not using instead of getting hints that
this variable is not used by the IDE I
can just use the underscore saying I
don't care about this value right how
many of you love the singleton pattern
how many of you know how to implement
the singleton pattern how many of you
have to look it up every time you
implement a single pattern oh come on be
honest if you are if you know the
singleton pattern by heart then you are
misusing your memory you should use it
for something else like singleton
patterns and regular expressions are not
something you want to keep in here
there's much more valuable things in
life I always say that I want to go to
my grave without learning regular
expressions so here's the singleton
pattern in Continent it's just an object
there's a thing called a we have the
concept of object as a first-class
citizen so you don't only you don't need
to create a class and then make sure
that the constructor can only be invoked
once and it's a private constructor blah
blah blah you just declare an object now
I'm not saying that this means you
should all go and create singleton
methods they're not that great if
they're read-only they're fine staying
neat a state they're not so good again
but it goes down to try and make things
as concise as possible
right okay now here's some things that
you probably haven't seen because a lot
of these things you can see in multiple
languages and as I said at the very
beginning colin is inspired by many
things all right but one thing that we
have is extensions so
what does this function do that function
is hello can you see okay at the back
they're too liberal eight for me to ask
you now but anyway wait I'll ask you in
ten minutes
um what does that do that is a function
hello except it's prefixed with string
dot dot what does that mean
well actually what it's doing is
extending the string class with a new
function right so I can come and in my
main I can say this is me dot hello now
any string class has that function this
is me dot hello hello right the
extension function is similar if you
know c-sharp
it's the same concept to see shop they
call the method extension although in
c-sharp e article your class with a
static class and a static method and
then pass in this is the first parameter
here you just prefix it with the name of
the class I can access the instance of
the class I'm extending I can pass in
parameters to the class I'm extending
right now watch this this is Jo this
should equal this if we come here that's
understandable because I'm saying should
equal takes a value and compares it to
the actual instance and in fact this
could be simplified like that right but
it's got this other little thing here
called
M fix and that allows me to call it in
this way this should equal this alright
one of the key things we wanted to
accomplish with Kotlin was the ability
to create DSL Cecily deer cells that you
can create easily simply in your sub
domain and use them without having to
understand AST s or a whole bunch of
language theory and some of these things
that you'll see now are what allow us to
have this ability
so the extension functions allow me to
extend any class I can extend the Java
class I can extend a call in class with
any functionality that I want the infix
allows me to create an that can be
called an infix notation as long as it's
a function that is an extension function
on a member function that has a single
parameter now the standard library comes
with a whole bunch of things so here for
instance I create and again look at the
inference in calling you know that I
don't have to be explicit I have a list
of album list of tracks then I have
multiple albums nothing around all of
this explicit and surround types etc if
I want to declare a list of numbers one
to thirty if I want to declare an array
of words array off and then all of the
different type words capitals list off
Madrid to Spain London to UK Berlin to
Germany Washington DC to USA what is
this - can anybody tell me what is it
it's an infix function right where is
this defined in the standard library so
instead of me having to do this more
explicit Madrid Spain pair this actually
creates a pair for me makes it more
expressive right and the standard
library comes with a whole bunch of
functions so filter filter you know on
numbers we follow the groovy Convention
as well that if lambda expression
consists of a single parameter I can
refer to that parameter using it instead
of being explicit so I could say you
know my even numbers equals numbers
filter and then it would be a function
that you know is divisor by two modulus
to equal zero so the pair's but first of
all in cotton in each of these funding
expression this is a lambda expression
right that's how you do a lambda
expression
: it could be multi-line right and if
the first parameter is if it's a single
parameter I can replace the explicit
definition of it exclusive decoration of
it with it so that's where that comes
from okay
that's like groovy I have all of these
functions like map and if you look
through the standard library the
majority of these are extension
functions on generic types so you get
map filter flat map sorted sort by group
by group all of these different things
on all of the different correct
collections are alias lists whatever you
want applicate locates all of these
different things this comes all part of
the standard library so the high order
of course I can create my own
higher-order functions is all so here I
have a higher-order function a
higher-order function if you're not
familiar with the term we've just used
it with filter filter is a high order
function higher-order function is a
function that takes a function or a
function and returns a function right
now you know functional programming
there you go
a higher-order function this is a
function that takes an integer and
integer returns an integer right I
invoke that I say print line func 2 3
how do I call that higher-order my sum I
can reference functions by name similar
to how you can do in Java now on a type
so my son is a function that takes two
parameters of type int and returns an
int so match is the pattern that I'm
expecting here now one of the things
that I showed you around being able to
do multi line with the lambdas one of
the benefits that that has is that we
try it again not only with the DSL which
I may call it in extensible as much as
possible and how many of you know they
try with resources in c-sharp there's
this thing called using which basically
is similar I take an object that is I
disposable and it automatically disposes
it I say using this object open braces
do whatever and automatically disposes
kind of similar to try with resources
I don't have that in Java I don't have
that in cotton but it's very easy to
create I create a function called using
that takes an object that's closable and
a body an action and I say try execute
that action finally close it off right
so when I want to use this I can do
something like using my closable done
right and it looks like it's a keyword
right it looks like it's part of the
language it looks like it's a construct
of the language but it essentially isn't
it's just a function and if you're
familiar with a synchronous programming
rx Java the keywords in c-sharp around
the sink await we all of we have all of
those in Kotlin as well they're called
co-routines it's implemented in a
generic way called co-routines
and none of the solutions a sink await
or any of these things that we provide
yield if you familiar with the with the
keyword yield then are part of the
language they're just functions but
because of the some of the conventions
and the abilities that we have we'd call
it it feels like it's part of the
language
so what else sequences a lot of the
things that you saw like when I take a
list of numbers and I do a filter and
then I do a map that's all eager
evaluation that means it's going to go
through the entire list it's going to
evaluate everything and then it's going
to print out the result a lot of times
now we want to work with laid evaluation
which means basically process data until
we find what we're looking for and then
discard the rest you can do that in Java
with streams in cotton used to be called
streams and then because of Java coming
out with streams we kind of changed it
and we call it sequences so now I can
take any collection and say a sequence
and as soon as I do that any operation
after that becomes lazy
so it's lazily evaluated and last but
not least in terms of coding algebraic
data types okay so if you're familiar
with this
this is very common in languages such as
Haskell for instance an algebraic data
file type is essentially typed it could
be of one type or another type boolean
for instance right here I have a page
result that can be a type success or
type error so you see that the class
success inherits from page result the
class error inherits from page result if
it's successful I want my class to
contain some property called the URL if
it's an error I wanted to return have a
code and a message now forget the steal
world sealed word here I'll tell you
what that is so now when I do like when
I do
calling page result equals get page now
when the result is with success print
line URL and again notice that this is
automatically casted to the return type
when the result is error print line
message right it's a much nicer cleaner
way to do write code because I don't
have to return an object that has
everything whether it's a result
successful or an error and then say if
error on that property then you know
make use of these properties if not make
use of those other properties so this is
just basically a subclass of the type
page result what's the field keyword in
here that's saying that this is it in a
hierarchical way no other class is ever
going to be inherited from page results
yes no that's different that's open so
open by default it's final right sealed
means that no other class outside of
these two are going to be inheriting
from page result so it's limiting this
the inheritance scope right now up to
calling 1.0 you had to define it as part
of the the class so like a child class
but now you can actually put it inside
the same file as long as it's inside the
same file it's okay
and if you combine this all of the
condition all of this conditional
statements like if when etc they all
return they can be used as expressions
as well so if I say return right because
it's not I mean I have to say it says
add else branch or add remaining branch
recite well I don't even have a return
type but if you use it as a return value
if return a value from the wind then it
becomes an exhaustive check because then
you'll say you know you're not taking
into account all of the different
instance okay so that's enough food code
let's go back to slides a little bit and
just finish off with some things some
other things that people are doing and
Co is if you're doing Android
development that's kind of like in a DSL
for creating views without having to
deal with XML Android extensions makes
use of some other technology that we
have in call them which is called the
plugin for the compiler so what it does
it actually gets information about your
elements on your Android forms and
statically typed them for you
so you can refer to them by name without
having to do a find by ID with the
string etc spring boot spring is a very
big advocate of Kotlin now they're using
it extensively and spring boot now
supports called in natively and you it
has called in extensions it makes use of
a lot of things Cobalts already
mentioned this is the DSL for writing
build in Kotlin and of course great old
recently announced well recently no
really a year ago announced that now
they support cotton so you can write
your Gradle scripts incontinent it's
called Gradle cut Gradle script Kotlin
instead of using groovy and they
recommend Kotlin for any new plugins as
well coming in 1.1 all of those things
are there because 1.1 has already been
released for you the next steps go to
call in languor try call in languor and
calling Cowen's you can download them
offline play with them down the language
books there's a whole bunch of books
these are just two these already
published if you're doing calling for
android recommend the book on the left
call it in action
I've got an alrighty course if you're
interested I also have a podcast now
called talking Kotlin self-publicity
their community is very very large very
active very nice
we've got about I think close to 7000
people now on our slack
Don't Tell slack because they don't like
open source projects on the free tier
they'll love it on the paper of course
so but yeah very active on the slack
Channel right so you can join the slack
channel and die with a thousand deaths
of slack channels inside slack channels
and also I wanted to mention with their
permission try fork because they're
helping organize this we're having a
calling conference in San Francisco so
if you're interested in that that's
going to be a two-day event on November
the second and third very cheap
beautiful it's going to be big I
promised I wouldn't do that anyway
summary so I hope you get the essence of
this the goal with this was to be a
pragmatic language a lot of the choices
that we have made is to make it easy to
solve some of the problems that we
facing daily development very easy
learning curve the interoperability
allows low risk adoption because you can
add it to your codebase gradually you
don't need to start with tests you know
any java class can be called from colony
calling class can be called from java
and this is obviously a very subjective
thing but empirical evidence based on my
biases has proven that it is extremely
enjoyable by everyone that I asked ok
and Colin is here to stay and this is a
very big important point because we have
a lot invested in continent and we
didn't make cotton to sell consulting
around cotton or sell programming around
cotton we create a column for us for our
tooling and our tooling is our main
source of income and you know we're
going to continue to sell tools and
Colin has now become one of our tools
except we use it ourselves and we give
it away free in the hope that you guys
will all buy IntelliJ IDEA which
eventually hopefully
and to sum up you know someone tweeted
and with their permission I I'm showing
it the city research Colleen last night
and then spending the morning looking
amount in the boilerplate Java in
Android studio I see why they did it
pretty much that that's a good summary
of why we did this thank you and we have
one minute for questions no questions
great thank you very much yes so the
question is when I extend string where
does that how does that impact so
essentially as long it's based on a
package level scope so when you define
your package which by default is default
package but you can explicitly define a
package in Kotlin we follow the same
conventions does Java you know the death
by a thousand subfolders except you
don't need to have them in subfolders
but it's basically on the scope so when
you're inside the ID if you write like
you know a string dot hello the ID is
going to pick it up and say oh there's a
hello defining this package and I'll
show you the intellisense then you hit
enter and it will import the package for
you all right class overrides can't
remember function overrides the
extension function so yes a data so the
question of static versus instances
everything I've done is essentially in a
class as you know it in Java right a
data class is a class in Java you have
to create an instance of it yes I
actually didn't show how to create an
instance of something Val Val customer
eCos customer there's no cute new
keyword ok that's how you create an
instance right the only thing that's not
an instance is object I mean sorry the
only thing that you don't create an
instance of this object because that's
already its own instance singleton ok
yes
yeah the question is when would you use
Scala when would you use Collin general
answer is if you're happy with Scala
there's nothing for you in cotton simple
as that
right if you're unhappy with Scala take
a look at cotton Scala is very powerful
it allows you many things in column we
don't we don't allow you to override any
symbol define any of
operator we limit you in what you can do
we do that intentionally so that often
we don't end up with the complexity this
with that we do so question is around
Java with Scala interrupts it's it's
very very smooth and don't take our word
for it ask on the internet ask on slack
it's very very smooth because remember
we had when we started we had ten years
of legacy code
we now have 17 years of Java legacy code
like we're dogfooding this every day so
we emphasize a lot the interoperability
yeah so we're very if the question is
around the explicitness around the types
of functions right function parameter
yeah yeah explicit yes yeah now we're
explicit around that because that also
helps in terms of optimizations and
compiler speed times I think
yeah go ahead last question because I
think we gotta go yes you could the
question is around testing you can use
the existing testing frameworks
absolutely in fact there's even more
awesome frameworks one of them is called
spread spec framework which you feel
familiar with jasmine or mocha is
essentially that and it allows you to do
kind of like a very nice style of
testing it is really really nice why cuz
I'm the author for version and one of
the now that's three of us maintaining
it so you can see that I can do for
example describe a calculator it should
return it should return right but I'm
going to be completely fair there's also
another one called column test which is
our competitor he's doing a great job as
well the author and that is kind of like
an implementation of Scala test in
Kotlin so that also looked I did not pay
for keywords there so that when they do
call into spec shows up some some people
actually do that so this is another one
right and this this has its own kind of
assertion framework right spec thousand
we use hamcrest or a whole bunch of
different things but this does have its
own kind of expectations
things right so there's already a lot of
stuff around that area one of the things
that we're going to do respect though is
we're going to try and decouple
completely from j-unit so that
essentially you're going to be able to
use spec when you target JavaScript
native or jovian right that's it for
time I'm here the three day so if you
want come round and I'll be happy to
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
