everyone we are here to take you on a
journey from waterfall to to add charm
and when we started out on a journey we
were very much an agile organization and
you'll get to see that but we actually
managed waterfowl right
yeah waterfall yeah sorry and we
actually managed to to get a bit of it
agile so so let's stop so yeah I know
said I'm Thomas I'll show you and I used
to fly f-16s and actually it's not as we
have to go into the agile world from an
f-16 pilot you know just if Sutherland
he was also flying f-16s and I did a
talk yesterday where I talked a lot
about some of the similarities in air
combat you know we have some of the same
problems that we have in the entire
world it's really you know there's a lot
of uncertainty and you need to handle
planning execution and organization with
a lot of people sometimes in in with
that uncertainty so some of the
strategies I used as a fighter pilot is
actually the same strategies I find in
the aerospace and also this a couple
that that we learned that you know it's
actually it inspires me once in a while
so I talked about it yesterday in the
talk safe versus scrum and how many of
you saw that talk Wow so actually quite
a bit so some of you might actually have
been lagging a little bit of context for
what safe is and today we're gonna talk
a little bit more about that some of the
processes behind it but of course also
how also how we were struggling in these
teams so you will get a little bit of
information about it and when I'm not
coaching at Yahoo have been doing that
for the last 11 years working will lean
an ad dial in different contexts and I'm
also developing a little bit I started
developing
when I was 12 I really loved code
encoded on lambda it was called and
later machine code assembler and
Commodore 64 right now I don't have too
much time coding but I code a little bit
on the Air Force f-16 simulators so I
own the company that are building the
next generation flight simulators for
the Air Force which I'm really proud of
actually we won that contract based on
agility so I think that's really a
tribute to a tile that we could compete
against some really major US companies
now yeah and my name is christian the
danish names are bit difficult for
foreigners to pronounce oh you can also
call me ID if you have an easier time on
that I'm a political scientist major and
I just said I turned to IT because hey
it's not because it's boring because
it's actually quite fun as so many
problems in IT and IT development that
is interesting for a guy like me to
solve so I've been with a TTC for seven
years and I've been working also in the
business departments in TDC and did a
few I post a few ideas there that we
could try out and then suddenly I fell
into the IT department but a little bit
more about the stuff that we do because
TDC is a pretty old company right mm-hmm
it's a hundred and thirty six years so
we started with 22 subscribers and
that's actually they they're 22
subscribers and our product was fairly
simple
it was a phone and our IT department
were I don't know maybe it's a bit
complex but that's how it looked like
the operations in IT so things have
progressed a little bit more since then
so when I got into this business things
needed to be done a little bit
differently like we are not moving
quotes around so we are building in our
department my department recommendations
and guidance solutions we are trying to
figure out what's the optimal way for a
problem to be solved and we are
delivering
systems to our contact center so
whenever any of you guys called TDC
you're going to be using indirectly the
system superbills we've built some
pretty hardcore IT stuff here but and
also for our technicians as well so we
have the whole value chain in this
department but it's not interesting what
we built it's more interesting for you
guys to hear how we get stuff done right
so the first thing you need to know is
that my team is a distributed team so we
are situated in almost in Denmark we
have developers in Pune in India and in
Bangalore also India so there's a quite
a geographic distance between developers
and people who know stuff about the
business another thing that I did was I
also took a look at how do we do
projects until you see how do we decide
on scope so I'd look through 50 or so
projects that I've been part of or that
I had been in a steering committee of
and took a look at how do we actually
decide on what we are building in TC and
basically what we came up with was the
project has its scope decided by a
committee right a committee could be a
group of business analysts or whatever
but they have removed from the users in
some way or it could be a steering
committee that suddenly just made a hey
we need to do this in that project right
it could also be the opinion of subject
matter experts that had expert knowledge
of a system saying ok we can't do this
we can do this and that way but the
really scary thing here is to me at
least is that 10% of the scope is only
only 10% of the scope is driven by users
and let's keep that in mind because we
are taking all of those requirements
from the scope in my department and so
what we do is we get the handover from
our business partners and then we write
this
good long list of requirements and we
wrapped them up pretty nicely we are
focused on making sure that it's of
course achievable and we can measure it
and we can see that stuff is it's made
right so so we wrap that up and then we
send that in a nice package to our
developers and we have a little bit of
assessment and talking back and forth
they ask questions we answer them and
stuff like that and then eventually
we'll get to a sort of common
understanding and we'll say okay we got
it we'll see you soon and from then on
it's more like tracking the progress
right so we would do status report
asking them how much time is left until
you are done how far you how much effort
have you spent so far and we will report
that back up to our department or
business department so we would doing a
lot of stakeholder management and you'll
be focused on making sure that cost
isn't getting out of control
meanwhile after they understand what
they're supposed to be doing they would
give their gears grinding and start
working on this stuff and they will be
focused on time right they want to be
focused on not failing because their
livelihood is dependent on them
delivering these requirements so they
would take the long list of requirements
able checkmark that they have built the
stuff that they were supposed to be
building and once they think they're
done they will pack it up send it to us
and we'll if we're happy with it we'll
deploy it but the central point here is
that we're missing something we're
missing some means action we're missing
the developers are missing that
interaction where it says what do they
think about what I just did and what
change did I do because developers have
removed from the business okay another
thing is also that we tend to pile a
batch of approached a project but it
takes a long time and a lot of effort to
get a project prioritized or even if you
find that we have a task we need to do
we need to get to write that task and
get it prioritized in a minor tasks
project and stuff like that so what
happens is that we spend a lot of time
doing the design phase and we build and
then we really
something and when we release that we
are immediately starting on the next
batch right so we don't get that
feedback that interaction between users
and developers and even if we find
something up here in the first batch of
work that we want to fix we can't fix it
until the third release because we're
already busy doing something else so
there's sort of feeds into this process
that enforces itself where you have
business guys looking at IC and saying
wow that's what's going on down there
it's alien we don't understand it or
we're not getting what we want so you
can see two of those guys up there
pretty angry they thought they had this
project that they wanted and they got it
out and ah no it wasn't exactly what
they needed and another guy is a little
bit skeptical and the last two guys are
like mmm that's pretty curious wonder
what's going on down there and I see and
the IT guy he's looking at the users and
saying okay the business units don't
think that they get what they want but
that's just because users don't
understand what I built right they don't
know how to use it they're cave people
they're doing something else right and
if you remember the way that we decided
on scope in the first place only 10
percent of that scope was actually used
at Revan so no wonder that the IT dude
is thinking this so at least this is my
experience so I when I got into this job
my business partner asked or told me
that now that I got this job you need to
produce more in a higher quality so I
was like hey say what how can i how can
I do that that's a trade-off right but
it turns out that no it's not really
it's right off you can actually do this
but given the constraints I was
massively challenged so we needed to do
something needed to change the reality
like we were so we needed to first of
all understand that ID and business is
in the same boat right we needed to get
that perception out
and the two guys in the front of the
boat day I in the same boat but they
don't want to help fix it or no one
showed them that they should fix it
maybe they forgot to bring the tools to
help them fix it right so we needed to
get that understanding out that everyone
is in the same boat and we've been
experimenting a bit with a child in CDC
and most of you would probably recognize
the scrum Waterfall talk right you think
you're agile and you do some scrum teams
and then you two project funding another
thing is that when we started agile I
didn't know anything about it
I was like huh a child isn't that just a
way of just we deciding on scope and
change scope and don't have a plan and
don't follow anything but so then these
misperception was something that we had
to combat so I set up three goals that I
needed to change really rapidly one I
needed to move knowledge away from
specialists and spread it out on the
team and I also wanted to distribute the
workload I needed to stop people from
having this bottleneck over here or one
person I could only do one thing right
and another thing I needed to understand
was that if I wanted to deliver more
quality I also needed to have more
people more brain power actually if I
couldn't have people just sit idly wait
until something came their way and I
needed to collaborate better with
business and lastly we had a problem
with red tape right so we had some
innovation but it got killed because you
needed to fund that idea you need to
fund that task that that person needed
to do so there was a lot of red tape in
order to get that so people either sense
that something happens that this is
never going to get approved or they
spend a lot of time trying to get that
prioritize so Thomas what can I do well
as you heard a question thought at I was
you know just this loose thing with a
way I could just basically do
what you wanted so I needed to convince
him that that was not the case right so
I found this picture on the net which is
basically safe and that convinced him
pretty quickly symbol right oh yeah it
was actually a pretty good match also
for us because these guys well a few of
them had a little bit of experience some
of the Indian guys had a scrum master
course and a little bit of practical
experience but most didn't have any
experience at all with that gal and what
safe does is provide a common
understanding of all the you know and
like vocabulary of all these basic stuff
like what is the use of story what is a
sprint and and and you know it's easy to
teach from and I was I was working with
Christian and the team's only part-time
so I needed all the help I could get to
you know get us a kickstart on this so
that is one of the reasons we chose safe
I'm gonna run through it pretty quickly
here what the ideas are behind safe this
is a drawing that you would understand
better after a two-day workshop but I'm
gonna give you the the core ideas here
and sort of the the flow of the process
so the the bottom layer is just normal
scrum stuff and and Kanban stuff all the
practices you know from from at Yahoo
then there is this layer on top of it
and which is just a container basically
for the team's could look like this you
have the scrum teams there and then the
bottom there are some servant leaders
they are focusing on on what we should
do just like a product owner and but
there is one looking out for all the
teams and then you have an architect
which you know some of you at al Ghul's
might sound a little bit weird no we
don't want architects to do our stuff
right we want the best architecture to
emerge from the teams but I'm gonna tell
you a little bit more about it because
it's actually not that anti agile in my
opinion at least then we have what is
called an RTE
a release train engineer which is
basically just a scrum master for the
teams and in this case it was Christian
so in this setup we have the four teams
when we start in safe you can have up to
12 coordinating in there in this way
the important thing about this group is
that it needs to be cross-functional so
they need to plan and execute together
as a cross-functional group and as you
heard from questions intro they were
really really siloed when we started
question had his IT dudes who were
responsible for building stuff and they
were handing stuff over between business
and IT basically so we needed to change
that we needed to have a you know the
whole value chain involved the whole all
the guys that are responsible for
building this product need to work
together in the same boat and that's
also a core idea in safe then the top
layer here is really dealing with how to
manage funding and traditionally
question needed to get a project
approved every time he would do anything
they all had to do anything and then he
would get people allocated to stuff so
basically the classical project funding
method and and you know it just creates
so much hassle and and start and stop
and you know it really doesn't work a
lot of delays so what we agreed on
actually pretty quickly I it amazed me
how easy a cell this was actually and
was to to fund the teams instead without
knowing exactly what they were going to
build so it took about two weeks we had
some managers at the high level in TDC
go to a safe course and you know they
understood that hey this is this is
actually an important part of safe so
they were funding crisis teams for the
next year without knowing exactly what
they would get out of it I would have a
met and that would be really have but it
just happened and so how do we how do we
work and how does safe actually think
about planning and there's this idea in
safe called an increment which is
basically five sprints in a row and you
do a sort of a high-level planning based
on that it could look like a big batch
of stuff but we need to remember that
this is only a planning session a
synchronization session a session where
we align roughly about what we're going
to work on
for the next period so it has nothing to
do with releases we can release several
times a day if that's what we want and
get feedback on what we're actually
working on what we also need to think
about is what is planning and what is a
plan so we have a little bit of a
love-hate relationship to planning and
natural right and it's the same thing
actually in the military as I mentioned
this guy Eisenhower says that plants are
worthless is really really hard on
plants right and it has this other idea
that planning is everything so what does
he mean by that
how can the output of planning a plan be
worthless and and then planning still be
worth something
the his idea is that it's really not the
plan which is the output of the planning
the the output of the planning is
alignment you know a shared mental model
about what can be achieved
where are the risks and what we need to
look out for when we are executing so
it's really a tool this you know three
months planning session that I'm gonna
talk about in a bit called p.i planning
it's really a tool to get a common
understanding of and and decentralize
execution and make communication easier
while we execute so if you're thinking
about planning like this sort of a
decision tree tree where you need to
find the single best plan when you start
out you know that that's not what we're
looking for in in safe what we're
looking forward to rough guidance on a
mission what is it we're trying to
achieve what is it the outcome the
difference we want to make to the
customers and we want to have a shared
understanding of it give us a general
direction and we want to minimize the
constraints so that the team can
actually as they execute choose their
own way through this to maximize the
impact of the customers so if we look at
the individual Sprint's that we execute
in this increment they look pretty much
like a normal scrum meetings that this
would be a calendar you have you're
planning your refinement meeting so
there's a couple of red dots there
they're called art sync it's basically
scrum
crumbs you have the same thing for
product management and then in the end
the team's demo but they do that
individually and then they also have a
common system demo where everybody shows
to each other what they have done
we were only four teams safe actually
says you need to be five to twelve we
thought we might want to check it out
anyway with the only four but we
modified it a bit actually here because
we were so few people that instead of
only or instead of first doing team
demos and then doing a common system
demo we actually just put that all
together we were few people enough that
that made sense for us and that has
worked out ok the other thing is the
team ret respects safe says that you
should do that on team level but we
wanted to test also what would happen if
we did them first on team level and then
put them together to sort of share their
learnings and that has turned out to be
really amazing actually and I don't know
if some of you have issues or feel on
teams where they feel sometimes that red
suspects are not you know getting all
the benefit out of it and what what we
saw was that as soon as people start
sharing and actually showing a little
bit being a little bit vulnerable about
what they are challenged with in their
teams and and you see that from another
team that hey these guys actually
sharing it and they are doing something
about it it sort of creates this you
know raises the bar a little bit we all
want to you know give something out of
our rich respects and so that was that
has been pretty nice and of course you
also get and you know get to help each
other and share solutions to different
problems turns out a lot of the problems
actually the same right then there's
this IP sprint bridge where is a
dual-purpose thing it's a buffer first
of all so when you do your three months
planning you don't take that capacity
into account and then you also have some
some events in there you could do
hackathons you could do some planning
preparation of course not for everybody
but some people might be a little
bit more involved with that then you
could put your if you have any egg you
know education activities this is a nice
place to do it you haven't inspect and
adapt workshop which is basically a full
all room all people in a room meeting
where you're doing a common retrospect
that there has been a pretty cruel thing
also we'll talk a bit about that later
and then there's a pie planning two-day
workshop and where a lot of stuff is
going on and this is really important
from the perspective of alignment and
that is the purpose of it
so you start out with understanding the
big picture we have different peoples
going on the scene there we have our
product management talking about what
sort of big things do they think we need
to work on what are the challenges they
see across teams that we should help
we'll and then the idea is that later on
as the teams actually execute on these
features that he will present they are
allowed to do lean startup and lean UX
practices right so this is not a
constraint that you must do this you
must deliver this it's just you know I
have I've spent some work on you know
trying to gather the big picture and and
this is what I see go fetch go solve
these problems so it's stuff like this
you know he asked a lot of the users
what are you actually thinking about our
product is it like solving the stuff
that we that we hope to do we also have
well we didn't have it in the beginning
actually but this girl Katrina is a UX
specialist or whatever you could call
her she after a month or so we figured
out that hey we're going in a little bit
different directions UX wise so we need
to you know have some alignment on it
and she stood forward and she's now
presenting on these meetings also to
give us some rough alignment on and
where to go give us some guidance which
is really just a team member who had
this additional task of trying to align
us on it this is a Cena
she's our architect so I asked her on
now a couple of weeks ago when we did
the last P I planning and let's see what
she says
question regarding your role as an
architect you know in in the agile
manifesto there's this wording that the
best architecture comes from
self-organizing teams so it seems
regarding okay we're in the middle of a
pie right now and on day two and
yesterday I noticed you on the stage
giving a presentation about some of the
things coming in the future when you
prepare for that thing what went through
your mind what did you think about and
what did you want to achieve
okay thanks so this is a sentient from
safe
the team's deserve to see the bigger
picture and be in power to design their
part you might ask you know what why
can't the team just teams just figure
this out themselves but but that's
actually what they're doing Cena is part
of a team she just you know takes on
this extra responsibility of you know
looking looking getting the big picture
for everyone but everybody is allowed to
coordinate she's not having a lot of
authority actually and then after we
have heard a lot about the big picture
stuff we have team breakouts we have a
common vision now we know what we're
trying to achieve and we know where we
have suffered a little bit in the past
and now it's the team's turn to figure
out what can we actually do here and so
it's sort of like a clock refinement
session that you do in the team breakout
after that we have a team review so we
just quickly go through the big picture
of each individual teams what do they
think will be achievable and what are
they struggling a little bit with and
then everybody gets a common
understanding of it you know probably
also realize that there's gonna be some
problems that we need to change the plan
a little bit so we'll talk about that
then the next day we'll have had time to
think a bit about it get some sleep and
then we'll present to everybody it
change in direction if it's needed and
then we'll have another team breakout so
this is one of our Indian developers and
I asked her a few questions also so
let's hear what she thinks about this
p.i planning thing right now we're in
the middle of
actually in the end of the P I planning
so this is today planning session it
sounds pretty boring I I mean I can
imagine that you'd rather be doing but
this is so you just know that why are
you going to do that work you know what
this is value then you come out at the
end of coding that you do so like you
know going to do something that users or
the customers will be happy at the end
of the day so this planning is a very
essential part of all the pudding that
okay so what I'm hearing her saying is
that this actually puts some purpose
into her life and you mentioned in the
beginning their question that that was
one thing we were struggling with and we
actually also saw that on some of the
metrics and unhappiness that the CDC is
collecting and those have gone up
rapidly after we started doing this
stuff so that's pretty cool I think then
we do a quick review of the plans after
another team breakout so you have this
iteration again and you know collecting
the big picture then going out doing
detail stuff collecting the big picture
again and then you have some sessions in
the end where you sort of look at the
risk we want to understand also you know
what it's gonna be hard to achieve and
remember you know back then whether they
were doing pure waterfall they you know
the IT department were mostly looking
for the technical risks and the business
we're looking at the business risk but
here we do it in a collected forum we
all want to understand the risks on both
both sides and I think that's really
cool also then you do a confidence world
like a fist of five how sure are we that
we can achieve these goals it has
actually worked pretty well for us also
and and finally you do maybe some
planning if people are not happy with
this and and the retro so and that best
you know the basic process of the safe
then you know we had these guys who
hadn't been doing any any agile at all
and we wanted to teach them this stuff
so we thought a bit about how to how to
start that and we decided on doing a two
day workshop where we taught people
mostly about actually the you know the
individuals and interaction stuff and
also some basic scrum but really
focusing on cross-functionality really
understanding how why is it that it's
not working what we're doing all these
handoffs and delays why is it that won't
work and and we need you guys to work
together now as a cross-functional team
we need you to rip
your your cards where it says that you
have this specialist role and now we're
just all product developers and you know
that that was the main goal of that
training so we did a lot of exercises to
enforce that and then in the end we
wanted the teams to self-organize so we
created a list together and how a
perfect team would look for us so the
you know we came up with stuff like we
need someone who understand the front
deck technology someone who understands
some other technologies that were
involved also you know would be nice
with having someone with scrum
experience and someone who understands
the business so this list of I think
1215 criteria that would be nice and
then we asked people to you know step
into the middle of the room and then you
know go self-organized go into teams
that match these criterias so what do
you think happened well you would think
they would do this right but that's not
what they did they basically went to the
people they liked working with and tried
to form teams for them so we had I think
four teams actually also in the
beginning but they were not really
matching the criteria right but then
after a while people are talking to each
other and hey we don't have any anybody
who understands the business here but
there's two over there we know you guys
really like each other but maybe we
should then you know it went on for
twenty minutes or so and then we're
actually pretty happy with the teams and
you know the cool thing about this is
that if you are if you are selected like
that and they also select the product
owners and and scrum masters themselves
you're sort of you know if you're scrum
master you and you're selected by own
team you you get that real feeling of
you know being a servant leader you are
really there for them to help them and
they have selected you and you know that
you know if you're not doing it doing a
good job then you know we might might
change to another person's as a scrum
master so you know this all's pretty
easy
I would think but let's say a Christian
what happens when Theory meets practice
yeah so we've all trained now to be
agile I mean you saw the
and meetings that you needed to do so we
took that meeting and put it into an
Outlook calendar took another meeting
put that into another day in the same
Outlook calendar which took a bunch of
people so Outlook calendars and we merge
these meeting into it and we had this
sack of money it's our budget so we will
also fund it for a year as semester set
so well yancha anyway all right we have
all the meetings we're doing all the
processes right and we have the budget
so hey Gretchen ye let's go no because
it's not really about the processes it's
more about the people let's take let's
take that story so in the beginning our
physical environments were pretty
horrible right he started out being
distributed on free locations remember
that we were in Pune in Bangalore and we
were on office right so we've been used
to mailing to each other when why don't
you communicate we had this long email
threats why we push back and forward and
people got added to it and removed from
it and then re-add it so that's the way
we used to communicate also via
communication company right so we you
should expect us to be able to
understand how to communicate well we
had one landline for four teams sorry
four teams on free locations needs team
they had people from each location also
yeah this is really crappy actually yeah
so each team will also geographically
placed on three different locations
thousands of kilometers apart we have
one landline Hey
and landline that's enough it can pick
up conversations going on ten different
places right no not really
so so all of these things were a problem
to us then just one comment Christian
yeah and you know we have this idea from
the manifest or write that people and
interactions over processes and tools
but you know if you have it distributed
teams like this if you don't have
tooling in place to have you know some
sort of virtual colocation whatever you
know you're totally screwed you can't do
it
so that's one of the lessons I think we
learned that you really need to invest
in this if you would have any chance to
to start to form any kind of team that
know each other and works well together
yeah exactly so three weeks in we had a
plan right we were at Chow we had an
actual plan does this look familiar to
you this is a Gantt chart right if you
recognize these things I don't know if
any of all of you come from a waterfall
world but what's interesting is that
there's a deadline date up there you can
see that relief mark or that's milestone
yeah so we were asked to deliver in in
three months we were supposed to deliver
a lot of scope I'll tell you more about
the scope in a bit but the problem here
that you can see right away is that
people's mindset was still stuck in that
waterfall were alright they were still
trying to mash everything into a
requirement and we mash everything into
a set of features that needed to be
developed and an release date which is
the milestone project closure yeah right
they sawed off next thing right so the
mindset here was not really changed
people were a child in Outlook and that
child in budget but they were still
project thinking in projects terms and
waterfall terms so at this point in time
the best thing that could describe us
was a scrum Waterfall organization so a
month and a half into this process we
realized this is going bad we were not
going to meet that deadline that's for
sure
I mean we took in way too much scope and
the good thing about this framework here
and the good thing about what we've been
doing for this one and a half month was
that we actually realized that pretty
quickly more quickly than we probably
would have in a project and the reason
we did that is because we had the system
demos right so on the system demos we
realized that what we were actually
building were markups and design
documents we didn't produce anything of
value
actually so a couple of sprints and we
stopped up and we figured out we needed
to do something differently right now so
we changed the focus looking at okay so
we had long list of requirements that we
needed to deliver so that was our focus
and we knew that's not going to happen
so we need to do something different so
we took a look at what is the value that
we can generate from now on and on till
March 27
so immediately people switched from
being okay we need to deliver all of
this requirement and report on this
progress to being focused on outcome our
own value on how compasses and also what
can we actually deliver so we started to
prioritize through all of these features
that we wanted to build and figure out
what was the value that we can generate
for the users so we did some quick
workshops will use a shirt and a little
bit what we're doing went back coded did
a couple of sprints showed it again and
got some quick feedback and we did that
for the next part so three months in
rereleased on the 27th of March and we
released something that users really
really really liked and we released and
the reason why they liked it is because
they were amazed that they've been
spending a year and a half
discussing and debating and trying to
build a scope on a project and it became
so big that it was just canceled it
didn't fly so we took a there was a
scope that we were trying to deliver in
the 27th of March deadline so we took my
business
koosy generate the most value I mean
clean written and we deliver that so
they actually chose an organization
outside of their own immediately silo as
the best team award because of this
change because they saw hey we are
involved they are taking care of what we
need and they're building something that
we use
so that was sort of the turning point
this is a major game changer for us
because we figured out that we're not
supposed to be focusing on the
requirement so far our business partners
that are part of our team now now we're
using a Wii paradigm
they also saw this they also saw oh wait
it doesn't pay off to come with demands
on and requirements like that we need to
set the direction we need to inspire
people to understand the value of what
they're building and they saw this also
because of this so now we received it
four months in that this a child culture
is starting to emerge and one of the
things that can use as a benchmark for
that is people are actually starting to
move out of their comfort zone they dare
to move on to comfort they can see the
value of moving out of their comfort
zone previously people were very happy
with being very specialized because that
was safe you could deliver within your
specialized so but that also created bar
tonight you only need this much of an
API guy and this amount of front-end
workers right and you can always plan on
when to meet or dispute the work so that
you can you can work efficiently
so this is where cross killing comes in
so people realize that hey we we sort of
moving ourselves into deadlines or sorry
inch of bottlenecks now and then how can
we help that and then they started to
move out of that comment saying hey I
could actually do a little bit of this
programming on that in learn a new code
line or a coding language another thing
was that people were willing to be far
more vulnerable I mean on our common
rate respects it was no longer accepted
that you didn't fail
in a sprint they didn't talk about
shortcomings in that sprint and the
other teams they started to help those
other teams or maybe they shared
something and then we worked on it
together
in that common retrospect so we found
our common solution or we help each
other in each of the teams so wish and
we try to expand
a little bit here as well but the teams
also made an effort now on each sprint
in the system demon to show some real
progress they no longer accept it just
being able to show some wireframe or
prototype and call that value no they
wanted to build something incremental II
that made value to the users and team on
that on on the system demo and as you
point was Thomas tooling here is really
everything so when you have a team that
is at best can be described as virtually
co-located and you expect them to be
able to work together you need proper
tools for it so we invested quite
heavily in buying new licenses for other
tools so that we could collaborate
better and we could make virtual sticky
notes and stuff with it so it felt a
little bit more like a physical
environment that you were talking about
yeah one thing I think helped them
progress was actually no doing the
system demos together and when you know
in the beginning some of the teams were
really stuck in this waterfall mindset
but they saw other teams actually
finishing stuff and they could you know
ask question about how did you actually
achieve it you know that sort of you
know the comment group and seeing what
all teams are doing that sort of helps
lift the buy a little bit I think so
definitely
yeah definitely those system demos and
common retrospect help us increase that
I think so this one bit here is actually
very very important it is super
important that you focus on what is the
outcome that you want to do and not
focus on what is it
what requirement are you spending its
what value are you generating what value
are you building so six months and we
switch from we probably switch from
requirement specifications to proper
outcome hypothesis where businesses or
business comes for their strategy and we
have it at one direction and we work
weekly on that we constantly rely on
ourselves on that direction
so features are no longer defined by
requirements or demands and what we want
and where we wanted it's defined by what
outcome are we expecting from this so
what positive chains for the customer do
we want if we want to increase you know
the use of something and or some guide
so you know the teams themselves have to
figure out how do we do it it's not just
a list of you know specific things they
need to chain it's a problem they need
to solve for the customer that's what we
mean by outcome thank you yes exactly
and we see that initiative actually
bringing now out from teams they are
suggesting things that can be done
features some mostly user oriented now
it's mostly developers that see that oh
I can see users are moving this way
through our system maybe we should
change this they are doing other things
for instance by themselves looking into
how can we generate data that can show
us more about how users are progressing
and how can we meet the user so they go
out and see how users are working they
do field studies now so they do a lot of
things but most important they're doing
the short feedback loop so they get
constant feedback from users and this
it's not just for the Danish guys these
are also Indian guys that come up here
and they go out and they see how the
program is being used and they do it
through our Danish so colleagues of
course if they are hindered from doing
so so they have a lot of short feedback
loops and they actually know what change
they're making as you saw from Sonja the
video you just saw she actually is very
concerned about what value she generates
it's a big motivation driver for her and
for when she is building stuff so the
main part here is what's most important
this outcome but also people are
actually having fun right so in every
rich respect we are trying to evaluate
ourselves if we're having fun working in
in this framework and if we if we remove
the first
two months then after a couple of months
people are not just happy they're super
excited they respond well that they're
role models in having fun right so and
that's a big driver for motivation as
well and especially for the quality that
you generate when you write so what can
you take away from from our talk yeah I
think one thing I learned is that you
know the safe framework is actually okay
also on what I would call a smaller
scale this is not hundreds of teams
right you could definitely do without a
framework just having these four teams
work together but you know you know it's
it's it's okay actually with some
guidance especially if you're starting
from miscrits
like we did it gives you some you know
some structure on how to make alignment
so that you can easy decentralize the
all the decisions down to the teams and
be comfortable that they actually
understand what we are trying to achieve
here that was definitely part of this
journey too I think that in the
beginning all the IT developers had no
clue about the business so we needed to
sort of you know it you know expand
their their mind about what is this and
and that takes times also yes and
another major part of this is also
funding long-living team so you invest
in people right the only invest in scope
on projects you invest in people and
once people feel valuable in the way
that they are they can see that hey we
don't really know what you're going to
do for the next year but we know you're
going to do something that is valuable
then you have that freedom and you have
that motivation to be vulnerable and to
change and you're not very worried about
the stuff that I'm doing something that
will also be something I'll be able to
work on no you will be able to work on
what matters and people trust that you
can now understand what matters so as I
said a lot of ideas in lean eyetality
and safe gives you shared mental models
of common vocabulary that's definitely a
benefit but again remember that safe is
not an
when end-goal it's not the you know the
goal in itself it's just a pragmatic
starting point something you know to
start from and the last part of it is
that the framework should not be viewed
as a static framework it is a framework
that will generate the options for you
to experiment right so if you see
something that isn't working well it's
built in that you can change it and you
will talk about it you have to inspect
and adapt you have to reach respects so
you will actually be able to constantly
change and iterate and become better and
all of this makes it possible for you to
actually place the authority where the
information is and that's the team's
right so thank you thank you very much
for listening in to us and don't forget
to rate our session yeah and if you have
any questions we will happily ask them
yeah so we have 30 questions and we have
minus two minutes so I'm gonna take an
easy one does this work in an
organization that also works in
waterfall yeah good question very good
question actually yes and you have to
observe that you will be faced with a
massive challenge we are a small agile
organization within CDC and there's 300
other guys working in CTC plus 6,000 in
various other departments and they don't
work well they work waterfall they still
do we just finished our budget the
project scope for next year right so
that process is inbound now so we have a
lot of dependencies we are an upstream
application so we have some 89 critical
system that we depend on that we can't
develop on so we need to be what we do
is we invite stakeholders to our pis so
we bring stakeholders in and they will
tell
about their deadlines and how much
effort they they can put into this and
then we sort of figure out is it
plausible that they can do stuff here in
time for us to deliver something in this
program and then we plan accordingly so
we have the program board where we list
all of our dependencies and that's a
huge huge program board but it can work
of course what we have also done and
learned that we need to do is to make
alternative plans so if there are some
departments where it's a little bit
shaky whether we trust them to deliver
on time for us to also deliver something
then we will have a back-up plan of
saying ok we will also prioritize
something that we know we can start
doing if that other thing burns and
falls through so we don't sit an idle
and don't do anything so yes it can work
in a waterfall organization it will be
pretty hard
depending on how dependent you are on on
back and your bank and yeah thank you
that's all see you in 25 minutes yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
