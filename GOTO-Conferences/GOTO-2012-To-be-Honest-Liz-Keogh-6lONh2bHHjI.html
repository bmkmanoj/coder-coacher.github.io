culmination of a series of talks that
I've been doing a series of workshops
I've done to try and gather material
just for this so you guys are really
special i did a keynote called respect
for people a couple of weeks ago i
actually got into a lot of trouble on
twitter for that keynote so i'm going to
be making some probably quite pissy
sound by t quotes if you take those out
of context i will end up having fights
on twitter with people my twitter name
is up there please go ahead i wanted to
start by sharing a story because we all
think the truth is quite important right
and being honest in our working in our
processes is really important to I was
acting as release manager for this
project and it was my first essentially
management role my first time I had done
anything other than just be a depth and
we were doing something akin to scrub
very similar to scrum it's called
extreme programming it's like scrum but
it works oh so I'm going to try not I'm
going to be talking about lean later as
well so don't worry they'll get their
turn um so we were doing these
iterations and we had decided what we
were going to do for the serration and
because we had a little bit of time left
towards the end of the iteration the
devs picked up another task and another
thing they needed to do and they were
trying to take it on board but they
couldn't test it because to test the
work they done they needed another
server from the dev ops team and I went
to see the dev ops team and this was on
the the Tuesday and the end of the
iteration was on a Thursday and they
said you know what it's not going to
happen we had somebody starting that
server and he's gone on holiday and none
of us know where he's got to and even if
we started again right now it would
still take a couple of days to get it to
you and if you do find anybody you're
not going to fix them and I went don't
worry about it wasn't something we had
agreed
beginning of the sprint nobody's really
expecting this and then I was in a
meeting and there was a program manager
and he said okay so what about this
other story you know you've done all the
others what about this one that you
haven't finished yet I said oh well we
didn't agree we were going to do at the
beginning of the sprint so it won't be a
problem he said we did I said we didn't
he said yes we did ice and this was the
mistake I made I said I wrote down
everything that we agreed to it's on my
pad in the other room i can go and get
it if you want so i had a record of the
truth and towards the end of this
meeting he started behaving really oddly
he said right I need somebody to go and
talk to the dev ops team and get this
server and I said I've already done that
and they're really busy with some more
important stuff they're not going to
have the resources to get us this server
and he just turned around to the rest of
the group he said i need somebody to go
and get that server and one of the
architects eventually volunteered
everybody's feeling really uncomfortable
on monday off one of the architects
volunteered to go and get it and talk to
the dev team and afterwards i spoke to
this gentleman i said to him you know I
get that you want somebody to go and
chase this up I really have already
spoken to them any went uh-huh I said we
really need the architects here because
there's a lot of big technical things
have gone through the pipeline of
anything's wrong with them we need him
here we're very close to the end we're
about to release he should be with the
team and he went all right then and it
took me months to work out that he did
actually believe me he did believe I was
telling the truth but I had presented it
in a way which embarrassed him and he
had essentially got really defensive
about it and behaved in this strange way
towards me and it made me realize there
are some times when maybe there are
different ways to present the true
roof or different aspects to the truth
that we need to consider and then I
thought well hold on when it'd be just
nice if we could just not worry about
any of this political stuff and just be
really honest now des how many deaths
are here because this is quite a
technical conference so I thought I
would start with you guys you're pretty
rational and as a group I found not
generally interested in in lying I was a
dev I'm not really interested in line
much so I thought I would start with
some code okay and show you the kind of
things I see dead suit this is a genuine
piece of code which I thought this was a
group who were doing BDD for the first
time and they were doing this as a unit
level they asked me to come in and look
at their examples also known as unit
tests and this was what they had it
should be France Germany or Italy and I
said so what's the problem and they said
well we don't know what to do now
because this is the code returns trivets
france germany or spain like okay well
something is like right there is it the
code that's lying or what it should do
and they said well it should it did do
that but do we have to change these
names every time you change the code I
said forget what the code is actually
doing what do you want the code to do
and they said well it should tell us if
it falls under EU regulation 1426 or
something like that and while they were
talking to me I typed yeah and they went
is that it you just type whatever we say
I went BDD well done okay it turns out
that honesty is really easy when you
know what you want and you express what
you want I was talking to a friend of
mine who's a change agent earlier
today's an internal organizational
change person and he's been trying to
get the project managers to help him
with this visualization and he keeps
tell
them you know if you do this
visualization it'll be really good for
you and the project managers like we
don't need it and he says no it'll be
really good and you should do it and
they're like that he's the one who wants
it I said if you try telling them that
you want it because then they'll be like
okay you know say what you want um yeah
so they also changed the name of the
method now we know as deaths that that's
just bad code right and we're used to
going I know you're all really good
debts you'd never write anything like
that anymore but yet i have seen really
good depths walk into a room that looks
like this this is actually a picture I
drew of a real room those are all story
cards on the ball over 200 of them 640
7.5 story points or the equivalent it
was there about right so there have been
a lot of estimating went into here now
this is point where I have to be really
careful with my language because the
last talk I did I said that estimates
were lying and I got some people who
went you actually went there you really
said that I'm going to be more exact
about what I mean by that this is one of
my favorite books this is waltzing with
bears it is a tiny little book about
risk in projects if you haven't read it
please please go read it it's the most
amazing thing I actually put it on a par
with the mythical man month and it says
right at the beginning of chapter one if
a project has no risks don't do it who
is in Donald's talked earlier anyone few
people right he says rule for somebody's
already done it before if somebody has
already done it before go and get the
thing that they use to do it will go
higher there more go buy it off the
shelf don't try and solve the problem
yourself the only problems you should be
solving yourself are the ones where
there's something
new something really important you've
never done before as part of it and if
you're going to do something new that
you've never done before it's going to
be a bit risky and it might not work or
it might work the third time or the
fifth time but you can't tell me that
you know how long it's going to take now
on this project I was actually measuring
how long things were taking and we were
trying to do one week iterations I
realized that more than half of the
things we were trying to do we're taking
two weeks more so we really had no idea
how long this stuff was taking and we
were still trying to estimate it dam is
a very good friend of mine he's also
written a blog post called the perils of
estimation that talks about how he
doesn't use the word dishonest but i'm
going to dishonest 64 puts 640 7.5 story
points really is because that level of
precision gives you an understanding of
certainty that you simply don't have so
I'm going to say very carefully if
you're doing software development on a
project with any kind of value
whatsoever estimates along right at Luna
vol ok I have been lying to for years
I've been talking about this thing
called feature injection and I'm
responsible for a lot of the
anti-patterns out there feature
injection was something that my friend
Chris max came up with he's one of the
analysts who's been heavily involved in
behavior driven development and worked
quite a lot with Dan not north of myself
and he says this is how it splits up
right you have an initial vision which
is something that's going to make money
save money or protect your revenue and a
championing stakeholder comes up with
this vision and then you have these
other stakeholders whose goals you need
to address in order to go live and from
there you develop some capabilities a
system will have to have or people will
have to have users will have to have in
order to make that work and you decide
to deliver those capabilities with
features
which are actual bits of software on a
web or on a phone or a Windows console
whatever it is and you split those up
into stories to get fast feedback which
is why we have stories you can use
scenarios behavior driven development
scenarios if you're into BDD to do that
and then you get the code isn't it
pretty so what rainbow colors I like
rainbows okay here's what a real project
looks like a real project you start by
even if you're not doing the massive
break up into stories you start by
having some idea of the problem you're
trying to solve and as you go through
trying to solve it you realize you've
got a bit and then you didn't know about
this other bit and you find stuff out as
you're going through it turns out these
guys are all interconnected and then you
don't need that bit and you can't
remember what that's for and as you go
through the project you start seeing all
these discoveries that you make along
the way because there were things that
were new that you've never done before
this is what a real project looks like
yeah so the agile manifesto is also
lying the agile manifesto says we're
discovering how to build software by
doing it in helping others do it you
know what we already know how to build
software that's development you practice
doing it you go to code retreats you
learn the techniques to build software
what we're really doing and what's new
about agile is we're discovering how to
discover stuff and how to react to it
early so I have a thing that I would
like you guys to do which I believe is
more honest than most of the processes
we're doing right now and that is
deliberately call out the difference
between the stuff you've done before and
the stuff you haven't and try and do as
much of those hopes those things you've
never done before
as possible and if anybody says how long
is that going to take you turn around
them and go you want me to lie right one
of the big problems is that human beings
hate uncertainty there have been a lot
of studies done around it clinically
depressed people have more problems with
it and a lot of people but human beings
we love being certain there's a thing
called confirmation bias that I write a
lot about a talk a lot about which is
our ability to go out there with models
of what's in our head and seek for
things that reinforce those models and
we do it all the time because we're
human it's really really hard to say hey
maybe I'm wrong if you've ever gone to
get feedback from people maybe for a
yearly review has anybody ever done that
yeah don't nearly reviews with feedback
in your tie to your player awful but we
do get made to do them sometimes and you
go to your friends and you go hey would
you do my review for me it's really hard
to go to somebody that you know has a
problem with you or your work and talk
to them and say look I really want your
feedback because it feels a bit like a
kick you know it makes us feel
uncomfortable so we like being certain
about what we're doing and everything we
tell ourselves about our models is often
our like it isn't the case then Dan says
we'd rather be wrong than uncertain and
it's not just the case we would also
rather lie them be uncertain and a lot
of us would rather hear lies than be
uncertain I have heard of project high
level you know program managers see iOS
CTOs who don't like to see anything on
the rag reports a red amber green
project reports except green and if they
see anything that's not screened they
will get very angry
and the deaths in this room were
thinking year project managers how many
of you get in trouble when the bill
fails a few of you right and yeah the
bills is broken you've got to make it
green you broke the build okay if your
bills are green the entire time i would
be tempted to check something in that's
failing just make sure they're still
doing something you know what are they
there for if not to catch and and help
you um so if your build is always green
it may well be lying to you know how you
get all your tests guaranteed to be
working a hundred percent of the time
delete them please don't okay I wanted
to touch on another lie that I keep
hearing and deaths particularly this is
1 i've heard from the deaths a lot we
can't accept this into our backlog
without clear acceptance criteria is
there anybody who's worked in a team and
you don't have to tell me whether you
said this is there anyone who's worked
in a team where that's been the case
huge numbers of hands going up i count
like 20 or so um this isn't true my
favorite thing with behavior driven
development is when you're talking
through the scenarios and you talk to
your business person you go so you know
in this context when we do this thing
what should happen then they go oh I'm
not sure and then you know you've just
uncovered some uncertainty you've
uncovered that that differentiating new
thing that's so important instead of
insisting that they go away and have a
bit more of a think about it you can
collaborate with them try something else
make sure that it's really safe and easy
to change because it's going to have to
change Chris maps also says you know if
we're going to pick a technology don't
pick the right technology because you
don't know what the right technology is
otherwise you wouldn't be having to make
a choice pick a technology that's easy
to change you might know it's wrong or
think it's wrong but you're going to
have more information later sustained
call real options
keep your options open and that allows
you to hold that uncertainty so as an
example we were trying to decide whether
to go with link / SQL or own hibernate
for this project and we needed one flag
from a database for each user it was
whether they had signed an agreement or
not so rather than go with any of those
big weighty things we went a simple data
tiny lat library will not be performance
will not be maintainable but for that
little problem it was very easy to take
it out and put something bigger in later
when we have more information about what
the right answer was so all of those of
you who are using spring and start a
project and go hey let's use spring
hands up admit it yeah I think that that
is taking on too much certainty too
early you don't know whether you're
going to need it and you don't know
whether it's the right thing and it will
bite you later that's my experience
anyway ok I'm going to touch on what I
think is the biggest lie in the software
development world ever and I have heard
this on almost every single project
apart from the ones who've learned from
it and changed done right this this this
word done I've heard dense they've you
know to do in progress done and they
move it to the done column tesla's
aren't done that software it makes no
sense tesla's aren't done with it when
the testers are done with it then it
still got to go into your production
probably those bugs because if you're
doing something new you got it wrong
you've never done it before okay so
there will always be unknown unknowns
that's what causes a lot of bugs when
you release it to production you're
still not done then because now you need
to maintain it and having accidentally
brought down the garden travel site once
I can tell you that sometimes you need
to maintain it really quite fast so
you're still not done and there's still
people using it and they want changes to
it
you are not done with your software
until you've actually removed it from
production and decided you no longer
need the code right then you're done
until then somebody somewhere is still
using the thing that you wrote and
you're not done with it so if you see
this word on your boards have a think
about what's really going on and try
replacing it one of the companies which
has stopped using this word it says
startup and they they were putting it
into production and marking it done and
the business said you know what that's
really winding us up because we still
don't know at that stage whether
anybody's using it or not so we're going
to call it a waiting validation and
we're going to have another column which
we're going to split for features we've
deleted and features we're keeping they
deleted features how magic is that so no
it's not okay right I'm I am going to
pick on lean in a moment don't worry
user stories hands up who uses user
stories is there anybody who's not on an
agile project or at least something
that's pretending to be an agile project
fantastic so you all you all know half a
hand you all know what a user story is
right okay here's it here's a user story
as a user I want to fill in the capture
box no wait hold on okay they're not
always for users I have a UX guy come to
me and say no that you should always be
thinking about the users first you
should get cater to their needs first
worry about everything else later I said
great can you take the adverts of them
please a lot of the time our user
stories are not for the benefit of the
users I actually got a blog post where I
talked about this they're not user
stories remember that I said there were
other stakeholders whose goals you
needed to achieve to go live it's for
them their stakeholder stories so resist
the urge to go as a user and try and
work out who's actually going to benefit
from it I wanted to share this template
with you because I think it's quite
helpful this is again Chris mats it's
the feature injection template that he
uses and he puts the stakeholder goal
first in order to achieve some goal or
some sub gullible leads to it as a
stakeholder I want somebody else to do
some stuff that's honest I want the
users to fill in capture boxes so i
don't have to moderate the site right if
you if you're concentrating and trying
to phrase it in terms of the user every
time i guarantee some of those you're
lying and you're lying on the user's
behalf don't do that okay I actually saw
this on a web site the other day leans
next okay I'm not only going to talk
about that all right metrics this is
this is lean right so lean likes
evidence lean doesn't lie lean loves
metrics and one of the things that the
lean software development community like
to do is they talk about looking
historically at your real data and from
your real data you can tell what your
variance is and and how quickly you'll
be able to do things and they've got
this thing where this is a normal
distribution curve so your software
falls into this normal distribution of
some things as small as something's a
large but mostly they're in the middle
so you can use the two sigma 2 times the
standard deviation and go well about 75%
of our stuff falls under this line no
you can't it turns out that the software
and this is from data that company
called rally came up with I'm quite good
friends with a lot of the rally guys and
they actually measured with a big
customer what the distribution was like
and they found some really interesting
things they started mapping on a graph
dates on which stories or features were
completed and the height represented how
long they've been in playful it's
actually story length Robbins
sorry of mislabeled axis which is also
lying and really bad thing to do and
they found this really interesting
phenomenon it turns out that more things
are completed on a Monday than any other
day of the week because des don't like
to check in on a Friday afternoon right
it things like that completely skew the
data so when you're actually doing these
distribution curves with your data it's
not real data its data that users have
already lied to you about that devs have
lie to you about because they didn't
mark it done because they didn't want to
check it in because it was friday
afternoon so the distribution is not a
normal distribution it turns out they
did an experiment with it and they said
if you were to put aside a hundred
thousands to compensate people every
time you failed your service you'd be
short by 400,000 every time you failed
to get something in before when you said
you would it's five times as bad as you
think it is so it's not ninety-five
percent of our stories come in it's
seventy-five percent of our stories come
in and a lot of them are over this this
line that we think should be two times
the standard deviation or but whatever
than 95 percentile line is and they
plotted these percentile lines on the
dates graph and they were all over the
place absolutely all over the place so
we can't even trust the real data we're
getting there is one piece of data that
surely has to be accurate right odd
count we know that bag counts when they
go down it's good when they go up it's
bad okay I'm going to tell you a real
story might see this little company and
this is a company that I thought what
they were amazing they came to extreme
to say Club in London the couple of them
and they said well we're really nervous
to be here because we've kind of self
trained ourselves and we don't know
whether we're agile enough to belong
here
you know I've been blogging recently
about humility these guys were pretty
humble we don't know whether agile
enough I said how often do you release
they went to three times a day I went to
your life environment they went yeah I
think you'll find I don't care what your
process is you're fine um and it turns
out they had quite an experimental quite
a curious nature to all the people in
the company and they found it curious
that they had quite a hide by count and
they wanted to solve this so what they
did was they hired another dev and
rotated an existing development member
through the role of bug fixing so an
experienced guy was bug fixing and they
were training up the new one as part of
the team and I can't went down yay and
this was working so well they hired a
second death and did the same thing put
him in the team bring another
experienced dev and rotating through
this bug fixing role just see experience
debt but come went up wasn't the dev was
bad he's doing a good job wasn't that
you know the team had grown to be
unwieldy that seemed fine they finally
looked where the bugs were coming from
and it turned out that the users had
noticed they were fixing the bug so
they'd started reporting them the bug
counts they had previously was only the
ones they'd noticed it was like right we
we have so much dishonesty in our
processes but there is a clue in that as
to how we can create an environment in
which we're more honest making it easy
to be honest making it safe to be honest
can help us to say we don't know this is
our reported bug account making it easy
for the users to report bugs guess your
counter is going to go up peroneus
happens when you put a policeman on the
beach report a crime goes up to
so I'm going to share something which i
have used a lot this is the prime
directive for retrospective and the idea
is the prime directive is it should make
it safe regardless of what we discover
we understand and truly believe that
everyone did the best job with they
could give them what they knew at the
time their skills and abilities the
resources available and the situation at
hand we understand and truly believe
that we all did the best job we could
and my friends buyers mayor who I
respect turn around went know you don't
actually believe that it's like right we
don't sometimes we performed
magnificently other times we mess up and
mostly we're somewhere between the two
extremes when you accept that then you
might be able to move on but as long as
you're pretending that you all did a
really amazing job consistently the
entire time you were working in you were
never tired and you never went out to
the pub very late the night before you
would do to do your talk it's great you
know we we are human and accepting that
is really important as well i think when
i did the respect for people talk i
ended it with a plea for forgiveness we
are human we will make mistakes we will
even tell ourselves lies so that their
convincing when we tell them back it's a
normal human thing I can actually see
that slide oh it is fine there we go it
looks like it was messed up on my thing
ok I want to share a little bit more of
a story around safety and retrospectives
because it's really important to me this
is a safety check that I normally do
when I'm with a team and it's just
numbers from one to five where five is I
feel really safe to express my opinions
and one is I'm just going to pretend
it's really safe which is the worst kind
of safety you can have and I did this
with this team and the project manager
scribbled five on the post-it note threw
it in the middle and all the rest of the
team went five is fine and he said get
on really well it's not a problem so the
next time i did a retrospective with
them i said to them we've got some
offshore guys for do to come
the week after i would like to practice
this with you properly okay what I'm
going to do is I'm going to make sure
you all use the same post it same pens
Sharpie pens and you're going to fold
them so that nobody can see it you're
going to write it in private and then
pass them to me and the first one we
unfolded was a fall and the project
management who wrote that I said can we
do this properly from now on their bike
here and there were three is in there
there were a couple of 5s but and it was
still really valuable to have the
retrospective but it was obvious that
not everybody felt they could be honest
and knowing that was really important
and it started making people consider
whether they were being respectful
enough whether they were being open
enough so the biggest plea that I really
want to give to you guys today is this
don't let your process hide your
ignorance hiding your ignorance will
cause you to be dishonest about things
if you look at wikipedias definition of
a lie it has like 15 different
categories and there's one where you
pretend to have more certainty about a
subject than you actually should and
Wikipedia refers to that is
right don't do that if you are uncertain
and try and find out how uncertain you
are imagine how uncertain you could
because there is stuff you don't know
that you don't know and share that
uncertainty as honestly as you can I was
thank you I was asked as part of a stand
up the project manager we were another
project and two months to the deadline
and the pn said to us she's had done
guys do you think you're going to make
the deadline and nobody responded which
as far as I'm concerned is it you know
there's there's a message in there in
love itself but you know are we going to
make it we're going to make it right
I said well I'll tell you what guys how
about we vote one if you think we're
going to make we're not going to make it
to if you think we might make it and
three if you think it's not going to be
a problem 1230 everybody in the ring
voted ones with a few tues some twos I
got in so much trouble for doing that it
was unbelievable so have the courage do
it anyway there is nothing wrong with
discovering information there is nothing
wrong with sharing the truth see if you
can find ways to make your environments
forgiving and safe so that you can show
that truth and don't let the process
hide your ignorance thank you very much
so I've left I have left plenty of time
for questions because I really like
having conversations about this stuff um
excuse me do any of you guys have any
questions do you want me to tell any
more outrageous stories I've got a few I
know Dan north so there's there's plenty
there what's the luna 4 ok so um luna 4
is the dragon that eats the moon in the
lunar eclipse and it's a really
important symbol for me because this
this red moon when there is a lunar
eclipse I remember my mum waking me up
at two in the morning when I was a child
so we could go out and see the lunar
eclipse the full moon is brilliant and
bright and very beautiful and we see it
every single month and nobody pays the
same attention to the full moon that
they do to the eclipsed one it's not
about the brilliant stuff you can do
it's about the different stuff that you
do and this is another part of this
message about discovering the risk
discovering the differentiators
discovering the things that are new that
nobody else has done so please go do
that because you're human beings and
you're awesome any other questions how
can you improve the honesty culture in
company um first of all I think it is
really important to have personal
resourceful pneus so I will occasionally
play the political game if I am feeling
a bit under the weather and I did take a
lot of flack off of twitter for the last
talk and I felt really down afterwards
and then I wasn't on Twitter for a bit
because I didn't want to have those
conversations anymore so if you feel
like you need to withdraw do that it's
perfectly ok get yourself some sleep
don't stay out drinking till two in the
morning especially not with Dan and you
know be forgiving to yourself and
recognize when you're not in the right
frame of mind is especially important I
think if you're giving feedback or
looking for feedback for yourself to
have a state of mind where you have some
resourcefulness of your own otherwise
it's really hard to be
brutally honest with people second try
and give other people that resourceful
this as well try and make their lives
easier and more friendly and more fun
and I am disrespectful but I try to do
it for humor of reasons and I apologize
for it sometimes especially to a scrum
community who I've tweeted about a lot
this week sorry guys scrum make you do
this commitment thing and that really
bugs me because that process says we
want you two to say that you will finish
this stuff and if there's things that
you've never done before in it you can't
make that commitment honestly and I
think that is dishonest to make a
commitment about stuff that you've never
done before you can do spikes and tine
box them and maybe you'll get more
information out of it but I'd much
rather just say you know what let's just
do all the risky stuff first I guarantee
if you do to all the risky stuff first
on a project your velocity measurements
will be like this all over the place and
they will not give you useful
information because you have no idea how
long it's going to take to do things and
your estimates will all be lying right
so be careful with some of those scrum
processes that cause you to force to
have those lives and make promises that
you can't keep if you want to really be
honest get those resourcefulness get the
forgiveness in the process if somebody's
having a go at you for missing your
commitments at the end of a scrum sprint
suggest to them that all's going to
happen is the devs are going to start
estimating higher and if that's what
they want they should carry on but it'll
still now the estimates relying even
more well done most project managers to
actually get that they're not promises
their estimates get the forgiveness into
that process and be an example of it
yourself be brave be courageous stand up
for the things that you know people are
lying about right
and pay attention to you build it's your
friend what if the truth puts people's
jobs at risk there's a thing that
Wikipedia phone refers to in his
emergency lie and the example they use
is you know you know where a husband's
wife is but you're not going to tell him
because he's going to beat her up that
was the example ladies in Wikipedia if
you're going to tell the truth and
people are going to get fired I honestly
think that's going to happen anyway all
you're doing is hiding the information
if you have that information maybe some
of them will go hey our jobs are at risk
let's go rescue this or hey we should go
find some other job somewhere else there
was a lovely little software house that
I went and visited and they were doing
really really well for a long time but
then the market changed and they
recognized that they were not going to
be able to get the work in and closed
down making sure that all their staff
could go to their next job and help them
find those new jobs and they closed down
while they were still in profit without
having to go into administration or
anything like that and I reckon that was
really honest behavior and that must
have been a hard conversation to have
with the stuff but they were honest
about it while I was at thought works
thought works were also pretty honest
every time there was any kind of
marketing balance or problem they would
tell us about it and we had access to
any information and there was never
really panic there was a lot of of
bitching and people you know trading
insults but that's thought workers for
you I'm an ex oh I'm as bad as they are
as you can tell any other questions I
had a lovely quote the other day which
was I can't remember who said it they
don't want a quarter-inch drill they
want a quarter inch hole the customer
doesn't want to know how uncertain
something is he wants you to help him
solve a problem and there may be easier
ways of solving that problem there are
ways of trying things out and
experimenting with them to solve the
problem and I think in a large scale you
can say hey we reckon we can solve that
problem for you in this span of time so
in the perils of estimation taught that
then the blog post that Dan's written he
says if he wants to estimate how long
it's going to take to write a particular
webpage she finds aight guys who've
written a similar size thing gets them
into a room and goes how long do you
guys reckon it's going to take and i go
6 10 to 1 year and he goes great and
that's about as accurately as you can
estimate and there's still uncertainty
inherent in it you know there is risk I
don't think you can ever hide it but
what you can do if you're honest about
the uncertainty and if you're doing it
up front first is to say hey guys this
is going to be way harder than we
thought it is it was it's simply not
going to be possible no it's why the
guaranteed success with agile really
winds me up because I agile does not
guarantee success if you're doing it
well it guarantees that you'll find the
failure fast and you will find failure
because there's stuff you that's new and
you've never done it before and some of
it won't work the first time so agile
guarantees failure lots until you
happened to find one that isn't fairly
well done now you can release and it's
all good well except that it isn't if
you're me and bring the Guardian travel
side down that was a data bug by the way
it was some we were releasing to an
environment that was production like and
it turned out that was also a lie who
knew is that answer the question sorry I
did say I was going to repeat the
questions I hope I've made sense to the
video up back any other questions
I keep telling other speakers you know
repeat the question guys as soon as it's
me I'm like oh yeah no completely
forgotten what do you do about gaming
the system what do you do about gaming
system if you have a lot of honest
people I actually dare to talk about
this I don't know if any of you guys
have seen as it's called learning and
perverse incentives the evil hat and I
have an evil hat it's a big black top
hat and I wear it for that talk I
metaphorically put it on when I was with
a company this was a big hedge fund
right big international hedge funds and
they were having a meeting to discuss
their kpi's and they they had worked out
that measuring deaths by the number of
lines added was a bad thing to do so
they were going to measure death by the
number of lines they'd changed and they
were going to measure the PM's by the
number of obstacles they removed from
the path of their team and they invited
me because they knew i was quite into
gaming things and into kpi's I'm antique
api's but I had some opinions about them
so I into them in that way and I SAT
there just watching them come up with
all these metrics and towards the end
they said so this what do you think I
said can I put my evil hat on they said
your what now my evil hat right here's
what I'm going to do if you give me
these KPIs and even if I don't have my
evil hat on that is making me gain those
kpi's I'm going to do it anyway because
subconsciously I will believe that this
is how you value me i'm going to rename
a class that you sell through the system
because you know people lie in their
class names and i'm going to correct it
only I'm human so I'll have got it wrong
and I'll change it back because my turns
out my mate Dan is right most of the
time so I'm going to change it all back
so that's five hundred thousand lines of
code great as a PM what I'm going to do
is even worse right I'm going to get my
mate in dev ops to just put all of the
tickets for my teen to the back
of the coup unless I come bug him about
them and remove those obstacles and if I
see an obstacle coming I'm not going to
stop it hitting the team I'm going to
wait till it's hit the team and then I'm
going to remove it so get my brownie
points now you might think that PM's
don't behave this way I'm going to tell
you another story I was I was in this
project and this was one of the most
weird places that I've ever worked the
person who had hired me for this said he
opened the fridge one when he got there
and he went to get some milk out the
fridge and discovered every single
person had their own bottle of milk with
their name on right as collaboration for
you but this this organization this
scrum master newly trained scrum master
he come from a development role had been
trained as a scrum master and he said he
was nervous he said this really weird
thing has just happened I got this email
from this other project manager not
somebody I know at all he's holding an
emergency meeting to rescue the project
I said but you're going life next week
yep and it looks fine you don't need
rescuing yep well what did he say and he
says we've got too many bugs and he gave
us a bug list from the previous week as
to be fixed all of those yep and he must
have told him that yeah and he says
there's no chance that we can possibly
have fixed them all so he's going to
hold an emergency meeting to rescue the
project and I thought about it I thought
what it would take for a project manager
to wade him with their sight lines into
somebody else's business you know and I
asked did they give bonuses for rescuing
projects here said it's really funny you
should say that
all these project managers circling each
other's projects like vultures quite
quite insane it turns out that at a
higher level the way they got projects
incepted in the first place was that if
your project was really good and people
liked it you would get a bonus and
unfortunately the guys who got to submit
the projects were sharing the bonuses
with the guys who got to accept the
projects and so there were lots of
projects first law of economics people
respond to incentives here this is David
by the way he and I had a great
conversation about anthropology last
night as well as some illegal drugs
which we were talking about not taking
and effects he might have been I like
beer and coffee and chili sauce just in
case anybody was looking to buy me a
drink or or give me a present tabasco is
good amazon do giant bottles of Tabasco
they sell everything that's not a lie
okay and anyone else got any questions
with time brilliant thank you very much
for coming guys enjoy the enjoy the
