is actually a talk about dating patterns
and I think that dating patterns are
relevant not only because I think we
should breed more geeks but also because
I think it's relevant also just for
normal communication between people and
I'm not saying that the present company
cannot communicate but maybe you have
some friends or brothers or sisters who
have problems and then you can tell them
what you heard today so i think i'll
start off with what I'll call a big
disclaimer this this is a talk where I
have to generalize a lot i have to say
men are like this women are like this
and of course they are not all like this
but I have to make it I had to simplify
it a bit to get my points through all
right so if you start getting it so that
just think that this is something that I
had to do but it's okay to be insulted
so this is this is what I'm actually
going to tell you as I said this morning
it's the female API I'll give you a
moment to read this
so this is what will happen in the next
15 minutes or at least I'll give you an
introduction and then you go out and
read the book so I'll give you an
example of a dating pattern it's called
the Cary Grant helper I don't know why
the AV is doing that but i'll just talk
over it so i don't know how many of you
know what a design pattern is right how
many of you have written a design
pattern right so so you know about the
literary form of design patterns they're
sort of there's a way of writing a
design pattern and one thing which is
very important is the problem domain or
the context in which it is and here the
problem by name domain is you want your
services to be regarded as superior and
appealing prior to and during
conversational state and during sessions
particularly those you want to be
stateful right we talking about stateful
and stateless sessions in these dating
patterns if some other peasants can be
used for both this is mostly for for
stateful patterns then if you remember
Christopher Alexander's original
patterns about building architecture he
talked about forces and these were real
physical forces what you need to keep
the roof on on the on the house would
you need how big windows should we have
to get enough lighting so these are the
forces that we have in in patterns and
we have the forces here again in the
dating patterns it's a client's market
meaning it's the women who decide and
that's why all you men look so good
that's because it's a yeah well and
women want women want classic romantic
implementations even though they've
forgotten all about it because of the
emancipation is actually deep down in
our system call what we really want the
solution is to use Cary Grant helper to
apply the rarely used but stable and
reliable set of politeness rules by
implementing gentlemen one point oh and
if you look like this while you're doing
it is even better do you know Mae West
how many of you know Mae West yeah she
is great and once she said about Cary
Grant was if it speaks I'll have it so
he looks good apparently I mean
according to somebody like Mae West but
as it is with patterns you know that the
solution that you get is an abstract
solution
it can be difficult for you to implement
the abstract solution in your particular
problem domain and that's why you get
some specific strategies or code samples
as it is to help you implement this
strategy so so some of the strategies is
is to hold the doors and and to pull out
chairs for for the women and let her
order first and pay her compliments and
and and when it comes to compliments
there's something quite important I have
to say some people think oh maybe she's
had enough compliments that it's not
really applicable I mean it can never be
enough compliments if you just go ahead
and how many compliments have you paid
today let me see a show of hands fingers
how many compliments have you paid to
women today 10 55 Wow okay more than I
thought but that's it but you can use
both hands tomorrow maybe another thing
about compliments is that women women
put particular attention to the
compliments that they don't hear often
so if it's a beautiful woman she's hurt
that she's beautiful many times so try
complement her for something else try a
compliment of the compliment if you know
what I mean try giving her a compliment
for her for her width or for her
intelligence or something else and it's
vice versa if she's very intelligent
she's probably used to hearing she's
intelligent but maybe it's nice to be
complimented for the but just for once
or something like that benefits and
drawbacks you cannot hold the chair for
everybody it's how it is with patterns
is the patterns are solutions to
recurring problems so in that case they
have the benefits that they solve the
problem but they also have the drawbacks
and in particular domains the drawback
can be more or less weighing in again
you can use you say you use unix when
everybody else is using windows so you
have a benefit they're related patterns
also as it is sometimes a pattern has a
drawback and then you can solve it by
using another pattern and that's why we
have the section called related patterns
we have here fifth position break which
is about dancing I'll talk about that
later interested listener which is about
how to actually listen and that's an
important one chord pattern I'll get
into later and decorated visitor honey
pot more about that later but let's talk
about where it all starts
it so my PhD was in object oriented
design patterns and languages so I spent
four years of my life on this book what
I didn't know at the time was that
actually this book was written as
something completely different this book
was written as a dating pattern book and
you can see when you look at it that it
was that book before it started but the
problem was that the authors when they
were writing the book they made a lot of
experiments and they put that experience
into the patterns and when they were
writing the book they suddenly realized
if we publish this book will have no
more open source development all the
developers will be too busy during the
weekends doing you know what dating and
talking to women playing chess and and
thus they wouldn't have time to actually
do any implementation so it would be a
problem so in in the last minute they
covered it up and you can see when I go
through the dating patterns that the
names of the dating patterns actually
resembles the one in the Gulf design
pattern book that's how closely it is
related to it and luckily it apparently
was very object oriented with these
dating patterns so it worked very well
with the object orientation and let's
take another pattern fifth position
break so the problem is you want to
easily find women and create sessions by
exposing desirable services and
attributes the point here is you want to
be able to do it easily you don't want
to work very hard that's something that
goes on in the context and the problem
domain for all these peasants you want
it to be easy to date these women the
forces are women love dancing in general
and very few men engage in this behavior
I'm sure some of you can recognize this
so these are the forces that go into the
to the problem so the solution is to use
fifth position break to meet and impress
an extensive number of women on demand
but again how do you do that actually
and then we have some strategies oh yeah
that's a picture of somebody dancing it
doesn't have to be that good but if it
is it's it's okay so the strategies are
there's no business like show business
this is a strategy where you bring one
of your good friends maybe with your
dancing partner to a party or somewhere
out of town and you dance all evening
just with her and you do it like a dream
and then you go home and then you come
again next week and they remember you or
you can also just dance with her almost
all evening and then just stand in the
bar like this and wait because they will
be curious another thing to make them
more curious is swinging with girls of
unknown pleasure this is an interesting
strategy because it means that you have
to really think about what you do so you
go to the party or or wherever is you're
going and then you dance with all the
women all the women even the ones you
don't want even a stateless session with
you dance with all of them it has two
effects one is that the women who
normally doesn't get to dance they are
very flattered that you want to dance
with them and the other effect which is
even more interesting is that the women
who are normally really very busy on the
dance floor will think why is he dancing
with her and not with me and that will
spike her interest and curiosity and
curiosity is very important when it
comes to to wooing women benefits and
drawbacks it's a magic button for
creating instant dating objects so
that's the lesser benefit it's really
really easy but it requires significant
resource investment of time and money
which means it's hard to learn to dance
and for some of you it might sure turn
out to be even harder than for some
others of you so it's really hard to
learn to dance and but when you do it's
almost like magic related patterns
exposed collector engage in a variety of
activities to meet women one of these
could be dancing so you could say that
the fifth position break is a sub
pattern of the exposed collector and
also pan-dimensional Renaissance
differentiator where you have a variety
of skills and interests to show off with
I'm not going to go into detail with
these two patterns you have to buy the
book so the next one is surprised state
fulness the problem is you want to
convince the target female that you're a
package of extremely desirable resources
and differentiate yourself from other
dating service providers it's it's it's
actually unique that you have to
preciate yourself because women see men
as sort of a sea of men they're all the
same so you have to really stand out and
do something that they do not anticipate
this is what you have to think about
what is it that I can do that other men
cannot do and this could be it the
forces are that women you men are
somewhat self senses I don't know where
we get that from it's really a crazy
idea but some of us think that you are a
bit self-centered and like talking about
yourself and thus women assign
significant value to a man who takes the
trouble to make her private data
persistent and when I say persistent I
mean more than three weeks if you can
remember what a woman has said to you
for more than three weeks you will stand
out and be a significant dating service
provider so the solution is to use
optimistic persistence to implement
explicit storage and retrieval of her
private attributes and again I'll go
into the strategies for this two main
strategies are the standard text
retrieval strategy which means she said
she bought a little poppy a cute little
dog or a kitten and then you ask her how
is the kitten doing or have you walked
the dog go what do you do with it when
you go on vacation so it's just a text
retrieval strategy you can also use the
object and Cynthia instantiation
strategy where if she said that she
would she like to play with a hula-hoop
bring maybe you buy a hula-hoop ring for
her or if she said that you really like
this band you can buy a CD for her with
that band or maybe even tickets she
could take and go with a friend which is
also called the big fat encapsulated
opening and I'll come back to that later
the benefits and drawbacks is it takes
considerable investment up front and I
think you should just take one minute
talk to your neighbor what is it this
considerable investment upfront talk to
you enable for a minute and I'll take
some water if you don't have a neighbor
just talk to yourself
maybe you can take notes
okay that's that's my minute come back
anybody what is the investment that you
have to do up front yes that is actually
so true you have to apply a lot of other
patterns beforehand to know enough of
the person have you have you read the
book anything else that was actually not
what's ours that that's not what the
teacher was thinking somebody else
please come up with something what is
the investment yes yeah let's that could
be that could be expensive but what I
was actually thinking was that you had
to listen to what they're saying which
is which gives considerable investment
up front but we have a person for that
it will give you a corresponding high
return really it will because they they
do not expect that they'll be like he
remembered that Wow not even my hospital
I mean that would never have related
patterns interested listener talk about
that later so interested listener the
problem is you want to enter and
maintain conversational state with the
client high quality request-response
cycles without exhausting system
resources so this is where your point
came in this is another pattern that we
have to apply first you're perfectly
right the forces are that as you said
without knowledge of attributes
maintaining conversational state is
difficult talking to another person can
be boring on the other hand talking
about yourself is always interesting and
you can use these forces when you're
talking to a woman so what you do is
that you get the public or private
attributes by calling standard getter
methods and with these in hand you run
more complex methods and you you
understand that because I'm I'm speaking
the language right but let me just get
into the strategies anyway so you could
ask her for directions or information
you could ask her about her book you
could ask her advice about something but
you have to implement look as if you're
listening while you're doing it
because if you haven't implemented that
interface nothing works it doesn't
really matter how much you're listening
if you're like mmm mmm it is not good
enough right so these are the strategies
the benefits and drawbacks it's easier
than think of something clever or
haven't I seen you here before cuz they
those methods they don't give very good
return parameters but sometimes your
data is stored in a friend zone cookie I
don't want to ask how many of you have
had your data stored in the friend zone
cookie but I suspect may be like thirty
percent of you in the book there is also
weighs about how to come out of the
French zone state if you're actually in
the friend zone which i think is rather
remarkable I thought it was not possible
rated patterns is a dating savent and
just to show you that the interface I
talked about look like you're listening
I'm going to show you a picture from
from a movie where you can see a man
listening to a woman can you see he's
listening to the woman yeah he's sort of
bending forward open mouth eyes on her
you can see the men in the background is
actually also listening to the how many
of you remember this movie how many of
you remember the scene it's this scene
you remember it now so that's why is
listening radio right yeah so if we talk
about that all the time you will be
listening you can see everybody else is
also listening but let's look at another
unexpected resource God is also a very
good dating pattern the forces that that
go into this is sorry the problem is you
want to find women and establish a
conversational state that can lead to
sessions with minimal effort again you
want to do as little as possible for
this and the forces our women are
typically colder than men and it's a
whole lot easier to use a social
engineering approach than to try to
better down her firewall with the
frontal assault and that means that
instead of just asking for her phone
number what you could do it you could
lend her an umbrella if it's raining and
then you could your phone number is of
course already in the umbrella something
like that or you can have chocolate or
headache pills or something like that so
the solution is initiate connections
using needed
resources unavailable to the target so
if the target needs something you can
have that in your backpack and it could
for instance be as i said before
headache pills it could be whether
things like the umbrella could be food
it could be children entertainment if
she's got children with her benefits and
drawbacks and they are hard storage
limits you can't have anything in your
backpack you have to think about what
will the weather be like what kind of
women will I meet do what I want to have
a single woman with children then I
should bring the toys and if not maybe I
should not have those things with me you
have to have the context awareness as
well there might be some things that you
can introduce to some women that might
offend them even though you think that
she needs it right now you can think
about what that could be but I won't say
anything related patterns decorated
visits a honey pot you can create
interesting environments and the
go-to-guy be the one with the answers
the go-to guy is be the guy who is nice
with the answers instead of the guy who
is like we well we heard in the morning
he know that there are some men in the
industry who looks down on people who
know less than them and there you see
that also with system administrators in
some companies so if you can be the
go-to guy that the women can ask for
help with different things it actually
also helps the other way I have been the
go-to girl at a company where people
would ask me for help so it doesn't have
to be that gender-based the decorated
visitor honeypot is one of my favorite
patterns the problem is you want to
connect to and create conversational
state with women but you want them to do
all the work we have it here again the
forces are they are women in your
general realm you have to have women
nearby otherwise this pattern will not
work and women notice their surroundings
much more than men they notice little
differences they notice chocolate they
noticed pictures they noticed things
that are cute much more than men so you
can take advantage of that a solution is
to establish an appealing novel
environment and thus externally
initiated connections what does that
mean externally initiated connections
means that the women come to you to talk
to you you
have to go outside of your cubicle and
talk to them they will come in to your
honey pot and talk to you and how do you
do that well there's some different
strategies as i said before chocolate
preferably very expensive chocolate
wrapped in glitter paper works really
well interests if you if you have like
if you've been climbing Mount Everest be
sure to have a picture of you climbing
Mount Everest you could also Photoshop
bed of course you could have pictures of
kittens actual kittens are better
pictures of babies actual babies are
better but not in your cubicle maybe you
can decorate yourself t-shirt with the
finish saying a t-shirt where she has to
ask what what is that why why does it
say something so weird and things like
that so anything that could initiate a
conversation again piqued her curiosity
benefits and drawbacks it's not cheap
expensive chocolate is not cheap and all
of the climbing Mount Everest and buying
a motorcycle can also be rather
expensive women will be initiative so
that is definitely the benefit you get
from this pattern they will come up and
ask you will talk to you about things
related patterns the unexpected resource
guard of course and the go-to guy be the
one with the answers again they'll come
to you and ask you does anybody here
have a decorated visitor honey pot in
their cubicle yes what do you have mmm
does it work good thank you I'm glad to
hear that there's some things that I
should have set here when it comes to
applying that I created reason to
honeypot if you have photoshopped that
picture of you with Mount Everest it
could backfire because if she is
actually a rock climb and she wants to
take you there you could die so think
about how much you want to photoshop
your interests and your skill set bridge
interpreters also very very important so
the problem is you want an accurate API
for the female platform and here I'm not
thinking about the general API that I'm
giving you right now I'm thinking for a
specific platform what is the API for
this platform that you're interested
the forces are that it's difficult to
understand the female operating system
and women would typically not divulge
any information to a man they're in
dating state with on the other hand
there'll be more than willing to divulge
a great deal of accurate current
information to a man they're not in the
dating stage with so they're more than
willing to talk about their friend at
what she likes and dislikes actually
which you can use to your benefit so the
solution is to connect to an interpreter
object in a non dating context and
obtain accurate data about this lady so
the strategies is to obtain this bridge
interpreter it could be a co-worker it
could be a girl friend of the friend and
use the bridge interpreter get advised
about clothes get it lies about
interests get advice about how to date
her and what to tell her what kind of
compliments does she always get give her
other kinds of compliments benefits and
drawbacks you may need more than one
bridge interpreter because you if you're
taking all your advice from one bridge
interpreter maybe she doesn't have the
accurate information or maybe she's got
other issues and then she might want to
just destroy that relationship and she
will not say that if that is the point
and some spew 100 megabyte return values
and your timeout or crash so you have to
be careful who you choose the raid
patterns again the fifth is a precision
break and the interested listener and to
give you an example of bridge
interpreters how many of you remember
these girls where they from what did
they do in Greece yeah so so so they
helped telling him yeah they gave her
makeup in holes in the years so they set
her up for his ideals and the other way
around also telling him about what she
liked which meant that at the at the end
you remember the intense where she was
dressed up like a really like fiery hot
woman I don't know what you would say
and he was dressed up like a nice
son-in-law and they're sort of so you
have to really think about if you use
the same preach interpreter and what
kind of rich interpreter sure you're
using
I'm going to go through some some
peasants just give you some examples of
what you can do so there's there's a
very core pattern is called half bad boy
+ protocol and this pattern is about the
fact that women in the in decor system
are interested in bad boys because if if
we can find somebody who is willing to
risk their life in some way and still
have survived they must have very strong
genes and we can't really look away from
that on the other hand we want them to
have protocol we want them to be nice
and sweet to us so half bad boy +
protocol is really important is also one
of the things that could take you out of
the friend zone if you are in the friend
zone you're seen as this cuddly friendly
guy and you could talk to her about
anything then maybe you could say some
of your friends could say to her
actually he used to steal cars or he he
used to be the one who who slept around
or something like that if they could
devote some some fact about you where
you're half bad boy could be interesting
for the woman again it could pique her
interest her curiosity I'll give you
some examples of a half bad boys cross
protocol again from Greece he is a half
bad boy post protocol right he is he is
really nasty he's in car races and still
he's surviving and he's in fights and
still he's surviving but he's also
wearing nice clothes and he's paying
compliments and he's holding the door
and he's trying to be nice another
example is James Dean of course he's the
ultimate half bad boy ghost protocol
yeah I just got sidetracked there so and
here's another one hand solo of course
he's a bad boy he used to be a villain
and suddenly he becomes a hero and save
the universe or something like that and
you remember that scene where where he
is where he is frozen and she says to
she says to him I love you and he says I
know I mean that's ah yeah that's really
half bad boy applause protocol and if
apparently it was just something that he
made up in the sea
there was not something which was in the
manuscript so he was actually in himself
half bad workers protocol yeah and
here's an example of where it doesn't
really work so richard stallman in many
ways a half bad boy but there's a tiny
bit lacking to actually live up to this
person there's not that much protocol
around him yes I couldn't really find
anybody in IT who were an example of a
half bad boy plush protocol maybe Elon
Musk can you think of anybody who's a
bad boy and still nice Bill Gates know
the guy from notebook
oh maybe yeah the in the movie Silicon
Valley oh that's we show yeah yeah yeah
that's yeah that's actually a good
example yes yes yeah I hadn't thought of
him i'll put him in the slides for next
time if i ever get to do this again big
fat encapsulated opening is another
pattern that i mentioned before a big
fat encapsulated opening is it sort of
if it's inviting without inviting
directly so it could be for instance
that you say me and some friends are
going to the cinema tonight would you
like to join so that's a big fat
encapsulated opening she can choose to
come if she says no it's not
embarrassing because it's not really a
date if she says yes it's great and you
have her nearby so that you can apply
some of the patterns on her because
she's nearby skiing if you are actually
really good at skiing and and she's
saying oh I'm going skiing and I simply
don't know how to do that it's really
rude I'm afraid I'll break my leg lenzi
we've sort of say well you know actually
I'm pretty good skier and I used to be
the ski instructor in Switzerland and
then of course if it's not correct then
you have to really go on YouTube a lot
before you before you teach you how to
ski because if she breaks her leg
because of you they'll be denial of
service for a really long time the last
thing is of course to take her to a
party or a dance where you can apply the
fifth position break some some people
use them the mediator for this as well
you could be wanting her to come with
you and the friends to somewhere but you
do not dare to ask but if you're
standing together with her you could
have a friend set up to come and say hey
Eric are you coming to the party tonight
and then it'll be embarrassing and not
socially polite if you don't invite her
with you oh of course you can come as
well so there there patterns for that
you can do big fat encapsulated openings
in in many ways general advice
women are prone to eject highly
available services and pursue scarce
services as I said in the beginning you
have to differentiate yourself you have
to not be the norm of men this is built
into the operating system and cannot be
changed those once understood it can be
leveraged also you might just want to go
out there and be a stateless session
bean for a while and then you have to
think about what patterns you're you're
using think about how you want to use
them there's a word of advice you know
in the original Golf book there was a
facade pattern but you should not use a
facade pattern it can result in a
permanent denial of service because if
you for instance use the facade that
you're a depressed artist or a rich
Irishman or something like that it can
only work for so long and then some of
her method calls when resolved in the
really wrong parameters and things won't
go horribly horribly wrong thank you for
listening i appreciate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
