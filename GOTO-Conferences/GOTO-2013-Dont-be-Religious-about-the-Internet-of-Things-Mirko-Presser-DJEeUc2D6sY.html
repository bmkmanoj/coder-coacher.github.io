thing are we going to do is we all going
to stand up because we all going to sing
the Internet of Things anthem okay it's
a you know the song it's a Paul
McCartney let it be but instead of its
letter B it's going to be I OT so I rely
on you to to go with me on this one you
know I'm feeling pretty uncomfortable
right now see you ready
you
so I I stole this from a workshop that
we did at CBS sometime back it was
actually a few coincidences coming
together somebody said we should do
workshop now the guy said we should have
a song then somebody came up with this
song and in the middle of a song
suddenly blood out instead of let it be
iot and since then we call this the
Internet of Things anthem so thank you
for participating if you did hear me you
probably would have guessed that I don't
make a living singing I could try but i
think i would fail so instead i am a
researcher at the alexandra institute
and my main field is the internet of
things and i'll be talking to you about
the Internet of Things very broadly I'll
hope I'll bring it down back to sort of
the the developer level in the end
although I wouldn't call myself a
developer directly this is mainly done
by my colleague that sits over there in
the corner lesser Vesta gone so he needs
to take a lot of the credit so if I mess
it up it's his fault okay so let me get
started and just what a warning i use
these sessions as trying to sort out
what's going in my mind as well so I
don't have a pre-planned presentation as
such I just sort of go along and then
try to get actually my mind sorted so if
I change my mind occasionally on what I
say then you just have to excuse me so I
want to start off with the 19th century
and I think the 19th century we we
should sort of classify as a century of
hysteria it's a century where a lot of
stuff happened you know in 1800 the
biggest city on the planet was 1 million
people in 1899 it was 6.7 million so
there wasn't a massive urbanization
happening and this organization happened
because of different technologies sort
of sort of appeared and one of them is
for instance train the car but also sort
of infrastructures in there so we went
through a massive sort of change and
things in society sort of prepared
yourself for the modern ages you could
say industrialization one of them and
with that coming education you know
being taught the basics of reading
writing and math and if we sort of
extrapolate that a little bit you know
we always add in a little bit to our
education and what's a bit that we're
going to add now and that's probably
programming so if we move on through the
centuries we get to the 20th century and
that's for a century of depression
luckily we saw left up behind us two
great Wars or world wars and the nuclear
bomb exploding and a hydrogen bomb
exploding and several other things
happening and you know the only Savior
that we had was the 80s and that was
sort of destroyed for the Germans by
David Hasselhoff but you know it was it
was kind of depressing you know we
weren't quite ready to go for the next
step it was only sort of towards the end
of it sort of the 80s and then coming to
the 90s where we we started getting the
internet and really telecommunications
but we suddenly had the ability not just
to broadcast you know one programming to
everybody and everybody could listen to
it or the telephone where I picked up
the receiver and talked to from one end
to the other end one person is one
person suddenly we had many too many
communications for the internet and that
was at the end of the 20th century my
beard scratching and then you know we're
coming out of the 21st century and we're
not quite sure what it's going to be you
know it's a lot of time still to end to
the end of that century but at the
moment is this obsessive compulsive
behavior so Krista loop has already
talked about how being competitive
obsessive compulsive about programming
these snippets of code and I think
characterizes us quite a lot I mean 10
years ago I didn't have the need to go
back to my front door and wiggle the
handle 10 times and if I now say have
you locked your front door you might
think uh maybe not but it's sort of this
this century where we where we start
maybe having this information overload
capability overload what should we do
next you know there are so many
opportunities so maybe you have to rein
ourselves in
or we get these little whispers of
wisdom and for me these whispering words
of wisdom is you know the internal
things it's it's this massive topic it
is this great these great three words
strung together into this beautiful
sentence let's say and I mean the
beautiful most beautiful definition is
actually in these foreign characters to
us by when Jabbar which is the internet
plus the Internet of Things is the
wisdom of the earth so this is for me a
definition thing that's how i can
describe sort of the notion of it it's
very philosophical you could say but you
shouldn't solve it for anything else but
but that equation it doesn't make any
sense if you you know take the internet
of things and you know wisdom minus you
know well maybe you could get sort of a
notion of how big the Internet of Things
is if you do that because if you just
take the internet as such it doesn't
really resemble any wisdom of they were
the world you know Google is kind of the
interface too many answers to your
questions that you have but it usually
comes back with you know not necessarily
exactly what you wanted so there's still
a lot of slack there so the Internet of
Things is you know big term and this is
also why i called my my chalk that we
shouldn't be religious about it because
we always go around in the in the
research community and then when we pass
it on to the Cylons asian community that
we need a definition and I've been
working on the topic of the internet
things since 2002 and I think every sort
of three months somebody comes up with a
new definition and tries to push it
through the community usually they come
from the outside and then it's going out
and I go out with a definition and then
three months later somebody else comes
in with a new definition and the latest
one is actually by by Rand and there's
also one beforehand which is quite
interesting by IRC but I like this this
is very poetic but let's get explore it
a little bit further and just ask
ourselves some questions about it so
good night lamp who knows good night
lamp one two three four probably a few
more maybe a little bit lazy after doing
all the singing but good night lamp in
principle is a from the maker community
it's a community of people that suddenly
have the ability to make stuff because
they get given the tools to do so on one
side is of course the programming in
particular the embedded programming side
but it's also the hardware devices that
come with it so you have for instance an
Arduino or the Raspberry Pi or something
you can try out things a lot more
fluently and you have a lot of
communities around contributing with
code so you can you can try out stuff
but it's still sitting down at work
bench in soldering stuff so Alex des who
is behind the good night lamp which
unfortunately didn't get funded on
Kickstarter and make these these
beautiful lamps which is a master lamp
and then a number of children lamps and
if you turn on the math lamp the
children turn on and if you turn off the
mass lamp a turn off so the idea is that
you have a degree of connectedness
between people and becomes a gator in
the house interesting not interesting
cool design you know anybody's cup of
tea or not gun fuzz go pumps pumps or
any other sort of piece of pretty heavy
engineering or light engineering
whatever you want to call it the new
wave of that is to stick on some ICT
some information communication
technologies on voila you have this
brand-new fantastic product so you give
just a new interface to it great step in
the right direction contributing to the
Internet of Things guilty this is model
of Hilty does that ring a bell they
change their business model from
actually selling the products into
offering them as services or renting
them out a great driver for or a great
way of looking at how we can innovate in
this space so what what do all of
of those things have in common I've
already given it away several times
anyone so they're all just in sensations
of the Internet of Things in one way or
another so you can sort of justify your
own definition by just picking up one of
those and saying it's you know just in
sensation of the internet of things but
is it really is it really that because
if you look at each single one of those
let's say all those products or in
sensations of the internal things they
all sort of work in this wall garden
approach you know you have this product
and you make some money out of the
product or you make some more money out
of the product and you kind of leave
everybody around that sort of hanging
you still haven't built an interface to
that particular product that you're
making you just make a product so we
have a problem and you make solution to
it and be very very good at that we've
done that for many years so the internal
things has been around for many years
already if we if we take that as a
definition and most recently you know
I've been involved in project that make
an intelligent waste public waste to the
basket that measures fill levels of it
and then issues a route planning for the
people that need to pick up the trash
then you have the adaptive street
lighting that is depending on your
presence of people it turns itself up or
turns itself down but these are all you
know expert systems where the
application or the service is directly
connected to this technology a B or C
you know whichever is your flavor what
you prefer to work on what is happening
next and we we know that this is where
the value lies at the moment for a
business model it is to solve a problem
somebody has a pain you solve the pain
the pain never says we want to have a
system that you know encompasses
everything and so on you know we rightly
moving towards it but it's not quite
there yet and I'm getting to my getting
to the point of my talk in a minute it's
going through two more slides I think
so how I think about the Internet of
Things is about problem spaces and
solution spaces and trying to combine
those two together so rather than
thinking in these in these vertical
silos in these stacks and building these
applications on top of technology I
think of it as platforms so you have an
applications in services market let's
say that is supported by a set of
technologies that build up a platform
and in the middle there's that sits
you're sort of your value the untapped
value so the value at the beginning was
that every bit of technology that
produces a bit of data or capability
let's say and then serves an application
will service you know you stack the next
to each other it's you know just the sum
of them but now when you think about
platforms the theory is that it is
actually the value is bigger than the
sum of its pieces and if somebody can
prove that value I think they crack the
problem so the way that we approaching
it now from a former theory perspective
is actually that we with that we put two
ideas and collision course one idea is
the internal things so embedded system
sensors giving the capability of
measuring stuff and interacting with the
real world to us and the other part is
open data so we open up this capability
to pretty much everyone you can also do
it in a closed system of course and sell
it someone but we can do it to everyone
this gives you tremendous capabilities
of actually having problems solved by
many people and what's interesting is
actually that go two runs on the
principle of the verticals at the moment
so we have a open data egovernment track
in parallel to the Internet of Things
track we don't mix these communities you
need to make a choice are you more
interested in open data or you're more
interested in embedded systems or do you
want to listen to the funny german or
whoever's on the other side I don't so
but just to get you a little bit
motivated now on the on the that's a
open data side of things in August here
we have a few months back now launched
the open data office portal which now
has a whopping 50 three datasets on it
most of these datasets are PDF files or
an excel file or document of any sorts
it's not not crazy stuff you know but
it's you know it's a starting point
we're putting stuff out there and less
it's also involved in that by the way
and it's also supported by something
called made with office which is the
label of the of the smart or initiative
and what's more interesting is it's also
built on on c-can and Drupal c-can is a
is a is a an open-source software as
supported by the Open Knowledge
Foundation and it's actually run by
about 40 or so cities now worldwide it's
been adopted by the Obama administration
for their open data platform as well as
the European Commission and it's sort of
a growing open-source use of this
platform community that contributes
itself back into it but I mean what can
you do it with it so you have this these
data sets or maybe you have an API if
you're lucky where you actually get
directly asses some some data what can
you do with it so just to run you
through some examples of how people
think about this and are trying to turn
it back into the Internet of Things in
one so this is an example of what people
do with data that sort of becomes public
this is who knows this anybody okay then
I explain it you know this is okay this
is a art by Eric Fisher Eric Fisher is
an artist who who got the skill of
actually programming or doing some basic
scripting and visualization of data and
use those skills to tap into the flickr
api and then extract the picture
geographical data of the pictures that
were uploaded there as well as the
profile
who uploaded them then he categorized
them into two groups red is tourists and
blues blue points are locals and then he
created some rules like if those points
were taking ten minutes apart then you
would draw a line and then did a bit of
artistic interpretation and he comes up
with these beautiful maps and listen for
instances Barcelona and then the quote
up there is you know now we know where
our tourist goes so we know where we can
clean up our roads so this is some use
of sort of data that is openly available
Twitter people are doing a lot of stuff
with with with the social media side of
things this is a map of languages spoken
in London as the title says and the
different what you can actually read it
Spanish French Turkish I think Arabic so
you can see some sort of ideas about
this what's happening there as a great
source of source of data but they're
still not these these data's are not on
these open data platforms you still need
to have some permissions or someone
years how to use it and work with it we
also hear a noise from the Alexander's
to try it a little bit trying you know
out what what can we actually get right
now in terms of data that is out there
and it wasn't an awful lot but if you
package it visually attractively then
you can do some interesting things last
one I want to show is actually one of
the more interesting ones and I'll show
you this one actually live because I
think that sort of corresponds for I
understand as the Internet of Things and
open data quite well not my laptop can I
just use Safari am I connected
ok
ah
okay I had an old book marked so I can't
show you this one so we go to the next
slide but it's it's very beautiful it's
an animation of it so you can just
google it and you'll find it no problem
but each of those dots is moving and is
in real time showing the the tube the
places where the trains are and it's
through Transport for London API that
this is enabled and then some artistic
interpretation of it so coming back to
this so open data is a nice way of
actually then saying okay what would
work with my data but the platform was
created for documents to start off with
you know publishing Excel sheets
publishing PDFs publishing some sort of
documentary so this is where we thought
you know we have a great opportunity as
a team this was this is the gate sense
this is powered by bygone force and then
try fork and Alexandra both partners in
this in this project and we're starting
up to actually we started up and saying
okay we want to build an Internet of
Things platform just see how it sort of
works and it explore from that but we we
sort of quickly came to the conclusion
that maybe it's it's a great idea to
only look at the data so we leave all
the device management side out of the
picture for now we just want to look at
the data and so why not merge or views
the idea of having all of the sensor
information all of the capabilities from
the real world over an open data
platform and this is where we came to
mixing the open data ideas with the
Internet of Things ideas so
is it that simple yes it is and i think
i'm going to invite you now to get your
mobile phones out so all your mobile
phones so if this doesn't work is your
fault and i would like you to access
this URL i'll go back to it sorry that
was too quick for you i think i want you
to go to this URL
and you should see sort of three numbers
flickering in the top left corner and
then a line saying success below it you
would well if you were talking about
user friendliness and stuff yeah this is
not very user-friendly your fault we're
working on it so you now my sensors my
real time data and here i can see
hopefully how many people are joining
there should be more people at the
moment there's three
just refresh press refresh
three sorry
okay let's see if we have a few more
okay so we have a few more so these dots
are just people joining it doesn't work
over the Wi-Fi forgot say that one sorry
guys so let's go let's go back to this
part and then explain explain how this
actually works so it's easier when it's
your own laptop how do i click on this
stuff ok I can hear very good so this is
just the accelerometer data and that
doesn't work either now oh come on
listen okay I can't demo it so let's say
come and fix it okay it doesn't work so
let's move on to to something else what
I can do what I can show is actually
that this is very embarrassing i try to
prove the point here what i can actually
show is that the data actually gets
stored on to seek on a second instance
so we regenerating regenerating real
data at the moment onto the open data
platform the whole point was that you
could actually see the near real time
when you then when we collectively move
our mobile phones you could see just a
curve changing so if we would all hold
it still and i move it you could see it
in one second delay that this was
working nothing you know it's nothing
nothing too too fancy in that context so
we since we started it when i tested
early on it was ten thousand records so
since we started six thousand records
what included on to this list and but
the whole point was that you that you
showed that you can actually take real
time data over a platform that was
created for documents quite easily and
the whole idea is that this isn't
competing with some specialized platform
for this purpose it's competing on a
completely different level to actually
open up the capability to everybody to
interact
so putting data sources in like for
instance a mobile phone or a sensor for
that matter is as easy as as taking the
data out again and using it for another
purpose so I think I need to come back
if I'm invited for go to next year to
show the polished version of it sorry
about the shame it didn't work ok but in
principle what what was then that we can
take the mobile data and display it as a
graph nothing too fancy but we have a
vision in the indicate ins project as it
is and the ideas that we actually for a
start just thinking about the data plane
so what can we do just by looking at the
possibilities of exposing data over this
platform and getting as many people
involved and just offering up their data
if they would like to so we're talking
to a lot of smaller companies we're
talking to a lot of cities how they
would like to expose their data and put
it up onto this platform and ass then
having a group or a set of developers
around this to actually make some
interesting applications and services
out of that so we we had the proof of
concept that I wanted to show you so the
next step was it would be actually to
create a tool box that allows a larger
group of people to interact with this so
code snippets how to for instance
extract so you make a work ok we showed
we show it after I'm finished let me try
it again one more time so the tool box
that allows you then to take code
snippets and write your own applications
and services also to find out if you
have a sensor how you can easily plug it
into a platform like this and make your
own records and at a much later stage we
would then look at this this bottom
layer the IOT platform that actually
does the device level management where
you can reprogram advice look at the
security of it or check its availability
and so on we don't worry about that at
the mo so I think I'm getting to to the
end now so this is now the shameless
advertising part so gate since we're
hiring
we're looking for some people to join us
so if you would like to join the talk to
me or I'll see out over there or a
lesson and then we have also a lot of
different other activities I'm also
launching the Internet of Things comic
book and at this conference so it's a
it's a it's a little book that is
targeting actually sort of CEOs of
companies and policy makers to get an
understanding about the technology it's
very broad got some sort of
illustrations about application
scenarios but also a number of very
interesting interviews from different
researchers in the field to give their
perspective on what the what this
technology or what this sweet and
philosophy of technologies will be doing
to the world and I think with that we're
going to try the demo one more time
listen you want to come down we just
hook up your laptop yes okay I can
elaborate on the business model of the
internal things okay good you have
questions so I only answer questions
about the font size and the font
anything technical goes to lesser that's
okay what about security on
machine-to-machine communication on IOT
yeah it's a good question so if you want
n to n security you want to be on the
IOT platform side so you want to be I
then in the HCM to MTC community to
defining this or you want to be in the
Epsilon's talking about talking about
the IP end-to-end IP so you can run any
security mechanisms over the IP side of
things so yeah but for gate since at the
moment we don't worry about that part
this is an exploration about the
possibilities that we can have in
changing the business models for
companies like gone for sabash to lick
to look at how to roam a company from
out of the box into a service company
there we go we can see a graph I love
that so it's very smooth so okay it we
actually called the website throwable
data because the original idea was that
be all for our phones but I don't know
how much so you can see that there's a
slight delay with with the data that you
get there and I think we need to all do
it together so it's it's a productive in
terms of this so if we all hold it away
from us and then turn it right it might
work but so it's not the amazing thing
that this is sort of near real time and
not very good the amazing thing it is
runs over platform that was designed for
for documents so trying to combine two
to technology nicely I think that's the
end of my talk so yes and thank you les
