after lunch talk it's not just reddit
because you're probably going to fall
asleep after all the good food you had
but also because the speakers apparently
spill on themselves while they eating so
if you're bored you can just look at the
nice pictures I made on my blouse during
lunch tools and I are very happy to
share our stories with you today
so as you can see in the title don't
kill agility with agile processes and
the main thing that we want you to take
away from this today if you forget
anything else is please think less about
processes and care more about trust and
empowerment that's the main thing that
we want you to take away and then I'd
like to introduce tools I used to work
with the tools to try folk for years and
he is very special in in this industry
since he's both a very high-end
developer and also a high-end
facilitator so he's sort of a unicorn in
my view and he likes old cars Oh still
well-functioning cars beautiful in their
own right and I've seen him had a number
of old cars over the years now he's got
a Mustang he likes old machinery and
that's why we're giving this talk
together today and then you can
introduce me yeah hello and welcome to I
know I know vaanga Corey I know is a
great teacher first of all she's been
teaching on the University of Oz for in
computer science for years she is a
brilliant facilitator she has taught me
everything I know about retrospectives
so if anyone out there needs a
facilitator i know who i would recommend
and even though she is beautiful looking
she also has a dark side because first
time when i met her we have to yeah meet
up and prepare for this talk the first
thing she said was told I had a dream
about you last night and I looked at her
very curious then she said we were
standing on this stage right here right
now and we were giving this talk and
each and every one of you would walk out
of the room and then that story has
haunted me until this day so I've
prepared extra good to prevent this from
happening so with this in mind please
welcome I know thank you yep so we try
to figure out how to convey these
stories to you we wanted to tell two
stories from Denmark but we had to get
something out of it that would leave
these stories together so we thought
about well what we want to have is
people who are experts in agility and
the only expert scale I know is the
Dreyfus one so we use that one use it
for my teaching in computer science how
to become a good teacher in computer
science and first when you start doing
anything at all teaching as well as
agility
you're a novice you work with the
context three rules you know the
methodologies you know what to do you've
read the book but you can only be called
a novice because you don't really know
how to react to new situations then you
become a beginner you start going to
conferences like these seeing these
talks you hear about guidelines you hear
what other people do and you become a
little better then you become competent
in your own right you start to be able
to respond to the unexpected so now
instead of just using other people's
guidelines you can use your own
experience to tackle situations then you
come in further in the agility expertise
layers and you become what they call
proficient
now you can unconsciously solve a lot of
different problems that you didn't
expect would happen now you can react to
all different situations also new
security situations but it's still
unconsciously so you're not there yet
where you can actually be a teacher or a
coach yourself to be able to do that you
have to become an expert once you're an
expert you're able to see okay why is
this working why is this not working so
that you can tell
to other people and help them learn this
themselves and this is the scale of
expertise that we're going to use
throughout this presentation to explain
to you where our different cases should
find himself in this scale on the way to
expertise so my case is the dark case my
case is the sad case I've got a little
bit of light in the end but if you want
to hear something nice you have to wait
until tools come on stage I'm going to
talk about an enterprise culture
business with a lot of outsourcing so
they started out as an old big company
with waterfall processes and a lot of
bureaucracy a lot of politics and then
they wanted to change into at John so
they put some very experienced people on
the top and they were very good at what
they were doing they knew a lot about
agile and that comes to the conferences
of course so they had a lot of
guidelines for doing this but as I said
before it only takes you so far so this
enterprise company had come from the
novice to the beginner and that's where
I was introduced because they couldn't
understand why they couldn't come any
further up on the expertise scale why is
this not working as it says in the books
so I went there and I looked at the
different processes they had and the
methods they used and one of the things
I looked at was that they they actually
did have a test 3:09 set they wanted to
do testing they wanted to do automated
testing they wanted to do regression
test they wanted to do all the right
things but the problem was that they had
the testers here and they had the
developers here and that the managers
who'd come to the conference's wanted to
make the testers think like developers
wanted to wanted them to do the Python
scripts to do the testing automated and
they wanted the developers to think like
testers to learn about how to become a
tester but there was a gap between these
two types of people and they didn't want
to look like each other they didn't want
to be each other didn't want to learn
from each other and that gap was just
broadened by the management trying to
force them into these new rules and
there was a lot of negative negativity
coming out of this instead of the
positive things about the test driven
mindset there was a lot of negativity
well let's write other things as well
that's right celebrations and
appreciations they heard maybe
especially from the Americans because
that these conferences that
appreciations and celebrations is a good
thing and will make people motivated and
very happy but it turns out that if it's
the management who say every week we
should say this is the developer of the
week or this is the developer of the
sprint or give him a prize or give her a
prize for something in particular it
becomes a bit awkward
it becomes awkward like this picture
this picture is me I'm sitting with two
glasses of champagne I'm celebrating my
wedding anniversary with my husband but
I'm in Australia and he's in Denmark and
I thought that it was a very good idea
that I would celebrate it with champagne
and sent the picture to him and he would
be happy and I'm not saying that I'm the
management in our relationship but it
didn't work out so well he wasn't too
pleased he was sitting in coat with
Denmark with three kids and no champagne
and he hadn't really felt that we
celebrated anything so that's the kind
of awkwardness that came in this
enterprise culture team where they tried
to be squeezed into this so against the
question of somebody trying to squeeze
them into doing something that they did
not really see the point in and it
didn't want to do themselves of course
they had retrospectives because they
said in the book they have to have
retrospectives how many of you have
retrospectives see we have to have
retrospectives it's just something that
we do because that's what we're told to
do but none nobody had really questioned
the retrospectives why they wanted to
have them and also they were maybe not
facilitated in a really facilitating way
so they're always asked so what went
well what should we continue doing what
should we stop doing what should we
start doing and then there was a lot of
finger-pointing about who did something
wrong so he was very slow or she didn't
understand that thing that went wrong
because he was sick or something like
that
so the retrospectives became something
that was very scary for the developers
they didn't want to go and thus i didn't
want to share anything at the
retrospectives and thus it didn't really
work they didn't really learn anything
from it
they also had stand-up meetings but the
problem with the stand-up meetings was
again that it was not something that
they knew why was efficient why was good
to have stand-up meetings it ended up
just being a lot of people at the
stand-up meetings because the managers
really wanted to check out what was
actually going on so there is it okay if
I come to the stand-up meeting yeah I'll
come to the stand-up meeting the product
owner would come every time people from
other teams would come just to check in
may be the the feedback to the other
groups and there's a lot of people there
only some of them actually participating
and a lot of people just standing there
looking at them listening to them and
then made it again it made it awkward
and they didn't want to share if there
was something they were really stuck
with because I didn't want the manager
to see that they also had to burn down
shots because we need to have to burn
down charts again the burn down charts
can be very good if you're interested in
seeing how the flow is how fast you can
go find the velocity and maybe look at
if there is a problem and maybe you need
to change something but what happened
with this is that they thought that the
burndown charts were there for the
managers sake so they didn't want to
show what actually happened they were
afraid that a management would say well
you're not working hard enough or you're
not working fast enough so what happened
in their burn down charts is that the
burn down chart would look like this it
would be one huge step
they wouldn't reveal anything until the
very end where they would say well now
we're done with everything so again it
was a question of an agile method which
turned out to be unhelpful to them or
even something that would make them feel
unsecure and not very happy about their
jobs so you can say that the management
had the best of intentions but there was
no communication and the no
communication was everywhere it was
difficult for them to communicate about
things in a constructive manner so they
were not able to communicate about the
feedback that came out from the
retrospectives because it was difficult
to look at they were not able to
communicate about the feedback from the
burndown shots and sometimes they
weren't even that much feedback in the
burndown charts because it was just one
step in the staircase
so they didn't really talk about the
problems in a constructive way they
talked about the problems in the
hallways they were nagging about the
things they had what we call in Denmark
and polka cultura so instead of talking
about it in the openly they were just
complaining to each other without
changing the problem as it was so
everything became rather dark and
unsettling to everybody they also stuck
in under my nose in three different
dimensions it was a demon ass between
the developers in the management because
the developers felt that the management
didn't trust them they thought that all
the agile methodologies was to keep an
eye on them and also they - between the
testers and the developers they didn't
want to be like each other and also in
there - in the outsourcing and the
actual company so they had all this
communication lacking because of all
these different demonize dimensions so
what we saw here that in a sense they
killed the agility with the agile
processes the agility which is about
communication which is about continuous
delivery which is about and always
knowing where we are right now and
seeing at the status right now it was
killed by the agile processes so what
could we do differently when I look back
to the different companies have been in
and I should say this is not just one
company this is sort of a mixed you have
a lot of different companies I've been
in I just created one case out of it
because it makes it easier all in all I
would have taken baby steps instead of
saying well now you have to have all the
agile processes at one time I would have
introduced them one at a time and see
how it worked and make that work before
it burned further I would also have used
other people's experiences I will be
used in the risings book fearless change
how many of you know about this book
fearless change some of you any of you
who wants to change culture in a way
should read this book because it's
really helpful to work based on other
people's experiences and I can mention a
few of the patterns in her book she's
written some patterns about how to
change the culture and changing a
culture like the culture I talked about
into some more agility is actually
really a change of culture
and one of the patterns that she
mentions is what she called brown bag
meetings and that's about when you want
to introduce people to something it's a
good idea for them to eat something
while you talk to them because giving
people food while you're telling them
something makes them more positive
towards it everybody who's got children
knows it and every woman who's got a man
knows this for sure that you have to
feed him and then he'll say yes to most
anything and the most that's not part of
this presentation-wise yeah we're gonna
go there anyway it's a good idea to have
these meetings where people can bring
food or you even give them food if you
know what they like and then introduce
things to them there's also another
person that I'll mention which is really
interesting it's called champion
skeptics and you know that everywhere in
an organization when you want to
introduce a change there's somebody
sitting there saying I don't want this
change is bad I hate it nothing good
will come out of it and all that energy
that's put into the negativity of these
people you can actually swap it so that
it becomes positive in your case and it
will become a champion for you I've read
it in the book and I've seen it
happening in my own work several times
that you find the most negative person
and you go up to this person and you say
hi one in the red blouse they're your
really intelligent aren't you and they
say I can't really can't question that
I'm really intelligent and then you
start talking to this person about I can
hear that you have some very interesting
ideas and insights about this change
that we're going through and I could
really use you in the change that I
would like these companies who have so
if you could help me please signal
whenever something negative takes place
when you see something probably won't
work please come up to me and say this
won't work because this and this or this
won't work because this and this or I
have heard these people talking about
this in a negative way if you can
include this person into the cultural
change and of course if the cultural
change makes sense at all you shouldn't
try to do it with a stupid idea
but if the cultural change makes sense
then this person will be a very good
Ally to have and they would want to play
a role it's an interesting psychological
factor the
they really really want to help even
with the negativity and they might even
be your best champion after a while how
many of you have seen some skeptic like
that how many of you have seen them
change yeah so it is interesting to see
a skeptic like that change and that's a
pattern for it as always so she's got a
lot of different patterns and you should
really read this book because it's also
very interesting about team psychology
and management and things like that also
I would have put a lot more questions I
asked a lot more questions instead of
saying we should have the retrospectives
we should have the stand-up meetings I
would have asked the developers so how
are things for you what's happening
what's not happening and if they could
come up with things they could explain
well we really had a problem with this
or we really we're struggling with this
then maybe you can come up with some of
these things as solutions so instead of
introducing retrospectives for the sake
of retrospective suggestion as solutions
to problems that they already have say
well I accidentally I have actually an
activity that can help us make these
things come out in the open and maybe we
can have a very structured and
constructive discussion about this so I
would have asked a lot more questions I
would have questioned everything a lot
more but the problem is that without
trust nothing will come out of it if the
developers don't trust the management
that they want the best for them they
will struggle and they'll be rigid and
the other way around if the management
doesn't trust the developers it'll also
be very difficult goes for the testers
and the developers the people in the
outsourcing and people in Denmark if
there's no trust it's really difficult
and what do we do about trust well we
have to invest to get the trust and salt
is going to talk a lot more about how
you can invest to get the trust you
invest time and you invest money and you
invest maybe your own fragility and
insecurity showing that you can make
mistakes and to get the trust from other
people so if we look at the road to
agility expertise and the case that I
talked about here it started out being
the nervous
it became the beginner and it became
more competent with questioning things
and trying to figure out what works for
us what can we take with us what should
we change they changed a lot of
different things but this is not what
this talk is about so I'll move on to
tolls thank you yes my reality until
2011 was that I was an agile coach
helping out either optimize or implement
scrum in large IDs here in Denmark and
I've always believed doing this that I
could actually help these companies move
from the novice level to the beginners
level and throughout the drive full
scale actually so by optimizing the
process was my to my weapon if you could
say so but after doing that a couple of
years I can see now that especially when
it comes to changing people's mindset
it's much harder you can't do that by a
process alone so and I've learned that
throughout the last couple of years
because in 2012 I joined a new team
effort I've been an external concern
salon so then so I didn't really have
much to do with with the try fog where
I'm at at the time but then I was hired
as an on a new in a new department new
people new team and they were delivering
apps to a large IT organization here in
Denmark actually one of the largest IT
organizations and I was hired as a
program again and of course with my
background I was told that yeah it would
of course it would be nice if you could
use the experience to optimize the
process further and so on but I was told
that these guys were doing scrum so I
was interesting to see how is it
actually that we're doing scrum right
now because I've told so many people
about it so
how are we really doing so I was quite
surprised - I'm always observing when I
get a new team by nature so I sat down
and I've served and what I saw amused me
because they won't know I don't know if
they Muse me but it surprised me because
never no planning in here there were no
estimates maybe at a very high level but
not on a daily basis like I was so used
to there were no burn down chart or even
some other kind of metric actually
showing the process and they had no
retrospective at the time and on at the
more technical practices there were no
unittest there were no really no pair
programming and actually none of them
had any agile training very few of them
so first of all I thought this has
nothing to do with scrum like I was told
but mmm how are they Holliday doing and
you know what's the customer loved this
team I could sense that right away
and actually we tried to measure the
customer satisfaction after a couple of
months and one of the question in here
is try to to to measure the net promoter
score maybe some how many notes the net
promoter score it says that it is
actually a single question that you
couldn't compare to other who says that
how likely is it that you would
recommend this team to another one you
know and on that scale in average they
actually gained nine out of ten which is
quite high and on the product level they
also had an amazing product the users
loved the product they were gaining this
is for this talk it said that it was
around yeah forced out out of five and
that's quite good for app that has been
out there for a couple of years and just
so it faces that this was not just yeah
when you think of apps and maybe it's
order add on to this item this
organization should deliver
but it if it was actually it was the
core business who was who was published
through these absolutely these these
were becoming over the time actually the
core business and a strategic platform
so it was and the customer were large IT
with a lot of developers behind it so it
was a quite huge set up even though we
were delivering that part but I felt for
myself yeah and just to say that on the
drive versatility scale I could just
sense that they were not beginners they
were not competent they were I felt like
they were at least proficient the way
they talked to the customer the way they
correct on feedback the way the customer
listened to them and just just the small
iteration so over time make me feel yes
this is what I think of when I think of
agility so something was right here so
I'll just like to show you what they did
and not that you can go home and just
apply that that is just observation
observation so you have to interpret for
yourself so and but what they did was
they had a process it's not called scrum
doesn't matter but they have figured out
something for himself so their process
was centered around really basic stuff
actually when it goes to jealousy
it was since heard around showing
progress getting feedback regularly and
continuously and then ensuring quality
over time and on a daily basis they were
doing stand-up meetings but it was
really centered around showing stuff so
team when stuff instead of the regular
question saying how how would that you
do last what did you do yesterday what
would you like to do today and other and
impediments know they were trying to
show stuff to each other of of course
this is a forgiving situation because
we're delivering AB so it's easy to show
stuff but it is much more effective if
you can then then just talk about it it
isn't that motivating actually talking
about what you did last day and yeah
yesterday and so on so show stuff on a
weekly basis or at
to week to week basis as it were they
were having iteration meetings like many
of you know it and I could talk more
about that but it was quite effective
meeting was a one-hour one or one and a
half hour meeting where they again
focused on showing stuff and getting
immediate feedback from the customer and
they deliver it these apps around they
had around four releases per year so
they ensured that the customer also that
the users gained some value and that was
actually the process when you look at it
showing progress getting a feedback as
much as you can then on a more technical
part of the process they had continuous
delivery and are not continuous delivery
but continuous integration and nothing
really new there but of course they
could commit their code and it ran a
build and they could deliver a build to
the customer so they existed when needed
and then they also visualized work this
is a picture taken some time later but
again the thing I want to say here is
that they tested each other's work so
maybe I said that they weren't doing
pair programming they won't doing code
reviews and so on but instead they had
this this this yeah around to that
process that they were testing what they
are but what each other did so that was
the rule before it hit the customer so
another way of ensuring quality another
way of showing interest for each other's
work like what you were gained with for
example a code reviews and so on and
when the screen showed before was used
for demoing stuff it the guys when I
were there they were setting up this
dashboard where they could see there
were it was gathering information about
quality of the system right now so up
here you can see the continuous
integration environment for the iPhone
platform here you can see it for the
iPad and Android over here and it was
quite easy to see when you walked out
the room whom something is wrong with
the iPhone it's actually a stable build
here that
goes into App Store so something needs
to be done here and down here they
developed some graphs showing what is
the performance of the back-end systems
right now also so you could easily get a
glance of mmm how are we doing is
instead of we could set and wait and
know why isn't it working and so on some
of the answers were given over here this
was sued in the early phase of this
graph but again it showed that they
actually care for the product all twelve
product two and they had some metrics
something that that made the system
alive and that that is that it's just
very important and when you want to
ensure quality but then what section it
when when I can see what was going on
about the process so again I thought mmm
I would really I could sense a really
great team here but it wasn't maybe this
is important what I've shown here but it
is really basic stuff right so there
must be something more so I thought more
about this and the rest of it is the
culture and I could talk a lot about
culture but I would Center it around two
topics today which is trust and
empowerment because I think it's very
very important factors to have in place
so on the trust level on the trust part
again I would talk about trusting in
there in three dimensions one between
management and employee within the team
and then between the customer and the
development team so first of all trust
beseem between management and employee I
would show that with a picture of myself
actually nine years ago I you can't see
it but I have a pretty tense smile here
and the reason why is that nine years
ago I was just hired at the try Fork and
I am was hired as a Dannette developer
but it was quite new at the time and I
want to learn more so I found this
course that I want to participate in and
I went to the CEO of char Fogg at the
time
not that many around 20 people at the
time and I said to you on Lasan hey I
found this course I want to be a better
than lip developer is it okay that I'm
going to this and he said mmm it's
perfect cause I have a customer who
needs at the Med course in two weeks
from now and I need a teacher can you be
the teacher and I'd never teach anything
anyone anything in my life and barely
raised my hand in school so this was a
huge challenge for me and I just thought
that the man was crazy at the time and
but I accepted the challenge and I
completed it and when I think of it
today is it that it was him showing me
trust and actually putting some risk
into it because I could have failed
I could have ruined budget of Triforce
image at the time but he believed in me
and that's important when you want to
put trusted people and want to actually
empower them over time and when I have
to think of this story at at the team
where I'm in right now it is the same
thing the department leader or the
manager he's not in the same way but he
has some of the same qualities he belief
in his people he supports them he never
overruled the seasons of the team which
is something that I've seen where I've
tried to help out with scrum and larger
I tease that yeah you can set up a
sprint goal and so on you start moving
and then a couple of days after a
manager comes and says hey you and you
come and help me I have something
written that you need to solve that it's
just ruining trust on many levels so it
is not like here it is not like that in
this team I could sense that you severe
the build the furrow Kirk talked about
introvert person and he's actually very
calm and into a person but he gives room
for his people and that's important so
that was water I wanted to say about
trust between employee and my manager
and I would seem label when I think of
the team here then one of the things
that they do is that they go for a trip
one time a year code so the elves have
some have some fun and it is actually
something that the company invest in
because we are using to work base on
this but it's an important thing if you
of course it this can happen in many
other ways but a way to facilitate
building trust to each other building
relations is to set up events like that
and honor when you talk with the trust
between the customer and the development
team then in this talk I talked too
little about the customer because I
don't have the time but of course they
had a very very huge part in this and
they they are a customer who really
listens to this team respect them and
the team respect the customer and again
simple way you can facilitate that is
actually to do something that is back to
basic stuff but again facilitate some
trust-building events and and you could
probably think of all the cases where
you could do small things to actually
initiate initiate trust initiatives and
that's important because you won't get
much further than the beginners level if
you haven't got trust between management
and the development teams and the other
levels that I talked about and when you
have trusts then I believe you can start
to work with empowerment because when I
first started out doing here
yeah doing agile yeah almost 10 years
ago it it was very much about
self-organizing teams and I thought oh
you could just start be scrum and then
you can self-organize stream
self-organizing teams but unfortunately
not you
have to have the trust part in in place
and then you have to empower your people
you have to use that trust for something
so I want to talk a little bit about
empowerment because this picture of
happy people it's a picture also of
something else
it's about trust starts at a micro level
to explain you explain to you why this
kinda make the reason why they look so
happy these nerds here is that the guy
in the middle is about to place his
order on his new PC and that's all you
have to do to get the help you
developers not that not that not that
hard right but it allows IT
organizations someone will come to you
here is your PC you are this domain you
aren't probably even the administrator
on your own machine and so on and
already there before anyone has thought
about it
you are killing much of the empowerment
that actually are quite important to
developers and if you try to think of
this in you I see those probably
hundreds of areas where you have to do
something to actually start to empower
your people more and I knew at the time
and then he had his PC and then you can
also install the environment that you
once once of this guy's running Linux
and windows and so on and and as as long
as you got the job done the man just
doesn't care good for and here's another
picture of another event and this is
called Haggar days twice a years the
developers goes to a cabin for two days
and do all the funny things that they
can't do while they're at work so this
is the time where they actually try to
innovate try to build something that
they they want to do and actually use
that the the these guys trust each other
and
to give them an event that empowers them
and some of these ideas actually is some
of the reason why we work with this
shoots huge IT organizations that do
today it started on a hanger base with a
solution that we wanted do for this
customer so important stuff but again I
hope someone from large I tease and have
someone's ability sits out there because
it's you who have to invest in this it's
not something that just come out of the
blue air giving sense you are so quiet
well this may be it just took a yeah
it's just a happy-go-lucky happy guy
yeah and maybe they are also the most
they probably just so good at doing
things that you could throw any anything
at them and there is some sense to that
these are also good people and a reason
why I'm saying this is that the world
comment about the same event that we did
in Copenhagen and she said yeah you can
show this but isn't it just because the
people are very very great and yes it is
but I've also seen very great teams in
larger I t's not being able to deliver
because they were restrained about their
the whole infrastructure so not
completely again the guys here I could
at relaxing important thing if you
haven't got that during the day you if
you can't see your develops actually
have a good time and relax the head
student today then do something about it
it's very important to relax your head
doing day if you want to stay effective
in the long run and they can do that
stay out here and play pool right the
customer sitting out there at the tables
paying for their bills so it's out in
the open and it's okay with that because
they are delivering okay and I believe
when you have build up a culture of
trust a culture where people feel
empowered then they will also likely
happen disruptive approach a disruptive
approach which was very important in
this case I'm talking about
want to elaborate a little bit because
what what do I mean by disruptive first
of all this guy here in the middle
standing in the middle of nowhere with a
mobile phone and when the mobile phone
phone came along and the apps like we
know it it wasn't this what if demand
for many companies the people we work
with here
it's a large IT they have been
delivering anything everything but apps
formally for 40 years or so so they're
very good at that to deliver to all
other platforms and the whole
infrastructure and the hundred and even
thousands of developers the and they
can't just shift and just put out all
the logics and mobile phones it was a
quite huge trends when when they
introduced this mobile app that I'm
talking about so the guys at the team
thought of this and they came up with a
very disruptive salutis solution very
pragmatic solution the solution was that
they needed this logic so they built a
screen scraping engine and if there are
any IT guys in here you should always oh
yeah you should be nervous because
screen scraping isn't the good solution
but they screen scraped an old HTML web
page actually that only one used to get
the logic out to the to the mobile
platform so they published a clean rest
interface that the mobile apps could use
they delivered and they put this engine
inside the eyes of IT infrastructure of
this large company and it was actually
the reason why they could they could
deliver this app in time and I don't
think that the big IT would have come up
with a solution because it needed
empower people it needed someone who had
this disruptive approach and wouldn't
take no for an answer when IT said no
and that that isn't possible no we can't
do that we have we only have these tools
that we can build this with so
disruptive approach and I believe then
first after having these things in place
first when you believe that you have a
culture of trust and empowerment then
self-organizing events and a culture
starts to happen and I want to show just
a few examples I could I could show me
more but this is an example late 2013 or
this team they tried to it was not an
outcome of a retrospective but actually
a future spective they talked about what
do we want to obtain in 2013 and 2014
without thinking that much about
obstacles and problems and so on but
just thought to themselves where do we
want to be and in here there is some
interesting stuff for example once the
labor above the Year this year we want
to improve the tool chain which Watson
huge required in jutsu effort but also a
huge problem and something that
improving tools and is usually something
that is quite hard to sell to a customer
but nonetheless they actually just
completed this recently and down here at
the bottom there's also interesting
things saying it is easier to get
forgiveness than permission so I just
think that this goal is a is a good
example of a goal that is that that is
built with people that actually believe
in themselves and believe that they
could do something that they didn't talk
about this goal with the manager with
managers and so on no I think they
believed in it and because the the state
they were in and just another example of
this self-organizing culture is that the
the guy on the left some day he came
with the spear in his hand and he said
hey wouldn't it be nice to if we would
give this beer to the team member of the
Sprint and we have to reason why so you
are the team member of the Sprint
because you did this and that very
person appreciative
event which it was just very very nice
to see and I had nothing to do it on all
the things you saw on here now I was
actually quite afraid to start
yeah actually advising them in anything
because of course there were problems
that yeah that I happened time to go on
through today and often they said to me
isn't it because we aren't doing strum
scrum strictly and I was I no no no no
it isn't i I know trust me and I also
have examples where actually tried to
introduce something and it didn't work
it just applied some extra stuff that
they have to deal with and it actually
killed a little bit of their freedom to
to be a sponsor alright so just an
example of then the culture actually
starts to build in a self-organizing way
so that was trust empowerment and so
vulcanized nice and culture and I want
to sum up to say that I still believe in
scrum and especially when you have to
start off in the large IT you have to
get a common language in some way but
from the very beginning you also have to
be aware that you won't go all the way
just by applying a process you'll have
to work on many levels so maybe you
could get you can get all the things in
place where actually censored much
around delivering IT scrum can help with
that said while all of the iterations
and so on so that you are able to
release something but that doesn't mean
that you are agile but then when you
move to the beginner state I think you
have to be aware that maybe you should
fade out the process a little bit maybe
pull off some of the events that maybe
it isn't
you ain't gaining that much of it maybe
sometimes you have to do a retrospective
not sometimes not sometimes they end up
sometimes not you have to be more aware
of that and instead start to think
building trust within the organization
what can you do to actually facilitate
and Trust
and you can't do something some I have
shown some few examples here but of
course there's a lot and then worry
about empowerment and then I believe you
can move throughout the Dreyfus scale I
are there and that was what I wanted to
say today so come out here I don't thank
you so there's one question in the app
and the question is isn't it inherently
so that there are seminars between
managers and developers you can say yes
because there they've got two different
names they've got two different areas of
responsibility but what I wanted to say
with three terminals dimensions is that
it was them anarse dimensions without
trust and without respect and you can
very well have a very more positive
lemonis between the managers and the
developers I sure you've seen cases
where you have developers and managers
where they trust each other and respect
each other so much so that it doesn't
really matter that they are on a
different level in salary or different
kinds of offices or different kinds of
clothes and still there's this respect
and also between developers and testers
there can be a very good demeanors
agreement so there was one question and
came in through the app are there any
others yes this one here does agility
discard urgency those agility discard
urgency yes hmm could I have some more
words on that who's who asked
one of you had an exam where the yeah
okay but I think the right way to handle
if there is an emergency some urgent
thing going on and the right thing would
be that yeah it's okay to be a manager
and come to a team and say hey I think
we have a situation here
what would you like to do this can you
handle this instead of where what I'm
seeing is that you just use your power
to pull out people of teams and
something like that and that is very
yeah that would kill much of the Trust's
so of course I mean we don't have full
expertise Calif agility doesn't solve
all problems but it definitely saw some
problems along the way and it makes it
nicer to work together which is I think
a very important point in working and
I've definitely also seen the difference
between teams being asked if they could
help out with an urgency and teams just
being pressed into another way of
working I think this is huge different
also comes down to trust again and
empowerment and giving them the power to
make choices together with the
management about what's right any more
questions any more questions from you
yeah
so the question is this looks like
examples where you have very small seams
how about when you have lots of people
who needs to work together well I'll say
that in my experience people will be
people and even if you have lots of
people working together the only way
that they can really work in a trusting
environment is to work with small types
of people at a time so you need to make
trust in the micro level to get trust in
the micro level in my experience so work
on different teams and work on the trust
between the teams as well and I know
what is his name is called Ryan speaker
come tomorrow talking about a case from
Google Randy Randy yeah they're very
good at actually setting up ownership to
around small teams like Anna said even
though they are delivering even though
they have a huge IT organization so
maybe participate in his talk he is much
about high ownership in a large IT so
renta Shoob says simply just to give
them each a goal and to live up to them
that goal and give them freedom within
that goal to figure out how they should
do it
so what you said less when you work with
huge architectures where's Ned no clean
architecture like Annie be on Google
it's more difficult to have the
interface between the different groups
is that the problem yeah well I guess
that takes a lot more working on the
trust and the small levels and working
them up to the top do you have any good
experiences with that yourself yeah I'm
sure you can go to the psychopath after
this talk and ask him what he did thank
you any more questions I have one here
from someone in the audience how do you
convince anti-pattern managers to comply
with agility how do you convince
anti-pattern managers to comply with
agility
well the managers they don't really care
what we do right they don't really care
about agility yeah I can't convince them
about agility I can't convince them that
that's a good idea
but if they come to somebody and they
have a problem then they would like you
to help you with that problem and then
you have to come up with ways of
presenting this so that it can help them
with that problem they will not be
convinced that agility is a good thing
because it usually sounds like a lot of
wasted time and money and building trust
for the developers but if you can call
it something else maybe really book
about psychopaths so that you can
communicate with them to let them know
that this is in their interest maybe
it's even their idea then I think that
would work and again I can say that this
is just my experience working with
managers introducing this this might not
be your experience so again talk to us
in the break or at the party if you
disagree anything else any more
questions
okay thank you
wait over thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
