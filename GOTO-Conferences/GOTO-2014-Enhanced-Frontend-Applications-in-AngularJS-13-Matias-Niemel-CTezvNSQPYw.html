I'm going to talk about angularjs 1.3
and just how to put together a web
application using it and some of the
events new features that come along with
it so about myself i was born in Finland
and I've lived in Toronto for 15 years
for the past two years I've been a core
developer on the angular JS project and
on a weekly basis I'll fly for about
four different programming languages
coding stuff from JavaScript elevated
closure doing stuff in darts and so on
my website is your mood calm and my
twitter handle is at your moon so I've
been building websites for over 10 years
and the past 10 years I've noticed
there's a huge difference in terms of
what's out there right and let's talk
about these websites that have been
coming around the past few years and
like where the trend is going well we
have web applications and we're trying
to mimic what happens on the desktop and
application environment but we're using
web technologies to do that and if we
were just to use regular CSS HTML and
JavaScript it kind of wouldn't be enough
because that technology is not entirely
designed to do these kinds of things but
you know that doesn't stop right
developers and engineers inventors from
create crafting these tools together to
build websites that can leverage
applications that work on a computer so
that being said where is the technology
heading so we're heading more and more
towards frameworks and tools and
technologies that have a solid basis and
that basically means MVC frameworks so
an MVC framework such as angular such as
m / such as knockout allows us to
basically organize our JavaScript code
or HTML code and our application
structure in a predictable way and what
we're doing here is we're separating the
data from the template which is the view
the data is the model and the controller
which is the logic for the application
two three distinct areas and at the same
time that lets us use lasts HTML less
JavaScript code to do more because the
framework takes care of most of it and
while we're doing this we're kind of
separating the data from the structure
of the page which means we're separating
the front end from the back end you end
up having the backend server which can
run on rails or PHP or node from the
front-end code which runs an angular
being completely separate from each
other so obvious MVC frameworks angular
is obviously one of them for those of
you who haven't used thanga they're just
before the idea here is that we embrace
HTML we allow HTML to do more than it
was designed to do in browsers and we
use dependency injection to facilitate
code reuse in the application and
routing and structure in the application
to make angular do a lot more than you
can think it can finally angular comes
with a lot of HTML components which are
extra HTML tags which can really make
your application do a lot with very
little code so why should we use angular
why should we care the point is that
it's back in diagnostic once again the
back end separate from the front end and
since it's a framework testing becomes
easier testing is encouraged because
everything is organized in a proper way
and it is one of the leading avicii
technologies so if you're worried about
being brand new and you don't know where
it's going to go it's been battle-tested
there's a lot of big websites that use
it and so on so now that the backend
isn't doing as much as it did so like 10
years ago when I was building websites
when I was first learning them PHP was
kind of a thing the way to go on right
and back then PHP did all the templating
stuff and all the browser would do is
just download the HTML code and display
it to the user if you wanted to have
extra interactivity you do this fancy
thing using javascript like a highlight
or fade or a slide that that's really it
nowadays it's the opposite so you've
gone to having a fat client and a finned
server where the server all that's doing
is getting data to the browser it's like
here's a JSON API and we're going to
explode
the this data and the browser is going
to download that data and build the UI
for us so this kind of contradicts the
old-school method of building websites
with dynamic websites so if you were to
build WordPress websites or you were to
build websites that render the template
on the server that's what the difference
is in this case the data it's not going
to be tied in with the HTML the data in
HTML or separate so since our
application is running with JavaScript
does that mean that a search engine can
render it if we were to have if we were
to have a search engine render
JavaScript code does that mean that they
can do it well it's close you know
search engines like Google and Bing are
getting closer to doing this they
probably can't do it a hundred percent
yet however if you want your application
to work on SEO it's just a matter of
finding the recipes online that explain
how to do it and there are so if this
interests you take a look on google for
angularjs and SEO ok finally what about
older browsers well I 9 and above for
1.3 i 8 and above for 1.2 we can't
support every browser the older browsers
don't really have a good JavaScript
support but browsers nowadays are
getting more more they're proving much
faster than usual and as long as they as
long as we keep up with the most modern
browsers number then you should be ok
when building these applications ok so
let's start with the basics of angular
so if modules and expressions were sort
of building the application structure
the expressions are going to be putting
the template to display data dynamic
templates are going to allow us to build
a page only using HTML or using very
little JavaScript code and controllers
in scope we're going to hold the data so
this is what I'm not angry the
application looks like here we have
angular just being loaded in we have to
find a module and then we've added the
module to the page but so far this
doesn't do anything this is what it
looks like for displaying data on the
page so we have a name and we have again
age value and so far if we want to do
this on server what would happen is the
server would run through all the
expressions
prints into the data into the HTML the
client would download it but that data
is kind of static right it's already
been downloaded so i'm going to change
this lives on in the browser so that
means that if any of these values change
in the browser then the page will get
updated instantly so let's for example
to try this up i'm going to open my
favorite editor and so can everybody see
this ok cool so let's paste that in
whoops so we have here two expressions
that show data this is a function but
we're not going to get to the JavaScript
code yet so I'm just going to put this
as a variable forget age but if i define
a value here if i say that name is equal
to TS age is equal to 27 you can see
that when we show the website you can
see that the values show up but nothing
crazy is going on right it's just been
rendered into the page i'm better off
using something like PHP because you
know this javascript code looks
complicated what's so special about it
well what we can do with this is we make
dynamic template so we can have bits and
pieces of the template change with only
the data changing so in this case if we
wanted to make a message show on the
page so let's get rid of this code and
let's make it so that when we click on a
button you can see the message shows and
highest so I give it a moment to load so
if I click on this button the message
shows you know and then you can make it
so that the message toggles show
messages on and off and you can actually
see that we made an interactive piece in
our template without having any
JavaScript code to power but you know
this is kind of boring so far so how can
we make it so that we can actually
change data and JavaScript and they have
it reflect into the template we can use
a system called the scope and what the
scope does is it's kind of like the
memory of an application whenever you
did change data on the scope the values
will up
on the template so let's copy this
JavaScript code in let's put it right
here and here what we had before so let
me copy over the code from here now
we're using these memory of the
application so in this case we're using
the root scope we're putting data on the
root scope like my name and my age and
now we can show it into the template
code so let's get rid of this right here
so let's see did I yeah let's do
something cool in there okay cool but
what about if we wanted to actually have
it so that we have specific areas of the
application to only show data or to have
interactivity in there we can use stuff
called a controller and what a
controller will do is it will scope out
one part of the application to have its
own data so if we had a usercontrol
they're going to display the name and
the age and stuff like that we could put
that into its own controller so let's
say we take the controller here let's
replace this code and put the controller
right here essentially controller user
ctrl as user and now we have the user
name and the user duck' NH same idea
here really cool ok well it's it's
really boring so far just taking data in
JavaScript and putting onto the page but
what if we wanted the user to be able to
interact with the application well well
thank you that we have a system called
to a data binding or what happens is the
data from the user interacts with the
data the application and when the data
you the user side changes that updates
the data on the application when the
application changes that updates data
the user side so here if we use input
field and we say that the input fields
going to listen on user name if I hop in
here and I start changing the value for
username you can see that the template
code and the JavaScript code updates
automatically so let's say that I had a
function to check this out i could say
this dot alert name and I could just do
alert self name itself equals to this so
here I can have a button for that
just to prove that the data changes in
the JavaScript world without me having
to manually update it so if I do user
dot alert to age you can see that
whatever I type in here oops I forgot
something alert name imma stick you can
see whatever I type in here at the data
updates accordingly so I've built an
interactive application without really
any JavaScript code aside from the data
and less than 30 lines of code really
cool so we saw that I passed an NG cliq
energy clicked handle the cliq operation
so you might be wondering well websites
back in the day they had on click and
stuff like that like are we going
backwards well know what we're doing
here is we're changing the data around
in the application based on what the
user is doing so if I were to read code
like this and see that oh click
operations going to happen and oh
there's an expression the template I'll
be able to understand the code far
easier than if I were to look at
somebody else's JavaScript code so we're
using the template is a script to
describe the interactivity of the
application and what we can also do is
we can take data and we can represent it
in a different way so for example here
we have a controller that's going to
show today's date we can use the filter
here to format the output of the date so
what we're really doing is we're using
the template as a mechanism to display
information to the user another good use
case is repeating data how could I show
a series of values on the page in HTML
well HTML isn't designed to repeat a
series of native elements on the page
you'd have to use JavaScript but with
angular what you can do is you can use
ng repeat in this case so if you want to
display a series of numbers copy this
code right here we put into the
application and now if we display the
series of numbers
oh sorry I know it's too fast I sing the
code way too many times let's jump back
and forth I'll get to the code in a
moment just need to add let me see
what's going on here oh that's right
i'ma stick so I made an application
right now that you can add or remove
numbers on the screen the code once
again to do this is we describe the
numbers we set functions on the
controller for getting the numbers we
have function for adding in a function
for removing and then to put that
controller quote into the template what
we do is we set a controller and then we
can have add remove and show the numbers
so we're embracing HTML we're adding
more features into HTML to display data
but you might be wondering how does the
browser update it automatically because
i haven't had a callback that tells you
no angular hey update the page or hey
there's new data on the page how does it
not update itself well since we're using
the special HTML stuff of ng which is
the angular prefix like ng-click or an
injury repeat or we're using a scope to
display data angular is aware of when
new data comes in it so we're when the
user interacts with the page so you
don't have to have this crazy callback
stuff like render the template or update
the data angry will do that on its own
and this is known as a digest cycle so
what happens is it takes the old data in
the model and it compares it to what's
in the view and it says has anything
changed is there any data I need to
update and one that it has changed it
will update them directly so what are
some of the more event stuff so so far
we have a really basic complication we
haven't done much well what we can do is
we can use directives to we can add
extra components your application for
example and the dependency injection
stuff is when we want to have a code
that goes into other parts of the
application and we're going to take a
look at routing a unit testing and after
that we're going to look at some of the
brand new features in 1.3
so let's talk about directives we saw
injury repeat we saw ng if we saw stuff
like that those are all components that
don't exist in HTML right so what
angular did is it created these
components these components are known as
directives so let's say that we want to
have a HTML tag called say hello that
when you click on it it would say hello
if I copy this code out here and I'll
explain what's going to what it's going
to do in a minute what's happening with
this code here is we're creating it HTML
tag called say hello that when you click
on it it will do an alert set alert
message it's not super helpful but the
point is that click here to say hello
the point with this is that we created
an HTML component just like that we
created a new tag that does something
and what you want to do is you want to
make your HTML very descriptive you
wanted to have all these cool features
but have really easy to understand tag
names and make it really clear what's
going on all right well what if we
wanted to make our own tab system like
this we want to have a series of tabs on
the page so that when you click on a tab
and highlights it or it calls the
function to update something well tabs
doesn't exist in HTML so we'd have to
use the directive to create that we'd
also have to create an inner directive
to communicate with the parent directive
to tell it hey there's a new tab and
I've been clicked on this is what the
code looks like to set up the parent
tabs what we're doing here is we're
setting up these controller functions to
register new tabs and then when you
click on them it's going to call select
message and so on and then we have
another code right here which is going
to display each of the tabs or it's
going to have an individual tab and then
it's going to set the event listener to
update itself let's copy this code again
here and let's copy this code here and
so we have the top-level tabs and we
have the bottle level tabs and now let's
copy the HTML code to represent the tabs
here and let's set some
dials for the tabs so that we can see
how they look so we set display block so
I'm using with directives and angular
you can use other HTML elements or you
can use them as attributes so I could be
like this for example and do div tab
like this I choose to put HTML elements
because it's a little bit more clear
what I'm trying to do so I'm putting the
style for both of them so we have a tab
element and the tab element we're going
to say display inline block and let's
set background to red or black and color
white and padding 10 pixels let's also
set it so that when you click on it it's
going to set it to an active class where
the background is going to be red when
clicked and then finally here I'm just
going to just a tiny little bug in the
code and it's going to make it so that
for each function tab and finally I need
to load in jQuery or just quickly get
that from here all right so I'm going to
load on the jQuery code and now what
we've done is we created a series of
tabs that when i click on them it just
automatically changes the class name to
it but the cool thing with this is that
I've created the code that works with
the HTML element but the underlying HTML
code is very simple I can use this
component put in other parts of my
application and it works as expected
this is what directives do an angular
this is why they're so powerful and this
is why the HTML component works so well
if the application finally stuff like
this is where websites are heading we're
going to be using web components in a
few years we're going to have something
called a shadow DOM we're going to have
custom HTML elements in our application
that do all this cool stuff in the
background and then you can customize
them in your coat so this mechanism is
going to be happening with newer
browsers and angular already hasn't in
its own framework
so now that we understand how directives
work let's talk about dependency
injection if we had one piece of code
and one part of the application we want
to put it into another part of the
application how could we do that well
with dependency injection we can say
take in one service that's defined in
one part of the application and throw it
in so right here for example we're
taking the root scope which is the
global memory of the application like
give me an instance to the global memory
I'm going to put some data in there or
give me an instance to this particular
function that I need or give me an
instance to a constant now you might be
thinking well what's the point why don't
I just have floating variables and
floating functions around in my coat and
the point with this is that if you were
to test this code out you can mock
things much easier so we'll take a look
at that in a moment so one particular
service that we would like to inject
into our application is HTTP so with
HTTP we can query a back-end to get data
and put it onto our page so in this case
we're asking for the HTTP service in the
controller function we're like give me
an instance of HTTP and then we're in a
query the a server to get the details
and then put them on to the controller
memory so for example if I copy this
code over and let's get rid of let's
keep all the top stuff because we'll
need that later but let's say we have a
controller for users and we're just
going to query a user's JSON file and
put that on here so here if I were to
have two ng-repeat user in users what I
call it entries we're going to display a
user ok
so let me just see if I've correctly
done this let's do a console.log just to
see that the data got downloaded okay as
you can see the users got downloaded and
these are put it up that's why this
let's be self so we can see that the
users got displayed in the page all that
we're doing here is we're just
downloading firmer resource we don't
have to tell the template to update
angular knows that when new data comes
in with the HTTP servers that the
templates can op date itself
automatically but you might be wondering
what's this success method well what I'm
going to make use of is it makes use of
these things called promise thats were
whenever anything asynchronous happens
it returns an object that has callback
method so when the promise is fulfilled
its going to run a function to update
the page so in this case we have case we
have a success function and we have an
error function and what a promise we'll
do is you don't have to use callbacks in
your code you don't have to handle the
callbacks in one particular piece of
code and then call them when they're
ready so what that does is you don't end
up having code that looks like this
where you have won call back instead of
another cop I gave this Christmas tree
at javascript code that's really hard to
test and it's just messy i think the
most i've seen is like five of these and
it's like okay our application works
it's so cool but no like when i was
studying computer science a told me you
shouldn't have more than three if
statements in your code like nested if
statements and look okay but then I saw
JavaScript code and like oh no this
can't be right so what the promise API
does it allows us to chain things using
this convenient consistent API so we're
like this is what happens when this is
done this is what happens when that is
done so this is set success function
that we had here this function right
here is a is just another name for the
six deven function in in angular but the
idea here is that we can have multiple
functions get called when a particular
callback is ready okay so let's not
quickly about routing that if we wanted
to have a particular URL route to a
particular
page on your angular application we can
have the root URL we can have / users
and stuff like that well to make this
work we add on a module called ng route
and then we define a route like so where
we have a controller and then we have
the template URL and that sort of
specifies what the page is so in this
case if I want to have a home controller
and I wanted to have say the users
controller we can add this in so I'm
going to add in the home controller and
then going to make another route for the
users controller so we have users users
ctrl so we've already define the users
controller now if I go into the home
page you can see that ready to find the
HTML for the home page welcome to the
home page and then I've defined the
users page and I have welcome to the
users page but i'm going to copy over
the code that lists the users on the
page oops wrong file here we go but how
can I actually put those templates into
my application well if we use a special
HTML directive called ng view all the
templates and all the controllers that
are associated with the router are going
to be loaded into the page so if we copy
and paste this over I've done a lot of
copying pasting today so you can see
that we have home and users and looks
like it's not downloading angular
properly I also need to download angular
rocked those my connection done looks
like it is oh that's back so now since I
use another module called ng route I add
that into here which is going to use
that module now we have the home page
but i did get loaded in the home page
which is kind of strange oh sorry that's
why this has sorry
so here we have / users so here we have
a homepage home controller needs to find
that as well so we have our home page we
have our users page but what if we want
to make the tabs work is work as links
for application so if we got rid of this
navigation here and we can since we can
use these directives as regular HTML
elements we can make this tab as the
homepage as the home page I make the
other one as the users pitch so we have
home and we have users so that's how you
do routing with Hank either now what
about unit testing we can use jasmine or
mocha to test parts of our application
out and we're going to use something
called karma to test out our code and
multiple browsers so you would install
karma using NPM and then when you call
karma start on your code you end up
having output like this which looks like
why does it get smaller when it goes
larger okay so here we have a console
that tells us that ok the browser passes
in curl nor our fails in Firefox and it
tells us which task passing which says
fail so if you wanted to actually test
out our angular code we would use
jasmine and we would have a test like
this we're describing a test it's going
to particular test this feature and
we're placing expectations in our code
so the code behaves in a certain way
with angular when we include it we can
tell it to load up a module so the my
app module that I had loaded up in the
application is running and then we use
inject to inject key pieces of our
angular app so if I were to make the
hello service and the hello service
would return our translation of the text
in whatever language you have I would
inject it here and then I could run an
assertion on that code if I wanted to
test out a directive for example if I
want to test out the hello service or
hello message directed that we created
all that will do is I'd compile the HTML
and then I would use the digest and then
we would check to see
if parts of the HTML code have been
updated as follows now i'm not expecting
everyone to understand this which is
fine but what I'm trying to emphasize
here is that the testing code works so
well with the inner quotev angular it's
so easy to hop in there and test key
pieces of code out and that also
facilitates mocking in a really cool way
because what you can do is you can have
a particular service something like root
scope or some other service that you
define and you can override it in the
test and then you can stub it to return
false data another really cool thing
with angular is that you can debug
things much easier you just hop into the
console and then use dollar zero so the
code right here that I have for the tabs
if I hop into here and I hit dollar zero
that's going to show me the particular
tag that's selected and if i do angular
element dollar zero and then I do scope
I can see all the properties of the data
on the scope for that particular tab
that's how you debug and angular app
another thing to look into is protractor
testing and not going to go over at this
talk but the idea here is that you would
describe how a page should work in a
test you describe that we're going to go
to the page and examine the title or
examine h2 the element and then you can
check to see if certain properties exist
on the code so what's happening here is
we're going to the index page we're
checking to see if there's a listing
property and if there's an empty listing
property and we can examine all the
properties on the page so this is like
an antenna test into integration test
for an angular app and the tool is
called protractor okay so enough of that
boring stuff with angular's talk about
1.3 stuff like the really cool new stuff
that's coming around well with 1.3 what
we can do is we can have for validation
and what form validation allows us to do
is we can set like the formal addition
has been around angular since the early
stages but the new stuff in 1.3 is much
more advanced and we can do a lot more
cool stuff so you know if for example we
wanted to check to see if you use your
email field exists this is what we had
before we can check to see that the
email is invalid or valid angular will
automatically figure out that it's an
email it's going to place the email
validation on it so the user has to type
valid email but with 1.3 we can have
custom validators that add to our
application much easier so for example
if you want to have something that would
check a username is the answer the
username characters in the right way we
could do something like this where we
set a directive called username
characters validator we get access to
this particular ng model which is the ng
model thing that collects data from the
user and then on there we add a
validator that checks to see if we have
uppercase lowercase digits non normal
character special characters and no
spaces allowed and then the actual code
to test that is we would just add a
special HTML property to it and then
here is how we display the message but
what's really cool about 1.3 so we have
a synchronous validators where if we had
something that will check to see if a
value exists on a server then it would
have to do a round trip from the client
side to the server get the result then
tell our application that it's that we
have a failed validation but with 1.3 we
have a sink validators where we just
return a promise for example when the
animation run our side when the
validation runs this is what the code
looks like for that we gain access to
the async validators code and here we're
checking to see if the property on the
server exists and it tells us when it's
false or not and once again when that to
make that work we would just add in this
user name available validator to to the
code and then here we can specify an
error when the user name available is
false so back to what I had here when
this happens both the valid and the
invalid flags on the validation code or
sets undefined because we don't know
what they are yet and then a pending
flag is set so we can have a loading
animation of some sort so here's an
example of this in action so on my blog
here I'm in a demo application with
these new form features and looks like
the entrance arthur ago so for example
if i type in username here that's fine
because I Smith spelt it but if I type
in user name let's check in to see now
tells me it's already been taken I can't
submit the form into
the user is valid on the server but I
don't have to have this crazy complex
JavaScript code says don't submit and
unless this is true it's just the basic
validator so if I choose a username that
is free such as user then I'm fine and
then I can validate the code another
really cool thing with this is that
there's a system of displaying messages
in 1.3 which is much better than we had
before so if you have a lot of four
messages like a required validator or
min length for max link for a pattern it
can get kind of tricky to display the
messages accordingly so what you can do
if ng messages is that you can scope
your code like this to have this
particular user name validator and we
can display the messages in order so
we're going to display the required
validator first then if the user name
has misspelled characters then we're
going to display the message if it's
already in use so if you've suffered
from having too much validation code in
your angular apps ng messages is really
cool because it can really improve the
HTML code to display error messages so
you can also put the error messages into
a separate HTML file and have them
download so that they can be validated
against your application for the stuff
that I talked about forms there's also
something called ng model options which
I recommend you take a look at it in the
slides if you want to see them then if
you click on them here you can see the
more if you go to my website ear of MU
you can see that as well ok so with
angularjs we have animation support
right where we can pass an animation
hooks like CSS and JavaScript code which
would kick off an animation as it
happens here for example we have a
repeater that's going to be repeating
stuff like for example the users we add
an injury animates and then what we can
do is we can fade in and fade out stuff
so if I quickly paste this code into the
application i have here and i add in the
ng animate module so i add that down
here oops
sorry and we add in the angular anime
code now for the users code that I had
before if i ad in a class of fade and
then let's say that we have it so that
we can filter out the users using ng
model so whatever the user types in the
users will will be filtered out so in
this case I think connection keeps
dropping so if I go into the users right
here and now if s are typing and stuff
so we're going to add the fade class the
fade class is added I forgot to copy
this upper part right here so what's
happening here is we were specifying a
transition and we have the enter
animation that's going to fade in from
something and fade out to something and
we have the leave animation as well so
if I copy this code in here yeah it's
right there so now for the users page
it's still not working what's going on
here did I copy it incorrectly okay
might be something to do with the
connection not probably downloading all
right well I'll shown it an example in a
moment but we can add an animation hooks
directly into the application we can
also use keyframes and we can also use
JavaScript code to trigger off
animations so with this we can also 1.3
we can tell we have to have multiple
animations run at the same time using
this tag called Angie animate children
and what we can also do is use promises
with the animation API so instead of
having callbacks to fire when an
animation is triggered we can use
promises finally a really cool thing
with 1.3 is we can pass in hinting now
this isn't in the core yet it will come
in this week hopefully but what we can
do is we can say when the user clicks on
something that is setting the styles of
where the box is going but we can pass
in animation hooks to animate it
whatever way we want so the goal of 1.3
2 point 0 is to pass animations for
every part of the application as
possible so here's what I want to demo
with the animation code here's a working
animation where we're going to load in
something called animate CSS which is
third party library and then we can add
our own animation code which hops onto
it and a conversa loading give it a
moment so here for example we have a
library called animate dot CSS it comes
with all these cool animations angular
smart enough now to tap into these and
then we can specify a delay in between
so with that CSS code that I had here
sir up here this same CSS code we can
define what animations are run for the
enter and leave animations for let's say
a series of items on the page and then
we can provide in a key frame which will
animate that as well so if we want to
have something like a hinge animation
you can see all these cool animations
that we can add into our application so
check out energy animate and check out
this staggering feature to see how you
can use these another really cool thing
I'll go over quickly is with angular 1.3
we have re-integration so if you had an
application that had ng show or
something like that it would
automatically put the Aria tags in there
for screen readers to understand and
another example is a check box where if
you check on it adds the Aria checked so
it's pretty new right now and there's
only certain directives that would
automatically add REO support but this
is going to get better over time finally
there's another there's a new framework
that comes with angular what comes with
but can be used with hanging there
called material design and that allows
you to have really cool effects in your
application and to build an application
that would work on a mobile phone as a
desktop in the same way and it's built
on Google's material design framework so
I'm not going to go over this here but
link right there is material down
angularjs org and if you look for
material polymer or something you can
see really cool demos angular is not
fully very yet but soon it will be okay
so that was it for the talk and I hope
that you enjoyed looking at angular and
seeing the futures that come 1.3 I can
ask if anyone has any questions right
now ok I'll be happy to answer
no questions yes so the question was if
were to take a long time to merge
angular and polymer I've never tried
using them together the tricky part is a
polymer is a series of polyfills on top
of the html5 JavaScript technologies to
make sure that all browsers have these
new crazy features it it would kind of
conflict with angular in the future we
might be able to get them to work where
right now since both of them are kind of
in a development stage we don't I don't
think that's really easy right now I
wouldn't really recommend it because the
features and both murmurs are kind of
similar but at the end of the day
they're really different someone had a
question here sure
so angular takes care of all that for
you so it keeps an internal counter if I
can find it here we are it keeps an
internal counter so it knows which one
comes in so right here if i type in an
invalid user so if i type in like
there's no request to the server all the
other validators on the input element
prevent the validation from going out
but as soon as i type in like a valid
username you can see that it only did
one request but if you the reason why i
did only one request is because i was
adding i had this thing called ng model
options that i didn't go over which made
it so that there's a 500 millisecond
delay until it accepts the value but you
can do that to prevent multiple requests
going to the server but even if you
don't have that and you just start
typing in values into the server so if i
type in like one you can see that it's
doing multiple requests angular knows
which one to use is always going to be
the last one so this one this is what
makes the asynchronous code much easier
to maintain because you don't have to do
all that tricky coding to figure out
which one which request is the right one
so enough okay so so there's been a lot
of questions about angular and how well
it works on a mobile browser the with
1.3 it's a lot more perform at than 1.2
there's a lot of stuff that we fixed and
made pasture and while mobile phones
will always be a step down from desktop
browsers it's getting better over time
so if you wanted to use angular 1.3 with
mobile browser then you have to read
like you're fine to use it there might
be some things might slow down over over
time if you're not aware of things that
will slow down an angular app but that
also affects desktop browsers as well in
the future with two point oh it's
getting developed as a mobile-first
framework so it's getting developed for
mobile phones with a bias towards mobile
phones first and then desktop browsers
so that you can use angular on a mobile
phone and have it have it run as fast as
a desktop application okay so um thank
you next question what is best practice
on organizing the JavaScript code across
files require j/s so what you can do is
I had all those controllers and I had
all that module code you can put them
into separate files but you would still
need some sort of tool to put them all
together into one file and you use gulp
or browserify or stuff like that I think
that's kind of what the question is if
you're wondering about angular directory
structure if you go on the angular blog
and you look for an article about
proposed directory structure they
explain you know good ways to organize
the JavaScript code to make it
predictable and to know exactly where
files are thank you um does the async
validate work if you send multiple
requests and the server answer requests
in the same order so I just answer that
question again and
it will and it will handle it
accordingly I was having problem with my
app so I missed that sorry about that
then maybe the last one is also already
asked have you done anything in terms of
improving performance going from one to
two to 10 3 well a lot of the browser
incompatibilities like I ate stuff has
been removed so there's a lot less code
to to fit older browsers angular 1.3 has
a bind once feature so if you have one
binding that will never change you can
use behind once and a lot of the
internal stuff on like scopes and like
when data is destroyed and one data is
updated has been updated as well there's
a new future that will hopefully come in
where you can we can only digest a
particular piece of the application
which once we got that working properly
I'll speed things up much faster thank
you very much and before we think matias
for his great talk i would like to
remind you to vote please vote thank you
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
