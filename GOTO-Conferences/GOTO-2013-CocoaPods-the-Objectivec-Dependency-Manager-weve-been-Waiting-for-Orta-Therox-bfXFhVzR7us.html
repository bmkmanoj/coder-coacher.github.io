pots and cocoa pods is a dependency
manager for iOS it's um you'll have seen
things similar interval languages you'll
see you know the tools do the same kind
of things but I want to talk about what
kind of makes cocoapods unique so this
is that beautiful where we go and I
guess before I get started I just want
to talk a little bit about myself so I'm
big on open source I do large amounts of
projects ranging from sort of client
work which is building applications for
kind of this place showing art galleries
around the world and I do iOS apps that
look stunning with no blue that are open
source that you can buy a line that you
know allow people to download a trade
media really fun stuff lots of cool
things like going on and my work at this
point now pay me effectively to work on
things like cocoa pods and open source
libraries as well as doing some of this
kind of stuff
so why want to start with his giving you
guys a bit of it and I do about how
copepods got started I was talking to
another developer at the sort of the big
cocoapods meet up that we do every year
wEDC and he said that there are
essentially free stages of developers
working with object to see you had
people that came from next step these
are the guys that built the runtime they
built the compilers they built all the
foundations they built on the library's
they built all these really kind of
computer science Henry applications and
a lot of the core foundations that we
need and still use every day like if you
did to see developer you're recognizing
NS from the beginning of all of your
core kind of language foundations from
that came the map developers these were
geyser usually were ex Apple they were
they were big on making these
well-crafted beautifully designed
applications but they were not bigger
than for sauce it was very few
large-scale applications on the max that
were that were a open source and be kind
of used by many people the only major
success story for open source on the Mac
at this time was really adium which is a
chat client I still use now it's it
taught me how to develop on the Mac
probably about six or seven years ago
and then we kind of ended up with I have
got the logo so that was next this was
an app developers pretty pink her and
then we had the iphone so this is
effectively like an influx of all these
new code immigrants these were people
that come from all these different
generations they've come from the
enterprise I've come for windows and
come from Ruby that come from the web
and they've come in with such a
different next level of expectation
about what the tooling should be like
and how the actual the language should
act them Apple have both reacted to this
and not reacted to solve this
you know there was a big simplification
of the language where they took out
memory management they took out a lot
they simplified the messaging syntax to
use dot notation instead of always
having the square brackets and these
were these are ways of making it more
accommodating for you know people that
are coming in with these new fresh ideas
and what it's really done is kind of
exposed so the the weaker points of the
buildings these applications and before
cocoapods effectively there was very few
major bit open source libraries that
people could work with that people could
take and just mix even small trivial
ones would mean that you'd have to go in
and do a lot of manual work in order
just take someone else's code so in my
humble opinion and because i work on
cocoapods I believe that cocoapods
really is the tent pole for objective
sees open source community temple is
like a metaphor from the movie business
wherein you have like one massive summer
blockbuster which kind of brings
everyone in and then it kind of raises
the tide for all the other movies and it
feels like this one project effectively
makes it so that everybody can quite
easily download pulp their own open
source it will force them into a quite a
rigid structure for how libraries should
be maintained and that library should be
created and by doing this it's really
made people
work harder do better and we found that
am I looking at the before and the after
with the community there's been a lot of
change so I'd like to a bit about
some of the competitors that we have to
copepods we have Bauer which is like a
JavaScript version of the dependency
management as nugget which is a sort of
net version of it Ruby Ruby gems and
bundler of a kind of ways of dealing
with these package management's and they
all take quite different approaches so
Ruby gems for example host all the
source code themselves this became a
problem probably about six months ago
when they found out that they'd been act
and they had no way of finding out if
people had gone in and actually edited
some of the source code that could then
have gone to potentially every single
person that has downloaded and you know
the gem from the Fowler's takes a lot of
ideas from us wearing we try and make
sure that a lot of the source code is
actually hosted by the individuals
themselves that the library maintained
us which I think there's quite a nice
way of doing it it's the same with
homebrew that I don't think they have a
logo so I didn't put them up on that so
what I wanted to show you because I'm
always getting to the explanations of
really what cocoapods is and how it
works underneath that is a video of
basically what you would have to do if
you were going to try and use and
external dependency in your own code
when you don't have cocoa pods so what
this was basically is you have to google
for it you have to go and read the
readme you have to do all the project
settings and you have to drag it within
I think it's like a minute or so long so
shouldn't be too bad they'll just talk
it through as it goes on so I'm just
opening my test app to see this they're
jumping into Safari them doing a search
for an iOS networking library I find one
that you've got to then go to the
project page and github until she could
go to a different page and github you
don't have to go find yourself we get
started that will then tell you to go
back and clone the repo so you can then
get the files down onto your local hard
drive he said stop reading for you to
read me and it'll tell you that you'll
need to go and copy some files in once
you've copied some files in then give it
a second to copy some files in
and this is at free time speed by the
way this this if you were doing this for
every single dependency new ideally
should also be noting you know what
specific sha you downloaded it from so
you've got an idea of what your
versioning zarn totally you've got to
make sure that your exact settings or
what the library expects whether you're
importing things it is I mean it is a
bit frustrating
I mean when you get compiler errors you
have to go back to the readme you've
gotta go check to find out exactly why
this happened go do your individual
build settings on a per file basis so in
this case this is making sure that the
project itself complies with arc which
is a memory management tool for object
to see so I'm going in and adding no arc
to all these specific files
arduous
and I think that's it I I think then
just go back and say is congratulations
you can build and you get built succeed
so that is a speed-up version of how you
would be able to download a networking
library integrate it with your project
going to read the readme go download
early files fill your build settings and
effectively cocoapods is a way of trying
to not make this so much hassle so one
of the things that we're going to see
here straight away is that we have a
built-in search tool for every single
copepod i use a flag on the command line
tool that all then actually go and check
github to see how many Forks and how
many stars each individual project is so
you've got the better way of kind of
discovering more interesting projects
based on stuff like this so pod
searching for networks I get to just
search through the ones i won again you
can just select the text i'm going to
create my pot file which i'll explain
later I want to say what platform i'm
using say that i'm using it networking
that i can just say pot install it will
go and do all the stuff that we watch
that we did in the last one where we do
individual bill settings download the
repo cop it in and in this case i'm
already done before I could even explain
what was actually happening so when
you're doing this with multiple
libraries this gets very very arduous
the old way and so composed tries to
simplify this
so coupons is now two years old we're
going to be quite mature project were in
terms of open source projects we've got
a awful large amount of contributors
1,500 this the range is from people just
saying you know you should make a tiny
edit this dependency to someone
submitting an entire pull request that
takes six months to merge we've got
2,300 libraries I win in comparing with
some of the other examples it turns out
that's quite a small amount but I think
it's because we have a very small
community when I went to looked at some
of the statistics from Apple about beta
downloads from iOS 6 say notes that
there'd been about 100,000 downloads of
the actual papers which was not being
specifically stated you know this is how
many developers are after the platform
it's a rough idea their families are
active and interested developers we have
in the community and of courses like
journalists and kids want to be on the
latest edge but I think that it's a
pretty good amount of saying you know
roughly one percent of the community
contributes to open source we've had
four thousand polar quest in the last
two years almost every morning now I
wake up to about 20 to 30 I've had to
build web haven't built Safari and
chrome extensions for dealing with these
we have people that build specific
iphone apps just to deal with like the
amount of traffic that we actually get
we deal a lot with with Travis CI so if
you've ever used that it's a constant
integration server that's kind of open
source based and if you've gone up and
sauce project and they'll do it for free
and so we've been stress testing Travis
CI since it came out for that they did
map revisions and we have 6,000
prospects so a part spec is an
individual recipe for how you can
download a open source library yeah we
have a lot downloads we found that some
irony and the cocoa pods is a dependency
manager and the only way you can stall
it actually is by using another
dependency manager ideally at some point
you would like to move that until I go
static binary that you can download and
they'll just don't work but for now
we've been using the gems infrastructure
to actually build our own package
manager tool it's like a psychic Python
I don't if you've you've used it but you
find out like when you install how to
map the first thing you need to do
actually is use your easy install
package whether to install pip another
package manager for Python so I mean
it's a nice way of doing it cool so
before I get started on like literally
what cocoapods is and how it all works
I've been working there for about three
or four bumps on a like a big rebranding
a big redesign and it's mostly black and
white so it should kind of work with no
blue I have I think if it's like bright
green then it's not right but so I
really wanted I I know quite a lot of
you guys may not have even heard of
copepods so for you it's not
particularly new but for a lot of people
this new logo is kind of interesting
controversial but for me it felt quite
awkward used writing all these slides
using the old kind of design but again
it's a bit green for you guys but I just
wanted to move into a kind of a new feel
the idea being that if cocoapods is this
this is this tent pole for the
objective-c community we need to really
show that you know you can have these
beautifully designed open source
projects that can also
help everybody because you can go look
at some of like the JavaScript people
and they have these beautifully adorned
libraries of amazing design work if you
look at the jQuery foundation now like
they have no maybe six or seven
ginormous websites all beautifully
branded that much on their style and how
they all work together and I kind of
feel that if cocoapods is going to be
this this one thing that people think in
the objective-c community like I want to
be a part of this and I think that
having a really good strong branding
will work this so we've already talked a
little bit about what problems does it
solve it's kind of cropped on the end
for me it's always solved this problem
in that you want to use get some modules
to deal with your dependency management
or so that allows you to quite happily
separate out you know your externals
into a different file or folder it
allows you to update it completely
separate to the actual main application
code but it can get my complex I've
worked in the project where we had get
sub modules that when nested four layers
deep and it was not fun at all to update
one right at the end of the one of the
leaf of your nodes so this gets rid of
gifts of modules for you it allows you
to do things like not having any of the
it will chop out any of the files you
don't actually use so let's say you have
a you download f networking which we saw
earlier doing that get sub module will
actually pull into the example code it
will pull in the change logs and it will
pull in the readme but that's probably
not so relevant to your actual project
so you'd end up just copying in some of
the specific files into your project but
in reality what you really want to be
doing is you know just cutting them all
out and that's what cocoapods does
there's anything else with dependency
versioning and as I mentioned earlier
with the fall level deep get some
marginal hierarchy in terms of dealing
with dependencies this gets quite
complex once you have multiple
applications dealing with you know the
same dependency that may then actually
need a different sub dependency inside
it copepods allows you to do you know
say that what dependency will need XY
and Z and no dependency might only need
XY and so will resolve the issue for you
just as you expect but this this comes
really useful later on when you come to
a project for maybe the second time to
come and do some maintenance work on it
because it means that the libraries
themselves may have changed and all
you'd have to do is say do a pod update
and pod update would automatically go
and look find out what updated versions
of the pod files that you already have
deal with them within the actual
understandings of where your
dependencies kind of the upper limit and
their lower limits are and it will see
if it can update it for you which can be
super essential for getting all the bug
fixes and for me one of the biggest kind
of
advantages of using the system like coca
buzz is that it allows you to separate
your external code from your application
how we do it is we create a separate
project in your project that's only for
cocoa pods which I and this what we
automatically make it so that you can
put that into version control but you
can remove that but effectively all we
do to your actual application code is
throw everything into a single folder
called the pods folder and then make one
time you change to actually a actual
application in order to make it link at
the end and this provides a really solid
clean separation between the stuff
you're working on under stuff that
you're not working on we have ways of
making it so you use parts for
development which I'll get into later
but effectively allows you to have a
very clean separation of how of what you
think is read-only code or what you
think is you read write code
so it turns out I'm actually about to
talk about developer pods I have so
parts of read-only um we don't think
that you should be editing your
dependencies in things like rubygems
your dependencies are very well hid in a
way you'd have to go into you know its
system folder down in and your terminal
to go and actually edit these incoco
possibly expose them to you because when
you're dealing with a statically linked
to our application then when you've got
crashes and things like that you want to
go exactly to the line you want to know
where these problems are coming from but
it's kind of a bit of a bad practice to
edit your dependencies so what is
generally novel is you can then go and
fork it and have your own repo but
you've got your edits and then you've
got a versioned version of your edits
based on someone else's library
that does handling all the compiler
settings you saw earlier we only I added
something called f no objective f no ops
ii arc which is a compiler flags that
say you suck but a lot of libraries have
a lot of very complex compiler settings
and once you start mixing emerging these
it gets very very complicated things
like ops ii all load are saying like
defines that are important to you actual
code base and networking for examples as
one that's that ensures that use a
specific type of SSL certification and
without using cocoapods that probably
would have been gone by default so we
don't just do that too we also allow you
to do things like pre-install and post
install hugs so for example Spotify the
Spotify library on cocoa pods will check
to see if you've already installed the
Spotify library in your kind of slash
user slash said it so user slash bin I
think and if it's not actually installed
the C library it will then go and run it
install script download all those and
then it will allow it to download the
actual pot so we allow you to have not
just complex application based
hierarchies of code we can actually then
pull in external libraries and do
updates and things like that again it's
trying to automate as much as possible
we ensure that all the parts of
validated server side so I mentioned
earlier like the Ruby gems people have a
problem whereby if someone goes and
edits any of the Ruby gems there's no
there's no validation it's not been
something tampered with all that it
might actually hurt your system because
a lot of these dependency manager tools
all rely on being able to execute
arbitrary code on your computer that's a
developer so for example if someone
released a version of a very popular
networking library and that included
some malicious shell script at the end
to update you know to pull off your
source code from your computer and
upload it to some Russian service and
what that could actually lecture will
surely happen so we have this kind of
validating limiting service which goes
through and checks every single pod
every time someone does it update which
is you know every could II 30 minutes or
so that will ensure that all of our
actual data is up to love to scratch and
not actually going to harm other
people's computers it's a it's a really
useful feature I would try to kind of
move away from this we tried to move
into using yamel instead of like fraud
dsl's in order to simplify this and it
avoids a single source for all source
code cocoapods is a collection of
rubygems we have a very cool one called
cocoapods downloader and it effectively
is a system for downloading arbitrary
source code so it could be tarred of
gzip files on some HTTP or ftp server it
could be in a bizarre
they're not the coal I think that just
call them Shia Simba's I could be on
some HD tag could be in a git repo Kirby
on subversion and wet totally virgin
control system agnostic in terms of
major open-source ones i'm pretty sure
that something like team foundation
isn't supported but maybe maybe if I
Microsoft oversaw sit and you know this
this gives us a lot of freedom in terms
of how people use cocoapods again to use
the Spotify example Spotify have a HTTP
zip file that we just download and we
own archive and then we extract the
sauce cook on that whereas some of the
KF networking because it get the repo
and we go and pull it from the tag and
you can have all of these and this is
particularly relevant when you're
dealing with private repositories of pot
specs so I think again up to that a
little bit later but it's a really
interesting aspect of the project
so what I wanted to show you guys is a
PUD spec and I actually get to use my
laser pointer so this is this is how you
would define the pots back you would
create one you'd give it a title you
give it a version a little description
you say what the website is fun we
enforce having a license on every single
piece of code and in our repositories so
you cannot release a cocoa pods pods
back to the public unless it is licensed
it doesn't have to specifically be an
open-source license or anything like
that but it has to have a license in
this case i'm referencing bsd and i'm
stating that the file is in this place
color is it a fact a license one of the
cool things that cocoa pods does a lot
of the other dependency managers don't
is that will go and generate markdown
version of all of your licenses as a
single file so you can kind of display
that in order to comply with a lot of
your licenses because a lot of your
license is required you know you should
show this license with your application
especially if it's going to be
statically linked so that's basically
what the bsd one does so we try and
generate what we call the
acknowledgements file by looking through
all the different licenses from all the
code that you've got as external
dependencies and then we generate one
simple file for you guys super useful
feature was once people find that they
get super excited about the actual
project because that's another thing
that people miss you know including
including all your licenses and stating
this is what I support this is built on
x y&amp;amp;z
who's at like one okay so how do we do
this so I talked briefly about how we
resolve dependencies we have all these
kind of do I have one here yet so you
can see some of my dependents easier so
in this library for downloading
subtitles we require a networking
library and we stay here that will
require leaks version one above so in
this case this will go up to two it
takes the least secondly significant
kind of digit and that uses that as the
that do not go above this marker so I
can look at this and say it's going to
include xmlrpc any version so there's no
actual checking of the versions in that
case but it will make sure that it will
not accept the vision to of AF
networking so it will dissolve
dependencies and what is resolved our
defenses it will create this this file
called the pod file that lock which will
come to later but that is effectively
this one single file that tells you
which exact versions we use the last
time someone built this this app with
these with these pots this means that
once again let's say you leave an
application for say six to ten months
and you come back again when you do pod
install you want to be able to get the
exact same version that's the last
version that you have or if you're
working with multiple people then you
still want the exact same version those
other people and so we have something
called pop file that lock in the pod
phone unlock basically is a collection
of
very specific char data very specific
version data which we'll get to later so
once we do that we go and fetch our
library sources as I said earlier this a
version control system agnostic so it
could be get our HD HTTP subversion we
effectively allow as much as possible
because people want to have the source
code how they want a bless a skirt and
then we collect all the build settings
again I'll show you an example of how we
do this but we we want to make sure that
each individual library is kind of
siloed into its own area where in it
cannot then habits build settings affect
another library because again this is
all compiled code so if you for example
we're just not using cocoapods and you
were dragging all your dependencies in
and you are then having these build
settings it could be very very long you
would also find that sort of thing would
clash so libraries might not work with
specific bill settings whilst others do
and it gets quite difficult to make sure
all of your bill settings are not
conflicting so we deal with this is an
interesting way but I'll get to that
later and then we create an Xcode
project arguably this was one of the
most controversial moves for cocoa pods
when it first started out and probably
one of the major reasons why people
hadn't made the project before
because I mean who work by using it well
we have two ways of doing it in fact
that I explained the first way is we try
and copy apples specification entirely
for a building of petco project which is
a specific type of well now it's more
like a JSON file with a little bit of
extra details around there and some
comments in order to make sure that the
ordering is correct but this is totally
fragile is literally it could just break
any time because any time Apple make an
update to what the actual project style
is potentially that could break
cocoapods we built another tool which is
probably even more of a hack actually
then if X code is running we'll use X
codes private api to generate that Xcode
project at runtime that will then use
that as the main arms the Maine
externals project which is really cool
and so far we don't we haven't put that
out too many testers yet because it's
very very liable to break but it's a
really interesting way of dealing with
how do you create a file with a format
that's both Conte sauce and very liable
to change at any time and then finally
we have user integration which is you we
don't want to be touching your project
as much as possible because it's your
project and quite rightly a lot of
people are suspicious of a project runs
on the command line that'll
automatically make edits to your own
source code and
it feels a bit magic it's it's it's take
it's one single line that you're right
that says dependency you do a total
Aquaman and then suddenly you've got two
projects and you've got a different file
type and every time instead of the
original and we really want to try and
minimize the amount of touching that we
do on your code so you can do a diff and
you if you do a diff which I should have
taken a screenshot of but it's basically
we just add a single like config file
and XC config file and we link in the
same way that you would link to any
normal library with the cocoa bottle so
yeah such as little as possible that's
funny because this this is black here is
exactly bright red so it just looks like
the same colors everything so this is
how you install it in terms of
objective-c developers this still a bit
of stigma to us jumping into the
terminal playing with things i said it's
most likely that again coming as code
immigrants for us a lot of the terminal
commands are exactly where we've
comfortable so luckily there's people
that disagree and they build you know
tools to allow you to just run cocoapods
there and then in xcode again this is
not officially supported but i do have
some really great ideas for how to make
cocoa pods feel like a really natural
part of xcode but we still like it's
still hot to build an Xcode plug it into
the kind of quality that we want it to
feel like people we do want to let
people know it exists but we don't want
people to entirely rely on the hacky
xcode look in order to then use
but but it works I use this I really
like this install docks during
integration I built a tool called Coco
docks which is a tool that open so we'll
create documentation for every single
open source library in an objective C so
that's six thousand different versions
and I think it's about 35 gigabytes
worth of data now I originally used to
build it on my laptop but eventually we
were done to a committee in the sky and
this effectively allows documentation to
be running in line in pink in your Xcode
very cool so this is an example of they
were a production-ready pops back up i
pod file sorry so this is one from my
work this is one of the ones I use when
I'm building apps and it shows some
interesting stuff so if we look at the
start straight away we do exactly well
platform and what version this minimum
supported and then I inhibit all linings
so my opinion again you guys could have
different ones is the external libraries
or external libraries that I do not want
to see warnings for external libraries
so again it's an option and there's an
exclamation point to let you know that's
a pretty serious move and then you go
through and you can describe all your
specific versions so in this case I'm
quite sure that I want 1.6 version so
that would accept one point six point
three four five six seven but it won't
go to 1.7
the wires reach ability I know it work
very check change very often they
certainly won't be changing the API for
that anytime soon but then we can see DD
progress for you at zip archives these
are projects that I have to make changes
do so again as I mentioned earlier it's
not very good than that to go in that
should not make that changes to your
actual prejudice coupons but so you
should you them make your
changes if you want to you can send a
poll request to the original owners and
maybe they'll take the original version
that you can go and change that to not
say this anymore but actually have a
specific version but in the meantime
you're in total control so I personally
leave them on my Fox I think I've said
submitted the pull request to both of
these projects pretty sure they went in
but i still haven't moved them back and
then you can see like these these are my
projects so I want them to always be on
the latest site also don't specify
version and then at the bottom we have
like unit testing so you can have
multiple targets in xcode project so
let's say you're building a library that
builds your application so you might
have library application unit testing so
you could potentially have a lot of
different targets in here that might
have only specific pot files specific
spots Max so in this case kiwi is a
testing framework and it's totally not
relevant to my application but it's very
relevant to building unit tests so we
lied kind of scope which which weighed
and Z's go
so this creates the pod file that lock
which we were talking about earlier this
is a very specific version that tells
you exactly what you downloaded and
exactly what someone else should use if
they're going to share your code so if i
delete this file um the next time I ran
a pot install it we're going to download
on the latest update so it could
possibly could to get all the patches
but until then we're stuck on these
exact versions and I know that right now
afnetworking is now one point six one
point three point six so I mean I could
do a pod update to get that change but
I'm not going to until i go back to work
on this so this is what ends up looking
like in this case 37 targets so each one
of these is your pod some of those can
then you know have some dependencies of
their own but they all still get further
into this this single project over here
nice simple and easy and I do not have
any development pots of you but they
would show up in this area too
I don't have any screenshots at all the
parts i guess i'll explain how they work
development pods are unique in there as
i said earlier if you treat all parts as
read-only sometimes you don't want to
treat your part as well as read-only you
might want to be working on a library
whilst at the same time using it in your
apps so what we allow is effectively a
file-based cocoa pod so instead of going
to the server don't have to bug of
course yeah this data there we go
instead of going to this server here and
then you know pulling in the files
deleting all the other ones and cleaning
up all the stuff it will actually go to
a folder not delete all the stuff but
only pull out with over pull out so
you'll create aliases to the actual
source file so it references so any
changes that you make will actually go
straight back to that local folder and
then you can just use you know new
version control system as normal and
that allows you to easily make edits and
allow us to be changed up without having
to go through the whole rigmarole of
changing to you and fork making the
changes pushing that up doing a pod
install having them come down
development plots are really useful
especially when you start using private
repositories so the jump back tomorrow
was downside of having animations oh we
were here so yeah z
the way that we handle all the settings
is kind of interesting we use an old
tool that used to be used a lot in like
the next step days which is called XC
config files in order to try and make
sure that we're not hiding all your
build settings in all these different
places what we have is one big file that
shows all of your major changes and then
we allow some sub X econ fix so again
these are read-only so changing these
would automatically get overwritten the
next time you did a pot install but we
have ways of allowing coupons to
actually make edits to them themselves
but it allows you to see all your build
settings in one place again when you've
got a large amount of cocoa pods as I
see I've got 37 individual external
libraries that's because they're doubled
because I've got two targets and then
the extra odd one is the actual pods
itself it means that for example which
one I've got the zip archive this has a
very specific compiler flags to ensure
that you include a specific type of lip
see lip zip so that again is an
ex-convict this soft stuff is uh
hard to find initially but once you
actually see that are it's quite a
simple system and it means that you can
actually make these edits quite easily
so this is this is being how you
actually deal with it well I've been
spending a lot of time lately is trying
to figure out how do you make
discoverability easy so I've been
working on a new website for Coco but
which is not only black and white
because we use read a lot paralyze a la
donna I tried to rethink how do you
search how do you explore how do you how
do you rate a project there's been my
main focus lately and to give you guys a
brief open show you have it feels it's
quite a nice website it gives a very
nice impression of the project that's
been going on for a while we do the same
when it comes to the mobile because it
turns out people use Mobile's that build
iOS but what I really wanted to show you
is is this the way that we've been
thinking about search so all the hard
things are dealing with libraries and
trying to do discoverability is that
it's very very subjective all of these
networking libraries have their own
positives and negatives and trying to
decide for cocoa puffs to try and decide
for you is kind of not the best solution
so I've been looking at is all these
different metrics on a library trying to
understand how do you figure out whether
it's something that's relevant to you so
some of the key metrics I've been
playing with are things like how much o
is the project so how long has it been
gone how many stars it got happy fox
because i built a tool for generated
documentation for every single open
source project that means i have an idea
of how well documented the entire
project is so that also is
we came from in there you can also then
talk about you know how long is the
readme is this a detailed feed me with
some installation instructions does it
tell you like how many people are
involved in the project usually the
length of the VD is actually quite a
good indicator about how much time and
effort has been spent on actually making
the library um again really cool really
cool so I gave me an awesome idea
yesterday but I think I was drinking too
much thought I got it do you remember
this haha one of the best ways of
determining whether a project is
relevant um no they can't remember but
regardless wicked I know it's like one
of those fake there but when they told
me I had to think I've gotta rethink the
entire concept no I don't because I've
already forgotten so yeah we show which
will show things like the readme in line
will show like screenshots in line
you'll be able to see us everything
about a project without ever having to
leave this search interface effectively
and that will like boost discoverability
if I have the small libraries at the
same time like you do a search for
something like blocks and you just get
so many results back now in the pod
search interface that it's just it's
just not that much fun to actually go
through a look and at the same time
because the limit of the amount of
information that you have available at
this point you can't make a solid
assumption about which is going to be
the most relevant to your project so I
think that this kind of revised search
wherein we provide a lot of context for
you the users means that a lot of people
will be able to find things that
previously they might have just missed
because they'd have gone with the most
popular project
and in objective-c until very recently
the most popular project was a project
called free 20 by Facebook which has
been discontinued now for almost a year
and they really don't want anybody to
use it now the they've gone and deleted
the source code from github because of
this problem of it being considered the
most popular project don't care and so
this is this is a salt problem that I'm
trying to solve we're dealing with
searching again it's just showing you
some nice results loading more these are
how we feel it should work on the mobile
again nice simple easy and really really
cool experience so I've not just been
looking at set the kind of looking at
how we can deal with letting people know
about project updates or best practices
again because cocoapods is this tent
pole we get to be a little bit pushy
we've said specifically this is how we
feel that iOS and Mac library should
kind of standardized so we have a set
project since that people kind of clone
that creates a kind of like a bootstrap
for iOS I guess it does things like
gives you a readme gives you a change
lock gives you rate commands rick is a
again the terminal command thing but it
automatically allows you to deploy
cocoapods to deploy to private
repositories to to kind of give you this
great start in well where project should
be and how a projection act and
because we've been doing this we've been
trying to find ways of dealing with you
know how do we get communications out so
if we've been playing a lot with blocks
you know start writing your cocoa pods
blog we want to try and use this same
kind of feel for the guides and for this
general system again big fan of this I
think train is going to be a really nice
way of presenting information pick a
person to using Twitter and using a
change like because what is to
transitory and never is too technical so
a lot of people don't read to change
like and I guess I just want to point
out that there's a lot of us involved in
the project as I said earlier there is
14,000 people have about 1400 people
involved in doing this and so I went and
grabbed all the gravitas and you get to
just do this for a long time before you
start to go through every one that's
actually done some contribution to act
like a home for this project and its
really nice to be able to just there to
work with so many people to interact
with so many people and to see so many
people with a passion for the actual
community so yeah that was me I'm water
and that was cocoapods you should follow
us both so thank you all right it isn't
there a danger the cocoa pods makes devs
ignorant of how you use xcode to
integrate projects I like to know how
things work in case I have to fix things
is the first question so yes yes yes yes
yes yes there is a danger of that there
is a big big danger of that um because
cocoapods feels like magic as I said
earlier you type a command line in and
back all your system has changed
slightly we've created a separate your
project to the pods file and
it it's hard to it's hard to kind of say
at what point should we be explaining
every single part of the process there
is a guide on our cocoapods wiki that
literally shows you every single step we
do in order to create both the project
and all the changes that we make to your
project but again this is hidden on the
wiki page in the middle of you know we
have 20 odd separate repose of the cocoa
pods repository cocoapods organization
and its hard to find this other stuff so
this is exactly why we've been building
the guides website in the block to try
and explain to people in a pin up in a
way that will always be relevant so let
the wiki at some point we'll have to
delete that in on that make it in the
guide but anybody can end that wiki
versus us that can control some of the
guide so we can deal with it pull
requests so yeah it is a bit magic
there's no way of not doing it in a
magical way the only way of not doing
the magical ways time Apple do it and
we've waited 12 odd years for Apple to
do it and so yes the community had took
a stand and unfortunately the only way
it could work is by involving some magic
but it's not that magical I did a talk a
week ago with the guy who actually
writes a lot of the underlying code of
cocoa pods I mainly kind of sell the top
and do all the design work figure out
you know the interactions how would
people how should people be using the
project and his entire thought was to
explain all the underlying principles to
make sure you guys have an idea of how
it works and the slides for that Roman
there's notes for every single slide
right definitely recommend looking at
that if you don't want to look at the
guides to understand how and why it
works
okay in Java for maven I've never used
this but I keep it keeps coming up so I
would like to if anybody who ever ask
this come and talk to you as well I
liked a little bit more about it so
private maven repose is it possible time
you're impossible every fitting house
modules yes very much yes super simple
in our case you just create a git
repository or whatever you can probably
create git repository for it and you can
just put the pot specs in the same or
what the same system that we use there's
probably about nine to ten blog posts
however people they explain the entire
process we have a recurrence guy that's
been dealt that's not out yet that
specifically shows the process from top
to bottom saying how you have a private
repository you know I can do it updates
automatically the command line tools
that we built to make that really simple
yet private repos are like a number one
priority for us because we I mean I
don't use in there but I use some in
solar project so the other types use
them in their own projects pirate
Reapers are super important test free
that's a good question that one
questions work so how do we handle
clashing versions perhaps an interesting
one so we've had to just we've had
okay there's two answers to this there's
a simple answer which is we don't and
there is the less simple and so which is
a little bit vague so because of the way
that dependency manager works we start
at the top of the final we work our way
down if you specify yourself which
version of a library you would like you
can entirely avoid the dependency
manager trying to figure that out for
you the biggest problem here is that you
gotta call the biggest problem here is
actually that we're using a statically
compiled library and we can't have we
can't do a version that only works for
one specific library so we can't have
version 1.5 point one of library X as
well as one point four point nine of
library why of a library X in the same
project because you get namespace
collisions there's been debates about
where we can get around this by applying
prefixes to every single but but I guess
even more complex because then whenever
you can virtually using any of these
virgins in your own code you have to
apply the cocoa pods name name spacing
before because the like the you know the
object to see runtime and the entire
compiler scale don't support name
spacing so until next facing exists that
we just can't build that feature at
least
in a way that's totally acceptable to
everybody and people that use the kind
of dynamic languages allow this kind of
name spacing big shame but it's on that
to-do list before version 1 and I've
been told that version will be out
before a year so I think it's a hard
problem that will be solving at some
point now is there any more questions it
was that my last yeah but I think we'll
cap it there okay it's fine everyone
remember to vote and have a good lunch
everyone stare of the luncheon shutout</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
