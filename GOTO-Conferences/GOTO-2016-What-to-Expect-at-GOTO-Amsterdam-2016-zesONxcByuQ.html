present you the program of go to
Amsterdam 2016 I want to start with our
four keynotes the first keynote is from
Irish gamma a member of the gang of four
co-author of the famous design patterns
book eclipse and Jen unit he's now a
member of the technical stuff at
Microsoft and he will talk about their
journey building visual studio in the
cloud based on more than 100 open source
components the second keynote is from
Andre kalpas the first Dutchman who has
two space missions to his name and he
spent more than two hundred days in
space Andre will talk about the crown
breaking technologies which helped him
survive in space and how many of the
ideas behind these technologies made it
into our normal life then we have Simon
zing the pretty science writer who
authored books like famous Last Theorem
Big Bang or the code book I read all of
his books and therefore i'm really
excited meeting him he will give an
introduction to the history of
cryptography and will explain why
encryption is today more important than
ever before our last keynote will be
from Jonathan sprinkle who will talk
about his work on self-driving cars and
cyber physical systems let's go to the
tricks we have a data track because we
think data it is the new gold and we
want to present some talks where you can
learn who to do the gold digging for
example machine learning a be testing or
big data analytics in the connected
world's track we want to look at the
many many gadgets out there which will
you make control with your tablet or
smartphone toys cars boats anything we
want to cover what is going on in this
space how it works and how to make this
happen in a secure way there shouldn't
be a conference without microservices
therefore we have a micro services track
however the concept is well known these
days therefore we want to cover how and
why you can transform your leg
legacy monolid into a micro services
architecture our world becomes more and
more dependent on digital infrastructure
and therefore we need to understand how
to build things more robust and secure
our rugged and security track presents
ideas on how to tackle these challenges
javascript is fortunately or
unfortunately everywhere this track will
cover the current state of usage the
spring track the spring framework is
considered done but there is so much
going on around this framework most
people don't know about the advantage
it's is that a transition to micro
services and the cloud is easier than
you think when you already use spring
which many of us do agile development
had its focus on more output our post
edge attract focuses on better outcomes
the philosophy track is totally new and
we are really excited about it how if
the program committee wants to be the
track host of this track why we cover
how our life as a programmer affects the
software we write and how the software
we write affects the life of all of us
what does it mean to a society when
everything around us get smart how do
thinking traps and biases affect design
or communication with stakeholders come
and see for our lightning talks track we
selected the 15 best submissions from
our call for papers and finally we have
also a solution track our sponsors will
talk about their most exciting and
challenging projects let's go to the
workshops where you can dive deeper and
get your hands dirty we have continuous
delivery with day farley then North will
explain us how you can test faster and
faster and more efficient I bahot wolf
will teach us about self containing
systems as an alternative to
microservices Josh long will explain
cloud native Java
using cloud foundry and spring cloud
coat as a crime scene with Adam torn
here he would show how to get valuable
information out of your repository Barry
O'Reilly on the Lean Enterprise and how
to become a high-performance
organization like Netflix or Spotify we
hope that you like our program and the
whole program committee wants to welcome
you at go to Amsterdam in June 2016
