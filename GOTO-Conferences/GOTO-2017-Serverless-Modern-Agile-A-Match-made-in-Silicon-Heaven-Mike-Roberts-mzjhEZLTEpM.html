coming to this talk I know there's at
least one other really good talk going
on right now my friend Sam Newman is
giving so thanks for coming to mine it's
my first time speaking at go-to I'm
super happy to be here I've heard about
go to and and now over the years but I
never made it out of Aarhus so it's
great to to be here in Chicago to speak
here so just a very quick background
about me I used to work thought works
back in the early mid 2000s such a lot
then with agile and continuous
integration and continuous delivery and
all that good stuff and then I moved to
New York in 2006 so 11 years ago working
in finance companies and ad tech and the
reason I'm talking with you all today is
that about a year ago I started getting
super interested in this area of service
and I got so interested in fact that I
decided that I was gonna write an
article about it and my good friend
Martin Fowler offered to host it on his
web site and that was very nice of him
and and then it then it proceeded to get
on Hacker News and was quite popular
which was a shock and it was so popular
in fact that at the beginning of this
year I decided to start my own
consulting business specifically in the
area of service with a good friend of
mine John Chapin and and this is what we
do serverless is literally what we do
and really what I have come to care
about most in my career is people and
trying to help people be the most
effective they can be in engineering
teams and whether that's through
management or through engineering with
them that is what I care about and and
and the reason that I like serval is so
much which may be surprising to some of
you is because of the potential
it has for making people more effective
the resources for this talk are at this
link and there's quite a lot of quotes
and links in this talk I steel at will
from various friends of mine but I quote
most of them so there's there's a Google
look at this link which you can find
from my Twitter which is there together
with a nicer font so I had a nice font
when I was going to present this on my
own laptop so we're looking a bit plain
font right now but you'll see the slides
in there and if you can hold the
questions to the end I'm gonna be around
for today and tomorrow so I'm happy to
answer questions afterwards but let's
get going so where am i coming from
before we get started so as I said I
worked for thought works in the early
mid-2000s and I was very into to agile
and continuous integration continuous
delivery and and and DevOps is it they
came and I've also been friends with
with dan dan north and lucky to have him
as a mentor and and have been talking
about a lot of what he's been sort of
chatting around for a while gave some of
you may have been in down north talked
earlier and it's sort of a bunch of
stuff that he's been talking about I'm
really what what am where we're getting
to is that over the last 20 years we've
seen the lis time for delivering
software decrease from years to weeks
and now we actually see an opportunity
to reduce this further to days or even
hours and with this we can transform our
way of producing software to one of
continuous experimentation
well what advantages does this bring and
what challenges would we face in getting
here and how would we surmount those
challenges well those are some of the
questions that I want to explore in this
talk with you today so in this first
section I want to take you on a journey
from how life used to be in software
engineering to how it can be today but
first of all let's all get a little
philosophical together what is the point
of software engineering
it's a question we don't think about
very often one answer is to enable our
customer or our users to be more awesome
and that means to make them able to do
something that they couldn't even think
about doing before or let them do
something that they've already done
before but far more efficiently or a far
higher quality or at less cost I
borrowed this question from late comer
to the room Dan North borrowed stole and
and here's a slightly different answer
this question he says the goal of
software is to sustainably minimize lead
time to business aspect it's a business
impact and the point is that we're not
here just to deliver software we're not
in the deliverables business whatever
you may have been told we're interested
in outcomes that is the delight of our
users and what they can do with our
software dan also talks here about lead
time and in fact a key part of improving
our impact is reducing lis time and lis
time in my opinion is is is the time
that we have an idea about how we can
make our customers more awesome to
actually giving them that capability so
reducing this lead time is our goal
because it gets the useful software in
the hands of users faster that's more
effective for them and as a nice side
effect it often unlocks revenue for us
earlier but it also lets us try far more
ideas and why is that important well
I'll explore that in a little while but
first of all a quick history lesson ooh
here a quick quick show of hands who
here has been the industry for more than
15 years yay lots of you yay hi so those
of you that put your hand up will know
this and those that you didn't might not
know this but 15 plus years ago it
normally took anywhere from six months
to two years to deliver software well
why on earth did it take so long well
first of all
releasing software was really expensive
and this was because change management
was expensive and testing was expensive
and a whole other multitude of reasons
and so what we did was we optimized our
process for large groups of people to
work on one product area with a small
number of releases infrastructure was
also expensive and so was the labor to
manage it and so we optimized our
architecture to reduce the total number
of components that we deployed we often
used multi-tenancy of various
configurations and various customers
into one runtime
additionally changing infrastructure was
expensive we needed to use the same
infrastructure over months or years for
it to be cost-effective and this is a
big reason why traditionally our
production infrastructure is mutable
even though that brings a whole bunch of
complexities so all of these constraints
drove us to a project mentality in how
we worked in industrial software teams
we needed significant technical data and
organizational coordination across large
groups of people leading to processes
like waterfall and techniques like Gantt
charts hello old friend over the years
our constraints have changed releasing
is not nearly as expensive as it used to
be
we've got practices now like continuous
delivery that allow us to optimize our
build test and deployment processes
through extensive automation we've also
seen huge reductions in the cost of
infrastructure and the management of
infrastructure through the maturing of
public clouds and not only have the
overall costs of our infrastructure been
reduced but we can now also modify much
of our infrastructure without loss of
capital because of the elastic
provisioning that the cloud gives us
immutable infrastructure is now a
reasonable possibility an actual way
that a lot of us work which is
aloud the new trend of thinking about
our servers as Cal's rather than kittens
because of these changes in constraints
we are now able to release software much
more frequently a continuous deployment
of several releases per day is now
commonplace in in many companies there's
a quote here from Sri Cote of Comcast
cable so quite a big company he said
this last year we used to ship our
product every 12 to 18 months in a 3 to
5 year period we shipped three or four
releases three or four releases in five
years now we ship three releases every
week what a turnaround so tied around
with this sort of reduction in cycle
time that we see here we also see that
Lee time has decreased now we often talk
about Lee time for new features or
products in days or weeks rather than
months or years and these reductions in
cyclin Lee times have changed how we
approach software delivery instead of
focusing on projects and deliverables we
can now spend much more time considering
the product that were actually trying to
build or in other words instead of
focusing on how many things we can build
our output we can instead optimize for
the effectiveness of our software in the
hands of the customer in other words the
outcome that it has now a lead time of
days and weeks is a vast improvement
over the months and years that we used
to have but we can do even better Adrien
Cockcroft who was the main cloud
architect at Netflix as they move to the
cloud and is now at AWS said this a
couple of months ago he said we're
starting to see applications be built in
ridiculously short time periods now
we're actually start thinking about
thinking about Lee time in hours as we
reduce our lead time further and further
we can start focusing more on two very
important points first of all we don't
know upfront what the best solution for
our customer is what we're making isn't
something that we've made before
building software products is a complex
problem when we start work
on a feature or a product we have an
idea of what we're trying to implement
but the problem is most of our ideas
suck thank you very much Jeff Patton and
it's true most of our ideas suck now
most the time when we're working on
implementing our idea they feel greates
like yep this is absolutely the idea
that we should be working on but history
says we're wrong history says most of
the time that feature is going to be
useless it's never going to be it's
never going to work or it's just going
to be kind of it and occasionally we'll
come up with one that's brilliant and in
fact if we have an idea where we can
deliver it if we have an environment
where we can deliver an idea from
scratch in hours we can try out many
many more ideas and not all of our ideas
suck just most of them in other words we
can play a numbers game and this way we
are far more likely to come across a
winner the one that is going to make our
customer awesome so we've already
decided that pretty much all companies
now have to be tech companies right
because if they're not a tech company
then a tech company is going to come
along and blow them out of the water
that's just the modern economy that we
now live in
however enterprises can now start moving
beyond just being technology companies
and embrace experimentation as their
core system of work startups have been
using this thinking for years using
ideas from lean startup they can build
Minimum Viable products assess success
and keep pivoting to try new ideas until
they find one which works enterprises
can now start thinking this way because
of the much shorter lead times we are
starting to see in software development
we need to stop thinking of our software
organizations as feature factories this
mindset of the neverending backlog is a
remnant of working in a project-based
output oriented environment optimized
for new releases for few releases sorry
and this system is out of date instead
we can transform our organizations into
product laboratories embracing a model
of continuous experimentation and this
will allow us to Bill
products that truly make our customers
awesome now such a significant
rethinking of how we approach software
engineering doesn't come with challenges
how do we get to the point how do we get
to this point of continuous
experimentation well let's look at some
of these challenges across technical and
organizational spectrums first of all
some technical challenges we need to
minimize the amount of incidental
complexity that we need to solve but we
still need to have valid safe production
deployment at scale and we want to
maximize the amount of our engineering
time we can have on the core of the
actual customer problem that we're
trying to solve we want to reduce the
infrastructure cost and commitment for
deploying a new system an experiment
might only lasts a couple of days and we
don't want to be locked into an
expensive system and we want to reduce
the technology overhead from having so
many different experiments we're going
to have lots and lots of small systems
in this world and how do we have
sufficient decoupling between them now
let's look at some organization on
cultural challenges we need to minimize
the time it takes to go from our code
being ready to actually being deployed
for the first time and there are many
technical and process and organizational
concerns that sort of come out of this
we need to change the culture of our
organizations to encourage continuous
learning we're not doing the same thing
repetitively in a feature factory
anymore and product innovation needs to
be spread around the teams and not just
the responsibility of product managers
so that we can source a whole raft of
ideas and that we can move those ideas
throughout our experiment engine fast
enough now this is going to be a much
less structured world and so we need to
rethink how we approach the idea of
safety we need to enable a
psychologically safe environment for
experiments to fail we need to maintain
budgetary safety in a significantly more
dynamic environment
and we also need to carry on maintaining
appropriate security and data access
safety now these aren't the only
challenges but there are enough to get
us thinking about the type of experiment
that type of changes that we're going to
need as we approach this world of
continuous experimentation and I'm going
to spend the most of the rest this time
talking about how we solve these
challenges the good news is that we've
already got most of the tools that we
need so unsurprisingly given that this
is a service track serverless is a key
technique in how we resolve many of the
technical challenges that we have in
this brave new world so first of all I
want to give you a very very quick
serverless reminder or overview for
those of you that may be new to service
this is going to be very very quick I'm
not gonna go into any much detail here
at all so service consists of various
types of technologies so first of all we
have things like Amazon lambda which
allows us to write really small bits of
code as functions upload those to a
functions as a service provider and let
that provider figure out how to scale
and run and deploy and monitor and log
all that code for us service also
consists of things like mobile team
hyper-efficient databases like google
firebase and it also consists of various
sort of software as a service type
things like all-zero which allow us to
plug in somebody else's logic for user
management into our system but Service
actually consists of some more older
school technologies as well it consists
of things like s3 so I think Amazon s3
is the original service technology and
also things like Amazon DynamoDB we
pretty much clap to classify a service
but what are all these things that I've
just been talking about about service
products what what are the attributes
that we care about here about what a
service product is so first of all
service products require no management
of server hosts or processes yes there
are servers somewhere but we're not
thinking about them when we're using
these services
service products self Auto provision and
auto scale based upon load and what that
means is that we don't have to think
about how we aware where we're going to
put our instances of our databases
we don't have to worry about how many
machines that we're going to need a
service product will auto scale an auto
provision for us
and finally in what I want to talk about
here serverless products have costs
based on actual precise usage not
something that we actually pre plan and
say hey we need capacity for X nope
service just charges us for what we use
now service products have a bunch of
other attributes as well such as
defining performance attributes based on
what we actually need rather than hosts
size and things like implicit high
availability but those are less
important for the context of this talk
so given that we can start moving on to
our challenges and the first one up is
this technical one how do we minimize
incidental complexity
well serverless can help us here because
it provides us pre-built logic that we
can incorporate as a service and I'm
thinking here about that product or 0
that I just talked about Amazon also
have a similar thing called Cognito and
they also have things like machine
learning service and the point being
here for many of the things that mean we
might want to experiment with we don't
have to write the code for that anymore
because lots and lots of people have not
just written the code that we can
download as a library but are actually
managing that code for us on our behalf
as a service that we can incorporate
into our overall application server this
also provides a very lightweight model
for the custom code that we do need to
write it's very very easy and quick to
to get up and running with Amazon lambda
and similar products I can actually
deploy an Amazon lambda running on API
gateway from scratch in 20 seconds
that's pretty fast and very lightweight
service also handles a significant
proportion of our systems administration
set up for general compute like lambda
but also for data storage and
communication and networking
infrastructure we can use a bunch of
these services databases and
Russ's without having to do any or any
significant systems administration work
and service also scales out horizontally
without any or any significant effort
and this is important because our
experiments are often not going to be
valid unless we can test them at scale
so we need systems that are going to be
scaling like that as soon as we deploy
them for the first time and that's what
we give with so that's what we get with
service so that's how we minimize a lot
of sort of incidental complexity the
kind of stuff that we normally come
across and how we can just focus on the
code that's specific to our experiment
next up we want to reduce infrastructure
cost now remember we're looking not just
to reduce vo that the overall cost here
but the commitment that we have to
deploying a brand new system we don't
want to be tied in to costs for three
months or six months if we're just
deploying something for a couple of days
well we're service we get very very
little overhead costs costs are actually
based on actual precise usage and so if
we've got 10 users going through the
system we're going to pay for 10 users
if we have 10,000 users going through
the system then we'll pay for 10,000
users but not until that point and the
good thing is that cost scale up from
zero and back down to zero automatically
we don't have to do any cost management
here or system management that's what
service gives us for us and finally
there's an interesting point here that
we get with service so in in traditional
systems it makes sense from a cost
optimization point of view to co-locate
a whole bunch of different features into
one system that's what we typically do
right we want to do a new we want to do
a new feature we'll take our existing
product and we'll add some code to a
product that's just the way we've got
used to thinking but one of the main
drivers for that even though we don't
think about it this way is that cost
optimization because if we wanted to in
a not in in you know five years ago if
we wanted to deploy a new system and new
hardware and new processes every time we
wanted to write a feature that would be
so cost costly with service we
don't have that constraint anymore it
goes away entirely and that really sort
of brings down the amount of complexity
that we have to worry about because we
can just deploy the code that we want to
in a Greenfield way every time we want
to create a new system and I actually
don't think that this is this point is
one that the service community has
completely grassed yet because it's such
a big change to how we built systems in
the past and the final technology point
of view I meant the technology challenge
I mentioned was minimizing tech debt so
we need a technical platform that
actively encourages decoupling of
components and that's what we get with
the event-driven granular architecture
that comes with serverless systems and
service today provides a great
foundation here but there's still a lot
of work that we need to do to figure out
patterns of good highly decomposed
architecture that work still work well
over time serverless is new and I'm not
going to tell you that I have the book
of you know best practice serverless
patterns in my back pocket and anyone
that says they have for the next two
years is wrong you know we've we've got
to understand how to build these systems
first but we'll get there now I want to
mention something this point and this is
sort of for those of you than the room
that may be a little bit more used to
servlet much of the time when people
talk about server lists they talk about
reductions in cost both from the
infrastructure and from the amount of
effort that it cost to run a system and
the cost savings are a service are
really useful and significant and I
talked about them a lot in other talks
but they're not the exciting benefits to
me they're not the reason that I decided
to start a consulting company and start
talking to people about this stuff and
if you're only using service for cost
savings you're actually missing a big
trick serverless also offers us the
chance to bring about the change in
delivery mindset of continuous
experimentation that I'm trying to show
in this talk and to really help our
teams and the individuals on our teams
really beaten make themselves more
effective
now we talked about what the technical
proof and I talked about service and how
service is going to save the world
mm-hmm but it's not a technical platform
it is not sufficient for these
challenges we need an organizational
framework that complements service to
help us solve the remaining challenges
so let's dig into those other challenges
that I mentioned so continuous
experimentation is about both the
continuously delivering new tests but
also about making those tests provide
ever more value to our users so how do
we need to change our organization's to
make this happen
well the key lever as we start looking
into organizational concerns is DevOps
but specifically here I'm talking about
DevOps culture and that is bringing
development operations and and several
other engineering activities much much
closer together
rather than having them performed in
strictly siloed organizations now in
many cases we're going to bring these
activities onto one team but if not then
we need to try and figure out how to get
rid of really sort of static work use
between them now the the DevOps handbook
which came out last year is going to be
a huge help for you as you start to
expand your thinking in this way and
it's really the most up-to-date digest
of everything DevOps by the leaders in
the subject so it's written by Gene Kim
and Jess humble and and and bunch of
other people it's it's really quite
extraordinary I use this book a ton when
I was preparing this talk and was like
the number of sticky notes I had
sticking out of it by the end was was
amazing I can't recommend this book
enough for those of you that are
thinking about DevOps as an
organizational thing and not just about
automated delivery okay let's get back
to our challenges
so the next challenge is how do we
minimize initial deployment time so
DevOps has done a great job of improving
our cycle time allowing our teams to
practice continuous deployment and
continuous deployment is the idea where
when we make a commit to trunk in
version control then there is a fully
automated process that gets that out to
production and continuous deployment is
amazing I mean we were I was talking
about this with with Chris Reid who's
sitting there and Dan who's sitting
there ten years ago about how can we
make this happen it would be
extraordinary and now it's sort of like
yeah if you're good company this is what
you do is like wow now continuous
deployment techniques are really useful
for us in what we're trying to do here
with continuous experimentation but we
actually need more than that we need to
improve our zero to production time
let's remember what we're up to here
what we're saying is that we want to
build new systems within a few hours and
much of that time is going to involve
coding so that leaves very very little
time to actually launch our software
maybe an hour or two or maybe just
minutes so in order to have this ability
we need to be able to have automation to
bring up new systems and have a platform
in service that can react to our
requests really really easily and
quickly so that's so we need all that
technology there but we also need the
process and the culture within our
organizations to support that it's not
enough to say for an engineering team to
have something ready to deploy and then
hand it over to a DevOps team q he says
in quotes because that's not a thing
and and then wait three days for it to
get deployed for the first time right
we've lost our entire feedback loop
cycle there so I'm not saying that
operations folk have to be on the same
team but we have to be able to have this
really really fast process and and and
management and organizational culture
needs to support that way of working
DevOps is far more about culture and
people than it is about autumn
built and automated deployment and if
you read the DevOps handbook you'll know
that so there's no point having
continuous experimentation unless we
also have continuous learning a big
point of each experiment is feedback for
figuring out what the next experiment is
going to be but oftentimes this idea of
continuous learning is not the way that
we've worked traditionally in our in our
organizations when we're engineers in
feature factories we take requirements
we crunch them up often with the same
old techniques because we're under time
pressure and then we repeat there's no
learning there it's just robotic now we
need to place learning as important as
delivery and this will come in various
forms first of all we need to tear up a
tear up the backlog we need to change
our approach to management no longer is
it useful to build backlogs of work
three months out and track progress to
this as part of our effectiveness that's
the old way of thinking we need to
continuously learn and adjust to what
our product needs to be the change is
also on us as engineers when we're in
the process of writing code what are we
optimizing for writing the perfectly
designed highly efficient solution isn't
necessarily the most appropriate thing
to do when we're trying to learn about
technology or the customers need perhaps
copying and pasting code is actually the
best thing sometimes as long as we
commit to stabilizing it at a later date
if it proves valuable mostly what we
want to do is the smallest amount of
work in order to test a hypothesis now
Dan north over here has been doing a lot
of great work on this front for a few
years with his software faster work if
any of any of you here in Dan's talk
this morning
some of you were right so you saw those
20 or 30 or whatever it was patterns on
the wall like a bunch of those things
are around how do we think about
engineering in highly effective teams
and and dan has been doing some great
work here
I've been completely you know stealing
ideas from him in this slide and so I
really encourage you to go and and look
at some of his stuff and there's links
to his stuff in in the resource document
for this talk it's also the whole team's
responsibility to change how we think of
ownership so product management is now a
mindset and not an individual the most
effective engineering teams are the ones
that consider customer affinity and not
just the best technical solution not
every individual needs to wear every
single hat we don't need everyone to be
thinking about testing and ops and
product management and engineering but
we do need to sort of soft an or break
down the silos of our roles across
software delivery including the
non-technical ones I've seen many many
developers excel in this area and when
we treat all our engineers as just code
robots then we're really not untapping
their full potential so as we change
product development from being a project
process of regular cadence overtime to
one of continuous experimentation and
feedback based redirection we need to
drastically change how we approach risk
and safety experiments are going to fail
and product expectations will mutate and
the requirements of our technical
environments are going to change and
sometimes change drastically and quickly
now safe experimentation is not a
contradiction in terms
science labs do this stuff all the time
so how do we do this in our product labs
well first in my mind most importantly
we need to allow our people to feel safe
by creating an environment where failure
is not something to be scared of now
Google figured this out years ago the
New York Times wrote a great article
about Google's own introspective studies
and includes this quote Google's data
indicated that psychological safety more
than anything else was critical to
making a team work and this might seem
reasonable ones like okay that seems
good about how much effort do we put
into this
in our own organizations how often do we
actually put safety as a thing that's
like oh we're going to think about that
the best companies adopt failure as part
of their process now here's a quote from
Jeff Bezos CEO of Amazon on the fire
phone whom he remembers the fire phone
who he remembers what a debacle it was
right so Jeff said this he said if you
think that's a big failure we're working
on much bigger failures right now and
I'm not kidding some of them are going
to make the fire phone look like a tiny
little blip maybe he was talking about
s3 outage and us the other week the
point is here if we value
experimentation we must actively embrace
failure as learning and not just merely
treat it as an unfortunate side effect
so how do we go about making our
cultures ones in which it is safe to
fail well one area to start is with
thinking about is blameless post-mortems
so here's a quote from Bethenny Macri an
engineer from Etsy in New York about
blameless post-mortems she said by
removing blame you remove fear by
removing fear you enable honesty and
honesty enables prevention now this
quote is directly from the developed
handbook again and there's a huge amount
in that book specifically around
psychological safety of course it's not
just enough to think about the safety of
our individual co-workers we also need
to think about the safety of our
business otherwise we'll be out jobs so
several areas to be to be concerned
about here but I want to talk about
infrastructure budget and how do we make
it safe to create whole new stacks of
infrastructure on a frequent basis
without bankrupting our organizations
well first of all we need team
visibility and ownership the best people
to understand how to have the most
efficient Hardware orb systems is the
teams that are using them so give them
access to knowing what their costs are
and more importantly give them ownership
and the ability to drive their costs
we can also introduce a whole bunch of
new of new automation and tooling around
this so if if teams can know how much
they've spent on it on a daily basis and
know how that has changed in the last
day or week or month that's going to
allow them a lot more control over what
they're doing and we also need to
actively seek out and and we actually
actively need to seek out bits of
software and systems that are not owned
and so that we can either assign
ownership to them and so that they can
be managed properly or so that we can
just delete them I also think that we
need to introduce per team and per
account soft and hard costs limp cost
limits now this is a new thing and I
think that our vendors need to extend
their platforms to support this kind of
area ok our final challenge is data and
security safety so what we need to do
here well we need to make security work
as much part of a team's responsibility
as anything else I'm sure Erin would
agree with me and consider it like
operations like we now consider
operations a thing that we do on highly
effective dev teams we need to think
about security as part of what we do and
highly effective dev teams we need to
build shared tooling across an
organization in a way that protects data
but also gives enough flexibility for
experimentation where possible we want
to give teams autonomy for many access
controls and then we want to build ways
of having review into that so that other
people know what changes have been made
but there are going to be some changes
that are actually going to need change
request processes and where we need that
then we need to actively update those
processes to optimize for flow so that
we don't slow down our experimentation
process even when team autonomy alone is
insufficient hey that's all of our
challenges discussed yay well there are
many areas to consider when we think
about moving to continuous
experimentation as I hope you've seen we
actually already have a lot of the tools
that we need to solve them
but what about the questions that we
haven't answered and the challenges that
we haven't yet discovered
what is our framework for considering
these well this is where I think modern
agile can help modern agile has set for
values that take the core of how agile
software development was originally
conceived and brings it up to date for
an experimentation focus culture it
comes from Joshua Carey FC and the rest
of folk industrial logic which is
company out in in California who have
been using extreme programming and agile
techniques for as long as I have now as
a set of values modern agile doesn't
give us a proscribed process for solving
all of our problems but it does give us
a framework for asking really useful
questions now I use these values as I
was driving out the challenges that I
wanted to discuss in this talk so let's
look at these four values now and see
where they fit as we consider
transforming our feature factories to
product labs the first fad value is make
people awesome if we're considering
customer satisfaction here but we're
also considering our own organizations
people in the understanding that the
more powerful our teams become the more
that we can do for our customer so this
brings up some questions it says it
brings up questions like what will make
our customers more awesome and how do we
give our team members superpowers next
value experiment and learn rapidly these
are taking the ideas of Lean Startup and
bringing them to the larger world
questions here are what can we learn on
a regular basis how do we approach
experimentation in a structured form
sorry about the fonts here by the way
this is what I was talking about earlier
when I'm not using my laptop I'm using
Chris's so that's why weird text sorry
about that
next valley deliver value continuously
unsurprisingly the root of this value is
all the work that has been done over the
last few years on continuous delivery
but at the point about continuous
delivery isn't just about a process of
turning wheel
how do we make what we do valuable and
how do we get that value frequently and
regularly to our customers and the final
value makes safety a prerequisite so is
placing safety as high a value a thing
to be concerned about as anything else
within our new world so with such an
environment of change and uncertainty
how can we make it safe to experiment we
need a safe environment for our team
members our companies and our customers
what are the areas of risk in our daily
work what are the limits of
experimentation of the of our
experimentation environment and how do
we build appropriate safety nets so in
this talk I've shown that we now have
the ability to have idea to production
lead times of hours and not years and
this enables us to think about how we
approach product development in a new
way
one of continuous experimentation rather
than the old project mindsets that we've
used before continuous experimentation
is really a natural progression from
continuous deployment through continuous
delivery through continuous deployment
continuous integration sorry through
continuous delivery continuous
deployment and now we have continuous
experimentation as an option serverless
provides us with a technical platform to
do this but it alone is not sufficient
to enable this change
additionally modern agile provides a
value framework DevOps provides the
principles and practices and Dan's
software faster work with patterns of
effective teams gives us new ways of
considering how we work as engineering
teams and how we think about engineering
itself so this leaves my question to all
of you
how will you transform your organization
from a feature factory to a product
laboratory i hope i've given you some
inspiration and some ideas that you can
take back to your own teams so as i
mentioned before there's some resources
for this talk at this link which you can
find very
easily on my Twitter that might be
Roberts I also as I mentioned have a
company we're dedicated service and all
of these kind of questions so feel free
to email me I'll be around today and
tomorrow so feel free to grab me I have
cool modern agile stickers for those of
you that like stickers on your laptops
and most of all thank you so much for
coming
we've got time yeah let's take let's
take a couple of questions and one at
the back yeah so the question is if you
already have a really robust continuous
delivery pipeline and it sounds like you
have a really robust continuous delivery
pipeline what is the point of moving to
which is using sort of traditional
traditional technologies like ec2 Bible
II I have no problem with the ec2 and in
containers they're all in one big happy
engineering family what is the point of
considering service and the ideas I've
been talking about today when you
already have a really robust continuous
delivery pipeline and great question the
the the thing I was saying I kind of
want to emphasize and one of the things
I'm trying to emphasize here is that
continuous delivery even as we got used
to over the last few years it gives us
this great great cycle time for an
existing product or an existing project
or a code base but normally it takes a
whole chunk of time to get that set up
what I'm saying is if we want to
actually build something brand-new if we
want to build a new mini system it can
take a really long time to set up all of
that infrastructure from scratch so
we're actually sort of forced into
building features into existing systems
whereas sometimes for it to experiment
it might be better just to have a clean
slate and try building a new system and
so what serverless does and some of
these other technologies do is they give
us a much quicker way of going from a
clean slate from nothing to having a
fully deployed system okay well I think
we're one more type of one more question
of it right yeah so this is really so
the question is so what if I have a
whole bunch of my how I built my system
sort of locked up within within a
particular vendor cloud cloud provider
system isn't that going to be a pain to
move it to a different cloud provider
and what if I want to have mixed mixed
multi cloud as its called
it's a really big question and it's it's
not
about service this is a question that we
are hitting now as an industry as we
start embracing public clouds more and
more and more what what are we doing
there about lock-in now in the
interesting thing about this stuff and
it's a question that I've been thinking
about a lot because it is such an
important one when we start thinking
about this stuff is that it's not binary
there's some of what we do in the
service world is really really easy to
migrate so for example for instance
actually lambda functions I think Chris
just left from AWS lambda functions are
actually really easy to migrate because
the code in a lambda function you don't
actually have to have any vendor
specific libraries in there at all
excuse me so the code itself is really
easy to migrate where the tricky part
comes is how that code is integrated
with all your other things so if you
have lambda listening to Kinesis and
then riding to dynamo and blah blah blah
and we have this interesting situation
with the cloud right now which is that a
bunch of cloud technologies are very
much commodity so things like file
storage is pretty much the same whether
you go from Amazon to Google or whatever
but some of these others sort of
higher-level features and not commodity
and there's actually differences across
them and so there's there's a real
question here when you're dealing with
this stuff it's like do you sort of code
to the lowest common denominator so that
you can migrate around or do you embrace
all of the extra features knowing that
you're going to be locked in and this is
a big thorny question and it really
depends on where you are as an
organization and what you're trying to
do and what your priorities are but it's
it's it's more than accepting that
lock-in is is a factor there and
deciding what to do about it and knowing
that it's a more sort of holistic
problem across your organization is one
that's worth thinking that ok we are out
of time I'll be outside I thoroughly
recommend sticking around for Peters
talk who's going to be chatting next
