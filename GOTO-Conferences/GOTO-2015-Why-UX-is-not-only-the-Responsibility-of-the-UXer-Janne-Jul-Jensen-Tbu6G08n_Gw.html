actually stayed because I know quite a
few left already and I don't blame them
because this is late so I'm gonna do my
utmost to keep you all happy and awake
and hopefully enjoying yourself and
having a good time the title of my talk
is chosen because it's a bit provocative
because there will be organizations that
will tell you that the UX is the
responsibility of the you actor and it
is but not solely and that's what I'm
gonna talk to you about today why that
is before we get to that you should
probably know this by now but I'm gonna
throw it up there anyways if you haven't
learnt by now you probably won't loan
but please engage rate the session and
above all ask questions I would be happy
to take questions at the end of my talk
just a bit about me so you know who is
up here yabbering
I am a software engineer I graduated in
2003 from Alvo University I then went on
to become a researcher at that same
University
and I actually managed so well there
that they offered me a PhD scholarship
that PhD scholarship was with in HCI as
it was called at the time HDI is short
for human-computer interaction and was
probably that x term for UX ux is a
newer term but it more or less covers
the same that PhD I did and finished in
2009 I then went on to become a
researcher again and in 2010 I decided
that now I spent eight years becoming
good at this field maybe I should get
out into the real world and find out if
this actually holds any water or if this
is just something we have invented in a
dusty university office somewhere
luckily that turned out not to be the
case I came to try fog in January 2011
and was really happy to find out that by
far most of what I had spent my time
getting good at was really useful in the
real world and as Kristen said I was up
until very recently actually until
Wednesday last week I was part of try
fork Thursday I started at Lego so don't
ask me how that is because I don't know
yes that's brand new but before then I
had promised I would come and give this
keynote and and I would of course not
miss this for the world so I was happy
that I was allowed to go even though I'm
not with trifling anymore
I would also like to know a bit about
who I'm speaking to
so show of hands how many in this room
are developers yeah that was to be
expected this is the developer
conference after all but I would also
like to know if there is any who are
responsible for the business side of
things such as project managers or
leadership or that sort of thing
show of hands all right that's quite a
few anyone in here work within marketing
in their business a couple not many
anyone within you act so a visual design
a few more all right so there are a bit
of everything in here but there's first
and foremost developers as was to be
expected alright um in my five years in
try fork we have had quite a few clients
come in and then when we were talking
about a new project then they would talk
to me about the roles of the project and
and and the scope of the project and all
of these initial things and and often
they are would hear sentences such as
the designer should focus on this and
this and we need to include the designer
in this and this and and I would usually
then at some point stop them and say so
you need an interaction designer or
visual designer because they would just
say designer and designer is a pretty
broad term and in some cases I would get
this response
and that's where I got worried because
there's a quite big difference and this
would be me then because then I know
that there is something that we need to
teach them before we start this project
because if they don't know that there's
a difference between an interaction
designer and a visual designer then they
also don't know what each of those roles
can contribute to a project and they
don't know what their responsibilities
will be so we need to figure that out
but honestly I don't really blame them
for not knowing the difference because
if you look at LinkedIn I just did a
random browse on LinkedIn if you look at
LinkedIn you can quickly find any kind
of these titles and I'm quite sure that
show of hands I won't test you on it but
show of hands how many of you know the
difference between all of these titles
okay not many hands I didn't expect it i
actually went as far as to make a title
generator because you can basically do
that you just choose your level of
seniority and then you choose your topic
and then you choose your role in the
project and you can more or less combine
all of these and you can probably also
find them out there and the thing is if
we don't know that I don't expect you to
know it your developers you're not in
the UX field the thing is you X's don't
even know it you X's don't even know the
specificity x' in all of the differences
between in these titles and if they
don't know it you can't blame the
developers for not knowing you can't
blame your customers for not knowing
okay so what's the problem in not
knowing what their title is for well if
you don't know what the title is for
then you also don't know what specific
part of the UX field that they belong in
and what they're responsible for and
this talk is about responsibility of UX
because this is how all of these fields
are related and I don't expect you to
memorize that and I won't test you on it
later on but as you can see there's
quite a lot of different areas that you
can specialize in one of the big chunks
is interaction design another big chunk
is visual design then there's the
architecture and informatics those are
probably the biggest ones but there's
also cognitive science psychology and
all sorts of niche areas that you can
specialize in but as you also might have
noticed UX is not up there why is that
that's because UX actually encompasses
encompasses far the most of this that's
UX the problem with that and the problem
with the term you AXA is UX is short for
user experience so I am a user
experience er what does the person like
that do I don't experience the user so
that doesn't make sense so you can't
talk about the title you exa that
doesn't make sense but everybody does it
nonetheless and the problem with us
being such a broad field is that you
cannot have one person be responsible
for all of that that's not possible that
would be a generalist and they wouldn't
be very good at either of those trades
my problem with this all of this is that
what happens then when we have clients
come in is that they found out this UX
that's the new black that's the thing
that we should all include in our
projects they don't really know what we
do or what we're responsible for but we
should somehow rubber stamp the project
so that makes me feel a little bit like
that basically I'm this kind of little
fairy that they will just shake on top
of their project and then everything
that was ever wrong and that project
should just magically disappear
Fairey just we all need some more that
except it doesn't exist and the back
side of that picture is that what
they're often looking for is that when
that doesn't happen because I can tell
you very right now it doesn't happen
I can't magically make all sorts of
mistakes disappear if I come in at the
very last stage of a project and is
expected to come save the world it
doesn't work like that and the back side
to that picture is that what they're
really looking for is that one the
scapegoat the person to point to once we
do launch this project out into the
world and they find out that was not
what the users wanted and they can't use
it and they are having a really hard
time then they will point to me or
whoever's in charge of UX and say you
didn't do your job right because they
can't use it this is not user friendly
this is not a good experience that's a
problem I don't like to be put in that
position
but why does it happen then why do they
bring us in so late why do they blame us
for whatever there is wrong with the
product well there's a number of
pitfalls that happens when you introduce
UX into an organization first one is too
little and everybody wants a
user-friendly product
everybody wants good user experience
user experience good user experience is
not for free it costs money
it takes a chunk out of the budget and
usually people aren't really aware of
that or if they are they aren't really
willing to give the appropriate chunk of
the budget for it and just like
everybody in this room is really good at
what they do
and should be valued accordingly most UX
teams are now who really are passionate
about what they do are really good at it
as well and they should also be awarded
so of course they need a budget
otherwise they can't function
and the other one is too late like I
said the fairy dust bring us in right at
the end and then hope we can come and
save the day that doesn't happen we need
to be there right at the beginning
otherwise it doesn't work
but there's more than too little and too
late there's also too detached there are
a lot of companies who has a UX team
that would be sitting somewhere
centralized and then they expect the
developers to cross to cross three
buildings to come see them about some
topic thing is that doesn't happen then
they'll just solve it on their own the
UX is need to be decentralized they need
to be in the teams and they need to be
there on a day to day basis knowing
what's going on what other problems
we're facing what are the exact things
that are being developed right now and
what are the problems we have with that
otherwise they can't help they need to
be an available resource and they are
not if they're detached and if they too
far away from where it's all going on
this one we've already covered a bit
it's 2d focused this whole UX thing is a
very fluffy term and since I just showed
you all of the titles that nobody knows
what do and all of the different
disciplines that nobody know her how
belong together
well how can you be focused on exactly
what a UX team should consist of which
roles what should they be responsible
for when should they be entered into the
project you can't do that if you don't
know all of these things before and then
finally and that has happened a lot
there aren't that many new axes that
have a lot of experience so as the
demand rises people will bring in a
rookie you work so that has just come
out of university nothing wrong with
that I've been there but they do not
have the experience and especially not
if they're being plunked straight into a
project too late in the process alone
and expected to save the world they set
up for failure they can't do that
all right so what is it why if we had
all of this salt what would then the
ideal UX process be what would be going
on well all of these titles like I said
before they actually do have specific
responsibilities not many people know
what the difference is between them but
they actually do have specific
responsibilities if you want to take a
look at this list and I could be making
that a lot longer but that list is just
some of the activities that will take
place in a big UX team in a big
organization and many of these
activities will be by specialists of the
titles we saw before so field research
actually going out meeting the users in
their everyday life at their workplace
find out what their pain points in and
is and so on face to face interviewing
find out what is their problem what is
that they would like to achieve in their
everyday life creation you of user tests
testing existing software before we
develop a new version testing paper
prototypes testing a functioning
prototypes benchmark testing the end
result software gathering and organizing
statistics if we have existing software
where we're building a new version we
probably have statistics we want to look
into those and find out what we can
learn before we start making new stuff
creating personas making detailed views
of who is your user not just my mom
because your mom isn't the user of every
piece of software in the world so it's
not really fair to put her into account
for that product design feature writing
writing for the web writing for an app
it's not just something that you sit
down and do it's actually difficult to
be clear and concise in every
communication you make in a piece of
software
requirement writing graphic animations
animators are some of the most
specialized people I know and the good
ones are really good but they don't have
to do all the rest of what's on that
list they focus on animation so I'm not
saying every single thing here should go
on in a UX process but these are some of
the activities that might be relevant in
a UX process and which ones in which
process depends on your project and what
you need but to think that one person
can cover all of that that solution the
problem why all of this that I talked
about before happens is that there is a
focus on just these two a lot of people
will mention these two and say that's
you axe to you it is because that's the
deliverable that's what comes out of all
of the other activities and that's why
that's focused on because you don't
deliver something tangible out of the
rest of them but they need to go into
those two for them to be really good you
do not get a good interface layout
unless you have done all of your
homework first you do not get a good
interface design unless you've done all
of your homework first
so that's what goes wrong people are not
aware of the first list they just aware
of these two and say how hard can it be
we would just get one person to do that
no all right so this is the UX process
these are the people that go into the UX
team but how do they then fit into the
organization UX is not a bubble UX is
not this sacred thing that you do not
encroach upon UX is in the tension field
between a lot of other interests in an
organization the users have some needs
and wants for a new piece of software
but that might not aligned with the
business goals the business goals some
of that will probably overlap hopefully
but the business goals might be
different
and then on top of that every project
has a budget and a deadline and then you
have to look at what is technologically
possible within that project and that
might also not be overlapping completely
with the two others so the idea of UX is
not a bubble UX is a compromise and it's
the compromise between the needs of the
users the goals of the business and the
technologically feasible in a project
and that requires you to take a lot of
battles to make those three ends meet
and just to give you a few examples of
no actually I'm rewind that that will
come later the examples come later this
one maslov's hierarchy of needs how many
of you have seen this before yeah I
expected that it's a fairly known one
and bottom line is that as long for you
for human being as long as the lower
basic needs the two lower layers are not
met that human being will not focus on
the three upper layers it is important
before anything else that you have food
water warmth and rest and secondary that
you feel secure and safe once that is
that is in place and stable then you
start looking at belonging less and and
love needs such as intimate relationship
and friends and also the prestige and
feeling of accomplishment and only once
that's in place you start actually
realizing yourself
so that's just the basic concept of this
one of course we all know that we all
know that unless we have Wi-Fi then all
else fails that one needs to go before
we don't have that then screw warmth and
food all right so what if Maslov had
been a user
what would the user the hierarchy of
user needs be well it could look
something like this
the bottom layer is data and content
unless we actually have something to
show the user that they need then all
else doesn't matter then it doesn't
matter to have a fancy interface it
doesn't matter that the navigation is
good it doesn't matter that there's a
lot of functionality we do not have the
content to back it up it doesn't matter
so that's the basic need but data and
content is something that we have in
overflow these days and to just throw it
all the raw data at the user they will
drown so we need to filter it we need to
massage it we need to choose carefully
which parts of their content and data to
show the user and when and we do that by
choosing the right functionality not too
much not too little the right amount of
functionality in an app
all right so now we've chosen what we
what we're showing them now we need to
choose how to show it to them so how
should they interact with it the
functionality is there but you can you
could realize that in a hundred
different ways we need to decide how to
make the interaction design work and
once that's in place that's when we
start making it look good
and we put the graphics on top
and as you can see none of this says UX
and the reason for this is because all
of this is UX all of this is UX the
reason for this is that if we don't have
the data or we have faulty data that
gives a poor user experience
if the functionality that we have chosen
for the user is too little too much
that gives the poor user experience as
well if they can't navigate it poor user
experience and if it looks bad that's
also going to affect the user experience
so all of this affects the user
experience it's the totality of it
but as I showed you before there's a lot
of stakeholders in this and they don't
always agree on what should be realized
and when and how so project managers
they have their needs marketing they
have theirs legal department they also
have a say
the visual designers some CXOs that have
a pet peeve of some sort developers have
a saying as well security wants
something as well all of these need to
come into the UX otherwise this won't
work and just to give you a few examples
of what these different interests of
these stakeholders could be then one of
these is this one is one of my favorites
form fields we all see them everywhere
we all hate them because there's always
tons of fields to fill out and there
seem to be a general rule not so much
anymore it's getting better but it was
worth it was really bad at some point
that because we can we will collect data
I completely understand that the
reasoning behind it that a company an
organization want to know as much about
their users as they can if we put the
white hat on it's because then they can
deliver better services if we put the
black hat on it's because that gives you
information to sell
but I'm fairly sure that that should be
a really really good prize in that
competition for me to give up all of
that information
because that's the thing users become
smart over the years they know that
information is money so if they know
that you were asking things that you
don't need to deliver that service that
you're claiming you will deliver they
know you over asking and then they will
think quid pro quo and say okay
am I getting enough for this
and what will happen is if they still
want what you're selling but they don't
think you deserve all of that
information then they will start filling
it out wrong then they will put 1st of
January 1995 as their birthday and they
will put in Mickey Mouse as their name
and some fictitious address and the only
thing that's worse for you to have then
not having data is faulty data because
that makes you take wrong musicians so
don't over ask but this is one of the
classical ones that the project manager
might come up with and that the uxr then
has to fight and saying that's not
really in the interest of the user
that's maybe in the interest of the
organization but it's not going to fly
because you're not going to get what you
want another one is something like this
that could be the project manager it
could also be marketing that will try to
push upon the user without the user
noticing something that the user doesn't
want and the user will find out I had a
fun experience with this one I had a
friend he is a great guy but he does not
know anything about computers he called
me up in panic one day yeah you know
Google has gone missing so damn Google
is big that's that's something she meant
to have that gone missing what had
happened was that he had updated Java
and he had not seen that and then not
only did he get the toolbar but it was
also his primary search provider so his
front screen on his his opening screen
on his browser that used to be Google
was now the ask toolbar
and he did not know what to do about it
he did not even know what had happened
or when it had happened so I had to go
through with him
finding the program uninstalling finding
Google again getting that to be the
default bla bla bla it worked but the
thing is this could be marketing doing
that in your organization you have a
primary product that everybody wants now
you have this new product that you would
like to give like a really good lift off
and you do so by bundling it with what
people really want and then stuffing it
down their throat when they're not
looking don't think that they don't
realize that's what's going on they will
and they will get really mad at you for
doing so this is not really good for
Oracle to be the anchorman of this
that it it digs into your trust as a
company if you do something like that
people are going to think twice about
saying yes to some of your products
another time because they never know
what they will get away with in the end
this one could also be a marketing one
I am a fan of NFL I play NFL fantasy and
on NFL's website when you are logged
into your fantasy league and you are in
the game center and you are looking at
your team and the team that you're
opposing that week then it right in the
middle of you checking out all of your
players and who's meeting who this week
and so on a video will start playing and
not without sound so basically that's
when you scramble for your mute button
because you're in the middle of a
meeting and you're actually on a website
you shouldn't be on and so on and so
forth right we've all been there don't
tell me you haven't
so either you scramble for your mute
button going bright red because you know
you're doing something you shouldn't at
the moment or you are swearing because
you jumped out of your seat because you
weren't prepared for that sound to come
out of the speakers especially if they
turned up you can get really scared but
that's also a marketing thing because
they would say Oh buddy should start
also playing because then we know the
user will see it and we know that they
will know we have a new product out yeah
and they're gonna hate you for it and
they are gonna actively avoid that
product because it scared them shitless
the first place
all right legal another one of my
favorites privacy policies terms and
conditions all of these fancy words that
has to be in there somewhere there was
an English company they did a very
unscientific small study where they had
put up a web Wi-Fi hotspot with some
terms and conditions that people had to
to sign on to to use the Wi-Fi and six
out of six people in that study had them
signed away the right to their first
born people don't read it and here's the
thing the I agree button it's
deactivated because somebody can't
somebody found out that people aren't
reading these and they really should be
because they should know what they
agreeing to so let's make them scroll
down for the I agree button to go active
yeah because that's gonna make them read
no it's not
and as if checking one box wasn't enough
why
see that's the thing as a UX ER which
I'm not but as a you actually I'm
responsible for that no legal is
responsible for that and also the effect
it has on the user experience that's
what I mean when I say that everybody is
responsible for UX because when you make
a decision in a product whether it's
legal or marketing or project managers
or whatever you have to be aware that
that will affect the user experience and
you have to think to yourself am i doing
this in my own selfish interest or am i
doing that in the interest of the user
if you're lucky there will be win-win
and it's the interest of both if you're
not then try if it is a must-win battle
in your organization try and make it the
least comfort zone for the user as you
can visual designers because I'm getting
all around I'm hammering all of you here
visual designers they love the bling
they love the aesthetics the thing is
sometimes that would become too
important to them and that will that
will supersede the usability this is a
weather app called haze I know the
people who made them they're nice people
but they're also very graphically minded
and they wanted to make the ultimate
aesthetically pleasing app and I think
they did the problem was that the user
experience suffered in the process
because the navigation of that one is
horrendous and it takes a very long time
to figure out how everything works on
top of that they have in order to make
it aesthetically pleasing they have
actually delivered less than minimum
viable product because there wasn't
enough functionality for that to be an
actual replacement for any weather app
I'm normally using there are some key
features missing in there and the thing
is it's not because they didn't have
time to develop these features because
they used plenty of time to develop
themes of all sorts for the app themes
that gradually become available as you
browse around the app and then it
becomes available as you go into
settings or as you go into something
else so it's not that they didn't have
the time or the budget to actually make
the features they just chose to focus on
something else graphics
again compromising the user experience
I mentioned that CXOs might sometimes
have a pet peeve and I have had clients
not only six hours but clients in
general coming in and saying although we
should have QR codes said no user ever
because that's approximately right
people don't use those and the reason
that they don't use those is because
they are often used wrong in whatever
software you're developing they used
instead of it very easy to remember URL
that you might as well type into your
browser now you put it on a QR code that
then makes the user have to download an
extra app that can actually scan that
code to make it go into your URL which
doesn't make any sense
there are cases where QR codes will make
sense but in most cases it's just
instead of a URL that you could make
that would be easily rememberable and
then you wouldn't have that problem
all right and now comes to the majority
of you developers
content as I said before in the user
needs triangle that's the basis we need
the content otherwise it's not
interesting and very often I have
developers saying oh but we can't get
that data that's not available to us and
in many cases they're right in some
cases they're also just lazy and I look
at them and saying we can't get it or we
can't be bothered to get it and then
push them a little bit because we need
that if we can't get the data if we
can't get what the user came there for
originally then it doesn't matter so we
have to make that extra effort I'm
perfectly aware that sometimes that
means extra hours and then we have to
look at a budget to find out if they're
actually there but since we're looking
at the very basis of the software we're
developing I should think that there
should be some budget for that
performance
so many of you have had apps that then
when you open them then they weren't
responsive enough and you deleted them
and you never look back
that happens to users as well that's not
dos developers you users as well it
happens so often that people lose their
temper with a piece of software because
it's too slow just a rule of thumb 0.1
second is the maximum delay that a user
won't notice one second is the maximum
delay that a user will notice but
without losing their train of thought
without actually breaking their rhythm
of what they're doing ten seconds is the
limit that people will not accept and
will leave abandon your software so I
can make the best interface in the world
but if the performance is poor people
aren't going to use it so developers are
also responsible for the UX because that
definitely affects the user experience
that one less is more typical Apple
product really really minimalistic do
one thing and do it really great Google
fantastic searches that's all it does
but it does it really well and then
there's that one
the one way it just ran off with the
developers because oh but we can do this
as well and it's really clever and
really smart and then I can get to use
this new technology yeah but is it
something that the user want maybe not
so sometimes less is more
often times less is more and yes it
might be smart but just because we can
do it doesn't mean we should
Security+ the specific kind of
developers typically but it's still one
of my pet peeves
how many of you fight with this
yeah we all do because even though how
many of you in here are security people
okay there's actually a few brave enough
to put up their hand I like it
see the thing is even security people
will fight with this nevertheless they
insist it should be there and it doesn't
make my sense because cognitively human
beings aren't able to do that they
aren't able to remember random passwords
especially not to the amount that we
actually need today and nevertheless we
ask it of them you would look at me
funny if I in all seriousness looked at
you and said please run a hundred miles
per hour I say I can't do that
no well go ahead do it that's a
requirement but I can't no users can do
that either nevertheless be required of
them
cognitively they're not capable of doing
that it's a hard limitation nevertheless
we ask it of them there was some
research done and web some people within
UX we're looking into how can we ease
this pain but without compromising
security because it's not like I don't
understand the necessity of security of
course I do
but first of all this is designed to
avoid people breaking other people's
passwords but that's not usually who
does it it's machines and the only thing
that affects the strength of a passwords
if it's machines breaking is brute force
thus the length of the password it
doesn't matter if it's it's if it's
special characters or capital letters or
a number that doesn't matter it's the
length that matters and most people have
something it's not completely random
passwords that people use people have
like concatenated words and then like a
number at the end or at the beginning of
something like that and there was some
research done where they actually
extended the length of the password and
then they sure they let the user choose
two characters in that password to be
shown
so if we're doing this whole
concatenated word thing then they would
show the first letter in the second word
and maybe the first of the ending
numbers that would greatly improve
people's ability to actually remember
that password and and limit it to you
know the subset of passwords that it
might be but without actually getting in
conflict with the security because the
password was just that much longer so
they were still r8 unknown characters
but now there were also two known ones
so it is possible to join security and
UX if you think a little about it rather
than just in it just insisting that it
just has to be this way
all right so you a sister use the uxs
responsibility I think we've established
that's not the case I think we've also
established that UX is not a bubble it
exists within all sorts of restrictions
do we have the right data if we don't
that affects the u.s. do we have enough
of a budget if we don't that affects the
UX do we have the right technology if
not yeah the business is it putting an
emphasis on this
or are they are there different or are
their interests different from the users
and are they insisting on that security
are they actually listening when we say
this is difficult for users
the deadline is that making it
impossible to make something good
marketing are they having their own pet
peeves that they might want to push in
front and insist on then that affects us
as well and graphical design if they
insist on it being bling and
aesthetically pleasing and that's about
everything else that certainly affects
the UX as well so as you can see UX
lives a hard life in the middle of
everything and that's why we need your
help because we can't do it alone UX is
a team effort
UX is not the USS responsibility
that's all I had thank you okay so
there's a few questions here so there's
one question saying and you exit has to
be automated can uxs be automated
do you even test it yes I do test it you
can test it at any kind of level in the
process you can test it on a paper
prototype you can test it functioning
prototype you can test the end product
you can basically test it in all phases
of a development process so definitely
you can test it can it be automated I
highly doubt it but you can you can save
because I know this question probably
comes out of a worry with budget because
it is expensive to run tests you can do
something that's semi automated because
you can do remote usability testing
that's a socratis where you use a piece
of software within which your piece of
software will run and then in that
framework you will have questions and
tasks that the user should answer and
solve and they will report back and then
the only kind of expense you have is a
symbolic payment to the users that are
helping you and any kind of payment for
the piece of software that you're using
so you can significantly save money on
the test part of UX by doing remote
usability testing in an asynchronous and
semi automated way of course there has
to be someone in the other end looking
at everything that's coming in and then
transforming that into some
recommendations that you can't avoid but
I think that's as much as you can
automate it
okay there's one more so do your best
thing this accept these legal terms
kinds of situations and the question is
how do you solve that accept these legal
terms from a UX perspective well I'm
just like security because I know the
necessity of good security I also know
the necessity of having well to say
bluntly you're asked coverage because
that's what it's about I know the
necessity of that especially if in your
your in some markets where you can get
easily sued over well everything but you
can do it in a very unintrusive manner
such as the list of I I consent that
blah blah blah and there was like twelve
of them why not just put one and saying
I accept terms and conditions why do you
make people scroll for the agree button
to go become active I mean it has to be
there I know that
but you can easily do it by saying that
hey if you Facebook does it if you once
you sign up if you say yes to the terms
and conditions the fact that you keep
using their software means that you
actively have accepted the terms and
conditions it's not even like you have
to accept every time only if they
actually change the terms and conditions
but otherwise the fact that you use
their software means you accept their
terms and conditions
that's very unintuitive doesn't mean
that they have any less covered so it's
not about saying okay then we just
shouldn't have any kind of legal
coverage at all of course we should
but let's not rub it in the face of the
user let's not make that the primary
functionality of the app okay thank you
so there's another question here saying
do you have any advice for a developer
who cares about UX but who finds himself
building suboptimal user experiences due
to time pressure oh that's a good
question and whoever whoever asked that
I really feel for you because that's not
a fun position to be in
that's a difficult one that's a
difficult one I would I would start by
trying to make people more aware of this
field they're his co-workers his is his
manager
maybe leadership by you know showing
them videos of some good talks that are
out there by maybe inviting in a speaker
that knows what they're talking about
because it might not be a lack of
interest in they might just not be aware
of this field existing and the
importance of it and that would be maybe
a first step to make people aware
secondly once they are aware it's going
to be a bit hard to ignore once you
actively start pushing and saying we
should really consider this because
search inserts and so and so and if if
he's not getting anywhere with it and
and that's a huge pain point for him
then perhaps look for a place where they
actually value it some more where they
see the importance of it because luckily
more and more places are actually
valuing good UX today
okay the last there's a last question
but it's actually more of a pun on the
go-to organization you know they're
they're asking how do you how do you
evaluate the UX of this and the
questionnaire you have to fill out I
think we'll just say thank you thanks
for joining thank you
