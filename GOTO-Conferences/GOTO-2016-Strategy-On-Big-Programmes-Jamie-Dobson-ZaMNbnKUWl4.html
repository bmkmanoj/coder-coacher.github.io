come for an introduction to dakka dakka
dakka dakka you're in the wrong place so
I don't know whose knock it out I'm a
little bit because I work for a company
called container solutions and what we
do at container solutions is we help
companies implement programmable
infrastructure build applications and
what we've discovered in the last two
years but also what I've seen in the
last 10 or 12 years of my own career is
that new technology only really takes
hold in customers or organizations that
take a strategic view of the matter now
containerization is a little bit
different to normal new in technologies
that you know work in a localized area
and that's typically for three reasons
containerization spans organizations so
it spans groups within organizations it
doesn't just affect development or
operations but rather both teams so this
needs to be coordination and typically
companies who were introducing
containers and programmable
infrastructure do not have the skills in
order to sort of carry out that change
so there's a skills deficit a capacity
deficit and the central paradox of all
business strategy is what's good for the
organization is often bad for those
within the organization so I was at a
summit recently where somebody stood on
stage a pretty senior member of the team
from a vendor and he said using our
platform
nobody will lose their jobs he was lying
and I told him he was lying and then he
walked away but you know so it's a very
disingenuous thing to say that software
and technology doesn't create
displacement it does and that's why
there's so much resistance so strategy
is to do with dealing with resistance
and dealing with this underlining
paradox that what is good for an
organization is often bad for the people
within it what I'd like to do today then
it's three things I want to introduce
the word strategy it's actually a very
hated word it's hated by nearly
everybody mainly because it's been used
and abused to sort of lose all meaning
people talk about this
social media strategy and all they
actually mean is they're good a tweet a
little bit more that's not a strategy
and they talk about the containerization
strategy and it's because the ball
Adrian's book and are going to do a
introductory training course that's also
not a containerization strategy so I
want to reclaim the word then I want to
share some of the key impediments that
I've seen in the last two years helping
customers to succeed with programmable
infrastructure and containerization and
actually I see Owens here today and we
first met 10 11 years ago when I'd been
doing a big program for KLM the Dutch
airline and the patterns we spoke about
then still hold today so as much as this
is a reflection about the last two years
of my work it's also really a reflection
of the last 12 to 15 years and the third
thing I'd like to do is give some advice
for overcoming these impediments which
hopefully you could take away to your
organizations and do something with so
the story begins like all good stories
back in ancient Greece so after the
Battle of Troy where Odysseus or Ulysses
dependent of you looking at the room and
all the Greek version he left and he was
on the way back to Ithaca to see his
wife and his children of course the last
thing he did is he left Froy was cursed
the gods
so Poseidon rose up and blew him off
course and thus began a 10 year Odyssey
trying to get back to his wife I think
he must have loved there I might have
considered giving up but anyway he was
determined and within the story of
Odysseus you see some interesting
characteristics of strategy so this
particular story is the story of the
sirens the sirens beautiful
Enchantress's they sing wonderfully but
they're sing so well that you steer your
ship towards them and you end up
shipwreck in and dying on the shore this
was this key challenge because Odysseus
was a curious character and he wanted to
listen to the music without crashing his
ship a fatal attraction if you will so
what he did is he got his crew to time
to the mast
they also fastened the rudders of the
ship which you can see here so he could
go straight past
listen to the music and to overcome the
problem of his sailors listening to the
the singing they put wax in their ears
with cotton it was not a management
meeting it was a crew there was a crew
on board a ship sir
within the story of Odysseus you
actually start to see all the different
characteristics of what strategy is here
were a few of them in my opinion one of
the most important ones his strategies
built into a much larger narrative so
when I first started container solutions
it was my first real attempt at a sort
of you know proper substantial business
and I just thought once we got the
business model working you know I
overcame my initial challenges I would
just be here coining it in and I'd never
have to work again this was a I quickly
realized this was not the case and
usually one problem or one solution
leads to your next problem that's the
nature of business that's the nature of
technology it's also the nature of
strategy but the larger narrative for
Odysseus was that he was trying to get
home and then as he made these attempted
journey he would come across numbers of
challenges so you should think of
strategy as small goals that are built
up to create a logical or to achieve a
larger goal in this case it was the
sirens there's always an element of
situational awareness so for some reason
people think of strategy has been about
the future about these grand visions I
don't know why these people think that
but it's much more to do with asking the
question what's going on here now and
it's still answering that question that
we can create sexual situational
awareness essential to strategy of
coalition's it's almost impossible to do
anything unless you know how to work
with other people self supporting
actions this is another one of my
favorites believe it or not
organizations do actions or they do
things that you know a repose to
different groups
there's no point putting wax in your
ears if your job or your mission is to
fight the Minotaur you see operations
teams settle on a lot of processes and
tools and technologies that work for
them in their local context good you see
development teams settle on tools and
processes that work for them in their
local context good but
together these choices actually oppose
each other this creates a friction in
between the groups so believe it or not
many organizations do actions that are
not self-supporting so the point is is
that your actions and your decisions are
meant to build on each other and of
course there's an element of risk
involved I always said that you don't
need strategy if there's no risk you
only need a plan but from all these
things there's still something missing
and to find the missing element of
strategy we now need to jump forward in
time to post-war Sweden this is IKEA
does anybody have an MBA yeah Chris has
got an MBA
did you study Michael Potter's five
force analysis okay I'm gonna try not to
offend you I don't know how I know
you're ready yeah a key strategic advice
so if if you look at IKEA now and you
did you did it what would be you could
call a classical or traditional
strategic analysis on it you would
identify customer segments you don't
identify the supply chain you would see
that they'd innovated around furniture
and also the geography of the shops
the problem is with an analysis like
that it makes sense in retrospect that
is not how businesses are created and
that is not how strategies unfold so the
first interesting point of our key story
is just after the post-war period their
goal their larger narrative their larger
mission was to create cost-effective
furniture for the citizens of Sweden
unfortunately none of the manufacturers
or distributors shared this goal IKEA
put in a downward pressure on prices and
so all the manufacturers boycotted them
what that meant was IKEA then had to
outsource manufacturing and design to
Poland where they did find supplies who
were willing to work with them however
as I just said earlier this solution
became tomorrow's problem because now
they had to get the stuff back from
Poland and it was at this point that
IKEA started to innovate around
flat-packed furniture so you see that
they didn't think oh let's have a store
that's cost-effective and does flat back
in but rather a
amuro's and in an opportunistic manner
ie IKEA management team we were able to
flip that around so strategy is a
process it's a process of opportunity
the next part of the story 1970
something 71 there's a change in the v80
rules in Sweden what that means is all
your consumer goods about to go up in
price by a couple of percentage points
are there any Swedish people here do you
remember this do your parents talk about
it because my mum never shuts up about
the exchange rate that changed
in the nineteen seventies right and I'm
like well you shut up about the stems
with the pound I wasn't even born okay
ask your parents please let you if this
is a true story I think I think it's
true although you must never let truth
get in the way of a good story by the
way there was a change in the v80 rules
which meant consumer goods were about to
take a hike in price Swedish people
illogical rational I think they like to
think they are they're all sat in a
coalition over there so of course what
did they do this in let's spend this
money so they started buying furniture
lots of it lots and lots of it at this
point
this wasn't a shop IKEA was a mail-order
company you had coupons on the back of
magazines and you filled them in I want
a Billy and I want you know whatever
else back to yourself and and they
couldn't deal with the demand
they couldn't cope with the demand so
what would you do do you turn all those
customers away well no they said to the
customers he'll just drive to the depot
and we will load your stuff up now some
conscientious Swede must've thought oh
 they're all going to be hungry what
are we going to feed them meatballs and
chips right the fan and sell for
supposed to be in there and said just
give them give us something cheap and
substantial meatball and chips write a
verse in a single act IKEA as a store
and the restaurant was born and so what
you can see is that the business model
for IKEA changed over time to become
what we know today this is the central
process this is the emergent strategy
model this was formalized in 1983 by
Mintzberg and if you take one thing away
today take this away
when you implement in technology and
rolling things out try to take this
model with you or at least think about
it
the three key elements to this the three
reasons this works
firstly you need some sort of cognition
most people think of strategies being an
exercise in thought thought is only a
small part of it so you need cognition
intelligence to come up with your intent
strategies but at the same time you need
an open mind in order to allow different
strategies different ideas to join your
stream of consciousness and ultimately
thirdly you need good judgment because
some of your strategies will be non
realized and you need to drop them some
of you imagine strategies won't be
appropriate and you need to drop them
too now what we see often especially in
our work around programmable
infrastructure containerization and
Technic technology rollout you see this
you see people with an intended strategy
and they work it right when I worked at
Accenture they used to say it was a de
draak xnt I apologize for that our
partners used to say to us plan the work
and work the plan right that's a good
thing to do when you were consultancy
charging hourly rates especially if the
plan rooms over plan the work and we're
at the plot so you get exactly what you
wanted but somehow it's not quite right
it's limp right I think there's a
Rolling Stones song about this getting
what you want and getting what you need
so there are impediments to emergent
strategy and the massive massive error
that everybody makes with this is they
think our strategies emergent therefore
it will emerge
all right the agile Istres have been
getting this wrong for nearly 20 years
right that somehow principals and Kurd
and test and architects will emerge out
of a group of people standing together
at nine o'clock every morning and having
a retrospective every two weeks it
doesn't work like that software isn't
built like that organizations are not
built like that a plant is emergent but
if you keep standing on it it will not
grow right and so there are ways to kill
emergent strategy and if you want to
learn them properly you should do an MBA
these are the three impediments that
we've seen leadership infrastructure
finance so these are the three things
that will almost guarantee to kill your
strategy in their tracks let's look at
leadership to begin with the problem for
leadership starts actually in the way
people go about their work it's not
completely black and white but you can
more or less separate people into
planners and thinkers and you can
separate other groups into emerges you
know add your listeners those who like
to play by ear
bit of intuition it's not unusual for me
to visit management teams and to work
with them and as I'm sorry I started to
realize that everybody on this side of
the boardroom is a planner and everybody
on this side of the boardroom is in a
merger and usually they both think
they're right so when you're
ideologically wedded to one way of
running your business over another this
is actually where the central conflict
begins what that means is people spend
an inordinate amount of time arguing
with each other I think we need to plan
more and other people said let's just
play it by ear let's just see what
happens so this ideological schism sits
right at the top of many organizations
and you can work you where right through
the organization and see this everywhere
some people believe in vm's some people
believe it could say this some people
believe in buying platforms other people
believe in we're all in the road dealing
with this conflict is the job of your
strategic leader or your leadership team
showing people the emergent strategy
model is often enough to get them
thinking about this I think our actually
there's a role for both types of people
the other thing of course is
institutional structures some
organizations are better organized to
create conflict to create disruption and
to allow these things to happen this is
f Scott's Fitzgerald
he said something like the test of a
first-rate mind
is the ability to hold two competing IDs
in your head whilst maintaining the
ability to function this is the central
thing that we need to learn and we need
to deal with when rolling out large
large technological changes so the next
problem looks the next problem is
infrastructure and what you see often is
not that there's something wrong with
infrastructure per se but there's
something wrong with the culture around
how we deal with infrastructure it's
very common in Netherlands where I do
quite a lot of work for people in
finance to say we have to run the bank
and we have to change the bank you know
so there's the talk about this and what
they often mean by running the bank is
keeping processes going keeping systems
going that are mission critical but if
you start to prod a little bit you can
discover the story of these mission
critical systems once upon a time
something went wrong somebody got in
trouble some money was lost and we start
building defenses around processes
around systems this is what edging off
calls organizational scar tissue you
know it's there to protect you
but it's clunky what happens is you then
create a culture where people don't
touch this particular system and of
course these systems and processes a
time-consuming they sort people in so
the issue isn't actually that
infrastructure per se kills your
strategy but what it does is it sucks
your leaders downwards into the middle
management tier and so where the middle
managers and our chin systems your
workers doing the same
you've got no room to breathe and think
about what comes next the reason I put
these monkeys on is because the the
dynamic of the way we patch and create a
culture of patching is reflected in this
experiment that they did at MIT I don't
know if it's a true experiment I'm still
trying to work this out some people say
it's an urban legend I hope it's an
urban legend because it's pretty
sadistic what the dip is to put these
monkeys in a cage with a trapdoor on the
top and the electrify the trapdoor so
the path to freedom was clear but when
the touch the trapdoor they would get
this electric shock then they put a
fourth monkey in and if
fifth monkian and the first thing the
new monkey does is try to climb the
ladder and escape through the trapdoor
now usually when somebody new comes into
a business the first thing they do is
try to fix this old process and
everybody go stop right don't touch it
what they do is they rotate the monkeys
they take them out put a new one in take
them out put a new one in and till at
some point all the monkeys in the cage
have never touched the trapdoor but
they've also never been electrified and
then the experiments do a really you
know horrible thing they switch the
trapdoor off and so these monkeys live
happily knowing that freedoms there but
never actually choosing to open the door
so this is how culture gets transmitted
through different generations you find
companies and teams where people don't
touch the trapdoors
these processes this infrastructure
because the person before them said
don't touch it and that that assumption
is never questioned so the culture
around infrastructure and how it pulls
in your leadership team is one of the
key reasons my strategies never emerge
you could have the best strategic
leaders in the world but you'd never
know it because they're around
patching systems that are dysfunctional
so this leads me to my third key
impediment it's to do with finance but
not finance per se but the habits we
have around finance now most of us have
worked on how many will you oh okay well
I'll give it ample anyway because I'm
sure if you're not are you if you're not
developers are you developer managers
development managers what are you what
are you all developers is there anybody
who hey operations engineers managers
infrastructure manager okay and
everybody else is just waiting for the
coffee to kick in
me too by the way
problem with finances the way is our
habits around finance so you've been on
projects where you know you need to
automate whether that's the bit you know
ultimate your build to do some
continuous integration set up some
system tests you know you should do it
on day one and people who have developed
good habits around it will do it on day
one but you know you've got a team and
they're the ten of them and they cost
about a thousand euros a day so it's ten
thousand euros per day and if it takes
him two weeks to automate the bill
that's you know what is that ten
thousand times ten it's 100,000 euro
like wow seriously 100,000 euros do I
just no good hello do you work here
check one two one two so people think
wow 100,000 euros to automate the build
okay but then six weeks around and then
you look back and you think oh my god
we'll spend a lot of time messing around
patching that build but you know there's
only another 10 weeks left so we're
going to automate it now the problem is
people don't really understand what
automation and software really is when
you are working through a script you
know it's might be tacit knowledge in
your head you're doing something when
you automate it
you've commoditized that knowledge and
now you can start to rinse value out it
I also need coffee you can rinse value
out of it from you know that particular
moment so it's not delaying
procrastinating on these decisions it's
not really saving your money what you're
actually doing is sort of stopping
yourself getting a return on that
investment early these weird financial
habits are what leads to weird
infrastructure that doesn't work
properly and it's the infrastructure
that pulls a leadership team in so all
three of these things are annoying is
that Mike working Matt so all three of
these things are annoying but what
actually happens is there's a dynamic
where the finance leads to the weak
infrastructure and the infrastructure
sucks in your leadership team so the
question is how can we deal with this
now I wish I had a black-and-white
answer but unfortunately the the path to
emergent strategy or the path to
strategy isn't necessarily you know if
there was if it was easy then everybody
would do it but one of the first things
I like to talk about is balancing
responsibility and duty so this is this
is a model that we call it the donut
principle I didn't come up with this
myself but I took it from a guy called
Charles handy it's a it's an English
donor it's not American right it's got a
hole in the middle so Americans are like
that's not a doughnut I did this talk
once and then all people could remember
was the donor and that it I was like oh
my god I have failed again so
our European donor and the idea of the
donor is to try to help people to
understand what their duties are whilst
reminding them in the Turing that have
actually got a responsibility something
much bigger than themselves so when I'm
working with managers or leaders out its
strategy duties you know the
conversations you have to have the space
you need
check one two yeah so the point of the
donor is to it
so in the space around the core you have
this space for autonomy now I always
think of my myself as a father I've got
two children when I know what I'm doing
what when I know roughly what my job
description is but there's a little bit
of space for autonomy and for us to be
ourselves that's when things start to
work a lot better now things go really
badly wrong when it's all core and
therefore all chore when you've got
organizations where the job description
is too full imagine strategy is almost
impossible now I was raised a Roman
Catholic strict Roman Catholic as well
rules lots of them Monday through Friday
at school rules in the house rules at
church on Sunday lots and lots of rules
what we end up want what we ended up
doing was expressing our autonomy by
breaking the rules so this was either
passive aggression you know smoking
behind the bike sheds messing about
or it was overt you know acting up
playing about disrupting things at
school after I graduated high school
went to university etc this behavior
stopped because he had a little bit of
autonomy baked into your life
I still eat Coco Pops my mum was crazy
about Coco Pops and sugar cereals we
couldn't have them right over we're
allowed to watch our TV now what that's
got to do with Catholicism I've got no
idea
I think the advertisements annoy day so
so all I do now is eat Coco Pops I'm 41
next birthday and I'm still eating sugar
cereals this is my big you to my
parents I think maybe it's time to let
that go so so we broke rules we express
the harana me by breaking rules I didn't
see this pattern until I started
consulting in LA got large organisations
and you could see I mean in finance is
often the most dysfunctional but you see
it in all types of organizations
people's autonomy is completely eaten up
lying management responsibilities ruling
processes that are dysfunctional and of
course all the regulations and
compliance rules that managers have to
go through so they've got no space to
lead their organizations and to lead the
changes and so there's no wonder that
you know a simple idea
takes two three four years to implement
so the eating up of this space is one of
the in my opinion one of the biggest
sort of problems when it comes to
emergence Trat adji another way that the
donor gets eaten is with methods like
scrum so I'm no fan of scrum because if
you look at the backlog all of your week
is plotted out for you and as soon as
you've finished the task you've got
something else to do and I speak to a
lot of agile Istres about this and they
said to me are but we've got a mechanism
for that what we do is we have a story
that's called an exploration story where
you can do what you like for an hour
okay that's not necessarily going to
create the sort of free thinking
open-minded Mormon where you know you
might get a new idea Google tried to
address this as well with the 20% rule
so I'm not the only person thinking
about this scrum and agile there's
nothing wrong with them per se but in
the hands of people who work in
organizations with door looks like this
agile stops being a system of innovation
and starts being a system of accounting
that's why they're all obsessed with
story points because they map them to
full-time hours wait and map back to a
budget dangerous method the dis doesn't
work either
this is when people have got so much
freedom that they end up going round and
round and round they may or may not
invent something but this is equally as
toxic as a donut that's too full when
you run a business often your life is a
bit like that CNN Icarus when you run a
business you often go between having
nothing to do and too much to do and so
hence the roller coaster I've been very
very busy and then being very very bored
if I ever figure that that out you know
how to deal with that I'll let you know
so the donor then it's just a conceptual
way of relating your duties to a fuller
responsibility if you're the CEO of a
business you do have responsibilities to
the wider society if you run a team with
20 or 30 developers you do have to get
the curd out but you've got a greater
responsibility to their mental health
their career development and things like
this often in soft
companies or companies that are becoming
software companies like in the banks you
see that the wider responsibility is
ignored this itself creates
dysfunctional organizations leads to
poor infrastructure destroys your
leadership it's a downward spiral so we
all have wider responsibilities and
management teams should think very
carefully about what that wider ring is
okay how do you deal with finance this
is this is a this is an interesting one
how do you help people get over their
their impulse not to spend money or to
delay spending money until you know it's
too late to extract value from it this
is something I teach to all my all the
customers of container solutions and
it's something that we use within our
organization we call it the book
it and the book it is very
useful because for two reasons if you
analyze what's going on with spending
habits it's actually because people are
afraid to fail right so they're afraid
to spend money that's not theirs they're
afraid to try something intuitive so
that gives you an indication that maybe
it's a plan based organization and
actually you need to decoupled people
you need systems you know what it's okay
to fail so when you try something and it
goes wrong you just roll it up and you
chuck it in the book it right
it's a way to free people but that's
only half of the job the other half is
actually what is the book about
and what a technology company is about
it's about generating knowledge so you
need to generate knowledge constantly
they antidote to risk is knowledge you
need a way to do that so every time you
throw something in the bucket
you're throwing something in there that
might later have value and in my
experience it's only a matter of time
before you're back in the book it and
taking things out so one of the reasons
I'm get so frustrated about teams that
overthink things overanalyze things it's
because all the time they're waste
they're spending
thinking they're not filling up the
buckets and I say your primary job is to
fill up your buckets because
you're going to get stuff out of it
later
recently we got a client at container
solutions we've been working on this
client or with this client for a year
and it's quite a prestigious one I'm not
gonna name names because the video is
recording but this is what this is what
happened the purchase order was for
25000 euros okay that's good we could do
a little bit of work with that it took
them six weeks for it to go through a
procurement be discussed beery discussed
and then go to the boss to be discussed
again on Friday afternoon just for a
laugh we tried to map out what we
thought that would have cost the
customer we think it cost them 60,000
euros to approve our twenty five
thousand euro proposal this is insanity
this is sixty thousand euros of value
that's left on the table that could have
been used to fill a book yup so the book
it has two purposes free yourself of
fear and generate knowledge now the
other thing that we've spotted in the
last two years at these different
archetypes of strategists so we've
talked about strategy how it emerges
we've said that it's a process we said
it involves situational awareness but it
nearly always involves people too so on
all travels this is what we've
discovered your situational awareness
you can think of as understanding of
reality a strategist or strategic leader
always represents a specific group they
always speak for them plan for them
represent them the strategist has some
imagination usually a voice and some
vision these are the core elements that
you need in order to get programs and
projects moving along in reality these
people extremely hard to find what we
actually find the people like this Fanta
cysts and in the beginning I didn't
understand it I thought why why do I
keep encountering people who don't
really have any understanding about
their own organization but they do have
this powerful vision and usually a
booming voice and the higher up in the
hierarchy you go the bigger your voice
is what is this then I started to think
more about it enterprises where your
donor is eaten up or even in a start-up
where you're struggling at difficult
places to work now what's the one thing
we do when we're having a hard time we
project into the future
oh you know whether it's Friday night
for a beer or actually you think
yourself well I'll be retired like in 30
years it'll be alright
so this fantasy and this projection is
to do with the difficulty of the
organizations you often find yourself in
many many managers fit this profile they
go to a conference they listen to Adrian
Cockroft talk and then they come back to
the Sauer strategies to do micro
services like Netflix and this is this
is this one I hear all the time we're
going to become the Netflix of the
Netherlands yeah okay which is good I
think well strange because they stream
videos and you're a bank so the Netflix
of the Netherlands don't make any
goddamn sense what they've done what
people have done is they've copied
somebody else's idea and said that's
going to be our strategy don't copy the
idea copy the process that created the
idea that was the thing that's the
secret of Ikea what was the process that
changed you know adversarial situations
into opportunities that's what you need
to copy that's embedded deep in people's
thought processes and in the culture of
an organization now there is another
archetype that we've discovered this one
the angry engineer anybody recognize
this one the angry engineer lots of
empathy nearly always represents nearly
always speaks for the group they claim
to represent operations I engineers
developers they often have a good grasp
of reality right they know that they
don't want to be they know they don't
need to jump to micro services right
they know that they need to do with the
here and now
unfortunately there's one part of
reality that they don't understand which
is that other people don't like to be
shouted at so angry engineers often
struggle to form the coalition's and the
social ties within their own group and
across different groups essentially
across different groups you take the
angry engineer and you stick him with
the the fantasies and you get something
that starts to look like a strategist
so I often say to people think very
carefully before you start talking about
new technology and bringing them into
your organization the questions begin
with yourself what am I actually good at
so there's a million times like well not
a million that's not true
many many times I've sat with leadership
teams senior leadership teams showed
them the strategies model and said who
considered themselves a strategist and
like five hands go up and I'm like you
know it also includes an element of
self-awareness right and if you were
strategist you wouldn't be hiring me I
wouldn't be stood here so this
self-awareness right this this sort of
narcissism that propels you to the top
of hierarchies is the one thing that
stops you making changes within the
hierarchies so you need to know what
you're good at and you need to know what
you're badder so strategy itself begins
with difficult questions
Odysseus knew that he had he had a
threadbare crew he knew what his
limitations were he was extremely
cunning captain he wasn't strong he
defeated most of his enemies with with
cunning and guile and so you need to
have self-awareness you need to have the
courage to ask yourself am i can I
actually do this and if I can't I'm a
willing to learn you know learn along
the way in order to know these things so
that brings me to my conclusion I think
I'm on time this is a good heuristic if
everything is deliberate there will be
no room for learning at all where is
everything
is emergent there's gonna be no control
so the balance lies somewhere in between
these balances change when you start a
project you start a new business you
want less control loosen your
organization controls and as you start
to understand as you start to nail the
processes and the system development
what you're working on
you can then scale them later so when
you do something new
number one rule loosen organizational
controls these compliance rules your
land management responsibilities change
the goddamn expense system right give
people freedom to think and as you start
to bring a program in you reinitiate
tighter controls so the balances change
over time but it's never 100
percent one or the other take one thing
away today it's this what's going on
here not where should we go
not Adrienne Cockcroft or micro-services
Netflix not Amazon not cloud what's
going on here
the first step of your journey is to do
with the present moment and not the
future you can extend that question to
be about yourself what's going on here
with me Pete Drucker the strategist is
three people an outside man somebody
understands his teams understands the
market understands his organization a
man of thought but crucially a man of
action where things go wrong with
strategy is for some reason I don't know
why people think it's a cognitive
exercise right you cannot think your way
through more situations you need to
actuate through them action reflection
nest next action
it's a generative process we're trying
to generate knowledge along the way and
then finally this model that I nicked
off the internet and modern psychology
is telling us what I think the ancient
Greeks and the ancient Romans already
knew when somebody has a purpose and
they have space to be autonomous and
whilst they're learning something new
whilst they're mastering something you
get extremely motivated groups of people
the real secret to the emergent strategy
model is that it forces you to think
what is it I actually want to do how am
I going to design the work so that
people have autonomy on what skills are
we missing that we need to master so
strategy itself typically good strategy
typically leads to highly motivated
workforces and that's my punchline thank
