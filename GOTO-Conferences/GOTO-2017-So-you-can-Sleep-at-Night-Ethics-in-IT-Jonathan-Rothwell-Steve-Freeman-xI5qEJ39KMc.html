here enjoying I hope the last day of go
through Berlin yes yes that was very
enthusiastic so my name is Jonathan this
is Steve we work for a company called
Zorka or I am not even going to attempt
the Swiss German pronunciation of its
despite the fact that's the German name
we are not German we're based in the UK
as all tourism Sultan see we do various
software work so this this talk came
about last year at salka we have every
every few weeks in the Zilker office in
London we do what are called BLTs or
bi-weekly a lunchtime talks and there
you can basically talk about anything
you like you can just throw together
some slides and at the end of last year
I don't know I don't know what happened
there was nothing us all about ethics in
the last you know at the end of 2016 but
I wants to talk about so I just decided
to write right so talk about sits and as
and as Steve will say we then took it to
we then took it to Amsterdam and now
we're bringing it here so please ask
your questions there will be questions
I'm sure please ask them through the app
do not put your hand up because the last
time that happened it was a disaster so
please ask your questions through the
app I promise we'll have time for
questions at the end if not come and
find us afterwards I'll be at the social
thing afterwards come and find us
talk to us we don't bite often
yeah and yeah so this this talk
contained scary stories it is entirely
free of conclusions and easy answers no
software exists in a vacuum and we have
software developers have to be humble we
have to be watchful and we have to make
sure that the decisions we make ensure
that we can sleep at night
so if this F as Daniel pink says there
are three main drivers for people you
have autonomy mastery and purpose this
yeah the point is just working so this
talk is perhaps less about it's less
about mastery that's the rest of the
conference this one is perhaps more
about autonomy and more about purpose so
quick quiz do you know who this person
is obviously you know through the years
cuz I put his name up there so this is
Thomas Midgley jr. he won the long
string of medals anyone hazard a guess
if I tell you he invented something any
ideas what yes not DDT not DDT however
close so bees if I say these are all
chemistry medals does that give you a
clue so Thomas b2b jr. invented was the
inventor of leaded petrol so leaded
petrol went ins car engines used to
contain lips reduced knocking in the
engine and prolong the life of the
engine but the thing was that was ladies
of course poisonous and that's led to
that was attributes all kinds of
horrible things that let's horrible
environmental pollution people died
during the production of tetraethyl lead
which is leaded petrol and they also it
was also attributed to things like
increased levels of violence in society
like in cities because the air was so
thick was led it would results in
psychological changes that would then
result in increased crime rates it was a
fun thing which is Thomas Midgley jr.
actually went to a actually participate
in a press conference about to
demonstrate the safety of leaded petrol
and he poured us over his hands and
claimed I could do this every day and
inhale the fumes for up to a minutes and
I'd never experienced any ill effects he
later had to take time off work due to
lead poisoning but after after that he
went on to do something else he decided
to beam himself he went on to do he went
on to work on safe refrigerants there's
refrigerants at the time were poisonous
and they could also explode so he and he
was on a team that discovered or works
on synthesizing the first safe odorless
colorless inerts
refrigerants which was the first CFC
which is responsible for the hole in the
ozone layer it's this wonderful thing
which is someone says he has more
impacts on the atmosphere than any other
single organism in Earth's history
so Thomas Midgley jr. responsible for
the hole in the ozone layer and for
untold misery through leaded petrol did
he intend to poison the world
probably not but how did he come to do
this Steve so one of the questions is
how do we get once you start digging you
get into this very difficult sort of
complicated situations and you it's good
to have some kind of framework we can
just sort of begin to think about it
so on the left here we have
we need to get conference the Dungeons &amp;amp;
Dragons alignment index I never actually
played Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons but I'm sure
this is familiar to many people in the
room the middle one is the Hippocratic
oath and everybody says so this is all
about do no harm
actually it's mostly about protecting
loyalty to the gills and doesn't mention
hardly mentions patients at all but
that's that skills for you there's long
obviously long philosophical tradition
the two on the left are well what
somebody thought Plato looked like and
Jeremy Bentham and that's the Strand
which is utilitarianism which says what
matters is the greater good is even if
you do things that are bad for a few
people as long as everybody benefits in
the whole that that's all right on the
right you have Aristotle and Kant which
says that what matters is the quality or
the intention behind your actions and if
bad things happen well you know there's
not much you can do about that and
obviously one of the previous talks is
if you really want to get into this
there's this that will keep you busy for
a while there are that in other
disciplines there are proper ethics
professionals this is serious business
so this is the Journal of medical ethics
or one of many journals of medical
medical ethics if you're doing trials
and things or new procedures in
hospitals you have to go to your
professional ethicist I've never seen
one of those for a software that's we
should but we don't we'd still so far we
don't go around cutting people up or
using restricted drugs but there are
clear regulations for those people
working in safety critical domains we do
have code of con codes of conduct this
is the ACM the Association of Computing
Machinery the I Triple E I've got one as
well it's mentioned over here there's a
lot of stuff in school and if you go
through the right colleges they do make
a fuss about this but there's a catch is
again unless you're working in a
stricted restricted area or controlled
area
it's for most of us it's impossible to
get struck off no matter how much damage
you do you might have a reputational
damage that people won't hire you but
there's no way to actually get banned
from what you did as a software
developer you don't have to have passed
a test you can drive before you can
write software you know they're all that
kind of stuff which is probably a good
thing that they're given the state of
the industry because we don't really
know what to enforce yet and who what
would go what would go in such a test
we I'm not sure that's clear but that
does lead to some interesting questions
this is a there's a TV series Silicon
Valley some of you might have seen and
this is one of the participants is
getting while they're researching and
you'll say that you'll see that they
went around and talked to lots of people
and it's not quite legible but it says
they'd often they would see tech that is
scary it don't mean weapons but altering
video tech the violates privacy all that
kind of stuff and we'll bring up our
concerns to them and realizing that zero
consideration seems to be given to the
ethical implications of tech they don't
even it's not even as you see at the
bottom they don't even have a pat
rehearsed answer they didn't just and
thought about it which is interesting so
in a way of sort of structuring how
we're going to think about this
channeling Captain Kirk who runs this
track in four go to Amsterdam it was
very strong on on Buddhism it turns out
that button believes that there were
these three character flaws that keep
people too satisfied and stuck in the
wrong part of their sort of
reincarnation cycle we don't have to
believe in reincarnation but they're
still kind of a useful useful
categorization so you have these three
animals there's a pig of the burden
mistake a snake representing first
ignorance that's bewilderment and
confusion stupidity delusion
that sort of thing attachment is around
greed and desire and lust and passion
and all that kind of stuff maybe that's
where you put your passionate
programmers and then a version is good
old-fashioned hatred and it's dislike
and stuff so this next section is a bit
depressing this is a catalogue of
categorized disasters and and things are
going wrong which will try and sort of
clean up afterwards but the goal of this
this section is to say perhaps look at
here are some interesting things that
happened perhaps we should start to
think a bit more about what we're doing
when we're building systems so if we
split up the three poisons then poison
number one ignorance this is mainly
about quality and competence I kind of
won't go into this too much it's been
covered a lot by the rest of the
conference two quotes said new word
earlier hubris thy name is software
developer but it's worth the reminder
that bad software does have real
consequences so the UK post office had a
system that effectively it was a system
in post office branches that made up
shortfalls and that actually led to jail
time for some people night capital I
think a software deployment went wrong
for them their system was down for
something like 30 minutes it was and
they lost millions and millions of
dollars they were gone within 12 months
they were bought out by another company
and Equifax everybody knows what's been
going all the like facts it turns out by
the way that the people receive or the
executives of Equifax are now losing
their bonuses which is good but that was
that was a bug that should have been
fixed that was about that was fixed and
they just did not deploy the updates and
then we have things like this so the so
it turns out that it turns out that a
Jeep Cherokee a cheap Cherokee I'm sorry
and various other cars can be hacks in
rather than nasty ways and strange
things can happen to them you can do
things like open the window
apply the brakes remotely and so on
attaching across the Internet's probably
not a great idea
to be honest but if we go back further
in time anyone know what with Garrett 25
years show of hands few people okay so
for those who don't know the ferret 25
if we go back to cutting people up
sorry 25 was not something that cut
people up with like knives and things
but it was a radiotherapy machine they
reused soft they reuse software from an
old radiotherapy machine that had a
hardware interlock the meant the beam
couldn't be turned on without the
collimator in place this one did not
have a hardware interlock and it could
be turned on with without the collimator
in place meaning that patients could get
zapped with far-far over be what would
be considered a safe dose of radiation
people got horrendously burned and died
horribly and that's just grim people
have actually died as a result of bad
software Steve okay actually the
interest think about those last two
examples just a minute is that both of
these are around taking taking some of
it works and reapplying it to a
different context the Cherokee was the
problem of that was that the network the
internal network that's in modern cars
the protocol that was not designed for
disconnected a local network that's not
supposed to be connected to the public
Internet in fact they the one of the
guys that did that was also speaking it
last year this year's the last go to
Amsterdam and again the ferric taking
software from one purpose sticking in
another without without making sure so
if we go to the second one this is
attachment this is the this is where we
get carried away with ambition or that
really neat idea that's just obviously
going to work and this is mostly the
realm of unintended consequences so
here's a couple of things
his kids toys that would have got that
record messages and stuff and and then
someone leaks the messages
and we have to remember that was we
stand here today this was used to be
governed by used to be run by a
government that encourage children to
squeal on their parents so it you know
it can be a sensitive issue it doesn't
have to be a government one of the
things about the you know the the
assorted disruptive disruptive
technologies companies whatever is that
they also disrupt stuff that we actually
really wanted to keep so one of the
things about things like Airbnb which
you know serves a lot of purposes but in
a many / part of the world there's been
a lot of work brought in over the
decades to stop discrimination against
guess if you're a hotel you have to take
disabled guests you how to date guests
of any race and all sorts of other other
considerations and that's very hard to
police when you're allowing people into
your house so all of a sudden all this
you know when this if there's just a few
it's no big deal but as you scale up and
becomes part of the infrastructure well
the sudden you find that that various
groups that used to be catered for and
now are now excluded and then you may
have heard that uber has is in the
process of appealing the loss of its
license in London and there's a lot of
fuss in the papers and and the media
there's social media and stuff about how
you know it's nasty bureaucratic
authorities trying to put a lid on on
this great innovation that's gonna
change the world
but if you actually read the notice that
the Transport for London published it's
full of things like well we didn't do
addict adequate checking of the drivers
and reporting of the drivers and that
they did they were using the what's
called the the grey ball to avoid being
checked on by regulators and stuff which
is not stuff you want in a public
service which is effectively uber is one
yeah these days
and so you know you've got this
fantastic idea for service you know we
don't get involved any of this it's much
simpler here's the thing for sending
money about and in this case its square
cash who responded very well if we tell
from this from this dialogue
anything that's used for communicating
from one person to another
unfortunately in the end can be used for
abuse so who would have thought that you
would have to block people from sending
you money but you know where are we
abusive ex sent you sending a dollar on
square cash and using that as a vehicle
for other mechanism for sending nasty
messages they found they realized they
had to put that in it's not the sort of
thing that you think about when you're
trained it might make people's lives
better and here's one please be careful
when sharing photos on social media they
can lead to poachers to our rhinos who
would have thought you know it turns out
the bad people are really clever and you
know they'll take advantage of what's
available yeah
incidentally during terrorist attacks
the police will now say please do not
post photographs on social media because
that can reveal who the bad guys where
the police are so fill out that let's
talk about Grindr so who here knows what
Grindr who's going to confess they know
what Grindr is okay okay I shouldn't be
so prudish we are in Berlin after all
yeah first time I gave this presentation
by the way I kind of threw it together
in a round in a round half an hour or so
I just downloaded some press images off
the internet I didn't actually realize
that the test users name was Jonathan
and was a white guy in his twenties
people have asked is this my Grindr
profile no I've done some I've done many
embarrassing things in my time but I
would never ever claim to work in
marketing
yeah so yeah Grindr is for though for
the few people who don't know it's an
app for gentlemen to meet other
gentlemen it shows you I've not got the
picture but it shows you a list of
cruising gay and bisexual men who are
close to you and you can send messages
and you can send photos to other people
but you'd think that they would perhaps
thoughts about this so the thing about
the location-based thing is you can use
it to triangulate to people's location
you can use it to just draw a circle and
then work out a potential place where
that person can be and the independent
report said that's the Egyptian police
will use it excuse me they were using
grinders to find and arrest LGBT people
for instance as well this is this is not
something that's it's not something that
is ancient history last sodomy laws in
the United States were only struck down
at the beginning of the 2000s Chechnya
is reportedly doing horrible things to
gay men there again it doesn't have to
be state actors as a bonafide gay person
this is the kind of stuff that
personally terrifies me and yeah it's
quite scary so here's something
interesting so here's a new AI that can
guess whether you're gay or straight
from a photograph some caveats here
number one it was trained on baiting
profile pictures which is probably not
it can't just tell I think it's based on
it was trained on dating profile
pictures number two it only works if you
are white and number three it only works
if you are cisgender
that is the gender you identify as now
is the one you were assigned at birth so
this thing let me just get the figures
correct it has so it could apparently
predicts with 81 percent accuracy for
men and 74 percent accuracy for women
now
question does this thing even need to be
accurate if there is some person
somewhere who wants to hunt down and
kill gay people the fact that all the
methods for finding witches were bunk
did not change the facts that's hundreds
and thousands of women were burned as
witches as Hanna Frey was saying
yesterday during the excellence evening
keynotes we kind of meet when we do
things like this we need to think a
little bit more carefully about what
this is actually saying so this is
probably not saying whether or not
you're gay or straight and to say it is
even though it might be a superficial
thing is ordering on ethical in ethical
irresponsibility and big data is of
course just it just collects human
biases and there's a real danger that we
that we say that oh because it comes out
of a computer it's subjective well if it
just collects human biases and then
reinforces them no it's not there's all
kinds of all kinds of situations I'm
sure I'm sure everyone's seen the video
of the racist soap dispenser so a white
person a white person puts his hand on
will these soap dispensers that has a
sensor and it can detect when it hands
under there and then a black person puts
their hand under there and it doesn't
detect they're there because they
haven't trained it there was a picture
we lost which was a which was a passport
application service that told a man
excuse me it's all day a man in New
Zealand of Asian descent that he needed
to open his eyes on his passport photo
they haven't trained it with an adequate
number of people so that's the sort of
more obviously geeky techie stuff but
there's a massive problem that's brewing
in some countries where you know we have
all these shiny objects and then
eventually even even the max start to
fall to bits
and then what happens to the disposal
this is in act this is survivor Accra in
Ghana there are many of these around the
world these electronic waste dumps I
have a house full of cables that I don't
quite know what to do with thanks to
Apple I have so many dead cables that
don't plug into anything more my house
it's not quite this bad but it's but you
get the point is I don't quite put them
back into the thing because we don't
really have a clean recycling or what do
we do with this stuff
not all of it is is recyclable and this
is a direct result of our you know
desperate need for faster processes so
we can look at pictures of cats which is
what we do most of the time and then yes
there's a mention of a Bitcoin this
morning this point pops up from time to
time is the whole point about Bitcoin
that makes it work is that it's
expensive to mine and you know there are
various sort of wild numbers about how
much energy bitcoin is consuming across
the world but it just seems to be going
in the wrong direction and it's you know
it's nice for a while but there's some
kind of grim hubris just in that so the
final thing the third the third section
or the third categorization is a version
which are otherwise known interest and
unpleasantness and hatred and all that
kind of stuff and some country people
consciously do bad things luckily not
many but there are there are some but
most people don't actually believe
they're trying you know they're being
bad people on the whole but then things
happen like this
you know everybody knows about the
emissions fraud Volkswagen turns out
other companies as well and there was a
little spin trying to blame it on a
couple of rogue engineers but I'm not
sure I believe that I don't know if
anyone else in this this that's
extremely difficult to the question is
how do you get to a company culture
where this is seen as as normal as a
reasonable thing to happen you sit there
we'll fix this someone has to have that
conscious decision to do that and
there's a contact around that you know
it's as Deming says it's always the
system 99% of the system 1% individual
perhaps they thought that them maybe
with justification or not that the
emissions tests were a bit pointless and
it was a reasonable to gain them because
the tests were poisonous you can see
going all the way back - MS Li you can
see probably people they're thinking
exactly the same and it turns out that
these large companies that we so admire
aren't always the nicest people
big conspiracies or big conspiracies
around keeping wages down for their
overpaid techies is rather disappointing
to hear that it's involved Pixar as well
because you thought no they were cool
and hip but it turns out they were in
the loop as well it turns out the money
matters and then of course the zubur
whose image is at least in some
countries has been getting more and more
toxic and they've they've shed the chief
executive and they desperately just
pedal backwards to make themselves more
and show that they've changed and
they're become better people then we
have stuff like this as I mentioned I
kind of wrote this sword originally at
the end of 2016
I was thinking WTF where am i flying
cars I thought were getting flying cars
in the future and well got this so all
kinds of grim things happened in 2016
and the concern about this is that
political lobbying is nothing new but
effects but they can do this the fact
big facts you know for instance that's
in the UK there are strict regulations
on the kind of particle political
broadcast you can put out on television
but there's nobody regulating how much
you can spend on Facebook
there's nobody regulating how much you
can spend on how much you can spend on
Google ads or Twitter or on botnets
that's
display or that's for certain messages
into the in front of the eyes of
potential voters
yeah the concern about this is how how
it's not transparent and again if we go
back to the aversion thing I'm sure
Robert Mercer believes he's saving the
world I'm sure he doesn't think he's a
bad person interestingly in the last
election in May it was looking like
there was a big upset because there was
a so it was thought that it was going to
be a conservative wipeouts
but the Labour Party actually came quite
like that quite a bit back and now we
have a hung parliament and it looked
like labor that outspent it looked like
labour outspent the Tories after after
that election which may have had
something to do with it so this is a
something right about the New York Times
Wall Street Journal oh sorry the other
one I apologize any Americans are the
audience I am very very sorry so this is
a something right about the Wall Street
Journal it shows you the typical typical
American liberal Facebook we have
typical American liberals Facebook feed
our typical American conservatives
Facebook feed
don't sass we might be American in
America liberal is blue and conservative
is red that's just how it is America so
political polarization in in the u.s. is
nothing new it's been getting worse and
worse over the decades but this kind of
stuff this kind of echo chamber that
this self-reinforcing can't really be
helping this chap Matt schabowski I hope
I pronounced that right he wrote in 2016
this year especially there's an
uncomfortable feeling the tech industry
that we did something wrong as in
following our credo of move fast and
break things some of what we knockdown
were load-bearing walls of our democracy
yeah sound familiar
who knows what this is yeah so this is
obviously the Holocaust Memorial which
is not far away
Holocaust killed 17 million people all
these people last year I was a Jewish
cemetery in Prague and it took me a
while to work out what the plates were
that had been screwed onto the wall on
one side of the cemetery
until I works out that's us fits him was
the Czech word outfits and all these
plates there was hundreds and hundreds
of meters all families gone like like
that's hundreds upon hundreds all of
those each one was family it's
horrifying you know what else is
horrifying is that all this happened
before the invention of the microchip
Jacob Bronowski was so ted nuit quoted
in this morning he was a scientist and
he wrote a television series called be a
sense of man in the 1970s he filmed
quite a famous sequence where he visited
Auschwitz and stood here and said this
is the concentration camp and crema
Soria massage fits this is where people
were turned into numbers into this pond
were flushed the ashes as some four
million people and that was not done by
gas it was done by arrogance it was done
by dogma was done by ignorance yeah it
turns out that they were sent into
numbers in more ways than one did you
know that IBM ramped up their
investments in their German subsidiary
around the time of 1933 German census
there's one of the punch cards
they did this they ramped up their
investments in intern in the in-zone
internment of Japanese citizens they
assisted in this all before the
microchip what if somebody wants to do
that today
what could they use remember it does not
have to be a state actor although even
if it was a state actor is that so
unbelievable anymore look at the recent
election results America Poland Hungary
Turkey this is scary so this is somebody
who snuck into Seattle super secrets
white nationalist convention and I'm
gonna quote this straight from the
article David Lewis who wrote it says
according to my observations the
standard Seattle Nazi is a white male
under 30 who either works in the tech
industry or is going to school to work
in the tech industry something's wrong
here really really wrong I'd like to
come back to this briefly done by
arrogance dogma ignorance remind you of
anything okay let's just take a little
breather yeah yeah yeah I apologize that
did that was horror stories that last
bits a question now is what can we do so
unless you'd intend to become a
full-time activist you know maybe that
suits you or or a monk or something
Europe you know as individuals our
options are limited retweeting might
help a bit but it's doesn't really solve
the solve the problem so you have to
look at what some of the things you do
have control over and if we go back to
the Buddhism the three poisons is they
have if you like antidote antidote
behaviors for each of these three
poisons so let's start with ignorance is
is to focus on non delusion is to remove
crime to the extent
you can remove your illusions about the
world and you have to remember as a
discipline we had we find it hard to
cope with off-by-one errors and naming
things what makes this thing we can run
the world so maybe we need a bit more
humility and spend a bit more time
learning about things outside the latest
hipster framework service thing cloud
service you think so here's an
interesting case in point so every once
in a while our current home secretary or
somebody in the press goes oh well we
have to ban encryption because of all
about people using encryption and then
all the gates go yes you can't but you
can't criminalize math you know that
doesn't work we should be free to
provide on Grace and unbreakable
encryption because that's the right
thing so that people can can do what
they need to do now here we go again
imagine where a an encryption specialist
in the 30s and we build a machine for
businesses to communicate privately over
the public telegraph like one of these
this is a an enigma machine from a
workshop at Bletchley Park Bletchley
Park was the UK code breakers Center
it's if you ever in Britain it's worth
going it's an amazing place and so I was
there for a workshop with a colleague of
mine Jamie Dobson and we were we used
the algorithm encryption algorithm as
part as a sort of test driven exercise
and one of the curators brought out that
there's a few of these machines left not
many and brought it out and all these
geeks
sort of went weak at the knees you know
cool than that cool technology which is
true but imagine if it had worked a
little better the world would have we
might have lost and the world would be a
significantly different place nowadays
that some of us would rather not be here
or not be in such a nice position turned
out apparently that the German
cryptographers knew that meanie book
could be broken but they didn't think it
was practical so encryption is awfully a
bad thing you know we must stop that on
the other hand here we are this is
cryptography being used to help
millions in place with not much money to
improve their lives and this whole new
world suddenly becomes available because
they can use encryption to do mobile
cheap mobile payments so that again you
know we said right at the beginning no
easy answers no solutions there are no
easy answers but it's worth taking the
time to step back and understand and if
there are easy answers for complicated
problems like this or complex problems
like this the chances are your alarm
bell should be going off you know
because something's not quite right and
again yeah this guy's great I've got all
these talks that he writes up
approaching the world as a software
problem is a category error that has led
some of us into some terrible habits of
minds of mind and I don't think it's an
accident or coincidence that the Silicon
Valley has been this hard at the center
of sort of hardcore libertarianism
because I think it's part of this
mindset and I remember I mean I was
there in the 90s and when you know that
there was a sort of deep libertarian
pockets and when it's sort of a side
thing that doesn't matter when when you
sort of start to get all the money in
the world and get control of stuff then
it becomes more complicated
non-attachment
yes I'm attachments it's time for
another pop quiz
who knows who this person is no one okay
it's Robert Metcalfe famous for
Metcalfe's law this attributed to I'm
not sure if he actually came up with it
the value of a telecommunications
network is porous excuse me I've
forgotten how to pronounce words the
value of a telecommunications network is
proportional to the square of the number
of connected users of the system or M
Squared so this means that many of us
end up working in these kind of
winner-takes-all domains if we write
that one framework if we you know
produce that one platform where everyone
wants to write it if we want to become
the next Facebook that's like a
winner-takes-all domain and the rewards
can be enormous the danger as always
with a shiny object syndrome we are as
vulnerable as any other industry I've
also heard something man
we're as vulnerable as any other
industries doing something just because
we can we there's always kind of a good
there's never a bad time to step back
and say what are we actually trying to
achieve here there's never a bad time so
look back and say I'll be going about
this the right way are we doing this
just because we can so Jen Schiffer she
writes so she writes a satirical blog
full of fake code articles like she's
written that she's written things such
as how no js' is going to replace java
scripts or something like that but she's
she gave a talk that's xoxo last year
and she said when things in real life
that sell sound sound like satire start
to happen it's way past the time where
we start Sneed reflex we need to start
flexing on how we're fostering a society
built on hate
we cannot let people at advanced tech
for their own selfish reasons while they
pretend they're doing it for everyone
this was on a slide about Peter Thiel
piece of field who was involved in
PayPal and how he seems to be extremely
interested in injecting himself with
young people's blood so he can live to a
hundred and twenty literally injecting
himself with young people's blood to
keep him young as Jen said immediately
after this we cannot all have access to
young people's blood especially not with
falling birth rates yes
I shan't remind you about that there was
a line from the lily tomlin which says
no matter how cynical I am I still can't
keep up with the world yes
yeah great line I'm trying I'm actually
trying to I'm actually trying to write a
dystopian science fiction novel at the
moment and then I turn on the news and
think I cannot possibly compete with
this
right so the antidote to aversion is non
hatred the short version of this I think
is try not to let them pull you pull you
pull you into their world not least of
which they're bigger than you so they
win this is a nice a rare and nice story
if Mary beard is a really interesting
character she's a classics professor in
Cambridge who's also bibbity TV
personality she's had sort of
documentaries and things about the
classical world and she she makes no
claims to be a glamour model and there's
lots of snotty comments on the web and
she had this interesting case where she
got some particularly nasty comments and
with some friends she found out who was
and got in touch and threatened to tell
his mum and so they met up and she
talked it through and Indian became they
became friends and you know they she
wrote him a reference in the end because
he was just being young and stupid so it
is written it's it is possible if you
extremely rare but you know every once
in a while good things gonna happen but
what's also tells you is that shouting
each other over the web particularly
over Twitter doesn't it improves
Twitter's what's called usage numbers
but he doesn't actually improve improve
the world so maybe a good start is just
to be civil to people in this room
that's probably not not such a not such
a strong request I I look at what people
say on the web and I don't understand it
I don't understand how anyone can type
that in knowing what's going public but
that's what happens but a good clue is
if you're restart you feel response
starts with the word actually you should
probably stop typing walk away for a bit
and come back some things aren't really
as we've been in there are now code of
conducts all over the place which they
didn't used to be that I can move
surprisingly quickly it turns out that
collective action a bit of campaigning a
bit of visibility can have an effect so
not everything is lost it is worth
trying to make a fuss and some care yeah
I like to just go back to this briefly
and say yes
this is great but it needs to be adhered
to there are certain communities where
they do not seem to be willing to adhere
to this I'm not going to name names but
if you if you know what I'm on about you
know what I'm on about there are certain
means there's a conference that's talk
the talk but do not do do not walk the
walk so it is critical that's if you
have one of these well it's critical
that you have one of these and it is
critical that you actually adhere to it
as well and you actually stick to it
you provide a path for people to address
these grievances otherwise
you may as well just not have it so this
is interesting this is a pledge by u.s.
IT workers so one of one of our dear
friend mr. Trump's campaign promises was
that he was going to stop Muslims from
entering the United States he did not
say how or he didn't really say why
either other than racism but he but so
this is a pledge by u.s. IT workers who
again their reference IBM collaborating
to digitize and streamline the Holocaust
and the internment of japanese-americans
and they these people are pledging never
again no we will not assist with
building a registry for instance of us
Muslims we will not assist with building
a u.s. registry of some of a
marginalized group that's could be
discriminated against if you've raised
if you've raised ethical concerns and no
one's listening or if they're just happy
to sign off of it then you can just
refuse and this is our last match a
Tchaikovsky put quotes I think the one
effectively we have against tech
companies is employee pressure
unfortunately enemy is complacency a
workplace free of politics is just one
of the many perks the tech industry
offers its pampered employees yes it's a
valid option to refuse and to walk away
just say I quit yes I'm an English
person standing in front of a bunch of
Germans talking about the virtues of
leaving sorry okay but the point of this
is clear should we use our position to
resist handing control to a few dominant
players maybe but who do we think we are
to make this call who are we what do we
know
we're just developers but who else is
there it's complicated but you know the
very minimum we can try what can we do
we can combat our own ignorance we can
be humble we can realize that we are
prone to hubris we can talk about it it
should be okay to say can this go wrong
and we can have a life outside Tech
learn more about the bubble outside Tech
learn more beyond your frame of
reference about other people
it'll pay dividends not just kind of
from an ethical standpoint it's it's
it's just good mom attachment just try
not to be seduced
try not to be seduced by that entry on
your resume that entry on your LinkedIn
that's new framework or whatever track
what people actually do with your system
Richard Clayton went into this earlier
little bits in the cyber crime scene but
track what people actually do with your
system and model the threats of hostile
users we we often talk about threat
modeling applied so security of
potential attackers but we don't tend to
think about it when it applies to
hostile users such as say an abusive ex
or somebody who wants to hunt down gay
people whatever maybe we should
apply basic threat modeling here maybe
we should consider that as like a key
non-functional requirements before
something goes into production to the
wider world and non hatred have a
visible ethical charter have an ethical
charter somewhere and have visible
reminders of its you can always leave or
refuse you can walk away you can not
sign that contracts your company cannot
go for that gig if you think that it's
going to involve people being put in
peril and you can just try to be civil
to people I'm not even saying being nice
to people because I think niceness is
kind of weaponized a bit and it's
obviously nice if you are a nice person
but at the very minimum just try to be
civil don't be that asshole
in the first place I'm sorry I swore
that sir in the end you just have to
find your own balance it's all about
finding your own balance most of us are
not going to be monks most of us are not
going to be philosophers most of us are
going to be full-time activists maybe
the thing for you is that you should
just be a jobbing programmer and just
really want or and you can give the
emotional labor or maybe the thing for
you to do is to you know it's to accrue
wealth and power and then become a
philanthropist instead of that
foundation and run for presidents or
something or it's something else but the
key point we want you to take away is
make a conscious decision and don't
drift into the world you didn't choose
thank you
[Laughter]
