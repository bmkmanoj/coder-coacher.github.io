really as a result of conference but in
particular I run that what's called the
Yale conference since Australians can't
possibly pronounce J aoo and so we
rebranded it in Australia and one of the
things we found and also here it had go
to is that we have a lot of people get
very inspired but then I would meet them
later and they say well gee that was
really great learning about this new you
know functional programming language
except you know I went back to my day
job and it was like oh oh my god you
know I'm back in this mess again and so
I've been able to live and prosper
really by living a dual identity so
schizophrenic 1ly working on the
bleeding edge technology but at the same
time making money by solving problems
with people who typically have a legacy
code so briefly the talk is I'm just
gonna you know talk about what legacy is
and the problems I'll talk about the
typical solutions and why they don't
work I'll talk a little bit of an agile
and legacy environment and I'll talk
about just some quick case studies and I
think that's really the interesting part
of the talk of experience I've had and
working with other consultants and
organizations in trying to innovate in a
legacy environment and I think there'll
be some side comments and agile as well
for those people that aren't at a post
agile like most of us are I work closely
with Mike feathers and I'm sure this
books will be coming out for years and
years but basically I think Mike's
definition is legacy code is code that
has no test or scary code you don't
understand
of course agile is invented a new word
for when they make a mess they call a
technical debt and expect all the
managers to pay for it I don't know
to comment on what a ripoff and my
technical debt is but it is it's older
it's written in a language you don't
like but in general however that's where
all the money is because most IT
departments I have one client that this
year has no budget to do anything new
just enhance and fix their existing
systems and this isn't an uncommon
scenario so and we use the word legacy
kind of like old but you really want to
use the word legacy and think of gold
because that's typically where the money
is most businesses and that are in
existence make a lot of money out of
their legacy applications and products
in fact you know they have a hard time
getting new ones they're as good as
their old ones in the end all software
turns into a big ball of mud this is
courtesy and the next picture is a good
friend of mine Brian foot
who's spoke in Copenhagen most recently
with go-to and basically the problem is
that after a while all software ends up
if it's actually been used and it has
lots of people working on it eventually
turns into this big ball of mud design
pattern and of course you know you have
all these great stories about Tim wells
no problem we'll just refactor it later
we'll defer all this and I think we all
know the results so the typical
solutions for doing this is first of all
rewrite it into modern technology this
is usually what happens when you hire
someone who just went to the go-to
conference right they come back and said
we should redo all this in Dart right
that'll be the answer the history of
rewrites is that there are some
successful examples just very few in
general changing the actual platform
doesn't really could you just cut that a
bit and of course there are these
automatic tools you know just take my
Delphi code
people can actually write and turn it
into c-sharp code that no one else can
write that's what most people that do
Delphi migrations do and they see their
productivity go down so again doesn't
really work outsource it this is a very
popular solution because when you don't
know how much it costs you to actually
build something in some vendor comes and
tells you you know we can outsource it
and it'll be cheaper you know an
executive easily goes for that that
looks very good near-term in a long term
you lose skills in fact you may lose the
knowledge of your whole business
many people have successfully shipped
all their product and domain knowledge
offshore so they actually have no core
values anymore this is not a state-
statement against offshore there's a
global set of resources of amazingly
talented people everywhere and everyone
should leverage those and it really
stresses a lot of things like testing
and requirements and so on because you
really have to pass these across the
great distance and you know our
collaborative tools despite you know
Cisco and IBM and so on still really
suck and they stress a lot of local
system as well of course the vendors
have a solution this is SOA it the key
principle of SOA probably the only one
that's really interesting is that you
have to have interfaces and most like
you see code bases that's one of the
definitions of a legacy code base there
are no interfaces so for a lot of things
and you get into big things and you get
all sorts of problems like these Process
Servers you know you can't stop them or
ever version with them because they're
implemented in a hurry so this stuff is
also a lose in general of course in this
audience the solution would be well it's
agile so we'll just you know pick away
at it right we got Mike feathers book
and Mike self-confessed said well I've
never worked another thing I wrote the
book but you know the biggest
application I worked on was 20 classes
which is pretty common for people to
write books well it's hard to write a
really good book and it's hard to do you
need a real example I think I lost audio
but I can you still hear me at the back
all right the other thing is that you
know it's really cool to do you know I
work with Bob Martin and you know he's
got the real cool
clickety-click barber trick refactor
this but it works for toy programs none
of refactoring tools are up for serious
refactoring of large Java C sharp code
bases they're just as no story you know
so there's really no way to attack code
about and of course if your code
mountain isn't written in one of those
beautiful refactor or beautiful tools
can handle like Java or C sharp then
you're kind of Sol right there are just
no tools to do it so it's really a pack
of nonsense when someone says well we're
gonna take a large legacy code base and
refactor it it's often an excuse for
blowing it up and doing it because
refactoring is a positive word so you
can hide the fact that you're going to
rip and tear this codebase apart under
refactoring and I know many people do
that but this is also a kind of nonsense
and the other problem of course is that
you can refat maybe you could get the
code refactor if you had some good tools
and strong discipline but you have to
refactor the data too and most people
the data is actually more important than
the code and so while there are
techniques for doing that none of them
to my knowledge are available any kind
of widespread commercial product so
you're really in big trouble trying to
do this now that doesn't mean that agile
lean can help right we all know you just
take the agile lean pill and somehow
that improves your organization it does
a little bit the way you do this is you
have to do an archaeological expedition
first of all because you've got Adams a
legacy code base that typically means
hiring backs on the people who left
because they actually understand it and
they're great storytellers this is a
very interesting experience and you also
find out how well some of these systems
are actually designed fella did what you
think for instance you find out that you
know transaction monitors are wage way
simpler than you know enterprise you
know Java beans and all that mess
because they don't actually weave your
program with system code you actually
write your app and then
right the sister security and
transaction management separately well
what an idea perhaps that will come back
again you need to have an agile team and
a tool chain so basically this is just
an activity of storytelling so what you
have to do is interview people and
basically get people to work with a
system for a long time you build a set
of stories and you actually build up a
picture of the you look at the coding
data assets use tools you basically look
at the value chain and you publish the
stories in data on the wall one of the
great things as you go into a company
and say okay you know do you have an
architecture and you're not supposed to
ask that question because of course they
have an architecture right and you say
ok show me the architecture and there's
usually somebody who has some old dusty
you know diagrams that may have been
made with UML or whatever it is and they
stick them up and says and everybody
would be at least you put them on the
wall and say here's the architecture
really everybody goes not that way this
doesn't work that way right the reality
is most companies can't actually tell
you because they don't keep a living
picture on the wall and again the key
principle in lean is put it on the wall
so what you have to do is rebuild this
picture and then you have to actually
look at all the assets so you look at
traces of real executions and
essentially what you do is you build up
a picture of this is actually a three or
four month job for a very large you know
multi you know multi-million dollar
legacy system you need a team so team
needs to be mixed that needs to know
needing to be people who really know how
to use the latest sort of stuff you know
they can fly the refactoring tools they
understand all the practices they're
very good at debugging and so on but you
also need people that actually
understand you know cobol or delphi or
you know if you're really reliable Ricky
and a really ugly old legacy code base
they probably have to understand Java
right because that's probably the worst
best that you have to work on in many
cases it's actually worse than investing
in a tool chain because if you have to
move hundreds of thousands of developers
say in a telco
or in a large COBOL and ABBA large bank
and you want to migrate them you
actually probably will invest in
providing a tool chain so that they can
get increased agility and that means
everything from continuous test hardware
software emulators
you know you know putting in a decent
source code management system my most
legacy systems have the source code
management system that would make an
agile developer cry and the easy way to
do that is not to say you know get rid
of that crappy old IBM source code
management system I should watch my
video remarks but they've all heard them
before anyway and replace it with good
what you do is you put a cache in front
of the wonderful IBM source code
management system you don't argue about
taking it out you just put little cache
servers in front and there's a little
script that makes it retire into the IBM
source code management system at night
that doesn't disrupt the existing
company and lets them buy cheaply anyway
there are a few practices for developers
one is isolate variability in the end
the important part of a code base is the
part that changes right that's the part
that's going to bite you another one is
another trick that's used almost all the
time is if there's any way to do
something that doesn't involve doing it
with code that's always going to be
better so the ease thing to change is
data we have good tools for doing that
so make it data-driven we used to teach
this to people but since objects have
come along many people don't know what
data-driven programs are and
unfortunately that makes program is very
very hard to change hardware is cheap
relative to humans so have lots of
mirroring back up logs caching emulation
so you can test it if necessary like
you're working a large real-time system
where it's real-time banking or trading
there are techniques for TDD where you
can actually use transaction rollback so
you actually do the update into the live
database do the test against it then you
basically back the transaction out so
you can actually do this is a really
nice dunt was done about five years ago
a great way to do TDD in a live system
you have a little bit of confidence in
the test unit before you do it but
it works just fine it's still one of the
best ways to get data from multiple
systems I'm sorry to say is the screen
scraped them but you want to automate
that if you're gonna go and renovate a
schema you know agile developers love
DBAs because they get along so well
right agile would like to change the
schema as they go and the DBAs are sort
of saying well we really can't do that
it's usually not quite as polite as that
but if you're going to go do it
basically think of schema reservation
and database renovation is kind of like
building renovations so basically when
you do it make sure you get lots of
extra space
make sure you add slots to all the
tables and don't go for a little bit go
for a lot because that allows you to
actually add things without having to
read build redo the database today
in-memory databases weather no SQL or
just our relational and ODBC give you
really simple ways to do things and of
course continuous inspection turn
everything into arrests and atom feeds
even from things like wire front
Wireshark and so on you can get lots of
debugging the problem is that most of my
clients they've tried all this and the
problem is when you do agile or lean or
oo they try and do it for everybody in
practice you know you can't fix all the
large organization or large code base so
most of them after trying all this come
back and say well everyone feels better
but our productivity still sucks and we
have to make changes so what I want to
talk about are some examples of what I
would really call lean driven changes
where we basically look at the legacy
system we look at the business and we
say okay where can we insert where if we
apply some new ideas where if we
innovate can we make a big difference in
the corporate value chain because
there's no way we can systemic lis
change a large legacy code base so we
really have to I have clients basically
if you can take their legacy code
and put dynamite in it and break it up
into five parts they'd be happy to pay
you five million dollars right they'd
just be happy could I have this one big
ugly mess split into three to five with
some interfaces between them that's
worth a fortune to them this is a really
hard problem so I'll just go through
some case studies fairly quickly and
they're not in any particular order I
apologize I camp with the names of the
companies here most the companies would
be happy to talk about how wonderful the
result is some of them won't even want
to talk about that but none of them
really want to talk about what a big
mess they were in before hands this is
an insurance company happens to be
located somewhere in the middle of
America and they've just done their
second implementation of a completely
new commercial insurance system and they
deployed that to the agents in the field
the insurance agents because they sell
through agents and the agents after two
weeks said please turn it off as it was
so bad and that was another two hundred
million dollars to one of those large
successful CSC IBM Accenture it doesn't
matter you just sort of rotate them
around right they rob you and leave you
with crap right
the basic problem so of course they got
a new CEO who said agile is the answer
right and since I'm large and they had a
large problem they phoned me and said
you know okay could you come and work on
this and we went in and said sure no
problem and they said to us what we're
gonna do is give you the it also this is
the sort of problem they got you know
there's more than that but for legacy
systems they've got you know two or
three they got four or five enterprise
you know si P you know custom rating
commercial rating engines their own
rating engines all these big pieces of
stuff their own kind of systems for each
system and of course they were you know
IBM or another large successful company
just sold them this big object data
so they could store all you know all the
insurance records could sleep in there
at night but of course it was object
persistence and you all know that
basically you persist objects you get a
big pain of performance right that's why
you use hibernate because you want to
slow things down right so basically they
came out and they said okay well we've
got is you know our vendor has
recommended an enterprise service bus
that's always a solution
you know you needs an ESB and we've been
trained by the vendor good
probably certified content free yeah
what do we do well I said could we have
a small team of Java programmers because
they selected Java as their weapon of
choice and we said we'd like a team of
experienced Java programmers and we're
gonna send them to the object mentor you
know TDD course for Java Wizards and get
them up to speed so we can start
building interfaces along the enterprise
service bus and being a big successful
company what they did is they said call
the resource department there's one of
those really brain-dead things that come
from McKinsey right you put all the
resource management here and you say I'd
like 12 green ones and four blue ones
greens or Java's right and what they do
is they go out on the street to some IT
recruiter you know who basically
previously was a pimp and now he sells
IT graduates
and basically they find everyone's blue
yeah all those thought and had people
but they spray them green and sent him
to us
literally their experience grab at Java
people the most experienced person we
had in the TDD course had two weeks of
Java programming and this was going to
be able to they just blown 200 million
on this previous system right so you
understand why they blow us money and
why can't I get the two hundred million
so the problem is we said this is it
we're done right it's very important to
know when to fire customer customers
like that you want to lose quickly and
just as I was leaving Jeff and Ken know
we're part of our team we're up working
with the BAS this is no Dave Dave Dave
don't go don't go we got we don't they
said you got to come upstairs and see
the BAS they're just amazing and haven't
abused as a fairly stable population in
this particular town and they had
amazing bas which is often the case bas
are one of the biggest underused
resources and something agile needs to
learn about and what they did is they
they basically had all the insurance for
it because they're sitting there making
requirements right while other people
are building the systems over five years
and not deploying them they all the
requirements are all the insurance that
the company did vehicle home commercial
personal all done in spreadsheets now
the spreadsheets start on that wall they
would continue you know down to a train
station but they had everything
organized and disciplines so what we did
is we cut the spreadsheets up modernize
them taught them how to modernize the
spreadsheets which is much easier than
teaching the Java programs how to write
objects and we were able to take a
couple of experts and auto-generate the
system from the spreadsheets and then we
used a few good Java guys to actually
build the interface the ESB as a result
everything the other thing is the other
lesson in this one is how do you deal
with existing sis and si P's the world
and so on who really don't want to do
things in an agile way the answer is you
can't
you can't pass agile across a contract
boundary
you can't reach into somebody else's
process but what you can do is write
into the contract that they have to run
the automatic acceptance tests and have
to give you the automatic acceptance
test before you'll even consider cutting
them a check for payment on delivery and
we spent probably the most significant
thing we did in this customers teach the
legal department how to change the word
acceptance test to automated and so
that's one way that you can enforce the
process and that's how for example large
companies like IBM or Motorola or who
takes offerman from many many suppliers
they basically make you a Class A
supplier if you'll provide everything
with automatic acceptance tests and you
either wait for us to test the thing
manually much take us a year or you can
give us automatic acceptance tests and
if we review the test we'll cut you the
check
at the end of the month of delivery so
that's a very significant vehicle for
large legacy solutions vignettes in this
next system is a in the United States if
you work for a large company they give
you a little card that says large
company loves you you know if you need
any help with your healthcare your
benefits you just call this number and
when you call that number a person
answers and says large company but they
actually work for a company called
Hewitt that's based in Chicago and they
handle everyone's benefits for most
large companies many in the world and
the problem is that benefit calculations
get very very complicated and when you
have unions involved you negotiate these
deals late at night and the benefits
analysts fill everything into Excel
spreadsheets in calc
what's an impact gonna be if we
basically give them a raise here and
more holidays and so on and you get
really crazy things in the United States
for example you know the first day of
the first day of hunting season in
Colorado everyone gets off right and
there's thousands of crazy rules like
this so the problem that they had a
Hewitt was how can we reduce the the
cycle time for getting these done
because basically what we have is we
have all these things specified again in
spreadsheets but we have to convert them
to COBOL it runs on a mainframe so in
those days
you know I along with several others was
pimping small talk as being the miracle
of the day an agile development of
course comes from small talk right we
all know what XP is that's you know an
XP mentors unemployed small talk
programmer read the books get back Ward
Cunningham and so the trick here was
great so we put IBM small talk in the
mainframe it's really fast you can
develop really quickly deploy instantly
to the server all those things you'd
like to have today and we teach all
those COBOL programmers the enlightened
things of small talk which is really
easy to refactor compared to other
languages and we got 15% improvement so
what problem is we couldn't meet the
cycle time and at that point can't
actually worked in this project
and his credit they realized that once
again the actual domain knowledge for
the problem was well-structured
so what they did is wrote a rule checker
for the spreadsheets because
spreadsheets are always wrong contain a
lot of bugs but they had the essence
there and then they wrote a spreadsheet
interpreter in small talk which today
has been rewritten in Java because
that's you know slower and bigger and
you know that runs in the mainframe so
the nice thing there is it took a
hundred COBOL programmers dropped it to
four developers and those hundred COBOL
programmers who have happened to be very
good by the way it wasn't the case that
this COBOL programmers couldn't learn
small talk right it was really the case
that you wanted to go much much faster
and do that you have to change the value
chain not just the tools and the
practices and that's the big mistake I
see with a lot of people late switch
languages and switch practices but they
don't really make a big difference
here's a job that no one would want to
do a really dirty job a large assembler
program on which a lot of people rely it
might even because it's almost a no
sequel database or an XML database but
it's in an assembler language that not a
whole lot of people know
and your challenge you've just been
employed is we need to get this ported
to a new platform which is much like the
old platform but it has a few extra
instructions in it
to really help accelerate things and I
won't name who it is but lots of people
have this opportunity in front of them
and I can just see all the enthusiastic
young people I want to work on this
right well it's happened that somewhere
along the way they picked a student
really fresh out of school and put him
on this project and everyone was
terrified and it was impossible because
the assembler code the other problem
with is that somewhere along the time
you have to do everything manually
assembler so somewhere along the way
when you push the stack frames down
somebody forgot to pop the right number
of arguments off so every once awhile
you'd actually be running in somebody
else's stack and so what they've done is
they they'd fix this right because they
had a new new practice what they did is
they put mark words on the stack so
you'd look when you popped up to where
your end of your stack was so you could
fix it and then you would fix your stack
and do it there are lots of crew LAN and
natural acts like this and large legacy
system but somehow he'd had this strange
professor in uni that sort of that's
Australian for university and who taught
them this weird language called Prolog
so since nobody else had any ideas what
he has converted all the assembler pro
the assembler to Prolog rules and what
he was able to do is reason over the
program what registers are being used so
basically do data flow and control flow
analysis by just asking questions to
prologue which Prolog is absolutely
fantastic for doing in fact data log is
used for that today and as a result they
were to figure out where the problems
were and where to actually make the
changes in the code now you think if you
do this that you don't become very
important to somebody in the company as
opposed to working on the agile team
where everybody's plotting along you
know let's do D D D for assembler
oh boy do something different make a
difference since our next speaker Helmut
lives in this area I won't dwell long in
this example but it's not from his
company because of course Siemens is
much more progressive than that he'll
tell us friends but the classic classic
thing that happens in process control is
there's all this custom equipment and
the process control community are really
really friendly there they really
embrace open systems they even change
the bus specs so they can patent it so
nobody else can put boards into their
system or extend them right so it turns
out this is really really hard and
there's hundreds of millions of dollars
of this gear installed now the problem
is of course in the early days these
systems were really good and everyone
just plugged them so with a patch panel
or ladder logic or whatever it is but
over time these things need to be kind
of enabled with a modern GUI not that
the modern GUI always helps but you have
to have one because that's marketing
right and so the problem here is how do
we do this now they had several sort of
second system effects right you know the
project 2000 which is rewrite everything
and will do everything and of course
they fail and then they start with
project 2010 and that fails and so so
the solution here is basically replace
the protocols with a standard bus
they'll put a card one card into all the
systems that speaks tcp/ip implement
HTTP and atom and that exposes all the
data over there without any api's you
want a really simple way to integrate
two systems and I think I have another
one for the MBS ollie all the IBM
systems and so on MQ that they all
output atom feeds today many people
don't know that but you don't even need
to use the api's you know to actually
get data and so on almost all these
systems are log files and so on there's
an option to get them in atom format so
this means you can take your favorite
Webster and they can write a dart
program that's really cool and has all
this animation that can show all the
process control stuff so you've got even
the old stuff made one small change
insert TCP use a standard protocol and
this trick works over and again this is
done all of these things are typically
done in a period of do a prototype that
involves about a month implemented
production system involves about three
or four months and may save the company
literally millions and millions of
dollars and allows you to deploy an old
product basically spruce it up and bring
in revenue
if you don't think people listen to you
when you do a few of these things you
just are missing the point in the end
it's about solving a problem for the
business and almost all these things if
you shouldn't show in by solving a
critical problem in the business they
let you use any technology you want I've
been using wacko languages and tools all
my life but the only reason is because
in the end we get it done and we pick a
high-value problem this is a telecom
example I don't know whether most you
know most people in telecom industry
make money from their installed switches
they're sort of the mainframe of the
telecom business and of course they all
have project 2000 and 2010 where they
rewrite with new hardware and software
this amazing thing and it dies you know
because that's the great rewrite which
fails so the companies basically like
this one had three Greenfield attempts
but the people love the hardware it just
has you know what lousy functionality
voice over IP doesn't work you know it
doesn't have SSL you know all sorts of
things that means that backward switch
and these switches happen to be all over
Europe and Russia and asia-pacific some
in America but it's a European company
again the solution is pretty simple go
to standard components basically take
the old cards and make new cards so you
can take the old processors and just run
them in a VM e card rack this is a
standard hardware bus for industrial put
it put a new co processor in so you put
in it's got to be an arm right because
everyone wants to work in an arm you
pick something that all the new guys
want to work on so you got you know you
got dad there you know and his son or
better is
grandson because grandson be a lot more
flexible and they can pair by having the
old hardware intimate with the new
hardware in the same rack with a memory
map interface so you can get data really
fast now you can add all sorts of really
cool functionality the existing thing
and you can just take it back to
existing customers because there's a
straightforward upgrade take out this
box put in this box send us more money
sign up for five years simple trick very
little vault now one of the other issues
is the build chain in these companies is
pretty horrific as most and whether you
know most telecom companies in the 60s
and early 70s built their own hardware
their own operating system their own
programming languages boy one of those
great days it's that we had a legacy
from it and so the challenge is if you
want to modernize those systems or bring
those people into sort of agile
practices what you have to do first of
all is put in big CI servers and it's
pretty common to go and Mada modify I'm
the godfather of the world's worst ID
though than all the other ones eclipse
and you can modify that with a lot of
work you know so for about a million
dollars you can customize it for a large
organization it doesn't make sense if
you got 20 developers but if you've got
a thousand developers located globally
using very specific tools and helmet
might comment on that as well then you
can do this so pretty commonly for this
and so you write and you write a unit of
X unit so you can test whatever it is
you know SDL or Protel or you know pick
your favorite old programming language
or mall and then all these people can
because the nice thing now is that
people are working in their older
languages but they can be part of the
same tool chain they have continuous
builds and so on and this really brings
a lot of excitement and it means you can
bring young developers in because you
say okay is this language isn't too bad
right it almost looks like Pascal right
and you can do that the other thing is
you can train people who aren't
programmers who bought ungentle are
better programmers anyway so you can get
engineers and other people that don't
whine and come
I always want to use the new languages
this is a banking application there's an
old operating system called HP MP II I
think it is
lots of people use at HP 9 thousands
very successful computer system replaced
by many people by hp-ux and a new kind
of hardware well some years ago HP said
that we HP seems to be making various
announcements that that they're going
out of business in several different
ways but about five years ago they
announced that they weren't going to
support this platform anymore so they
now it's what's called end-of-life an
end-of-life for a platform is something
you know it's basically a guaranteed way
to irritate every single customer you've
ever had and upset people and breach
break trust and everything like that is
something you should almost never do and
so I was colleague of mine was doing
work in this large bank and other
applications are in HP COBOL and so
therefore they had a proposal what we're
gonna do is we're gonna rewrite all
these applications in job or a c-sharp
the Microsoft folks the Sun folks both
had their own proposal and that was
gonna be you know I think it was the
bill was 70 million or something like
that and no one knew you know how are
they gonna work again plus we don't have
any c-sharp or Java skills well we
didn't train you this went to the board
and the board someone on the board says
you know this seems to be seem fairly
risky to me plus after we spend in sort
of order 100 million all we got is the
same old crap running in a new language
maybe with bugs so again we didn't do
the work we just basically guided the
process what we did is we found an ISV
that basically had something that ran on
standard Intel hardware which ran the
API so if you think of a net appliance
just think of this as kind of an HP
appliance all the API is run but it acts
runs on top of Linux running on Intel
hardware we used instruction trick they
used instruction traces from all the
executions so that they could verify
that all the execution of the
applications produced the same same set
of API traces in both platforms so that
was how you did acceptance testing at
the platform level and then had a
separate si migrated the banking apps
and again use acceptance tests and
traces to go through and make sure that
all those apps work the same and then
they switch the ID and they got this
really exciting IDE doesn't that look
cool this is Michael focus COBOL but
your COBOL developer is really cool
because you can do run applications on
your workstation you can use the PC you
have to be logged in to a green screen
so it's really you know jumping ahead
you know 10 to 20 years for some COBOL
developers and I know I didn't think it
would turn you but look at the numbers
25% of the estimated cost sorry 10 to
25% of the cost and the time was 25% you
think they're not happy and it works a
rewrite almost always will never works
this is a kind of double legacy problem
it's a product company that does used to
be called MRP and became ERP and now
it's probably got some new name that I
don't know but basically keeps track of
manufacturing assets and does planning
and so on and they build a really good
product for a very specific kind of
industry where they've got lots and lots
of customers who are very happy the
problem is they built it on top maybe a
legacy database vendor so this is the
case where you've got to sort of rotting
smelly pieces right the database at the
bottom which is you know could go away
any time because the vendors flaky
because people are you know switching
off of this and I won't name it because
it's still a cracked up there and then
you've got this product on top so the
first problem the customers and the so
the problem is you can think of a long
term solution but when you meet a
customer like this or a business like
this the FIR
thing they need to do is try and get
something to their customers so the
customers just don't they don't lose
their customer base because you can have
a long-term strategy for how to do this
but if it's gonna take very long the
customers could be gone
and they'd already had to great rewrites
this is sort of the standard story they
don't call us until they've already
tried everything else and spending a lot
way more money with them and they ever
do with us which is really irritating
but so their situation is we're really
really in deep yoghurt right we really
have to we're up to here we've got to
say something to our customers over this
are gonna push us all the way down in
the yoghurt so the biggest complaint
from the customers is they couldn't
actually do more flexible reporting and
again these tricks work over and over
again so the first thing we did is have
the product team implement an ODBC
interface to their existing product as
well as the the vendor didn't have an
ODBC - interface and we use this trick
many times to take something that does
not look like a database at all it can
be an old application but just put an
OTB an interface in front of it and
there's this company that produces
there's three or four companies that
produce proven tested ODBC stacks and
what you do is you make their product
look like a server that can basically
take SQL select and project what this
meant in in just a few months they
rolled announced this product have it
working with Crystal Reports and you
know various other you know reporting
tools and basically sell the customers
an upgrade in cash in the bank so now
the management says hey we should you
know have you got any more tricks in the
bag we like that and the next trick is a
lot scarier because basically the
customers and the company are locked to
the physical data assets so this is
what's known in the agile world as
database refactoring of course any
serious refactoring is not equivalent is
preserving I know very few people who
refactor the code to make it look better
you know
other than the people write books right
because beautiful codes important
because it says examples I'm not digging
though but you know people who've got
huge code bases typically don't have the
time or unable to I don't have the tools
or whatever to refactor them data is
even harder and the other problem is of
course that they really would needed to
change the schema because a schema had
been sitting there for years rotting
they've done everything else jam it up
in slots you know turn little blobs in
the fields you know put bits into extra
slots I mean really cruel and unnatural
stuff right we all do it I mean yeah we
got to get this shipped how can we do it
without breaking everything so you have
some really clever way that you you play
please God don't let me see don't let me
see this right so the solution in a
previous life I did bulk high
performance database conversion and
database restructuring is essentially
database conversion so it's a very
simple set of algorithms and so the
solution was to hire a very talented si
and basically say here's the algorithms
for how you do this what you need to do
is take the pages off the disk and put
them onto another disk over here in the
physical format of Oracle or my sequel
or whatever your favorite databases the
nice thing about this out these
algorithms is they actually run at disk
speed so they run a block transfer so
you can basically refactor add change
and transform a database very very fast
that doesn't mean it's simple because if
you got to move a petabyte a day that
can still take you a while but most
companies have typically their databases
are you know best terabytes long and you
can do those really really quickly
pinnacle Eve you got a large machine
with memory and so on the other problem
is okay good we've got the database now
in the new world how do we do how do we
know it worked and of course we could
write a lot of tests right because
that's the way you do it in the agile
world right some tests but it's really
hard to test some of these programs
so we used a very old technique which
was to hire somebody else and pay them
both you get paid bonuses if you find
bugs that they didn't find and you you
basically get penalized you know if they
find bugs and you didn't have that you
have in your code and so they wrote a
completely independent test which they
are will to generate and then we could
compare the results from both of those
and this is a proven technique for doing
testing which is from my point of view
for large conversions live migrations a
lot of data work better than trying to
use classic kind of TDD acceptance
testing sort of techniques so the last
kind of example here is what I call real
models to code I mean they're you know
we all know there's this MDC and you
know what is MDA and all that oMG
garbage this is real model so not UML
models right there's lots of people
who've done this these are just a few
examples what you do is you have a model
that you understand and then I'll be
talking a little bit more about this
sort of approach tomorrow but what you
do is you encode that model in some DSL
or some very high-level language that's
small and compact and then what you do
is you generate you know some you know
accept a little code because you
wouldn't be allowed to use Haskell I
mean what are you doing using Haskell I
mean that's like you know putting porn
on your screen you know what is that
stuff you know all those characters
stuck together right however it's a very
good way for bright people to basically
get small examples and we've used it for
instance small talk years ago for
tailing analog chip design because
typically analog chips and finite
elements are big Fortran programs and
they have to do integration and the big
secret there is that often there's
nonlinear regions and you have to make
the step size for the integrator is very
very small at that point but if you run
the step size constantly it very small
the finite element analysis or the
circuit simulation never finishes so
what you actually do is create custom
Fortran code or C++ code from the model
and since the model is fairly easy to
prove
rekt and write test for that it's very
is very straightforward to get the test
this is done in the financial markets
using Haskell and scheme Haskell can
never go fast that's a challenge for all
the language guys out there but you know
some of the best you know programs for
Drude and then swaps are written in
Haskell and then they generate big ugly
C++ programs again it's very
maintainable and you can do that in fact
a colleague of mine his body graduated
from MIT where he programmed in scheme
which is a wonderful language which is
completely unacceptable in most
businesses and he went to Wall Street
because they pay a lot of money and
started programming in scheme and they
just look son we don't do that here you
know real man program in C++ so what he
did is he wrote himself a scheme
interpreter in C++ and stuck it at the
top of his program as a library and then
he just typed the stuff in and they came
by and said wow how you getting these
done so quickly oh I've got this
data-driven system I just type in these
sort of rules and then they execute and
they said wow we should use that in more
places so there's a large financial
institution that's actually running a
lot of scheme code but doesn't know it
and language like F sharp and so on so
again the point is there are just tons
and tons of opportunity if you think out
of the box if you figure out what's the
most important thing that I could do for
the business at this point what would
help the business get to more revenue
service the needs of a customer what
would let us enter another market how
could we solve a problem that's
important to the business you know
forget looking for someone to give you a
little stories cut up like worms so you
can feed them to the agile elves that
are you know sitting there eating away
think of what the big problem what is
the big problem that's blocking us think
lean look at the value chain if we could
shorten the time to do this or the cost
of doing this what would make a big
difference to our business that's the
one to attack attack it first through a
prototype and then go say look oK we've
demonstrated this and be careful because
a lot of these things use use lots of
data so don't assume that because you've
done something fun with hibernate that
when you actually put Big Data through
it it's not going to suck because it
will suck so what you have to do is
basically do the small prototype then
validate with Big Data then open your
mouth and then you go and get the
commitments say look in three months we
can have this done and if you do we want
a big bonus and if not you can shoot us
all well the choice is you can stay
working on that legacy system right so
you got to move on anyway so who cares
if you die lots of things you can use
lots of cool languages for doing this as
I said I've been able to use any
language I want as long as I got the job
done and I could demonstrate the value
of the business so innovation in a
legacy innovation in a large corporation
is about first of all figuring out how
you can maximize the value to the
corporation and to their customers and
then secondly demonstrating very quickly
you can do it and usually you have to do
this on your own time while doing your
day job right so you know you don't go
and say gee I'd like permission to use
Scalla
for three months to learn it wrong so
what you really want to do is basically
meet the need by doing that all sorts of
examples you can do this
and with the hardware around today lots
and lots of opportunity so I'll finish
now maybe have time for one one question
before Helmut comes on he can set up
while I'm talking and basically the key
point is think about value chain think
lean forget trying to transform your
organization you'll never get it done
and it won't be will be more than 10 or
15 percent across the large organization
which doesn't matter executives are fed
up with agile because it doesn't make a
difference it doesn't give them agility
it doesn't give them a big bang for the
buck what they want
Arleen solutions where you bake is you
send an attack team and you blow up
something it's important that's
challenging it's demanding but it has a
big impact and you can use lots and lots
of technologies but you have to be able
to promise to deliver and you have to be
able to test and verify that works and
you need to be able to not afraid of
using big data so you can't just do a
prototype you need to run it anyway I
hope that's been a little bit
encouraging for those of you that some
of you that I know are stuck in big Corp
I've made a lot of money and had a very
good life doing all sorts of interesting
things
mostly funded by dirty jobs and always
had great experiences and great people
and you know trust me once you do one or
two of these things you get a reputation
you can go work anywhere because people
understand that you deliver value so
it's a great opportunity to
differentiate yourself as an individual
because all the smart people want to go
program in dart right you know who wants
to compete against all those smart
people when they can starve trying to
program in Dart and you can make a whole
lot of money doing closure or something
even better you know you know in a
legacy thanks very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
