three co-founders of motive gnosis okay
we are using medical devices now we are
using gaming devices for medicine so in
my PhD I started using Microsoft Kinect
which is like a camera a fancy 3d camera
that provides these 3d images and I just
try to use it for gait analysis so how
are people walking can we use it and
three years ago we took this idea and
made a small startup company and we are
doing medical studies with these devices
since and I'm mostly a software
developer but I also do lots of medical
data science and statistics and signal
processing and in my spare time I'm
doing this for my PhD in medical
computers or medical science I'm one of
before I was a PhD student a child Hey I
had a guest research researcher account
and we do a lot of studies with multiple
sclerosis patients and Parkinson
patients and these are new new a
generative disease and these people show
a lot of motor symptoms so like tremors
like imbalance they fall a lot and well
basically I used the Kinect to somehow
detect these signs and try to help to
use the doctors these kind of technology
so from my point of view
IOT and the connected world is rather
about Eider and in medicine we have a
lot of these small ecosystems and with
the possibility of new technology and
the connections of these new
technologies we can do a lot
but to give you an understanding of this
impact I will give you a really small
introduction to a lot of medical
projects these things are currently
happening these things are some research
but this is like real it's not effective
it's it's happening now a lot of these a
lot of these projects are not my own but
I find them quite interesting and also
some of them are a bit creepy so just be
prepared new technology and also new
developments affect us in medicine in
different ways like we have these better
effectors right now like implants like
new Diagnostics like all the things
that's directly in our body are attached
to our body but there is even more like
in hospitals you have this huge IT which
which may basically make the hospital
run so without any technological
developments and an IT in medicine we
wouldn't be at this point right now and
this it's a huge influence but let's
start with some some basics like one of
the most common implants are cochlear
implants so if a baby is born beef and
cannot hear anything it and it would be
benefit from this kind of implant it is
like an advanced hearing aid so you have
this out part which is basically be
hearing it basically like a microphone
and you have this implant part where
this little device is put between the
skull and the skin so it's it's under
the skin and connected to these micro
microphone part and then a small wire
gets into the cochlea and from from
these so the the signal the noise are
transmitted into the
in a part of the year and then
everything goes normal it's just like
benefit if some some in the middle from
the outer ear to the inner ear is kind
of crushed or not working properly so
this is rather easy if we want to look
at the eye it's a bit more complex in
the late 70s there were the first trials
to bring back a vision to blind people
here they had to go the right way the
direct ray into the visual cortex so you
see here there are electrodes going
directly into the brain and this was in
the early 70s so they had these five
kilogram computers and a huge pair of
electrodes and the results back then was
that these people at least could
differentiate between black and white
and some strong contrasts there is still
some development in this field but it's
they they currently focus on not that
impact surgery and more like visual aids
who analyze this the scene that a person
is looking at and then gives some audio
feedback to them but I can also be used
for other things like Diagnostics so
Google and of artists are currently
developing smart contact lens that is
measuring the blood blood sugar or
glucose level for diabetics so these
small components could give the diabetic
person like an alarm if his blood sugar
level drops too low because the these
people tend to fall into a coma and they
don't recognize it by anybody symptoms
though this would be quite interesting
to get a bit more complex
I've mentioned I work a lot with
Parkinson patients so Parkinson patients
you see the this patient has a really
large tremor and in the 90s there is
this thing called deep brain stimulation
it is an implant similar to a pacemaker
if this is not properly working or is
off then the symptoms is like this if
it's on it's like this so how this works
is they're putting electrodes deep into
the brain and these attic shifts
stimulate a specific cell type which
then produces the missing hormones of
for these patients it's really similar
to a pacemaker and these electrodes are
connected to these wires and then you
have also similar to a pacemaker these
control units and the patient when the
doctor had the little remote control so
they can switch between different
programs and put the use electrodes on
and off but there are other things like
brain brain human interactive brain
computer interaction is a real
interesting thing right now in medical
research as you can see here the patient
is really specific so she can't move at
all and she had this kind of implant
right over her motor cortex so what
she's now doing is she thinks about
moving her hand and the robotic hand
responds so she is now capable to
control a robot hand so that she could
drink something and this is currently
more in research it's published in
Nature but there is some really great
developments on that but to go a bit
more into the things that maybe affect
you more there are technology like
virtual realities
and I just want to show you how virtual
reality devices are used for therapy
there's this project called work again
the idea was that paraplegic people who
people who could not walk anymore who
are wheelchair-bound use these brain
computer interface to to control an
exoskeleton and learn to walk again
these people had a really tough and
widespread training session and training
plan with the exoskeleton and also with
virtual reality devices and they just
showed these persons that how it would
look like to walk again
and they just should imagine to walk
again and what happened was really
really unexpected because in short
people started to feel their legs again
to feel touches at their legs again and
some of these people or she also started
to move their legs again so there was
this real interesting huge recovery that
no one expected before and there are
different theories how this happened
one is that due to the combined stimuli
from virtual reality and from these
training some parts of the brain
recovered and also some remaining nerves
in the spine got reactivated and helped
to to make the missing connections to
from the legs to the brain and vice
versa but there are also other really
really interesting virtual reality
approach for the European
Sampson be fearless is an interesting
program where they tackle anxiety and
phobias with virtual reality this is
interesting because with virtual reality
scenes you have these really controlled
and and safe environments for people so
you don't have to
any physical thing there to tackle your
fear of heights or your anxiety of
speaking in front of people you have
this controlled environment which is
working rather well so far and also
there is some things of paying therapy
so some specific types of pain do not
respond to normal painkillers so these
patients are in constant pain and
nothing really helps so there was a
study who just showed these patients
happy virtual reality scenes and this is
an fMRI scan which shows brain activity
so all these yellow areas you see is the
patient is in pain he suffers and when
these virtual reality things are seen is
put on then endorphines
get invoked by the patient themselves
and this reduces in pain so maybe you
know if you're happy you don't feel that
much pain and this is what virtual
reality and this study used to lower the
pain for these patients they are also
not only not only therapy but also
diagnostics advantage and here I'm
talking a bit about my research and what
we are doing we use their connect the
connectors are written a gaming device
for the Xbox and amidst these at least
three dimensional point cloud what we
did is in one of our studies just put it
in a sleep laboratory above of a patient
and our question was can we detect
breathing signals can we detect abnormal
'its and it's really not healthy at all
and typically this is done by putting a
lot of cables and sensors
head to the person that's really
uncomfortable you have to go to this
live laboratory and what you are seeing
right on the right is that we get some
decent just breathing patterns and also
detected these mentioned of knowing so
the technology itself
could be used for for like home
monitoring of up knowing patients but
the real benefit of the Kinect is that
it provides like these three images it
recognizes a person and also it's put
these anatomic landmarks so like the
skeleton you see on the right and you
can use this for tracking the patient's
for different movement tasks so for
example Pakistan and MS patients if they
go to the doctor they have to perform
specific tasks so the doctor sees how
much is he or she's swaying is she
falling has she is some some spastics
and some legs and one of our approach is
to just record these motions and then
calculate specific parameters that can
then be interpreted because currently it
is the doctor is looking at this patient
and just days okay he's writing between
zero and one and he just had a scale
from zero to three and this is extremely
subjective it is not really reproducible
because it's highly influenced on the
doctor but also in which state the
patient currently is so we are exploring
these a bit more and but it could be
they could be done extremely more with
just these movement analysis for example
there was this publication and they just
had a look at the behavior of children
and wanted to have a look if they could
detect autism in children because these
people also
some specific movement problems and but
also they try to behave different in a
room full of playthings and toys and
they published these with some some
extent of success so this was a lot of
medicine a lot of different project just
in short in general
currently the approach in medicine is
that it's getting more patient-centered
so typically it is the patient comes
once or twice a year to the doctor the
doctor really relies on what the patient
is telling him it is for most of the
patients quite tricky how often did you
fall when is it better or worse in the
morning your symptoms how was it last
week how was it two months ago it is
often not that easy for the patients but
also for the doctors so in research they
try to explore the use of wearable
sensors or motion trackers like fitness
trackers just to add more knowledge
about the patient but also on the
disease and changes in this in their
behavior could be used for medication
adjustment and so on and so on these the
data of one patient of one of our
studies so in example on what the doctor
would get from these devices and it's
quite interesting but also highly
private ATAR
because as you see here the patient
tends to take a nap on the weekend for
one an hour so is it something that you
would tell your doctor is something that
you think is important just think about
this and the developments are getting
even further they are well built they
were developed that can monitor your
eating drinking and even social behavior
this is
really interesting because it could be
used to detect things like depression or
anxiety or changes in like your motor
symptoms but it's highly private writer
we we we have to make a cut between okay
we have this really private data and
currently it's used only for research
and before every medical study there's
this ethic community that have to decide
if this is okay to do for the doctors
and for the patients but there's also a
lot of interest in the industry to do
medical things one of the biggest
players Apple he it has his research kit
where researchers can use an iPhone or
Apple device just to collect all the
data and put it in this research kit for
their own study so for the research
studies but for example Fitbit fitness
is a typical fitness tracker but it
advanced or it tries to advance into
medical in health care but also like
diagnostic proposes so it's basically
one to use all your data for medicine
another interesting fact is that a lot
of tech companies cooperate with pharma
companies so for example Pfizer and IBM
using IBM Watson for a drug discovery
and is quite successful with that I
already showed you Novartis and Google
with their smart contact lens there was
also another yeah project from Microsoft
and Novartis who are you were using the
Kinect also for medical scaling so what
the doctor did before just by looking at
the patient
this system could do by themselves in a
meta learning approach unfortunately
Microsoft just killed the Kinect it was
one of the most promising devices for
healthcare but it didn't perform in its
primary market which is kind of interest
an interesting decision it we think or
most of the people think that they just
focus on the hololens the development of
the whole lens but nonetheless really
promising devised for medical research
for other research for medical use it's
just died but there are more promising
promising news as well who of you have
seen Star Trek at least something yeah
they have these medical tricorder
just make a scan and the doctor sees
everybody is every health condition that
a patient has and there was a huge huge
thing by Qualcomm who were who was
looking for the startups or the
solutions that at most near to these
medical tricorders and mid of this year
we have two winners so there are these
male prototypes who can measure more
than 13 different medical conditions and
there are no working on to use this or
and make a real product of it so we'll
see when we have the first tricorder
that can measure nearly anything without
touching everything another thing that
is just really big currently in in
healthcare startups are chat BOTS that
uses here our response and try to make
medical decisions to help you but also
to help the doctor and ADA health and
babble in health are just received 46
and 60 million just to do more of their
development
so this is kind of huge and kind of
interesting because it really shows how
startups are pushed to do a medical
revolution and some kind and another
really well-known startup is 23andme
this gives gene sequencing so you just
have to take a sample of your salvia and
then send it in and they make a complete
gene sequencing and if you want you can
get information about health risks and
delete that maybe tackle you there is
yeah this brave new world so technology
influences us in medicine to an extreme
demand from the industry from a startup
point of view and also in medical
research but we face some challenges
with it and I want to speak about that a
bit I've shown you the possibilities of
virtual reality before and there was
this really great talk from me earlier
that I really recommend you if you're
doing something with virtual reality
because she explained how to develop
applications so your customers don't get
anxiety attacks don't get panic attacks
don't get motion sick it's really
important that you know how to develop
applications for this because it is so
emerged to the person that all the
benefits I've shown you can be complete
reverse and can used for for the
negative like triggering anxiety attacks
like triggering dizziness and really
medical problems if you don't do what
you're doing right and how is it
currently in hospitals
so I mentioned briefly at the start of
this talk the company runs on really
different sufferers so one of the
backbones of each Hospital is like the
hospital information system this is like
the nervous system of this rule
institution everything is connected to
this and everything is attached and
everything has to be responsive to this
system and the current development
standards on this maybe you have a guess
like these is they're agile development
in health systems nope
so these systems are built over a couple
of years by waterfall system they have a
lot of legacy code it is it they are old
language no also the developers tend to
be older I know of companies who are
developing these systems where they
everywhere their average developer age
is about 50 which is huge so immense
also unit testing integration testing
well they have a QA team but real unit
testing is mostly not done it is quite
interesting that these huge system don't
fail more often and if they do it makes
quite around last year in last year in
Australia there was a huge hospital who
was often shut down for several hours
because their system didn't work they
just deployed a new version of their
have a hospital information system and
it had so many bugs in it that it didn't
run properly and they have to switch
back to writing everything down and
is that really sucks also what do you
think about current security standards
in these systems and everything it's not
just the hospital system also the the
pacemakers the deep brain stimulation
last year the FDA just recalled
half-a-million pacemakers because a heck
hacking team just announced that they
could simply switch to these pacemakers
off and the people were quite scared the
interesting thing is the FDA didn't
recall them because of these failures
they they recalled them because the
people were afraid so these symptoms
these systems most often are just safe
and secure because you have to be
physical near them and it's quite a
niche so it's not that interesting for
hackers so far to heck these devices but
just imagine if a Perkins impatient is a
victim of one of these attacks and he is
driving a pacemaker
most of the receivers of the pacemaker
will still live first for some degree
because it's not they are not that
dependent but if you start having these
tremors and you're just driving a car
it's not that good another market is the
mobile health mother so there are over
300,000 medical device medical apps or
health apps a good amount of them are
free and most of them don't have an FDA
approval or a medical certifications so
they just claim by themselves they help
you with your drug management or with
tracking some of your symptoms or
like a patient diary and they didn't get
approved at all for these these things
because they are not directly medicine
and there were quite a huge number of
studies who just had to look at the
privacy policy and also on the direct
security of these apps and it was quite
often shown that most of the free apps
just sell your data to advertisement
companies to map companies and they also
gather more data that they should so we
heard the word that in spas on kite
already here in this track this morning
and most of the apps don't apply to that
so they gather a lot of data and it is
often quite unknown what they do with
this but they are also problem in the
science field so in some countries there
is this phenomena if you are a friend
about his meaning or his opinion about
something you get always a positive
feedback because people are afraid to
know this is just not a good idea you
should maybe do something else
is a bit called the publication bias and
this also applies to scientific papers
so most of the papers that are shown and
published our papers that shows some
promising results huge effects it's the
new big thing and unfortunately a lot of
papers who show the opposite or reject
some findings before before or just show
ok there is no correlation there is no
relation between something a and
something B this is not getting
published and this leads to the problem
that sometimes false information is
spread but also that sometimes more
studies have to be
formed then are originally necessary
another problem in research but also in
developments is if you so this this
study this little paper had a look at
different implementations of deep neural
networks I guess
nearly everyone heard about even area
networks so far it's like the new big
thing in image recognition and they just
show that most of the most of the
deployed networks are really available
if just one pixel or a few pixels are
changed the network didn't work at all
anymore
there are mechanisms to prevent that but
they were not implemented in these in
these models so now just imagine one of
these models are used for tumor
detection in MRI bill figures or one of
these is used for like medical scoring
or decision-making or it says okay you
have attic you have some visual
impairments it decides somehow that it's
not a migraine it's a tumor so what are
you doing now you as a person who get
this information is kind of confused
kind of irritated your doctor cannot
really cannot really relate to the
decision that was made he was not sure
and yeah what what consequences have
this for for us another really great
story a study is about a Samiha thing it
was honored by an Ig Nobel Prize an Ig
Nobel Prize the Nobel Prize for studies
and papers who first make you laugh and
then make you think so if you want to
read something really interesting just
go on the idea and see what was honored
with an Ig Nobel Prize and this study
just had a look at
what happens if you still skip a minor
statistics part in fMRI images and what
they found is if you skip this step you
find brain activity in dead fish so they
put these selim in an fMRI scanner and
perform their typical studies they just
want to have a ground truth if the
system is working and perform quite well
and then they just played around a bit
with some functions of the fMRI
technology and software and they just
they skipped these multi comparison step
and what happened is that they got false
negative results the problem is that
most of the published fMRI studies it
mentioned if they did this step or not
so every study that didn't clearly say
we have done this we have checked for
this may be a false positive result and
this impacts hundreds and nearly
thousands of papers since the release of
these MRI scanners so we have also
besides from the technologic besides
from PACs besides from Arabic besides
from we didn't know any better sorry we
as developers and also we as researchers
have an ethical and moral thing so so we
have to make a clear decision we have
responsibility we have to be aware that
if we do something in medicine or maybe
also in gaming we we have to make sure
that we don't harm people and also I
think most of you are well aware of
these data at the non-oil side by Clive
jambe the site contains more he also
explains why he think this is quite
fitting and I agree with him to some
some extent but I will also like to add
in in in medicine or everything when you
gather your data just make sure you
don't earn everything so thank you
questions you showed a number of health
apps available health apps in the
various app stores what do you think
about regulations versus availability
like this is a broad question yeah so we
have to see on so we have two different
differentiate between different types of
regulation I think it is quite tricky to
regulate all on everything that does not
work but if an app gathers data about a
patient or about user then I think this
should be regulated to some degree and
it shouldn't just be okay put it in your
private private policies and then
everything is fine but I think this is
currently in the current system not not
applicable so still things to do love to
do yeah there's a question here from
someone talking about or suggesting if
sleep monitoring application could
replace pressure pads for monitoring
sleeping children okay it depends on
what you want to look at I think this
pressure pet that you put under under
children when they are sleeping they
they detect not real symptoms but just
if the child is still moving so for an
alarming system these type of data
would be totally fine and I think to
some degree you would also be able to
get breathing patterns and and some
moving movement patterns I think it
would be sufficient enough you could use
also these 3d depths fader and and
detect more of it for example if you
have a child who have epilepsy these
pressure pod would mainly not be
sufficient to detect a seizure so an
another system would be quite
interesting but they are there it really
depends how much data you want together
and how much your approach is like a
video camera approach gathers always a
really lot of error and your film doing
your sleep so I would pre I would prefer
to use these only in research and
diagnostic approaches not in everyday
life you're a fan of Porton okay more
questions yeah excited we have we have
some we have some contact there
our impression was that the German
division wasn't we're aware at all of
these decision to kill the Kinect so if
they are from from Germany I think they
will not no more but until interests
really pushing in these 3d centers they
also have the first laptops who have
these sensors integrators so it is not a
problem for us or for my research but
everything that is just working like a
black box and I they have to throw away
their data and start from the beginning
because you have new
new input syn sorry but okay let's
figure out where Microsoft stands in
half an hour no hold on there's a new
question here Oh actually it's just a
repetition of someone resubmit it's the
question about regulations versions okay
missus ability so more questions in that
case it's Microsoft in half an hour
thanks a lot Karen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
