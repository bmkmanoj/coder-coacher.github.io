everyone and thank you for coming to my
talk on service architectures I know
that I'm the last man standing between
you the final keynote and the party so
look I'll try to be quick I'll try to be
life and hopefully make it fun for you
we have a few notable guests in the
audience like Martin so that doesn't
make me nervous at all but look I will
tell you a story about my service
startup and I will tell you some of the
lessons that we learned where we
succeeded and where we failed I think
that a service approach to architecture
is the future but it is also not a
silver bullet in all circumstances
there are some interesting problems that
still need to be solved but it is an
unbelievable accelerator if used wisely
so just a quick question before I start
who has heard or use of AWS lambda X or
the tick you've done this before
what about as your functions yes that's
the usual response that I get this is
recorded right
what about IBM open wisk yes and what
about Google Cloud functions cool okay
so look my name is Peters Barsky and I'm
VP of engineering we're a company called
a cloud guru and our mission is to teach
the world of cloud computing so I'm also
the head organizer of a conference
dedicated to service architectures and
technologies and this serve this
conference is called service Kong so
both Chris and Mike who presented just
before me actually attended and
presented at service from last week so
this is how much both of them love
servers you know after that conference
they immediately came here to present to
us today so thank you to those guys they
are amazing I have a background in
computer science I've got a PhD in
Kampai
in 2000
I worked as a consultant in northern
Australia for a number of years I worked
the defense Science and Technology
organisation and the United Nations in
New York my interest is in clouds of the
architecture and over the past couple of
years I've spent quite a lot of time
kind of trying to understand what these
service thing is all about
and finally I'm the author of this book
it is called service architectures on
AWS so if you're interested coming talk
to me after my talk so let me set just a
little bit of context before we go any
further so here's a little story about
our setup so at the start of 2016 we put
some courses on udemy.com
teaching people about AWS rather than
helping them to achieve certification so
the whole thing went a little bit crazy
a lot of people seem to like our courses
and so after a while we decided to build
our own online training platform we
think that learning is a social thing
and so we wanted to build the best
possible place online for training we
wanted to provide interactive
discussions unification and just you
know make kind of learning and training
a lot of fun and so in 18 months we have
scaled to 200 thousand engineers
globally across 140 countries at any
given time there can be thousands of
people using our platform watching
videos doing quizzes interacting with
each other all in real time and so our
system is completely event-driven and
push based going to the talk to the
keynote this morning this means that as
people interact these interactions are
pushed immediately to all the devices
worldwide and we don't run a single
server not one not anywhere in fact our
hosting bill is almost non-existent and
I'll tell you what it is a little bit
later and for the main point that I want
to bring across to you is that what this
has built is not just like a toy
application it is a fully fledged reach
web application in production that
flowers that you know with thousands of
simultaneous users at the moment now
there are other examples that I can tell
you about other service systems like
Expedia that triggers 1.2 billion
service requests a month Indra the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
processes half a trillion validations of
stocks substrates every day I'm so on
and so forth so there are a lot of
examples so look this wouldn't be a talk
on service if I didn't tell you what
service is right I think this is the
tradition I have to say yes there are
service absolutely yeah so here is my
definition of service so number one a
system is service if obviously there are
no service for you to manage or
administer instead use an ephemeral
compute service they given a small piece
of code like a function will execute it
for you on demand right so some people
prefer to use to call that function as a
service which is totally understandable
next service applications typically use
third-party services to help with tasks
such as authentication database file
storage and so on and we can call that
back-end as a service look obviously it
isn't mandatory to use third-party
services but we find that a lot of
server service applications room finally
there are certain settings and
architectures which are common to
several systems so for example big
powerful front ends that communicate
directly with other services using gates
and their focus service applications are
typically isn't driven and so on and I
will talk more about these patents and
architectures a little bit further on so
in my view service is a theme right it's
an approach to building software and
it's made out it's made out of our
computer and patents so this is
interesting just this morning I had a
look at this soft word signal generator
and it is
so the food service architectures and
the trial which means that this approach
to kind of software design is mature
enough who seems to begin trialing and
exploring in more depth so that is very
cool let me talk about AWS lambda just
for a minute
so when they use Amazon's servers
compute service and it's definitely
leading the game right now and works
very simply right so you create a
function zip it up upload to lambda and
lambda will execute that function for
you in response to some of them right it
could be an HTTP request or it could be
a file placed in an s3 bucket so an
event will happen and then configure a
lambda function that can do some
processing so I say that lambda is
groundbreaking and it is bigger ship
forward for cloud computing as s3 was
for cloud storage and in fact if you
think about it the two are very very
similar so lambda is to compute what s3
is for storage as free deals in objects
for storage right you provide an object
and s3 stores it you don't know how you
don't know where and you don't care
there are no drives to concern yourself
with there's no such thing as a disk
space not map space no such thing as too
much unused space these concepts do not
exist at all you cannot over provision
or under provision
storage capacity in s3 it is just what
you want it to be as free stores and
charges you exactly what you give it
nothing more nothing less
so if you look at lambda it's the same
thing right
lend the guilt in functions for
execution you provide function code and
let the executor for you and demand you
don't know how and you don't know where
you don't really care there are no
virtual machines for you to think about
no such being as a server farm capacity
to many idling service not enough
service to meet demand No
in groups these concepts do not exist at
all for you so you cannot over provision
or under provision compute capacity with
lambda that typically it is just what
you want it to be and lambda executes
and charges you for exactly what you
have to do so nothing more nothing less
so this is why I think that lambda is
the next level for cloud computing and
it is bigger shift force for compute as
SP was for storage but lambda isn't the
only player in town right so we have
other servers compute technologies we
have Microsoft Azure functions we have
Google Cloud functions we have IBM open
risk we have zero wrapped up so other
cloud vendors are jumping onto this as
well because I think they are seeing
something here they see maybe the future
in some way kind of while we were
building our platform we came up with a
number of principles for service
architectures that I kind of want to
share with you and I would love to hear
your feedback does this resonate with
you you think that they're right to
think that they're wrong
so after this please let me know what
you think and I will kind of just
quickly mention each principle and then
I will illustrate with an example from
our own systems
so I guess look this is probably the
most important principle if you're going
to do service applications right use a
computer service to execute code on
demand
aka don't run a server and this is
probably the most important principle
look you don't want to run or manager
server if you don't need to write your
goal is usually to solve an interesting
problem it's not to fetch about you on
so another security updates you can run
you can write functions to carry out
almost any task you can read and write
the data source you can perform a
computation you can do pretty much
anything you want another cool thing
about service pack lambda is that you
are only paying for the time that you
code execute
that means you are built in new seconds
not hours and this can massively reduce
your hosting costs yes the right
sections yeah but you are not paying for
service to sit around idling waiting for
requests to come through and it's
interesting that in fact due to a
generous freeze here that AWS provides
we haven't actually paid for lambda as
yet so don't tell Amazon squeezed in the
audience please don't say anything okay
and that's for two hundred thousand
users who are hitting the system so
that's kind of interesting of course
there will be scenarios where you may
need a server I totally understand you
know but you know try to minimize your
dependency on service as much as
possible
so look here's a basic use case where
you're where lambda serves as a back-end
for let's say a web application so you
have a client it could be a web
application it could be a mobile app the
request comes through to the API gateway
which is another service provided by
Amazon API gateway invokes the write
lambda function that lambda function can
process your request it can call out to
other services it can talk to say
dynamodb or really to anything you want
it doesn't have to talk to services only
within AWS
you can pull out anywhere you want it
can generate a response and then send
that response back to the client so your
client doesn't actually know that it's
talking through a service system
security can be taken care of at the API
gateway level or at each functions so I
would suggest doing both but again
depends on your requirements so here's
another scenario so I call this
computer's group so this is where you
use
lender functions to glue other services
together so you might have some storage
like file storage innisfree you might
have a simple notification service or I
don't know relational database and you
can glue these services together and you
can create awesome scalable I find
where you push that across the phone
certain operations and you can do it all
in an event-driven style and I'll show
you an example in just a minute number
two right single purpose stateless
functions as software engineers you know
we are aware of the single
responsibility principle write a
function that does one thing is more
testable it is more about it leads to
fewer side-effects and by composing and
combining functions and services in a
loose orchestration you can't build
complex back-end systems that are still
understandable and easy to manage also a
regular function with a well-defined
interface is also more likely to be
reused within your service architecture
when you write code for say a lambda
function remember to create it in a
stateless style you must not assume that
any resources will kind of survive
beyond immediate session so stateless
list is very powerful and there is
actually that magic sauce that makes
lambda and other confused services
possible it allows these platforms to
quickly scale to handle that
ever-changing number of incoming events
or requests and look open it is very
hard to know where the granularity of a
function should be right you make
something too granular and then you have
you know an explosion of functions that
you need to manage for the nightmare and
then use no granularity and you credit
mini monolith also that idea and look it
takes time I think to kind of understand
where the rival granularity should be
we've tried to focus on giving each
function one purpose there's other
thinking that says that each lambda
function should do zero or one data
transformations but no more and so for
Johnson suggested that when you write a
lambda function only to zero or one data
transformations so that's interesting to
keep in mind but for example in our
system we have functions that allow
users to get questions
and comments on our forums also me to
answers on our forums with our function
that allows a person to vote up and down
the question on our forums will have a
little sled board called guru board that
informs our lecturers how much money
they have made each day will have a
function that's responsible for taking
payments and will have a function that
grant users access to restricted files
third principle and this is my favorite
it's about designing push-based
event-driven pipelines and look they are
powerful and they allow you to expand
your architecture really simply and they
look like magic so in the rendering
pipeline in my new manager is basically
this if you click open event and that
event continues to propagate further
without any additional user input so
very simple one event triggers another
event so here is a very basic example we
use a non sequel database called
firebase and it is a real-time streaming
database which uses WebSockets so
changes made to the database I think to
all clients in real time so you make a
little change in firebase and all of
those changes are pushed to all web
browsers connected through our website
so in this example a user I think that's
me if it needs a comment which goes to
the API gateway a day gateway invokes a
lambda function that lambda function
makes a change to our firebase database
and that change is immediately pushed to
all clients that's kind of cool totally
when driven there's no following
everything is kind of pushed based in
happens one by one you put technically
even simplify that further you could
have Peter update
firebase directly from the browser and
have that push to all connected clients
now this may not be a good idea in all
circumstances but there are
circumstances where this actually works
too
so here's a simplified example of our
video transcoding pipelines we allow our
lectures to upload videos so there is
one of course awesome we allow them to
upload the video which then gets
transcoded to 20 different formats so a
video can be transcoded to 720p 1080p
HMS WebM etc and so he look happy so our
user so our lecturer from their browser
upload the file straight to s3 right
there's no intermediate server there so
file goes to s free once the file is
uploaded that automatically invokes a
lambda function which goes hey there's a
new file in the bucket who that lambda
function then sets up an elastic
transcoder job elastic transcoder is
another service in AWS which can
transport video videos to different
formats so elastic transcoder receives
this new job and go save awesome let me
do this processing it spends let's say
half an hour working and producing these
new files the new transported files are
then placed in another bucket
now that pushes an event onto the SNS
topic that we have which then triggers
basically sends out and triggers a
number of other lambda functions that we
had one of those Thunder functions Gosei
cool there's a new transport file it
updates our firebase database and all
users basically in real time receive
that updates so you think all
notification pops are cool they see kind
of a new lesson added to the list of
lessons that they have and this happens
basically as quickly as possible
so there's no polling there's no
refreshing this is all push based kind
of end-to-end
that is really cool and it works very
well so this one this principle gets me
in a lot of trouble always and I get a
lot of debates and I'd be very
interested in hearing what you have to
say about this if you are creating a web
application with server
architectures for example I would
suggest to you to create thicker more
powerful front end so what do I mean by
that so let's think about a traditional
fruity approach so you have a web
browser which is your presentations here
you have your web server which is your
OTP
and the database data here and so this
layering keeps a nice separation of
concerns but it becomes very tedious to
maintain and improve and it gets even
worse in the world of rich single page
applications so let's have a look at
this you know you are all familiar with
this approach right so in a single page
app you have your whole framework in the
browser would use browsing maybe
controllers if use angular services
components your sta talks over the wire
and sends messages to your server right
there you have to authorize all calls
whether this input search model from the
database apply business logic so on and
so forth and then if you have to add a
new feature you may have to go and touch
each of those layers and I was a project
that had ten layers
I had managers and proxies and all kinds
of things and adding a button becomes
really really difficult which isn't a
lot of fun but with the explosion of
cloud-based services and great security
mechanisms like force JWT samo something
new becomes possible your phantoms app
can talk directly and securely to a
number of cloud enabled services it is
really interesting and you can even talk
directly to a database and that may not
be a bad thing in some circumstances but
this makes it possible to remove the
middleman it's interesting that this new
model means that most of your data
transformation and business logic could
actually be moved to the front end right
but of course you know we are sensible
people and we understand that there are
a lot of actions that cannot be
performed in the front-end right
there are security concerns that you
have to think about privacy concerns yes
and for that you do have to still use
something like AWS lender to execute
clothes in a protected manner so for
example let's say I want to notify all
subscribers of my systems that there's a
new forum post you would never ever ever
do that from the front end right if you
can fail you may have issues it's
insecure you cannot load other people's
email addresses into somebody's browser
that's a big no-no so for that you would
use a lambda function right you would
use you would execute that action from a
protective function so you get to
something like this right you have a lot
of richness in your front-end you can
focus also with straight to your
database maybe and you can invoke cloud
functions when you need to perform
certain protective actions now again
this works for a web application you
know this isn't going to work if you're
building an API for example and again
I'd be very interested in hearing your
thoughts after this and now the fifth
principle is about using third-party
services and look we all know that there
are companies that dedicate 100% of
their time to doing some very specific
things very well so you have all 0 that
do they do authentication and
authorization you have s3 for file
storage cloud front for CDN distribution
firebase for data striping paper for
payments each of these companies do what
they do very very well so you can pick
up a lot of fees a lot of speed by
outsourcing some of the work that you
have to do and then you can focus on
your core product which gives you that
additional acceleration now again this
is easy for me to say because you know I
work in a start-up so we can do this
it's a greenfield project you may be
working you know in a different
environment in an enterprise and you may
not be able to use third-party services
I certainly understand again it's just a
principle that I kind of wanted to share
with you
so why did we choose to build a server
system rather than that traditional web
server approach and what benefits has it
brought us well first of all number one
rep it's time to market so early early
on we were very resource constrained and
we didn't have a big team and tended all
of our funding was from our cash flow
and we had four weeks to build our
entire system from scratch and this
included sign ups payments post video
delivery delivery practice exams
discussion forums so on and so forth
basically you know all the LMS features
you would expect and if we had taken
that traditional web server approach I
believe we would have never made it and
we wouldn't have had the business we
have today secondly we needed to scale
fast and effortlessly when we decided to
build our platform we already had tens
of thousands of users on udemy.com
scaling taking our courses so we knew
that when we launched our platforms we
would need to scale reverse really
quickly we wouldn't have that typical
kind of slow trickle start up being
where we gradually acquire users we need
to scale quickly and we also knew that
we would have very large spikes during
sales period like Black Friday and so
for example Black Friday 2016 our load
was 40 times our regular day right so we
get 40 times as much business as we do
during a normal day and it's amazing
that our system that we do need to do
anything we didn't need to provision any
additional kind of computer packages the
platform scaled for us we also wanted to
offer a disruptive business model right
we're doing something different
instead of paying for like thousands of
dollars in personal training in person
training our customers pay like twenty
nine dollars per horse and they keep it
forever right it's just one purchase
lifetime access and I don't think we
could have done it without lambda and
AWS because lambda as a city before
we only pay for the time that our lambda
function executes and then the execute
once when our user goes to take a course
and that's that and I think and again I
know that this is recorded but I think
it costs us roughly fourteen cents to
deliver a course to a user once a user
by the course and most of the cost is
actually in the data delivery right this
is so that's kind of very interesting
and this allows us to not charge those
kind of ongoing fees that others may
charge and this has really enabled our
business model and fuel the growth of
our business the cost is disrupted and
look one of the advantages to the
server's approach is that existing
applications can be gradually
reimplemented
to service architecture so if you're
faced with a monolithic code base you
can gradually just float apart right
gives it apart and great lambda
functions that your application can
communicate with service doesn't have to
be an all-or-nothing proposition so this
is to make it to be a hybrid but that's
okay that's probably fine you still get
a lot of benefit exam points look it is
not for everyone
services like lambda run out of a public
cloud so if you're building a
mission-critical applications like a
patient's life support system for
example then you may require a higher
level of performance and reliability
than a public cloud can provide
obviously their service levels and
customization AWS has a lace for certain
things but not for others so you have to
consider that as well is reliability
offered by AWS good enough for you
it's good enough for our business but it
may or may not work for your business
there is that are the issue of when the
locking and I totally agree with Mike
that the
when the locking issue is not in the
lambda function lambda functions that
easy to float across you can wrap your
lambda function even expressed framework
and run it on your own server it's not a
big deal
the issues are the other services that
you may integrate with in a public cloud
like AWS how are you going to float
across as free and Kinesis and DynamoDB
and all the other services that your
service application could be using so
that's something you have to consider
and of course the centralization you
know if you move from a monolithic
approach to a more decentralized service
approach you know you're not
automatically reducing the complexity of
your system not at all in fact the
distributed nature of the solution can
introduce its own challenges because now
you're making remote rather than in
process calls and so use the handle bay
leaves and latency across the network
but you would with a micro services of
course there are a lot of pros while you
would go with a service approach the big
one is no more service to manage so you
don't need to think about server
configuration and management batching
maintenance all of that is taken care of
by the vendor and let's say Amazon in
our case looks after the health of the
of its fleet of service and it has to
make sure that capacity is provisioned
for us the security we have found that
service architectures are very versatile
so we have build backends we can field
Evangeline pipelines we process a lot of
that I would have chat box that would
build you can do all kinds of things and
you can do them really quickly low cost
I've said this to you before you are
only paying while your user is doing
something useful if you use it isn't
using your system that then you're not
saying anything so that's interesting
oops sorry I jumped across
and of course you know there's
scalability flexibility and we have
found that our system actually has less
code which is interesting so we kind of
build our system and it was also and it
scales but we realized something about
our architecture yes it was servers but
it was actually a service monolith why
well it's because we had one database
firebase and everything was coupled to
it so all of our lambda functions would
write to the database which was okay it
got us to market you know it created our
business but it presented a number of
challenges first of all we wanted to
bring in a mobile app and that was hard
to do we didn't really have a version
consistent consistent API we also used
cloud formation for the AWS parts of our
system but there was no cloud formation
for firebase right it's a Google form
it's made by another vendor that was
hard to manage and how would we kind of
scale from a few developers that we had
to pretend about this 20:50 without
everybody kind of stepping over one
another and dealing with a single
codebase and a database so this is what
we have right we have kind of our cool
little server system without our lender
functions to have our database and
everything works okay but how do we grow
where do we go from here so we decided
to move to a microservices tile
architecture so where each distinct
business domain is represented by
separate micro service and each micro
service is responsible for its own view
of the world it has its own database and
its own API and this has allowed us to
achieve acceleration with highly focused
schemes
that that own and are accountable for
one particular aspect of the system and
it allows us to actually scale various
parts of our system separately so we can
allocate different read and write
throughput capabilities DynamoDB
depending on the different levels of
demands and we may experience and so
here's a very simple example right so
this is our learning record service so
we have a request it comes through to
the API gateway for that particular
micro service there's a little lender
function just above the API gateway
that's our custom authorizer if the
fancy pizza request then the API gateway
invokes the lambda function that lambda
functions write something to our source
of truth which is DynamoDB which is a
DynamoDB table in this example so again
every microservices on database but the
action of writing something to the
dynamodb table invokes another than the
function which then goes and updates
firebase which is as you remember our
old firebase that we use which is
coupled to our user interface but now
firebase is basically used as a
materialized view that drives our UI
there are no smart in this database
we don't do anything really with us we
update the database we can normalize
everything and that's simply updates our
UI so what happens is again we have our
source of truth which is our dynamodb
table for this particular microservice
and then we have firebase which is that
materialized view which drives our UI
and again everything is push based and
event-driven as soon as the changes made
to firebase everything updates we also
use algo Lea which is an awesome search
service that you can use to kind of
provide search capability for your
application I actually implemented
cloud search on AWS and don't go there
don't try it again sorry Chrissy here
so there you go and when you think about
it we've migrated from this serverless
monolithic architecture to microservices
without actually having to think about
infrastructure what haven't had to think
about server provisioning of web farms
or load balancers we changed our
architecture by changing a demo file in
a service framework so we use a product
called service framework which allows us
to underfoot organize orchestrate and
deploy our entire application in one go
and yeah so we define our architecture
in that one file of number files and we
hit deploy and our system can be created
ahead of a button
one other thing to think about and going
service managed services are moving
targets right you are building against a
set of managed services so for example
firebase made their old version obsolete
which forced us to upgrade suddenly no
0.1 support was dropped by AWS lender
and that force us to upgrade we had no
other choice right Amazon said sorry
guys were throwing off support for node
zero point one tomorrow and well it
wasn't tomorrow we had a couple of
months to do it but we had to do it so
you have to consider that we had a bug
bugs that showed up in our deployment
because of zero
so another services we use introduced
the library change like a minor version
and that's had a bug in it and that
forced our application to have a bug so
yeah look it sounds amazing that you
know you can create all these services
and lend the functions and have this
awesome scalable architecture and you
can but you do have to consider and
think about being kind of the et parts
as well
so look I want to tell you that this is
a worthwhile thing to have a look at
this is fun even if you do it in your
own spare time create a lambda function
hook it up to something create a service
chat board it is really just fun to do
and I think you will realize as you work
with this more and more you will see
kind of the power that you get from it
and you will I think identify aspects in
your day-to-day job where you could use
a service approach as well so I run a
conference called service comp and we
are going to have videos from all the
speakers who attended our most recent
conference which was last week on
YouTube so you can just go to video dot
service consulate IO and you see all the
videos there we have a number of great
talks by people like Mike for example
charity majors Chris just presented
before as well
Tim bagging up with the head of the
service team at AWS
so great talks you will see a lot of
different perspectives debates this is
still a very new area every one of you
can still become a pioneer can be a
pioneer in this and like Mike said we
haven't discovered all the patterns and
all the architectures that we build with
this approach so I kind of urge you get
into it build something share with the
community blog about it because you can
do that next pioneer the next Dijkstra
it kind of leads us forward I didn't
know how much time I would have and I
thought maybe you know all right I will
have too much time left so I added a
couple of pictures from the conference
so we did it this conference was held at
the Zak theater in Austin Texas
so microphones on stage and I hope he
enjoyed the experience it's kind of
weird being on stage and having
everybody up in front of you so here's
another picture here's another picture
in the personal columns
final plugs we do a number of workshops
ourselves architects service
architecture so interested if you are
interested please come and talk to me
and look that's it
this stuff is fun so get your hands
dirty build something small go with it
and yes give it a try thank you for
