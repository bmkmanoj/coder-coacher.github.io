we're going to close with some
suggestions from cognitive science and
if you don't get a chance to ask a
question you've got my email address and
look at that I'm on Twitter this is not
my field of expertise I'm a PhD in
computer science so I'm always happy to
say I do a lot of reading in this area
but I don't have any certification or
any degrees in it but everything that I
tell you is not just based on my own
experience it's based on research which
is very different from most conferences
especially agile conferences how much
agile recommendation is based on
research anyone just almost done what is
it based on I was going to say
enthusiasm enthusiasm it's good stuff I
try to work for me so you should try it
so these are recommendations in that
category as well because I'm not gonna
recommend anything that I personally
haven't tried but it's all based on
research and I'm not going to cite but
if you'd happy I'd be happy to send you
any paper or a pointer to the research
if you say I'd really like to read a
little more about that so here's my
recommendation we only have time for one
the most important thing that you can do
to improve your personal productivity is
stop sitting how many people sit more
than three hours a day there's new
research that shows that people who sit
more than three hours a day regardless
of whether you are in good health or
whether you exercise you might go out
and run marathons every day but if you
sit longer than three hours you are more
likely to die
hello so wouldn't that be a good idea to
try standing try moving so I'm taking a
survey as I go around the world I ask
people what is the longest amount of
time I know you sit more than three
hours what's the longest amount of time
you've ever sat staring in front of a
computer screen not moving not going to
the toilet just sitting call out a
number how many hours 14 do I hear 15 14
hours I was going to say up till this
point the record is 13 I have two people
who say they have sat for 13 hours
without moving so do we wonder about his
biology or do we want to ask long-haul
truck drivers use some interesting
things so they don't have to stop I
wonder it's not a talk about that
so usually when I comment on how long
that is
14 hours usually the person says oh but
I found the bug or fix the problem or
but you were playing games so much for
personal productivity so we know that
when you stare at a screen for 14 hours
you're gonna be my new record holder
where are you from the Netherlands okay
the other two are from the UK my other
13 hour guys at least lift your eyes
from the screen so you don't have time
to do a lot of moving you're hardwired
to look at the horizon look at the
horizon you stare at the screen for any
length of time and after a while you
forget to blink your eyes dry out that
immediately affects your productivity so
at least raise your eyes if you have a
window to look out even better but if
you don't look at something blue or
something green all of that has been
shown to make your problem-solving
ability and your decision-making much
better stand up move around a little bit
at least five minutes and if you can
walk around even better but what's
really good lie down now you might have
to explain to your manager what you're
doing on the floor
so I'll be happy remember to send you
that research if you're on a pull that
paper out of your back pocket to say
look I'm increasing my personal
productivity now I've been talking about
this for a long time and finally finally
I think we're reaching a tipping point
finally people are starting to pay
attention two years ago at the agile
conference someone gave a talk about
pair programming on a treadmill so it's
pretty easy actually the person who's
doing the typing is on the treadmill
walking about 1.2 miles per hour just an
easy stroll you can type you can read
you can talk on the phone you can read
you can do anything that you can
normally do sitting at your desk on a
treadmill companies are starting to make
the treadmill desk it's a very in this
version anyway it's not very tall so
that you can put a chair on it and sit
down if you want the desk has adjustable
height but most people I know in most
organizations are going out to
Craigslist Craigslist buying an old
treadmill stripping it down to just the
bare essentials going to Ikea getting an
adjustable desk and saying wallah
there it is so you don't have to stand
all day you just want to slowly over
time reduce the amount of time that you
are sitting and in the organization
where pair programming is done on a
treadmill the person who is the
assistant is standing to the side and
then when they're ready to switch one
gets off the treadmill and the other one
gets on remember there's data I don't
know what's going on there's research
that shows this will increase your
personal productivity although it's not
doing anything for my connection here so
I don't own any stock in the treadmill
desk and there
lots of people are doing it the
interesting thing about this
presentation at the agile conference is
that the presentation itself was given
on a treadmill now let's see will it
work let's all say a silent prayer to
the computer God's dear computer gods
please show this video I'd really
appreciate it
it's a movement it's a nonprofit
organization called just stand org join
the uprising not just for your own
personal productivity while you're
working alone but also in meetings this
is a quote from an executive at Kaiser
Permanente who says of course we have
walking meetings we know that there's a
lot of research that shows the results
of a meeting are pretty much the same
but by having a walking meeting or a
standing meeting what we can see is the
time of the meeting is reduced by about
10 to 20 percent I wonder how that works
so if you can get the same result in a
shorter a period of time wouldn't that
be productive so this is a financial
services company in Minneapolis where
they all work on treadmill desks and
when it's time to have a meeting they
just roll the treadmill desks into the
conference room and everyone is walking
while they're having the meeting now I
don't know about you but I've been in
some pretty long meetings that I thought
could have been cut shorter and this is
the way to do that everyone stand up or
everyone get on the treadmill and it
will automatically increase productivity
so I'm encouraging you to try your own
experiments you've been sitting for days
now wouldn't it be a good idea if maybe
you might try standing up you don't have
to stand up all day just stand for a
little bit get up walk around I think if
we make that socially acceptable that is
okay to stand up that it's okay to walk
around across the back as long as you're
not disturbing anyone else we'll all be
happier and healthier and you'll be
smarter thanks for listening we have a
time for a question yes stand up yes I
don't know of any I don't know of any I
do remember though I worked for a while
on the triple7 airplane and people came
in and worked horrendous hours and I do
remember guys falling asleep on their
keyboard and waking up and they'd had
big gashes on their broken nose yeah so
you can have an accident sitting down
yes these are these are pretty quiet and
one of the reasons for that is that
you're hardly moving 1.2 miles per hour
is just a very slow gentle kind of
stroll
you're not running so you're not having
the noise of your foot hitting the
treadmill and the motor isn't running
and very rapidly so the noise one of the
other elements we could talk about is a
noisy environment which does have an
impact on your thinking as agile moves
us to open bullpens I worry about that
because the research is pretty clear we
don't do as well with a lot of noise so
it doesn't seem to be a problem and the
ones that are built with the desks the
treadmill desk they're very quiet that's
a good question yes sir
it's just more than three hours a day
total three hours a day the interesting
thing about us as a species if you go
back to the Stone Age what they know
pretty pretty certain Lee is that we
walked about 12 to 15 miles a day
we're walkers we're designed to walk
we're not designed to walk fast
we're just designed to stroll and to
keep moving and what we all do now and
you can measure it around the globe
we're not getting as much sleep which is
also bad for your brain and we're
sitting and as a result you can see the
rise of a number of diseases of the
increase in weight did you see the movie
wall-e that's where we're headed yeah
yes sir well when you and you also have
to move I have a very small office at
home and so I have a standing desk I
don't have room for a treadmill and if I
don't move then that is actually what's
going to happen you that's why the
treadmill is better so just standing
fixed you know there are lots of
evidence for that in the military that
if you stand at attention after a while
you fall over so you need to move that
increases the circulation in your legs
and you might not be able to stand long
because it takes core body muscles and
if you sit all day that was not really a
joke all the people leaned over so if
you do that all day after a while your
core cannot support you so you start
leaning on things and that's not so good
either so don't just immediately begin
to stand all day in bad shoes and you
know little tiny steps experiment yes
ma'am
yeah yeah chained them chained them to
the desk that's what I think let's get
out the whips no it's just a little
experiment why don't we try standing for
a few minutes and when you're tired sit
down and then you could stand up again
it's the encouraging of a different
position rather than having it be
acceptable to sit that that's the
preferred position so if somebody stands
there must be something wrong with that
so it's gonna require a bit of a culture
shift and not everyone can stand for a
variety of reasons so you don't want to
require it you don't want to say you
must stand you just want to make it
acceptable to stand and move around a
little bit so I try a little experiment
figure out what works for you to not sit
for 14 hours without moving and and
you're yelling you're not worried but
when I read research that says this is
going to cut your lifespan short I pay
attention yes
oh no what no what it shows is for
people who don't sit it they do
controlled experiments so comparing
populations where one population sits
the other an identical population stands
that's what they notice is lifespan is
reduced a couple of years and and you're
I know you're thinking a couple of years
but let me tell you a couple of years no
I want those I want those two years
absolutely you bet and there are other
health benefits as well we can see
increase in strokes heart problems high
blood pressure that lead to those early
deaths and we're seeing those problems
in children so even our children sit way
too much yes this trend what's kind of
bringing everything in actually takes
something that's a very obvious kind of
part of the day in which to walk go to
lunch it takes it away and we have found
this as a team what my comment that
question that it's a way of you know
kind of walking on a treadmill bring a
meeting maybe a bit it's made major
culture shift perhaps walking to lunch
probably is not and we've found that we
kind of brainstorm things in those walks
plus you're outside most of us spend
those 14 hours inside and I don't know
about you but I've been on projects
where I came in when it was dark and I
left when it was dark I never saw a
natural light for days that's not
healthy either so stepping outside and
looking at a real tree real grass that's
a good thing that's a very good thing
for your brain so yes excellent
suggestion we've done a lot of things to
change the way we work
not just the sitting but as you say
there are other things as well and it's
the package that's bad this is all we
have time to talk about today but it's
just the tip of the iceberg so start
some small experiments thanks for your
attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
