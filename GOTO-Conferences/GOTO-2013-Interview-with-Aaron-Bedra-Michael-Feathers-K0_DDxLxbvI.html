Erin better and Michael feathers and
we're about to talk about security
cheers Cheers okay so yeah Erin you've
been involved in security for quite a
while since a little cash interview yeah
tell us more about her I took a kind of
a dive through languages of closure and
Ruby and it's at that for a few years
what kind of always had by now here's a
guy with security and and did it even
before writing professionally really
penetration testing digital forensics
and things like that kind of rate it
very early in my career just to kind of
went from hobby to job to kind of career
path for me eventually yeah this is cool
because it seems like it so much really
you know getting a lot of attention
these days yeah what's funny is that
there's so many developers idea of the
basis almost like a completely
peripheral concern they just don't
believe I'd all that much except I'm
impinges on their work yeah how do you
feel about that I mean for me it's kind
of a it's a way of life right it's a way
of thinking it's a way of designing
systems it definitely shouldn't get in
the way really what you do is enable you
to do more faster right just like any
tool we use and any any idea that we
constantly using programming good design
yields relativity so everyone's into
offers that just don't want to thank
sure absolutely all the time and that's
okay great evidence that everybody wants
to think about this all the time you
know especially when they're ready to go
right you want it to work you want it to
you want to get out the door or you want
to you know you want to live in regular
business around you have money to make
and when you have to stop that for
something for anything that's seen as
you know kind of a detriment yeah I just
kind of wonder though whether it really
should be able to Morty
McRaven yeah I mean absolutely it's
definitely this is like it's a bit kind
of feel still feels like them in the
afterthought but it's coming down like
their own most series of development
it's like something going to take some
particularly injured you know area like
a user interaction stuff like that say
that hey this is a very primary thing
than money money push it forward the
development process and make it really
something we highlight and it feels like
without over the years we've kinda like
push that science and look it's just
really matter of getting something out
there and you know as a concern arises
we start to deal with it but I'm
wondering the security fence really we
should be and it's always been baked in
which is tacked on later right and
security baked in you know usually is a
better design right and actually you do
a lot less your system is less
complicated when you build the security
in because we can talk it out later you
end up having to I had a bunch of knobs
to everything you're doing and you know
you don't really get all the way to the
core system and so it becomes harder you
have to create additional distractions
and additional ideas around the stopper
you ready just snatching attached but if
you design things when they're ground up
with security in mind you know it makes
it go a lot faster a lot easier yeah it
just feels like it's kind of weird right
now because there is like all that
peripheral talk about security and
people you know there who are experts in
security but I just don't I'm not quite
sure where we really go as far as going
in developing the mindset among
developers you know to its it's odd
right even the e kind of some of the
older ways of security thinking we're
always know right you know you can't do
that or you have to stop and fix this
before you can push something out the
door or basically it's roadblocks right
securities always seen as a roadblock
it's a perception problem really because
in the end right now our business of
limb so fast it's about creative ways to
send yes and that's really the point
yeah but is there
an analogy in a way it's kinda like with
curious than in that role in sense kind
of okay well this time no this isn't
ready this kind of thing yeah wonder how
much this is really an artifact that had
separate teams of people rather than
going and having you know kind of
coordinated coordinated action on site
look absolutely i'm not saying no but
basically with you really enough the
processing of say hey this is how we had
to yes absolutely yeah I mean it's about
being part of every day and being
involved the entire time because then
you put things out the door on time I
mean they that's them important than or
anything you don't want to be attacked
you don't want to be compromised but you
also need to ship software to make money
you know and that's really the point of
running your business right unless your
business is actually just doing security
right as it Salton Sea is something else
yeah at the bottom line is you have to
you know your function as a business and
really it's that kind of black and white
feeling that we've had in the past two
of yes or no secure own secure or
insecure it's it's tough because we end
up in that way of thinking what really
it's about a state of risk tolerance
right yeah however you cemented
situations were basically people are
encountering unanticipated Bowl security
concerns absolutely occasional I mean
there's someone that happened just a
what a month and a half ago or so
reading Ruby I'm announcing a giant you
know vionnet the exploit and everything
is fine and then all said it's not and
it's still not fine that somebody can
just go in no run whatever code they
want on your system and your impacted I
didn't see the response time even if it
was you know 12 hours which is not great
but also not that bad was enough time
for you know a worm to propagate idea
and I just find the real servers and
epic on this wings I kind of wonder
whether that really is where that should
be considered on anticipate or it's
because that kind of bone disease yeah
there's really the book of ultimate
bears it's actually kind of about risk
tolerance yeah Reno risk management
general it's a tiny Marco and he had
can't remember the authors but every in
the book and you know they kind of refer
to things like the meteor event right
asteroid hits the planet you know
there's not much you can do right you
know you have to focus on the things
that are relevant right the things you
see coming you you're never going to
make that read write and there's that
list of you know exploits sitting out on
the market for sale I haven't been
published yet yeah there's always that
that's that one last thing they can get
you yeah so here's a question it sounds
like the security discussion you have a
certain amount of control over security
from the application level the coma that
you're writing but there's a whole stack
there and makes me think back to some
DevOps discussions that we've had and
looking at the entire system so not just
the application code but looking at the
stack the libraries you're choosing the
hardware it's running on the
infrastructure which how how does
security affect your decisions in each
of these areas like for instance can you
look at and say okay well here's our
process for rolling out a new driver
because there's an issue with the
underlying youth in that driver or a new
kernel for the underlying vm that we're
running on because then only certain
types of vulnerabilities are at the
application layer and there's also slew
of them victim to the giant stack
underneath you you know it is standing
on the shoulders of giants right there's
a ton of stuff there and you know it
really depends on your business and how
sensitive you are those needs I mean you
can get as detailed as understanding was
manufactured ships and making sure
somebody hasn't paid them to embed you
know porfa don't compromise firmware
right I mean that happens it's espionage
or reduction allege intimate acts so it
can go all the way down to the silicon
when you really what it really gets when
it comes down to it so you have to if it
way the benefit it's funny with that
Turkish question kind of pretty suppose
allure just base leading software also
right we're not just software and
hardware but this kind of way because at
least 30 min securing some lucky we've
been talking to basically pointing out
that it's really so much broader in
essence the psychical emotion even what
features are choosing the application
basically will improve it even certain
social engineering exploits of along
those lines that are you know I think
they quite often to us as you know we
have something offers we tend to think
an awful lot about this is suffer heavy
basically protect ourselves at these
various layers and stuff but it's it can
entire risk mindset across the entire
absolutely in and you know there's
there's definitely saying that's you
know it's got around that amateurs of
tech systems specialist attack people oh
yeah and social engineering is you think
the really the easiest way in most of
the time yeah and there's also the
combination of social engineering plus
plus actual you know technical exploits
you know I the RSA event that happened a
lot back was a combination of you know
convincing somebody at a charge open a
spreadsheet that had a 0 X went to excel
that kind of launched the entire chain
of events that happen from there yeah so
you know it was a combination of social
engineering and actual technical places
so definitely side effect of going Lee
thinks Varitek Vegas yeah it's the world
has room that's right okay perfect you
make things easier as a function of
business right and the technology is not
well understood but it's it's a tool and
you can you know if you use it for all
kinds of reasons yeah what I think
security is such a huge topic and as
we've talked about hits every level of
development and kind of any any software
that you're thinking about has hundreds
security risks or more i'm just i'm
wondering i said just feel so big and i
feel like i can't know everything
there's no way i can learn everything
today is there some sage advice that you
can give
as a developer or as somebody who's a
consultant in the software industry or
as some he's an architect what should I
be thinking day-to-day to really just
help my my company be a little more
secure I mean it really starts with just
a culture right just the way you think
about designing and building things you
know obviously education on just the
basic application security stuff is
important you know if you're in the web
space the OWASP top 10 pay attention to
that you know finding tools like web
code will help you kind of learn the
techniques for attacking a site and just
attack it right attack your own sites
make sure that you know you understand
that once you get there that you realize
how an attacker might come in your
system then you make this offense so you
build up defenses based on understanding
how the attacks work I mean that's a
very small part of the sack but the rest
of it right the the patching their
servers providing firewalls IDs that
kind of stuff is that there's kind of a
prescribed thing there right yeah
everybody system is different the
solutions are different but there is you
know that there's a way to get there
that isn't as complicated as working it
into the software you're writing right
so at the application security level
there's a lot more to think about
because it is that different it's not
just everybody uses the same network
stack more or less right everybody use
the same kind of basic principles for
communicating between systems not
everybody is the same language framework
librarians there's just so much more
levels of variance between the software
running until it gets complicated is
it's just striking to me because it
seems like there's such a strong analogy
between you know QA Andres security just
in the sense that seems I'm alpha level
is right about going in cultivating an
adversarial mindset absolutely and one
of the best things you can do is
actually to train all of the people in
QA how to attack site and let them do
that during their their QA process you
know the QA boxer should include
security heads you know it's not hard
right the
some of the best actuals made are made
by you know Google and Microsoft and
opera and Mozilla right the browser he
said actually you know the wooden
Firebug came around and all the web
inspector tools came around that's it
right i mean that's that's how a lot of
those works it's not like somebody
bought a you know
hundred-thousand-dollar advance at
actual you know they had a browser and
they had a little proxy sitting behind
it and they just handle with data and
that's it it's a pretty trivial thing to
learn firesheep is a great example of
something which is a barrier to entry
absolutely to home yeah five sheep is
definitely one of those look how real
this is kind of jewels you know it is so
close to us it's so easy there's this
interesting perception that security
being a hacker is is complicated and
tough and and a Academy right there
there are definitely very complicated
exploits that require understanding of
systems really deep understanding
systems but most of them are really
trivial and really simple of off and
often have to do with not touching your
server correct yeah I mean you know if
you just keep up on the basics right
just actually win matches come out just
doing the updates you're doing a lot
better than most people to be honest I
mean if the problem is it's difficult
and when your culture doesn't allow it
end there's that kind of mindset where
you and your environment or your
environmental to you right and you get
to that stage where you have the freedom
to command your environment when you get
there actually it's easy when your
environment it was you it's not right
and then in places like that the problem
really is it the fact that you can't
patch because this was that came out the
problem is you don't know any
environment right you view it's too
complicated it's or it's too brittle and
its really this all comes back and just
designing resilient systems right
designing good systems that function in
the face of you know will anything right
just knowing that eventually gonna be
broken right i mean what's that some
pecans big enough some part of it will
always be growing and you have to accept
that and when you build systems to to
kind of just accept that as a status quo
than everything we don't
you can start doing the patching and
everything else so in it just becomes
good architecture do you think it makes
sense to put effort into intrusion
detection tools like trip wire or
pattern detection what are these things
at what point should you introduce these
and what benefits do provide Nina so any
kind of data is data right your head and
you have to find out whether it signor
noise so a lot of these systems ids
tools you know the forensics tools
tripwire samhain things like that
they're all useful they just require to
me and false positives high rates of
false positives are Qatar top forex a
lot of noise but if you didn't have
false positives you're probably doing
something wrong right like there's that
threshold of when the false positive
stop you have to wonder if anything's
have so it's good and that right but
data the morning you have the more
decisions you're able to make and so
it's really about collecting all today
you can so if you can check the kind of
stuff up and you can put it into a state
of its functioning and it's loading
sometimes and it hasn't gotten so noises
that you ignore it then it's ok but
there's that problem where you turn it
on and its really noisy that one just
forgets about they filter it off in
their mail and never see it again and
it's just as noisy little thing the back
are sending me email I don't care about
right so it's a really fine line of of
actually carrying what things are
putting together so be careful about how
you introduce things of how how much
data you're giving everybody right
because actually gonna ignore it is too
much I've heard that described us alert
fatigue yeah absolutely that's very much
a good good word for one thing is you're
interested me is there such as a bit of
an outsider so holding some that
aspect of this whole thing about come on
escalating you know more yeah arms race
pretty much and I can wear this ever
comes up or there's like a series of
exports where a security professional
might choose to have this is ignore
those rather than actually escalate oh
it's possible right I don't feel sad
you're interesting at the end of day
this all comes down to except for levels
of risk okay if you if you know that the
impact from from a compromise
is ten thousand dollars and that's a
drop to the bucket your company and you
don't suffer in your patient damage or
brand image you know they basically shut
off one of your you know servers that
you barely use every now and again that
you know collects you know who got
somebody for lunch right it's its
response to you it costs you money to
respond to it basically know okay then
it's not business and in effect things
you don't have you didn't break
compliance right the impact is low the
rip you know the loss the actual loss
from from an event is so low that move
on right on it might cost you more to go
and fix this thing in you know
opportunity cost and some other function
of your business or legal off and fix
this then it would be just let it happen
right or just you know transits mahalo
together but yeah if you have to
understand and be able to understand the
impact of an event and speak in dollars
and cents right nobody cares that this
thing is vulnerable of that exploit they
care that it just happens my business
loses this much money right everybody
understands that doesn't matter who you
talk to it's very clear and so it's not
up to us and implementers of a system or
design into a system to make those calls
it's up to us to inform everybody what
the impeccable losses and let them
choose what the business shooting yeah
and too many of us get wrapped up into
saying we have to fix everything it's a
problem and you have to understand that
it's always going to be a problem you
can't live in this black and white half
moral absolutes you have to understand
that it's okay sometimes I really
enjoyed your your targets for your comp
I don't know if you want to make any of
that public at the moment but all you
you talked a bit about if if there's
somebody that you find or you you
suspect that they have mal-intent you do
something to make them think that
they've been successful yeah the funny
bonding right actually talked about a
year at the conference as well go to so
i actually had built that system out in
an open source it now so it really is
it's fun to study a right-sided behavior
right you don't always just flat out
deny somebody access sometimes you put
them in a little corner and watch what
they do right and then what you're
getting is actual signal right you're
seeing an attack you're seeing what
they're doing
and you can study that and actually if
you capture the day of the right way you
can replay it and train a model to learn
right it's a supervised learning
exercise right but you can say yeah this
is an attack and switch here's what it
looks like and you just play that
through your supervised learning and you
know also and it sorts out what that is
and next time it happens it sees all
that's an attack let's go ahead and
classify those attacking and maybe block
them later so it depends right have I
haven't seen it before have I not is it
different from the past time I've seen
it so you can choose whether that's
funny pot based on the data data you
have so since I keep talking about a lot
of data and processing a lot of
algorithms over this data it is yeah um
you know it you know I guess the the
funny funny coin is a you know
securities data sites problem which is
you know one of those things that I say
that it's just more of a job than
anything but that's what it's ready to
looking at data you're asking questions
you're listening if we have a lit in
already the things like IDs and forensic
logs gives us more data to make
decisions but the raw data is that and
your self listen to it right geoip you
know where they're coming from if any
have anomaly right just knowing the
distribution of HTTP methods and you're
just a understand when and I beat us
deviating that like there's a reason for
that they're not behavior of everybody
else why it might be good it might be
bad for the end of the day something's
different all right there's an anomaly
and just that just that basic Nalan
tection actually gives you a lot of
information about what's happening so do
you think honey plotting is more
effective against known attacks or
against new attacks because I mean it
seems if you're setting up an
environment that is going to mimic a
vulnerable environment you have to
already know that it's vulnerable and he
kind of already know roughly how the
store is going to play out whereas
something completely new like Richard
suppose grass pollen or building from a
couple weeks ago where they said
everybody upgrade right effin now yeah
that that kind of thing you can't really
protect against that necessarily obvious
you can't like that against that but you
also understand what the attack looks
like let's talk of signatures right so
if you know an attack looks like this
you can actually use something like wat
security or
kind of IPs and say here is the
signature of his attack when you see
this act you know one of the nicest that
came out of the room and rails
vulnerability was there was a lot
security rule written just for that
exploit so people couldn't pass right
away could turn him on security see this
coming into and block traffic right so
there was not he was an obviously did
you read it was a very clear pelo so
it's not always black and write like
that when it's definitely something to
think about when I was consulting I
think mostly security was always
attacked on after the fact just like you
said earlier so you build something and
then you have somebody come in and
trying pen test and then you get some
kind of a certification same year in the
year secure yeah um that feels wrong is
there any of that that's okay and I mean
so it's better than not doing it all
right i mean there's alternative just
don't do it but it's really this all
comes back to just go to other practice
anyways right this is the check the tack
about later is usually a function of a
lot of other things that happened before
it right somebody built a prototype very
quickly to get that cos about the door
what do they do they didn't delete it
and know the real thing they just kept
going right oh this works good enough
let's just get let's just keep using it
right this is just all goes back to poor
software development practices in
general right this has nothing to do
with security it's it's just the choices
we make right and eventually we make
enough choices and we get enough kind of
it the red that we'll have to just make
the choice to tack it on later so the
design is good design that's weighing
about this because it seems like you
know there's constantly evolving threats
in any area and makes you really more a
bit the second memory what is what is
the benefit of having
designing from fraud if you are going to
continuously have to have monitoring and
stuff like that sort he will deal with
them I don't I said oh really know
enough about that they would basically
know what the payoff really is similar
to secret so it's about being able just
ignore certain types of problems yeah
right when you build your login system
right understanding that you know the
way you stored passwords impacts
potential things in the future rights
choosing the right the right algorithm
to store passwords right knowing that a
simple patch is not good enough or by
text of course but you know that you
have to choose the right thing and you
and you make a conscious choice right
eventually there's an offline cracking
time right there's there's an ability
that something will uproot force this
more than maybe even up a worse you know
things like a theoretical timing attack
and decrypt things like that I'm just
kind of crazy but you know you choose
the algorithm you want and you also
choose the level of complexity level of
time the system is going to crunch on
something before it emits Davis ones and
that is direct and fortunate to how long
it will take to add a minimum to crack
that all right and so what you want to
do is to understand the value of an
account right user account is they know
its value at this amount of money right
so you want to make it about equal to
the amount of money and attacker would
have to spend to crack it and at that
point you're good right so if your
accounts for fifteen bucks and you know
you have a pretty slow or pretty pretty
quick cycle and the pending offline
packing time is you know a week your
brand reputation might suffer a little
more so maybe you don't think more about
that but it's not even accounts three
thousand dollars you know you might want
to have you know make sure it's at least
three four five six months of of time
for a single hatch to get to get through
that yeah it's kind of as it seems like
that's the direct cost when there's so
many other oh yeah there's reputation
some things which peripheral cost and it
seems that we suffer from the same thing
yeah make security that you do with like
Adam software design like nothing would
really assess the actual value of what
very very sure your answer the problem
is you really can't assess the impact of
bread damage until it happens right
that's the really tough part but you can
give a dollar x value to account what
you can do it will be stacked right we
know the numbers are not really they're
not really completely real but this
something working for you have to start
somewhere and it's all about data
metrics like the more information you
have the benefit is you can make and
that's that nothing your secured it has
just as I don't know what's up back in
general right so yeah nothing nothing
new here really it's just applying all
the stuff we already do is security yeah
so I'm thinking of two words that are
going to change the entire security game
sometime next 5 years can you guess what
those two words are it's a lot of words
quantum computing oh yeah sure um yeah
there's a lot of I'm uncertain about how
so yeah I mean the amount of power I
mean I didn't you know we've already the
US has invested in it you know the
military's invested in it you know yeah
it's a game-changer right the problem is
there actually is you know no joking
aside a lot of uncertainty around how
it's going to turn out you know what's
going to happen right there there's not
enough data yet to make a choice it's
going to make an impact right now the
cost is so high and a lot of it's locked
down I mean something could of course it
access to it and then start you know
running all my data through it but I
mean obviously my powers on candy it's
taking the you know the time to crunch
information way to weigh down right and
when I never did I've heard mentioned
that it might be the end of public
photography its rights awesomes right
you know there's huge impacts right and
I'm confident like just we had this
before somebody will find another way
right we were good at this this is what
we do as a species right we we have all
we learn we grow and have things get
better it's very possible that you know
this kind of thing doesn't I love you
crypto but that's speculation right
there's no reason to the bestest that
meteor right we can't we can't worry
about that right now I mean some people
have to there are there certain you know
so the people that really need to assure
secrecy right and those people you know
I'm sure are worried about this and
doing the right things but as you know
generic you know non-secret you know
business owners or members of a business
we have to function with the information
we have and basically good enough is
good enough which is son unfortunately
to say but Beth day today is about you
know making money in whatever business
domain worry not about security it's
very fine thing cos years and years ago
I like for the biasing of security I
read this book called on trusting trust
by ken Thompson it was like his ACM turn
word lunch I know it was the one about
the original c compiler right yeah yeah
see going and pointing you're basically
it was like this labyrinth of choices
you can make you one basically sort of
like in bed you know a way to going hack
into any system is kamagra see in flour
and then we know trace yeah we're
looking at things like well that just
means there's no security some stuff
yeah as is we're not done marina but not
look at just being like like a really
for my poor my perceptions of it and
then you know your slavery the universe
well you know it's just not about
everything basically it's a matter of
like
saying going and finding the appropriate
level of security for things but this
doesn't feel like the least among the
general public and you know many people
in tech there's this sense of like it's
minor this like a systems either secure
yeah and it's perception right all
action problem and I mean you know where
I could brain to you know a lot of what
we're doing is its credit card
attractions right now and so we have a
high level of risk and we take that very
seriously and it's crucial our business
right yeah but you know you have that
that varying stay right you know if your
startup but doesn't take credit card
numbers or really anything but
somebody's email address I mean you want
to report we should be careful with them
um but if that's what you're at the
whole information you have you know the
impact super level and you should worry
about it and yes there might be grand
damaged but is that a bigger obstacle
for you than getting to that first
release to get the money you need to
keep your business going yeah right so
there's a choice you have to make it
it's a very life thought but it's
essentially since we had like this son
an escalating war would you call that in
arms race yeah we're going to call this
stuff so we probably a situational
basically training better hacker some
hacking systems probably raising the bar
significantly on new entrants into a
business it's coming if you have a
website you're starting up you doing
various things you cannot simply before
all the security basically something
like Google or Amazon yeah and yeah i'm
surre of strange thing we're actually
functioning a lingual raster going and
cup scraping off the bottom and you know
it is it is fun it's an interesting
point to make because security has
become a pretty big spotlight recently
you know last couple years it's become
more and more important business is
going to really attached to it and
understand that it's it's vital to
business function yeah and the bar is
going up and up for staying sexy fright
as new tools come out
you know one of my favorite examples of
medically it's a wonderful tool security
research tool but of course be used for
you know their own things but it I can't
talk about this in Ruby confident
doesn't seven chakras had a point thick
root right you know you have some gooey
you say i want this server they don't
want to be this thing i want to be and
CE window back you hit the button and
backhoes it easy with all right it's
dangerous because it makes somebody with
no knowledge of this very capable mm-hmm
and you know the bar goes up and then
you have to you have to raise your bar
de to get back to it and you have to you
know you have to keep up now I'm just
like everything else we need right you
know around of technology we keep on
security and the things people don't you
know so as a result you just have like
this this this swath of you know
companies businesses so much that this
simply are not shark would be able to
reach that level security which is yeah
a really interesting problem it is a
problem I think that so the best part
about this like the best one about all
this it is not that hard to learn all
right the basic stuff is simple concepts
you know things we do with distributed
concurrency and all this stuff is way
more complicated than checking pump from
cross-site scripting right yeah like
this that you know you think of these
these these complexity problems need to
these these different things that we
tackle every day's programme yes right
that stuff is way more advanced than
most of the security things that you
learn is just the edge the basement
right yeah it would start thinking that
yeah it's just a matter of the offensive
mindset understanding how it works I'm
engine earning and so a lot of folks
will think that if they invest the time
and understanding currency that they'll
have a better job in reality if they
spent that all that time and energy into
just protecting against the OAuth Tom
tech hello right just the basics it's
actually allowed to pay off Walker
because at the end you know you can all
that another computer right you can't
always add you know another business
when you're
when your business without goes out
because somebody that's a strategy go
it's Jackie yeah let me know that's a
choice right again it's all about the
tricycle yeah any a resources that as a
beginner you said it's very easy pick up
are there resources that you go to
regularly that I should be looking um
you know it was a good resource they
prob was top ten every year which of the
top ten most you know exploited Becker's
in the web basically it's injection of
some sort and a bunch of those stuff but
always cross the scripting sequel
injection that kind of thing you know if
you're not into web security there are
there other resources you know a lot of
what we're doing a lot of what I'm doing
right now is it's web-based stuff all
right obviously the whole cryptography
stuff you know seen it's a different
thing right the crypto stuff will take
more time to get to get good at it
requires the bathtub is complicated I'm
not an expert I can apply it but I you
know the math behind it is not you know
my thing I do know some people that I'd
know it that pretty well let's do like
this it's pretty orthogonal yeah so I
just think how to apply to ography is
nice definitely invest the time and just
understanding how to apply what kind of
crypto in such situations super
important doesn't take that much to
understand their there's the web build
project it tells you how to attack site
it's just you're good at testing there
are several books out there the web
application hacker's handbook is a nice
kind of reinforcement on top ten and how
to attack there's a kind of a
complementary both the web I get you
defenders handbook which is the it's
actually a lot about modsecurity one of
the month that I think still leave them
on security project published that book
so it's a lot about setting up on
security how to defend your site's
setting up rules triggers that kind of
thing so it's kind of a nice you know
nice pair of books actually and it
actually comes from a series from a
little while back called the shell
coders handbook which was more about
some of the you know earlier deeper
exploits actually worth a go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
