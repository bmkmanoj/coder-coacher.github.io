introduction and okay oh good many of
you great well what I'm hoping to do is
really get in some of the depths of it
so not just the surface level stuff but
just show you what we've been doing with
my company I run a company called
industrial logic where we've kind of
become over time become a small global
company so we actually people all over
the world now helping companies you know
adopt lean and agile concepts and
principles and we ourselves make a
software product a an e-learning
software product that use that we use to
help teach people things like
test-driven development and other
practices and in creating that software
we actually tried to practice what we
preach we try to learn constantly and so
we apply a lot of these concepts to our
product development so it keeps us
honest and it certainly keeps us
learning and falling on her face and
getting back up so I'm going to show you
some the things that we've learned along
the way if you're interested in lean
startup moving on Twitter you know that
hashtag will will get you a load of
stuff it's very active so check it out
for me Lean Startup is basically a very
nice packaging of a lot of important
stuff there's really I would say some
things about it that are newish kind of
new but there are other things that it
just it just stands on the shoulders of
others okay so it really came out of
Eric Reese's failures and one thing I
love about the Lean Startup movement is
the people who are the core leaders of
it are very very upfront about their
failures they've had lots of failures
and a lot of those failures have finally
led them to see to find better ways it's
not a silver bullet of course it's not I
know people doing lean startup where the
businesses have failed they failed often
for complex reasons things they couldn't
see even though they were doing all
these experiments and all these pivots
and all this AV testing itself out
so it is not a silver bullet however I
think it can help you fail less and I
actually have found it to be helping us
be much more successful so I'm not a I'm
just a fanboy of things that I'm going
to talk show you tools that I like I'm
not trying to sell you anything I'm just
going to show you stuff that I find
useful so Lean Startup was funded the
the company that Eric Ries started years
ago called in view this sort of 3d
animated world which I've never
experienced I really should try it
sometime
but it was it was partially funded by a
guy named Steve Blank who Rose a
co-author of this book up here the
startup owners manual anyone here know
about that book the startup owners
manual it's a very very very good book
it's very thick it's very dense
if you're going to read one book this
year check that one out it's really
really good so that defines the customer
development approach and if you take
product developments and puts it put
alongside of it customer development
you've really got something powerful
we've always had product development and
software development and that critical
piece of customer development just
hasn't been there which is really trying
to understand what the heck does this
customer need and want and what are they
going to really use what are they going
to pay for so he's introduced an
absolutely critical thing to to our work
and Eric Ries basically adopted those
ideas study them when Steve was teaching
at Berkeley and Stanford and applied
them to his own startup with great
success so customer development is a
core part of the lean startup
Eric used extreme programming and in
view and is a big fan of extreme
programming so that of course was
blended into their process and in view
and certainly was influenced by the
poppin dicks and their lean development
books and a very peripheral part of lean
syrup is you know they actually use a
Kanban board there so Kanban was a
little piece of Lean Startup all right
so let's dive deeper Mitch Kapur the guy
that created created Lotus 1-2-3 had
that to say about the book ROI Bahat
president of a huge gaming company IGN
Entertainment said it's it's for
organizations of all sizes now this is
controversial there are some people in
Lean Startup where we'll say this is
really just for small cut for small
startups don't pollute it by trying to
bring it into big corporations it's just
not going to work corporations can't
handle this they're big they're bulky
they can't move quickly they can't pivot
so this is a little controversial but
here's a company called in to it which
is in the Fortune 100 or Fortune 50 I
think centerpiece of how teams work in
my company is an absolute core part of
how into it runs ok so there's an
example of a giant company that has done
it that said Intuit has always been an
extremely entrepreneurial company so
this is this is in their ballpark
alright not many other corporations we
work with are really as entrepreneurial
as an into it so it's still not
necessarily true that a big organization
can adopt Lean Startup what is it this
is my kind of definition that I threw
together based on lots of my studies and
reading a disciplined scientific and
capital efficient you'll hear me use
that term a lot capital efficient
because we waste a ton of time and money
all the time in the work we do so to
meet capital efficiency is really
important and the way you become capital
efficient is by being scientific and
being really disciplined about it
so it's this this scientific the this
discipline scientific and capital
efficient method for discovering and
building products that services that
people love that's the goal
ok let's tell a story need feed never
heard of them right you never heard of
need feed as a start-up there's hundreds
and hundreds of startups especially
where I live in Silicon Valley need feed
had a clever idea they said you know
people buy things on the internet and
there's this social media so why don't
we kind of bring the two together when
I'm buying something expensive I kind of
want to ask my social network hey you
know I'm buying a camera you've bought
cameras what did you buy it just made
sense it made sense not only for this
company but for two other companies in
Silicon Valley so three companies got
funded for this concept to bring buying
and social together one of those
companies need feed was a Lean Startup
so they follow the Lean Startup approach
they said you know the Farley and start
up the first I'm going to try to do is
invalidate our idea we just got millions
of dollars of investment capital for
this idea now let's try to invalidate it
how can we do that they went on to rent
a coder calm first thing they did lend
to coder calm and they paid a guy $40
u.s. to write a greasemonkey script the
greasemonkey script basically changed
Facebook
it changed Facebook to pretend to find
your friends and put fake news items
into your newsfeed it looked like this
so you'd come in to facebook login right
it would just have to be on one computer
because that was where the greasemonkey
script was running it didn't change all
of Facebook
greasemonkey can just change one browser
at a time okay so you come and you log
in and it's it's finding your friends
and putting fake news items about what
they bought into your newsfeed they had
50 people coming through they're coming
to their office they pay them 20 bucks
apiece 50 people walked in they said
what's your favorite social media
network they all said Facebook is fine
log into Facebook and tell us what do
you think of Facebook and they log in
they see these fake news items and
they'd say you know I used to love
Facebook it it was my friends we're
sharing poetry and pictures now I see
all this commerce stuff I mean
Facebook's going to hell I I don't like
this at all I'm so 47 out of 50 people
hated what they did here but they spent
almost nothing to actually do this
experiment to invalidate their idea they
spent almost nothing so they went back
to their venture capitalists and they
said look we have good news and bad news
the good news is we invalidated the idea
you funded us for so we didn't waste
your money the bad news is you know we
have to basically now start looking for
the next the next pivot the next
hypothesis and start testing that so do
you want to continue to work with us or
not they said yes so they kept going and
they kept pivoting until they found
something that actually work that
statistically and through all the
surveys and all of the work they did
with real people they said you know
says attraction and then they started
hiring and started moving quickly I love
the story because of the capital
efficiency of their invalidated
invalidated work in validating the ideas
so efficiently so capital efficiently
alright so in a start-up no facts exist
inside the building only opinions this
has to be a core fundamental idea in
your heart that you keep thinking we
have opinions here we have no facts
because every time you have that giant
backlog of prioritized items it really
is just a list of guesses most of the
time it's a bunch of guesses so don't
think you have any facts get outside of
the building is the rallying cry of
Steve Blank so take that now with what
lean talks about which is trying to see
waste and basically systematically
eliminate it this is what Toyota did to
see it and eliminate it okay
waste is everywhere we learned how to
deal with some wasted wasted product of
feature ideas let's say you have a
product and you want to build a new
feature you could build the feature and
spend a whole bunch of time and then
find out that no one uses it or you
could do one of many techniques this
one's called a feature fake I learned
this from Laura Klein she's a lean UX
expert so what we did was this we said
we think our we have an opinion we have
a guess that people are going to want to
do online chatting in our e-learning
system so when they're on a page
together they can all join a chat
instead of just talking through our
message threads they could just have a
live chat Wow it's an interesting idea
but it's just it's just an idea it's a
guess so let's put a feature fake up on
every single page we put this message 16
users from four countries are online
right now join the chat it was
completely fake we hacked it into the
HTML shoved it up there with continuous
deployment and it was live and we said
we're going to have a hundred people see
it and then we're just going to take it
down so 100 people saw it 22 of them
clicked on join the chat out of those we
gave them a little survey the survey
said you know the new group chat feature
may not may be available soon how likely
would you be to use it
likely neutral or likely and these were
the numbers we got so ultimately there
were six people out of a hundred who
ultimately said they'd they would use
this feature based on that information
we said let's not do this it's not
really compelling data okay now we since
that time we've said you know we
probably should have had more than 100
because the hundreds kind of small for
our sample size we should have gone to a
thousand that might have been a little
bit better in addition we didn't a B
test this we didn't have two different
messages you know it could have said
sixteen people from your country are
online right now and see what the
differences are we didn't do that either
so there's some there's some ways we
could have improved that the other thing
you may be thinking is my god if they
use this all the time they're going to
really annoy their users right how many
of you were thinking that many of you me
too when she first told me about this I
was like oh no no I that's going to be
bad now basically you only use this when
you need to use it occasionally it's one
of many tools in your tool chest and you
only and you put it up there very
quickly and take it down so it's not
going to bother people for a long time
it's just user research it's done
quickly and easily so that's a feature
fake feature fake saved us a whole bunch
of time right eliminating weight
systematically eliminating waste like
Toyota that's what it did now agile I'm
I'm going to trash agile a little bit in
this talk so just get used to that
but agile basically has this concept of
you know the work was accepted by some
sort of authority the product owner or
the customer in XP it was accepted and
so if you're a developer you want to get
the work accepted because if is accepted
it's like oh that's just it's wonderful
I got my points I can move on I'm a rock
star
except it means nothing no one see it
you've accepted that you built
someone's guess that's basically what
you did
someone's guess about something that's
important no users have rarely validated
anything
so in Lean Startup what they started to
do was have a validated column okay and
this is hard to do in fact the
interesting thing is I've been hanging
out with people who worked at IMVU so
I'm getting more the inside story lately
and they didn't do this all the time
because this is hard
this is hard to do but ultimately it
means that you validated that the work
you did was actually used by people that
they liked it that it it brought you
know the experience you were looking for
that for them to have into the product
right that's when you're really finished
because you validated that it actually
did something not that you finished it
according to and someone liked it inside
your company remember there are no facts
inside the building we did this we did
this with what feature a resume feature
in our e-learning we basically said in
fact we say this now for any feature we
build from now on we will have usage
metrics so we will know if people are
using it or not so when you log in to
our e-learning there's a simple little
resume button that shows what album you
were on and it'll take you right to
where you were not a big deal we didn't
we knew that we had to build this
because more than three or four clients
all wanted it so I was like fine there's
evidence we'll build it we didn't fake
it we knew we needed to build it but we
wanted to measure so the measurement
said you know 32% of people were
actually using it at that time that has
grown and grown and grown I've looked at
later is like forty four percent
recently all right that's a pretty good
statistic I know that people are using
my youth my resume feature I want this
for all my features I want to have
percentage use of percentages of usage
for every single feature I do so I could
even say you know rate us as an
organization for all the features we put
out what's the average percentage of
usage on our features what if we did
that for all product owners some of them
wouldn't do too well I think validated
learning learning validated via data
surveys and interviews or demonstrated
by positive improvements in the startups
core metrics right you have some core
metrics that you're shooting towards
again that's you know there's a vision
and it's typically guided by what you're
building some mission you're trying to
achieve something you have some metrics
behind all that we'll get to that what
those look like in a minute but you need
to be doing experiments to ultimately
get closer and closer towards those
goals so you're validating that all
right now Eric Ries himself struggled
with agile he tried agile and I
basically found that agile led him to
create fairly well crafted
software that no one wanted to use right
as judge said before now I think you
know his implementation of agile was a
little naive because I wouldn't I would
never have built 11 you know I am
network see they they he built all the
software to connect 11 different IM
networks you know instant messaging
networks that's a lot you know
normally I'd say well you just do one or
two and tested you know don't even an
agile it sound like agile has no concept
of being you know doing something
minimalistic and trying it
it's just that lean start goes a lot
further so I thought you know this was
when I first read this in his book I
said you know you're kind of missed what
agile was he said well tell me where it
said in any of the agile literature tell
me where it said only build one I am
Network now I had grown I've been doing
this stuff since the late 90s and I just
we know we know to do that right but it
didn't it's hard to find somewhere it
says that it is actually hard to find it
so it was too implicit in the agile
literature this this concept of you know
do do one little thing and test people
just built whatever they want guessing
that people would want to use it they
were wrong we had something fairly
embarrassing having us we basically had
a gigantic sale of are you learning to
one of our biggest customers we were
really happy it was a particularly
timely because it was during the
recession so we were just sitting pretty
in the recession and we prided ourselves
on giving incredibly good customer
service like you know on are you
learning system you can ask a question
and we would immediately reply we had a
few people internally at that company
that wanted changes to some content
occasionally we'd make it immediately
incredibly good customer service but we
weren't doing something just now I look
I think of it now it's completely basic
we weren't looking at their usage they
were buying box sets of albums for
students and gosh almost 80% of those
albums were never touched the green are
the ones that were finished and the the
15% are ones that were started albums
that were started but not finished those
are not that's shelf where that's shelf
er I never want to be in the business of
selling shelf where but we were not
paying sufficient attention to usage
um okay we needed to improve no so when
I started reading Lean Startup stuff
around 2008 or 9 I was like this is
really talking about this important
thing that we were missing here
so what Eric says is that a start-up is
a human institution designed to create a
new product or service under conditions
of extreme uncertainty now we were
extreme programmers we interpreted this
we didn't think about this our version
of it was this so it was not true that
was under conditions of extreme
programming that was that that's a great
joke that just completely fell flat so I
will not use that one again
happiness we we've learned that we have
to focus on ecosystem happiness not just
users what if someone in a giant
corporation buys our e-learning and it
turns out to be shelf where they're the
buyer they're never going to ever use
our software no matter how good we make
the user experience they're not going to
use it we got to make them happy too we
got to make a whole bunch of people
happy in the ecosystem so the basic
formula we do now all the time is this
hypothesis experimentation loop with
this mad scientist doing the a/b testing
and all kinds of crazy experiments as
fast as possible and if we somehow
manage to get past all that to something
that we prove should be built then we'll
plan it the agile way build it the agile
way and hopefully measure for more
happiness now I don't want to be like
this zealot like this is all this is the
only way we work now that's not true
we'll have a client say I'd like one
more column on this report please put
that there we say fine we'll just do it
I mean there's nothing there's nothing
to talk about is no experimentation to
do so you don't have to go crazy with
this stuff it you don't use it for
everything we do continuous deployment
was one of the first things we brought
we brought in as one of our practices of
Lean Startup this must be about three
years now that we're doing this and we
absolutely love it so it did really Lean
Startup one of the first things I
learned about Lean Startup was
continuous deployment Kent Beck sent me
an email saying you gotta go see this
video about continuous deployment and it
was just phenomenal they were deploying
50 times a day
at imbue with incredible abilities to
roll back and do all this stuff
that was my first inclination that lean
startup was had basically taken the knob
of agile and turned it up turned it up
to 11
it was just startling that we've been
doing CI continuous integration for so
many years and hadn't really moved to CD
continuous deployment or continuous
delivery as Jen's calls did so we
started looking at a lot of things to
deal with our low usage rates at least
at that big giant client we started to
categorize our users there were the
non-starters people that never even
signed our EULA it's like great your
company bought you something and you
don't even bother to even look at it the
skimmers the people would just skim a
little bit the dabblers they would
dabble in like maybe one album but never
really go further on the connectors the
people that actually were doing the
content and connecting with others
through our message boards and then the
finish
you know when you start to sort of
observe the data of these different
kinds of users to try to figure out
what's going on you know how do we get
all these folks down the funnel we
looked at our response time to two
questions we always said we had great
customer service great responsiveness
but we weren't statistical about it we
didn't look at data right it was just a
feeling and it was mostly right you know
within we promised 48-hour delivery two
questions five hours for the refactoring
was average six hours for code smells Oh
50 hours for micro testing Wow the
average is 50 hours for micro testing 50
hours respond to a student's question
interesting one of the big shifts that
happen to us as we moved from agile to
Lean Startup was we started looking at
lots of statistics lots of data
this whole presentations filled with
that stuff because that's in our nature
now we're constantly looking at numbers
big difference from agile we would
analyze pageviews we would look at what
happened during the launch of the
e-learning with a new client what
happened during training what happened
when we did a webinar and the second
webinar and onwards what happens here
what happens when we do mail campaigns
and send stuff out to the students
studying studying studying all the data
usage improvements have been there we've
seen them steadily
Clym for every one of our clients we've
been tracking it closely looking at you
know the improvements of our completion
rates started rates and trying to drop
you know the the not started rates this
is one customer they've rolled this out
globally and they're up to 61% and
actually that's an old number
that's the sliding is little updating
but it's getting a lot better because
all these experiments that we're trying
with our customers so Shaun Ellis said
basically this in an early stage startup
success is not in a to-do list it's in a
to learn list what do we need to learn
and I think it's not just early-stage
startups I think this applies to a lot
of the projects we do a lot of the work
we do it's actually what do we need to
learn and how can we do it as rapidly as
possible not the giant backlog and enter
in one of these wonderful new tools okay
there's all kinds of tools out there for
planning agile projects there's all
kinds of ones right this is a tool which
comes straight out of the lean startup
world I really like it it's refreshing
ly different
it's called lean launch lab okay lean
launch lab and it basically has a little
very simplistic I'll just jump to this
it's kind of a simple Kanban right
you've got your to-do you're in progress
and you're done
but everything you enter in is all about
hypotheses and tracking them
so the to-do must contain you know your
hypothesis what experiments you want to
prove or disprove any metrics associated
with that and some tasks you need to do
right it's very hyper focus that this is
a hypothesis a Steve Blank says he uses
the term hypothesis at Stanford and at
Berkeley when he teaches because people
have paid a lot of money to the come to
those institutions and he needs to use
big words like hypothesis when he's not
there he uses the normal word which is
guess so essentially this is a guess
enter your guess is to have a lovely
enter your guess because you know this
is just a guess
it's not really salt there's no solid
evidence for the most part right our
resume feature you know
of evidence that people wanted it it
wasn't necessarily a difficult guess it
was something that we're pretty sure
they'd use but for the most part there
are lots of things that we have no idea
about and we need to treat them as such
so it not only walks you through this
process it also helps you deal with the
lean canvas we'll get to that in a
minute but this tool made it super super
simple to fill out that lean canvas it
just walked you through a question at a
time
in the customer development process
you're really trying to move from
customer discovery to customer
validation and then onwards into the
growth of your business
building the actual really really
building the business so if you get past
this line right here you know you've got
your product market fit that golden
phrase and if you say do it if you have
to ask are we there yet have we achieved
product market fit you haven't you'll
know it when you achieve it going from
customer discovery to customer
validation is painful and it often
doesn't work you have to go right back
to customer discovery through the the
pivot concept and I'll explain what
pivot means at a moment but this is
basically the search for a business
you're searching for a business here you
really don't know what to build think of
need feet need feet tried something that
completely invalidated it they had to
then search for the actual business so a
pivot is a special kind of change
designed to test a new fundamental guess
about the product business model or
engine of growth you're basically
constantly focused on what product my
building what are the metrics around it
what's my engine of growth and how can I
test that how can I really my it so this
is the famous New Yorker cartoon
and a catalogue of pivots a zoom in
pivot what's a zoom in pivot say you
have your new feature your new startup
product has 20 features in it turns out
your customers really only like three of
the features jettison all the others and
zoom into those three and make that your
product build on that zoom in zoom out
the opposite they're using three but
they don't like it they need more they
need more stuff they're not going to
really go whole hog if they don't have
more zoom out customer segments pivot
there's a chain of well let me start
this fight there was a husband-and-wife
that ran a little antique store right
antique furniture and it was a
mom-and-pop literally store antiques
people would come and buy but the wife
decided one day to start making some
sandwiches to feed people because you
know they'd be in there for a while and
they want to get there hungry so she
made these roast beef sandwiches people
loved them
in fact they started lining up out the
door to get the roast beef sandwiches
finally they realized one day you know
maybe we should just sell the roast beef
sandwiches and get rid of the all the
antiques now they have a whole chain of
restaurants all across the United States
for their roast beef sandwiches so
that's a customer segment pivot we've
changed who our customer is customer
need pivot is you know basically
actually you know I might have gotten
that wrong the customer need pivot is
one I just described sorry the customer
segment pivot is you're just going from
a different segment I might go from my
consumers to a business you know b2b b2c
to b2b or something like that platform
pivot you've just completely changed
platforms you know IMVU did a very very
critical platform pivot they moved from
one technology to another and it made a
huge difference in their bottom line it
made an absolute huge difference in
their engine of growth phenomenal so I
won't get too deep into voters in Jed's
talked about that if you were in the
last talk with voters in as a start-up
in San Francisco that basically went
through all kinds of pivoting to arrive
at something that was scaleable and you
know and basically an MVP I'm an MVP
that got to product market fit and is
now trying to grow
so the interesting thing is that kinds
of pivots they did they started out with
their initial product which took about
eight months to build
they found that failed miserably they
zoomed in did a zoom in pivot which then
took about four months and that also
failed then they said you know what
we're going to switch to cock we're
going to switch to corporations forget
people you know just working with
individuals that's not working let's go
to corporations they got some excellent
evidence that corporations were going to
pay a lot of money to use their software
turned out wasn't right but they'd only
done spend about two months on that so
finally they did a platform pivot and
that was their fourth MVP Minimum Viable
Product it was actually a success they
started to see the kinds of return the
kinds of numbers that they were
expecting to see okay this is the big
deal here it's not MVP MVP is a simple
concept of some extent Minimum Viable
Product everyone talks about MVP they
pick up the MVP concept and they run
with it
they forget one critical thing you can't
really do well with MVP if you don't do
innovation accounting innovation
accounting is where you're accounting
for is my MVP any good what metrics are
telling me that my Minimum Viable
Product is actually good so vote esand
did a marvelous job of tracking their
numbers of doing innovation accounting
right so basically they saw some
evidence in pivot for that they were
really moving in the right direction
okay all right so the pirate metrics are
metrics are the activation basically
users coming to your product or to your
site activation they're starting to
actually use the proctor site retention
they keep coming back they don't just
use it once they keep coming back
referral often called the Net Promoter
Score right you ask people all you know
on a scale of you know one to ten how
would you know likely would it be for
you to tell friends and family about
this and you should be getting numbers
up there you know in the eights and
nines and so forth that's referral and
then revenue are you actually gaining
revenue out of all this so that's pirate
metrics
very nice way to you know measure
whether you're getting where you want to
be okay it's just one set of metrics
there's all kinds of others you could be
looking at but this is a popular set
Intuit has their own Intuit they call
them the love metrics delivered customer
benefit have we delivered customer
benefit have we are our customers
actively using it right and also are
they telling others about it so that is
how how Intuit grades themselves they
also follow the - pizza team rule the
teams are no bigger than you can feed
with two pizzas so that's um I was just
actually in Italy I show this to them
and they're like that doesn't look like
great Italian pizza I'm like you're
right it's American some trashy American
we've reached out to the monkeys for
help
in becoming more and more lean and an
adopting lean startup who are the
monkeys the monkeys are MailChimp Survey
Monkey and a company called angry
monkeys and I'll show you what we've
done so first of all split or AV testing
is a very common thing that's that's
done in Lean Startup you try two
different versions of something usually
at the same time and get data on them to
see which one's better some some of my
friends call it champion and contender
like a boxing match you have the
champion and then there's a new
contender comes along and you see if
that contender can win so you might put
a little bit of traffic towards the
contender while the champion is getting
most of the traffic that's one way
there's a variety ways to do a be
testing but it is a wonderful way to
rapidly get some data into it basically
said we stopped arguing with each other
it used to be that you'd shell to a
boardroom everyone would have their
beautiful PowerPoint slides and the best
speaker with the best PowerPoint slides
would win the argument now they just put
a whole bunch of experiments into the
product and collect real data and then
make decisions on real data and there's
very little fighting now it's a
wonderful change we tried this we
started sending emails to our customers
are you learning customers we'd say
let's see what happens if we treat one
set of people as VIPs you know
very important persons and the other is
just regular people set the exact same
email except for one difference in the
power one paragraph difference the
paragraph difference was hey by the way
I'm going to be your personal VIP for
your e-learning and I'm going to help
you each and every week to make sure you
get through stuff isn't that great
let's get started send me an email
here's my email address just to see what
would happen to trap the opens and the
click throughs and all that other stuff
we'd never used to do this before we
actually used to just send emails via
our email program and we didn't track
anything we didn't track open rates we
didn't track click rates right as I said
we've become more and more and more
statistical this was fascinating because
we had crappy open and click rates look
at this for 203 opens 1 this led us is
to call the guy that bought the stuff
from us the the the buyer and say what's
happening here we sent this out to like
50 people and barely anyone opened it oh
we're doing a release right now it's a
giant release that's going out like ok
why did you buy this now and roll this
out now during your release but I didn't
say that I was just like it was a mental
notes like oh I'm learning more about my
customer they're crazy
so this was very interesting because we
we did get you know some very
interesting exchanges one guy in
particular sent a nice email to us these
course are huge out for me I switched
into coding from audio production so
anything that covers gaps my knowledge
is great and we tracked this guy he was
going through every single album doing
every exercise uploading things getting
stuff he was awesome so he sent his
email at first I just thought oh this is
nice let me forward this on to the team
but then I stopped in my tracks I was
like wait a second
he's brand-new to programming and I had
no idea of that there's nothing I'm
capturing about him that says that I
would tell me he's brand new to
programming I don't even I don't capture
that data I don't in fact I own capture
with your male or female when you enter
my system I couldn't tell the difference
there I don't know I don't know so much
about mice my own customers because
we've been so you know we've been to
lean in some sense and now we're
learning to be a little less lean a
little more you know let's gather as
much data and learn
much about our customer so this was a
little bit of a mind shift for me we
started after this collecting lots and
lots more data about our customers so
one of the things we started collecting
was usability data we said you know one
thing we do know is that people struggle
with our navigation a little bit and
lean UX people say you got to constantly
be doing lean UX testing constant
constant testing of your UI to see if
it's actually working well so I said
let's make a little survey here I said
where would you click to go to page 8
you're on this page of our e-learning
and all I did was take a little snapshot
of a photo a little snapshot of a page
threw it on the click test right it's
made by the angry monkeys it's called
the click test and you can just put a
question and put an image so my question
was where would you click if you want to
go to page 8 there's a little
information display here called which
says that you're on page 4 just for
information display and you're supposed
to actually click over here to get there
the fastest because that's the next
track button and actually brings up well
it's complicated but here's what they
did
most of them clicked on this next page
button which they'd have to click four
times to get there that's the wrong
button
statistically 88% clicked in the wrong
area I said fine fine you know what I'm
going to do another experiment just took
all of like that's up like 10 minutes
how about I said the question was no
good page four to page eight how about
you're on page 20 and you want to go to
page 40 that's a big jump I put a new a
new test up there by the way do you
notice anything different yeah well I
took some I took some button how do you
think I took the buttons away by the way
Photoshop correct Photoshop I simply
just erased them in fact there's a
little trace of one like right there's
part of the button and I put the word
contents there to make it really clear
if you want to jump for 20 pages just
click on the contents link and you'll go
there made sense see what they did
82% clicked in the wrong area now this
is interesting cause I had no idea that
they would actually be clicking on this
it's an information display about where
you are okay
I know what's wrong I know it's wrong
same sort of question this time I made
it huge orange you know that's just I'm
in pain shop why not why not just make
it like I could have made it flashing
but I didn't go that far and sure enough
it was same thing so I said fine I've
seen enough another question and I just
I just look how ugly this looks I mean
I'm not a graphic artist but it's one of
those things and you know I got we got
the numbers right so I was 77 percent
now ironically you know you might look
at this and go okay so then they
implemented that right no we didn't
implement that you know why because the
previous design before we had those four
buttons was this see it there it is we
already did this we did this a long time
ago it was also not good not good it
didn't work well people were confused by
it all the time they didn't know what to
do so we know that that doesn't work
either so I said fine I'm going to Laura
Klein or lean UX expert let her do some
magic let her do some testing and she
basically went into her balsamiq started
making some sketches went to a cafe in
Silicon Valley started talking and
having programmers go through it and
came up with this and this is the new
design which you know she has said
tested extremely well when she wants it
she had various screens this is just one
of many screens but this is the new
design that we will be implementing so
again all I'm trying to show you is lots
of experimentation to lead to find out
where we really need to go at all levels
of the product um okay that's that
conquer and set based design anyone know
about that from lean conquer and set
based design it's not something I see so
much in lean startup but it's certainly
one of the lean concepts that we apply a
lot so there might be three different
versions you might have Kim Bob and Jim
all doing something in the exact same
time the same exact thing they're all
doing the same trying to accomplish the
same task and at the end you say you
know what we really like this part
Kim's work and this is great about Bob
here and these things from Jimmy great
let's bring all that together in our
solution it's wonderful stuff we did
this on our website we we did 99designs
calm everyone ever hear that it's
basically you launch a contest we
launched a contest for the homepage of
industrial logic and basically said you
know here's what we want here are sites
we like here's stuff we don't want and
so forth you give some background for
what you're looking for and all of a
sudden you have a contest and we had
about twenty two designers worldwide
join the contest and we had over 60
entries and they went through a series
of you know qualification rounds all the
way up to the finalists like a real
contest
um all of a sudden we ended up with a
without did this just died okay so all
of a sudden we ended up with a ton of
great designs that we can choose from
and we liked for example we like this
guy had a great header we loved the
header that he did someone else had a
very nice footer that we liked I forget
where it was this guy had a great map
down here that we thought was excellent
so we took all these different pieces
and put them together in our final
design but there were many many many
entries and it just it was it was so
inexpensive is unbelievable so here's
another example of you know capital
efficient work because it cost nothing
and it happened to like a we have done
that was a final design heat screw a
heat click and scroll mapping we love
this as well if you have if you're if
you're doing stuff on the web you can
test you can test in all kinds of
wonderful ways so we are experimenting
with selling a new album right this
album does not exist it's called
test-driving embedded see it's going to
be an album version of a book that James
Brennan wrote okay we have a multimedia
album but we don't want to build it we
don't want to spend any money on it we
don't want to do anything until we
validate there's enough interest in it
so we may have this landing page it's
just a landing page the product doesn't
exist you can buy it you can pre-order
it now at Half Price
and then let's let's get some analytics
going here let's get some let's get some
some mapping happen so we can see where
people are clicking through crazy egg
shows us where they really happen to be
clicking notice there aren't too many
clicks here we can see who our returning
users or new users and where they click
we can see where they're scrolling right
where are they scrolling because it's a
fairly long page we can see do they
scroll to the bottom of the page or not
it turns out this one they mostly stay
in that first section they don't scroll
down too much so anyway I've just shown
you a whole bunch of different tools
that we use and they're they're not that
hard to find but all of these tools are
helping us to measure are we actually
building the right thing are we building
something that or should we build it
first of all and if we did build it how
can we refine it to make it better and
better better
so to summarize um agile versus lean
startup on some areas we build upon what
agile has you just build upon you cannot
do continuous deployment without
continuous integration so you're
building the punk in other areas it's
just a substitution product roadmaps are
tricky if everything is a guess if you
have too many guesses your time spent
building a product roadmap is probably a
lot of waste
so think about maybe just focusing on
looking at what's called the business
model canvas I didn't have time to get
deeply into that but it looks at the
bigger picture of what you're trying to
achieve with your MVP product vision I
think you still need a product vision
and you'll build on that you have to
build on the vision but you want to see
am I getting to that vision is that
vision even realistic by seeing can I
get to product market fit so you can't
get the product market fit your vision
is wrong something's off release
planning release fighting I still use it
I still love it but I'm mostly focusing
on creating that Minimum Viable Product
so I'm not going to spend much time
doing release planning unless it's
targeted at the MVP it's friends you can
still work in sprints no problem at all
but really the main focus for us is lean
learn measure build what do I need to
learn what what hypothesis do I have how
am I going to measure whether it's
successful or not and then
we build it and see if I can you know
get the results I want so this is the
cycle we're focused on the most you
don't even really do fixed line sprints
we haven't done in the 2007 so you can
either build on this or not
on-site customer on-site customer is a
great idea but in Lean Startup it's get
out of the building right it's that
there are no fats in the building you
got to get out right this is where
Toyota sends a guy to California to live
with a family for two weeks and go in
their vehicle for all two weeks so this
Toyota engineer is living and breathing
with a family he's very far outside of
Japan outside of the building on the
inside of a car but learning learning
learning about the customer user stories
well yes but that's still kind of
thinking that we know what we're
building versus hypotheses or guesses
backlogs my god there's gonna be so much
waste in the backlog grooming and the
backlog estimation and all this work I
really really don't like this too much
I'd much rather have a to learn list
that's short here's what I want to learn
now cost of her feedback it's wonderful
we've got we love customer feedback we'd
love to get that feedback but we're
alternately focused on validating actual
metrics okay seeing if we're getting the
kinds of things I'm looking for kinds of
data we want to see acceptance tests are
wonderful we still build upon them but
the split testing is something that we
find is even more valuable right now
just seeing if we're which way to go on
features or whether to build them at all
continuous integration we build on it
with continuous deployment velocity
burned out etc all this junk my god I
can't stand it I'm writing a blog about
this it's coming out soon aar are are
the are metrics or pirate metrics are
wonderful for you know having some
innovation accounting agile versus Lean
Startup here to finalize we have
retrospectives still very important I
think I mean you have to do this in such
a way that it's having meaningful
results if it's not then it is waste the
five whys in lean which is something
Lean Startup uses as well very very
wonderful for getting to the root cause
of problems really getting into the root
cause and that's where you know remember
I said it was
discipline capital efficient method
there's a lot of discipline in doing
this in doing this regularly having
problems and doing the five why's you
can read about this in any of the
welcome read Greece's book you'll learn
about it
velocity tracking you know it's it's
really just a big I think it's a waste
of time
innovation accounting is really where
it's out you're focused on am I getting
the kinds of core changes the things I
want to see users doing my product is
that is that there or not and
unfortunately I can say agile you know
to me has been led by some consultants
where whereas I see Lean Startup being
led by successful entrepreneurs I mean
there's a huge difference in business
acumen of people the lean startup world
to I mean I'm an I'm an agile consultant
I'm in this phase here right I'd rather
be on this one but um you know I have to
respect these guys who have gone through
these kinds of you know Steve Blank and
his bio he says he's cratered a few few
companies cratered you know a crater
he's cratered a few companies and he's
had tremendous success with a few
companies so they're very honest about
the kinds of the learnings they've had
and that is mostly my talk thanks
we have two minutes for questions yes
you would sound of talking about
assuming out how do you know when you
can still know how do you know when to
zoom out is the question you basically
it's not all data right you can't just
be looking at data you have to be
talking to people you have to be showing
your product to people usually that's
the kind of thing where you would get
enough people saying you know I would
use it if it did this or if it did that
and that's that's the truth right there
you got to eat out of walk you know zoom
out it really don't forget we have been
talking a lot about data here and
tracking things but there's the human
side to you've got to be having people
using your product and watching them use
it all that human stuff is extremely
important to they're both important
other questions yep do you think you can
get two Lean Startup and passing through
the edge on stage can you get any coming
of age can you get to Lean Startup
without passing through the agile state
I think ma I would say absolutely yes
because most people that adopt agile or
or anything are not very good at it
start out with right so might as well
start out and not be very good at Lean
Startup then not be very good at advil
right because Lean Startup is focused on
why to build it I mean I think that's a
topic that Gaby's going to be talking
about why build it in the first place or
should you build it in the first place
uh and learn really faster than that
agile you'll you'll cripple yourself
with Lean Startup if you start building
a product successfully and you don't use
a lot of the agile you know concepts
especially TDD and refactoring all those
great engineering practices so but
isolates more important to go that
direction yes I would say go straight
into Lean Startup thank grow out of time
so thanks thanks are in order
