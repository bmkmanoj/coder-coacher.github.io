this is soon I promise
as Brian introduced me I'm Suze Hinton
my username on github and Twitter and a
lot of other places is new cat it stands
for no up cat so a lazy cat anyway I
thought it was funny I'm a front-end dev
at Kickstarter so that's sort of what I
do during the day but I'm gonna talk to
you more about what I do not for my job
I'm a member of the no Deus hardware
working group so I help try to create
better tooling for anyone who knows ASO
JavaScript developers and want to start
playing with robots I'm also a member of
the Ember accessibility project team I
believe that front-end frameworks can do
a better job of being helping people
create accessible apps out of the box so
I'm very passionate about that too so
why are we here what the main thing that
I'm going to be talking to you about is
data and art and how they can come
together but also about making a mess
and why it's really important to do that
and there's if you've seen any of my
talks before I don't need to put this
warning but for those who haven't seen
my talk there's always a lot of feelings
in it so we'll just brace for that so I
want to tell you a story first that you
can sort of see how this journey began
for me with some of the experiments that
I'm going to show you today it was 1994
and I was reading through this book with
rather enthusiasm and this was the book
and you're probably thinking 1994 is a
bit late to be reading a book like this
but that was my first computer and so I
was a child that liked drawing and when
I heard about these things called
computers the first thing I wanted to do
was draw on the computer as well and
drawing on a Commodore 64 involved
reading this book and like poking
certain registers to get stuff to show
up so sort of fell in love with computer
programming more from the art
perspective which is maybe the less
traditional route and so I sort of was
this this nine-year-old like littlest
artist trying to find my way in
going from using crayons to actually
creating things with I guess pixels and
then I grew up and I became a
professional programmer and my focus
went from play and experimentation to
syntax readability working with other
programmers and like really really
important stuff that matters when you
work as part of a team and you work at a
professional company and I care very
deeply about all of those things so at
work I was on writing really elegant
easy to recode I mentor juniors I write
really helpful and constructive feedback
on pull requests etc etc so it's
something I care about a lot but in my
personal time I sort of try to do things
that are outside of that and that's the
message that I want to convey today that
sometimes it's important to sort of
break out of that stuff and so after
growing up I still sort of did this
stuff in my spare time so this is an
image of some JavaScript library that I
wrote code Olli DJ yes and what Olli DJ
s does is it essentially creates and
abstracts a driver so that you can put
messages pitches texts anything you like
really on this LED screen here if you
have it plugged into an Arduino and I
really like cats in case you haven't
noticed already so that's going to be a
recurring theme through this whole talk
and so I have a lot of fun still trying
to enable people to create art but also
just reminding myself that odd is where
my roots started in programming so I
still think of myself as this accidental
programmer because I didn't go through
college and I sort of have I feel like
I'm this double agent that leads a
double life so you know I don't really
care about semicolons whether you use
them or you don't you know whether you
put two on the end or not it just that
sort of stuff doesn't really matter to
me outside of my professional life so to
give you an idea of the the sort of
imagination that that I have I'm gonna
tell you a story within a story so who's
read this book here a couple of you yeah
this is contact by Carl Sagan this is
Carl Sagan this this is a very apt
description of him if you haven't seen
any of his documentaries already on any
books I highly recommend it a friend of
a friend of mine gave this to me a while
ago and said I think you will really
like this book and he was right the main
character in the book is dr. Ellie
Arroway and she works for SETI and she's
looking for extraterrestrial life and
she grows up to be a radio astronomer
and she has sort of she reminds me a lot
of me so this is a book that I can I can
really relate to and Ellie Arroway
actually does find extraterrestrial
signals beaming back to earth and her
entire life has turned upside down as
she tries to make sense of this she
tries to lead a team to decipher the
message and it takes her texture all
across America and she finds herself in
New York attending all of these really
important meetings and she'd never been
to New York before and when I read this
book I was living in Australia and the
way she described in New York really
captured my imagination and she talked
about taking trains to all of these
really important meetings she was going
to and she rejected having chauffeurs
and things like that and I think that's
really awesome and while on these
meetings she was her brain was so wired
to be deciphering messages and
deciphering and data in in the real
world that she started listening to the
the noises that the train was making in
the subway and she ended up missing
meetings because she kept trying to stay
on the trains she was convinced that
there were secret messages everywhere
and so when I came to New York I thought
of her and you know I live there now and
I've fallen in love with the subway for
like very similar reasons and sometimes
I'm disappointed when I reached my
station because I'd rather stay on the
train then go to the social engagement
that I'm going to and so these are just
some images for those who haven't seen
the trains or what the subway looks like
it's this whole other world underground
and really does capture my imagination
in a very romantic way and Ellie Arroway
is told by numerous people in the book
and in her lifetime that she's too
romantic about things so I really like
that about her so she kept thinking that
she could hear these messages and but I
realized that there's a difference
between Ellie Arroway or me when it
comes to deciphering these messages and
that is that dr. Arroway didn't have
JavaScript so I thought okay I know
JavaScript and I'm like a lot of other
JavaScript developers I just try and do
everything in JavaScript I think that's
something really fun and I'm really
looking forward to Matt's talk later
this afternoon which is all about just
doing stuff in JavaScript because you
can really great whole class all right
and so I thought okay if I use
JavaScript like what can I make these
sounds that Elliott Aero a was hearing
how can I visualize them and and how can
I sort of try to make up something that
doesn't exist in the sound but but it's
meaningful still so we can find out via
art and we can actually use the Web
Audio API so we can do all of this in
the browser so I promised that I would
explain what this is so we'll go over
this really quickly the formulaic
spectrum is essentially if you imagine
like working with data and you have this
kind of like line and you've got data
integrity on one side and data
corruption on the other right so in a
lot of in a lot of circumstances it's
really important to remain sort of one
on one with the data or to be very
accurate and how you represent that data
so that you don't mislead people right
so I'm thinking about graphs on some of
the famous graphs on the New York Times
website the way that Bloomberg like
shows their data and then if you don't
stick with the data and you start
dropping it out or corrupting it or just
messing with all the numbers then you
get corruption down the line and so it's
really important to stay like loyal to
the data right we're not really because
when you're creating art it doesn't
matter like that sort of stuff doesn't
matter so I'm going to show you an
example of like one-to-one data and art
and then just like completely subversive
it on the other end so we've got two
examples so most of the stuff is
probably going to be around this
position there so we're gonna have some
fun so analyzing PCM data who's actually
played with the Web Audio API before
yeah it's super fun and I was talking
with someone recently about this it's
the most in-depth API in the browser I
feel that I've ever seen like it just
has so much rich things that you can do
with it
including analyzing live audio but what
I wanted to do was sort of like secretly
record sounds in the subway and then
like analyze them after the fact so this
isn't live analysis and the way you can
do that in the Web Audio API is by
analyzing the PCM data of let's say a
WAV file or or an uncompressed file so
PCM stands for pulse code modulation
it's just the raw uncompressed audio
data so it's not like mp3 format or
anything like that it actually is just
just the pure data the samples so each
value in the file other than of course
the the header at the beginning the
samples range from negative one to
positive one and how many samples in the
file depends on obviously the sample
rate and the bit depth and so some
common PCM format of file extensions at
Wave AFA udl 16mp cm and this is a
wikipedia SVG that did not scale very
well you can see how off those dots are
but this sort of gives you a
representation of if you're trying to
sample analog data and then put it into
digital format you have to have these
algorithms that determine like how often
those samples happen and then you can
map that through so so it's those actual
samples that we're dealing with today so
there's a lot of sounds on the subway
that people hate and I know that a lot
of people don't like the subway either
and I really loved it so I'm trying to
create something really beautiful out of
something that a lot of people either
dislike heavily or just come to ignore
so the sample file that we'll be working
with today is this one stand clear of
the closing doors please
ding-dong at the NS so obnoxious ok so
just think about that there's some
there's some speech at the beginning and
then there's a dingdong at the end I'll
play it just one more time to stand
clear of the closing doors please
okay definitely etched in people's
memories so what if we took this down
and we mapped one pixel her data points
so you know for each value that was
negative one to one we we assigned a
pixel to that and then what if we just
change that range and mapped it to be
zero to 255 instead because negative one
to positive one is kind of a weird range
to work with when we're talking about
things like colors or any kind of value
in JavaScript and then what if the new
value so the value from 2 to 0 to 255
effected what the hue value of the pixel
was so we can kind of alter color
depending on what the value of that of
each sample is and there's a lot of
samples in just that one wave file so
let's have a look at how that comes
together when we use canvas to put one
pixel per sample but before we do that I
wanted to show how short or like how
much code you have to do in order to get
that going and it's I think 13 lines
here that's how easy it is this are
creating art in the browser and to start
using the Web Audio API so definitely
have a look at this code sample in my
slides after the talk but the main point
you need to know is to create art
digitally a lot of the time you're just
running for loops and you're just
manipulating something and then you're
just like calling refresh on the page to
do that so you can see here that what
we're analyzing our data we're assigning
a hue to it we're manipulating our image
data object in canvas if you've used
that before and then we simply just once
we've got all the new sample values we
put those pixels onto the canvas so it
looks something like this and the
contrast is letting a sound a bit on the
screen but you can essentially see that
it's not just all uniform that it has
actually analyzed all of the different
sound bytes and if if you can see
closely enough you might actually be
able to make out certain parts of the
sound that you might remember so you can
see at the top there you can make out
the individual words and the pauses in
between the words of the speaker so you
can actually see stand clear of the
closing doors and any pauses just a
little bit more and then the please
right at the bottom here then you can
see the white noise of just you know
just and
noise while they're pausing and then
this really super bright rainbow bit
here is the ding-dong and I just love
that that turned up so obnoxiously as
well so I feel like this is you know a
pretty accurate visual representation of
the data and for people who for people
who have a deaf like this is a great way
of describing like in a different sense
like how sound is interpreted which i
think is really cool the only problem is
what you just saw there was 300 thousand
pixels there's probably better ways to
code what I put together
because when you console.log out the
value of every single loop you will
crash your browser so I was just trying
to verify that you know is having some
sensible pixels being put on and that's
really not a good idea so that's an
overwhelming amount of stuff to to sort
of deal with and again it's still on a
production level like professional
setting so you can actually start taking
these things apart and doing things with
them
so let's reduce it and let's go more
towards their corruption end of the
formulaic spectrum what if we tried to
take audio analyze it and then create
completely new audio from it what if we
try to make a song and you can already
imagine this is a terrible idea because
how do you let a machine make a song and
still have it sound Pleasant so this was
sort of my exploration of exactly how to
do that so let's take something pretty
standard let's have sixteen beats so we
have sixteen beats we want to deal with
one block of data per beats right so we
want sixteen blocks of data to represent
this song so what if we took out three
hundred and eight thousand samples and
we divided that by sixteen we end up
with nineteen thousand two hundred and
ninety five samples per beat that's
still a problem right we haven't done
anything really to reduce it so what if
we got really cheeky and we started
corrupting things and we averaged the
sample values of each beat so what if we
added together in each block the 19,000
samples and then we found an average
from like negative one to one we just
found the aggregate of that we kind of
have stuff to work with right but it's
still even though it's broken down a lot
it's still reminiscent of the original
data that we were working with because
you can see the
there were very big blocks of patterns
in the data as we saw when we visualized
it and then what if we wanted to
accompany the song with some kind of tie
back to our trains what if we took each
value and depending on what value it was
we could assign a seat color that
represents the really lovely seat colors
that are in some of the trains in the
subway and then what if that was coupled
with you know which have a drum beat we
wanted to play based on that value and
these are simple if-else statements if
if value is between x and y then we can
assign a certain value right so it's
pretty simple to set up and then what if
we decided that maybe certain values
trigger a cat to be sitting on the seat
and the cat plays a certain guitar strum
and note now I'm not sure how this will
sound because the oscillator sometimes
blows out speakers so we'll just see but
if you would like to again these are all
embedded in my slides so you can play
with this later if you'd like to listen
to it with proper headphones and if you
do I apologize so this is a quick
demonstration I put together of how we
can visualize the sound at the same time
as playing it so let's see what
averaging all of this out and assigning
instruments to it ended up being
all right so you get the point and
that's super fun and I'm not sure
whether you could call that music but it
came out a little more pleasant than I
thought it would but let's let's have a
little bit more fun with it right that's
it's not super exciting so I have this
friend his name is Mark Johnson he also
lives in Brooklyn he's a really cool guy
and he's a very funny guy too so I met
up with him in a cafe recently and I
said you don't happen to have any weird
sounds that you've recorded where you're
making sound effects with your mouth and
unsurprisingly if we know him you would
expect the answer to be yes and he he
basically dropbox' me a bunch of really
weird sounds that he made for some game
that he was designing a while ago and so
I thought what if I you know put the
oscillator in and stuff but what if I
substitute some of these musical notes
for silly sounds that he makes so let's
hope the oscillator doesn't drown out
his awesome sounds
okay so that's a bit of a racket but I
thought that that was actually really
fun so yeah he thinks that's really
funny to see himself visualized in this
way so you know once you have the
formula for something you can just swap
things in and out and really play with
it and see what you come out with so
this is something that to me is not very
deeply explored yet this is something
this is a project that I want to explore
a lot more and see if I can actually
study more music theory to get some some
more pleasant results but that's an
example of how you can corrupt data and
then create something that's really cool
but but it's still you know at least
slightly reminiscent so the way I put
this together it's actually not canvas
this time I used SVG images that I drew
in a program called graphic by Autodesk
I just created a bunch of divs
so those seats are just floating divs
next to each other and the arrow that
follows along at the bottom is a CSS
arrow and I'm just using javascript to
like move the positions of things and
using CSS animations for the cats when
they play the guitar so a lot of it is
if you're a JavaScript programmer or
front-end programmer their skills that
you already have you don't really need
to learn anything else the main thing is
to use the Web Audio API to analyze the
data to get that in the first place but
you can get your data from any way you
like without looking like a weirdo
trying to record sounds in this half way
and you could probably tell especially
the musicians in the room that I'm not a
musician and so I'm still working on
that and trying to make things better
but I am better at Hardware things
that's kind of what I'm known for
especially in that open source world so
then I thought what if I could take that
sound that I made in the browser what if
I could take the song and then what if I
could then bring that back into real
life and then play that sound in the
subway I know that's really weird but if
something I wanted to do like what would
this look like so I took it a step
further and the JavaScript meetup I go
to in well actually there's three or
four of them now in New York City is
called Brooklyn Jas and this is actually
their tickets so when you buy a ticket
and you show up on the night they give
you this token and you can swap this
token for a drink or you can keep it and
the money they save from not buying you
a drink they donate to scripted which is
a wonderful
co-teaching initiative and I thought
this was a really clever
on the metro card designs so this is
actually what a real metro card looks
like and I thought this is a really
clever riff because most of us take the
subway to get there it's right near the
Bergen stop you know the bar that we
hold of that is right near the bergen's
station so I thought what if I did my
own interpretation of this given that
the Brooklyn Jas meetup has been such a
heavy influence in my life by socially
and and technically for a while now so I
sort of took this design and I tried to
reproduce it as a printed circuit board
so this is me trying to lay out all the
pieces and trying to invent what it's
actually going to do so you can see the
black layer is the silkscreen and you
can see all of the traces underneath
which I'm still learning about optimized
traces and and putting them on an angle
so that they're less they're less
fragile and things like that but this
was a really fun exercise for me to do
so this is what the actual device looks
like and I've got it here today if you
wanted to play with it and it does work
I just charged up the battery so it's
supposed to be like an old-timey speaker
gramophone thing and all that does is
read a sound of an SD card so I can put
the sound that I've exported from my
browser I can put it on there ste card
I'm gonna hold the button down it plays
the sound so that means that you don't
have to have a browser with you you can
take your transform sound with you
wherever you want to go so I 3d printed
the speaker housing once the PCB order
arrived I didn't add my own PCB I
uploaded the files and it came to me
from the internet which I love so come
and talk to me about that if you'd like
to know more this is me with the stock
closing door sounds so this was like a
first test after I soldered it together
to see if it was working
so when I put the sound on it it doesn't
quite pick up the oscillator so I need
to put in I'll camp into the socket so
there will be a MetroCard v2 very soon
but I've loaded the the exact same sound
on today so that you can hear it because
it is very quiet the speaker is stolen
from a greeting one of these musical
greeting cards so it doesn't take a lot
of what's so it's easy to blow out so we
want to keep the volume kind of low but
you got the idea so the goal is like
what I want to take the the music
further to make better music which we'll
talk about in a second but I want to put
more JavaScript in this right so last
last year I wrote a tool called a viago
and what it does is it uses nodejs
to flesh see compiled C programs onto
microcontrollers so I have some headers
on this here which allow you to just
directly program the chip on the board
which is cool so I've done that there's
a little bit of JavaScript there the
other thing that I started working on
recently was streaming the sound from
the browser to the board so this
requires like the SPI interface and the
SD card uses the SPI interface too so I
have some bottlenecking issues where I
need to be swapping between for want of
a better term someone please let me know
how I can replace master/slave because
that's a terrible way of describing
things but I have to play with that
relationship to get the sound streaming
onto the SD card but while also you know
communicating back to the programmer at
the same time but again ask me about
that if you'd like to know more and I'm
probably going to be seeking matt's
opinion on that later on and of course
as I've mentioned a few times I want to
make better music because I think this
could go somewhere and if you if you
arrange some better sort of harmonies
and things it's actually quite easy to
make like foolproof music from
accidental data that you can't control
I've seen a lot of artists do really
cool stuff with that okay
things go a little bit with but there
was a point to this and there's a point
to why things got weird it's art and
that's okay to create things that you
didn't think we're going to happen I
think that's important to be able to
take the time to explore that so what
did I learn from all of this and what's
the point and what can you all take away
with you creative coding gets you out of
your comfort zone you know when when
you're in
you work for a company every single day
or you work for yourself or you're
freelance
you're usually solving problems that
come up over and over again and they're
very familiar problems to you you're
just solving them in a better way or a
slightly different way each time and I
feel like creative coding just presents
this new set of issues problems
performance stuff all sorts of weird
api's that you haven't worked with
before and it gives you an opportunity
to actually do that and I think that
that makes you a better programmer in
the end in my opinion art doesn't care
about your semicolon feelings so you can
write this stuff and it doesn't matter
because most of time no one's gonna see
the code and the point I'm making is
that it's not about the code it's about
what you produce as an EM razón you
know you you want to you want to judge
those results and not like yeah but what
does the code look like underneath it's
just it's so irrelevant to me in the
journey that because ah doesn't care
about perfection it's it's whatever you
want it to be and so again it's about
exploration
Kilian McMahon at work that's his
Twitter name he sat down with me on a
hack day and I said killing can you
teach me how do music I don't I don't
get it so he started scribbling these
things down for me and I'm really
grateful for that and I actually worked
with him very frequently he's a designer
and he writes the HTML and the CSS at
work and I implement the JavaScript for
it and so we're used to working in a
very in a very technical way but we've
never talked about music before this
project so I got to know a side of
Killian that I've never seen before
which is that he plays music any spare
times he plays gigs he's actually
opening for PyCon who if anyone's coming
there the adventure capitalists they
make fun of the startup scene and
they're really clever so you should see
Killians band so he's I think he's going
to teach me a little bit more and I
really value having a different side to
that relationship you know we're very
close pair at work and this is just like
improved our relationship so it's really
about what you learned and what you
learned about yourself and what you
learned about others so my advice is to
take some time out of your day jobs
where you're expected to be perfect all
the time and write some messy code and I
want you to make lots of mistakes
- and to say this isn't what I thought
it was going to be but this is kind of
cool I'm gonna just make a new branch
and get and then just like go this way
instead I think that's a really valuable
thing to have it makes you feel a lot
more free because you deserve a break
from being judged all the time there's
been a lot of language bashing and sort
of snarky comments at this conference
and that surprised me a little bit
because I thought that the point of
bringing programmers together is because
we're all sort of aiming for the same
thing which is to be really good at what
we do and to talk about why we love
programming so much so if you have the
privilege of spare time I know you know
everyone does just sort of start typing
like this and just just see what comes
out of it you know and and there's been
many times when you know I've had maybe
a glass of whiskey too much and then
I've written something really insane and
then working up the next morning and
going wow what is this and I think
that's really important actually it's
it's it's taught me a lot about the fact
that even though I'm capable of being a
great programmer I'm still okay with
just slapping some paint around on a
canvas and and that it makes me feel
like that nine-year-old trying to
program the Commodore 64 to make
pictures again and it's it's important
to remember who you are
so my advice is when you have the
opportunity to code like no one's
watching and if you can for the benefit
of others don't get rebase eye on these
kind of repos don't squash down mistakes
you know you can leave comments saying
Lowell what WTF is this but don't squash
down your mistakes like let other people
see them let genius in the industry see
how you actually put things together and
this will remind them that no one writes
perfect heard from out of the gate even
if you're already familiar with a
problem everyone reef actors everyone
goes back over and discovers to leave
things that they've done and I think
that I've seen too many juniors in our
industry have that blank file that blank
canvas fright where they feel like
everything they write down needs to be
in a way where they knew what they were
doing right from the start and that's
just not true and I don't think we
should perpetuate that and I think we do
unconsciously through being
perfectionist ourselves so just get push
and that was scary I've pushed up a lot
of actually all of the code that I
showed today and it's all first pass I
just wrote it really quickly
I laughed at it and then I pushed it and
it was actually really scary to do that
because you know it's it's in a public
space not many women are programmers on
github who actively contribute to open
source and so that that can be used
against me but I think it's important
again to say here is my professional
open source and here is my silly open
source and so I'm starting to try and
create that dichotomy because I think
it's healthy for all of us because then
it makes it okay for others to do the
same thing so make some art like throw
it away it doesn't matter because it's
just card right it doesn't cost anything
so if you want to have a look at my
silly demos you can go to the following
address
il TSW just to help you have a mnemonic
is it stands for I love the subway you
can find my slides here so again it's my
github dot io / formulaic spectrum and
so you can play with the demos that I
have in there if it's more helpful to
you I'm going to be blogging about this
project really Sirian just describing
how I did everything and just a deeper
dive into the technical side of things
so my blog is meowth nuke at home in
case you didn't already know how into
cats i am and thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
