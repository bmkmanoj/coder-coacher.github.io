Kirk the rumors about my name being
influenced by Star Trek are absolutely
true I did change my name and my sister
Vanessa Spock is somewhere here so that
gives you a little bit of an idea of how
I think I do believe right I'm just
taking my time to warm up so that we can
get seated great so navigating politics
I've been really surprised about the
reaction to this particular talk
generally apart from such a big venue
like this we've had a lot of people just
jam-packed and I'm not arrogant enough
to think that that's because of me I
know that it's because of that word
politics so very interesting let's see
if I get this working there we go so
just to comfort you all a little to let
you know that I am allowed to be up here
that's a little bit about me I think the
main thing is that I specialize in
working with troubled projects so I
started my career because in coaching
because I had friends who are working in
industry and they loved the products
they are working on but the project
managers and coaches were leaving and
they K they give me a call because I was
cheap and they would say please come in
and just see what you can do because I
have this strange upbringing where I was
put up in an Aboriginal tribe so don't
think in a box and I would go in and get
my experience from working out crazy
solutions underneath the edge arleene
banner and move on and after a while I
thought this is really stressing me out
so I'm gonna do some easier projects and
I tried them and I got bored so I went
back to the troubled projects because I
really like the way that we think under
stress we just try and get the job done
and sometimes that really creates an
environment for innovation
so that's a little bit about me so
navigating politics so I've gone from
troubled project to troubled project to
troubled project and I've noticed
patterns and if only we didn't have any
people everything would be fine
yeah so this is not a very well
thought-out theory it's just based on
experience and you're going to see
there's a lot of expertise in the room
and you're going to see inconsistencies
and things that need correction I put my
hand up to that and do feel free to come
and tell me afterwards but all I'm
trying to do here is make a call out to
everybody to start focusing in on this
particular subject a little more because
I see that there's a problem so we can
have discussions so today I'm just going
to give you a short introduction I'm
then going to talk about my tribal view
and in relation to collaboration and so
on I'm then going to talk about my
journey in technology it does connect
and it is relevant don't worry and why a
john lien doesn't always stop the
dreaded politics just a little kind of
idea that I've got just an idea and then
because I'm really interested in it I'm
going to talk about Eastern philosophy
and how you can use that to help
strategize yourself out of some of these
difficult scenarios and I have used
those things in my day to day and that's
the sort of stuff that I'm trying to
communicate at the moment so
introduction guess what politics has
been around for a very long time nearly
two and a half thousand years ago
Aristotle was writing about it so it's
not your fault humans interacting with
humans but we mustn't underestimate the
power of politics and what it can do to
your agile lean initiative you've got to
remember that people have died holding
on to political positions so how do we
expect
a little loose framework to solve this
deep human problem we all have and also
I'm looking at just up the top there in
gray so you can hardly read it that's
the definition I'm using for politics in
this particular talk now we may have
been through this take down that
portfolio board transfer it to a
spreadsheet it's forcing people to be
open about their priorities and that's
causing conflicts in the executive team
that was a very real thing that happened
to me in a large corporation that's
politics
we showed a manager our last successful
release and he said oh gosh I'm really
pleased you've done so well I am sure
that you're going to do twice the work
and I'm happy that you've done twice the
work in the same time frame but now I'm
confident you can keep the same pace
with a 50% reduction of programmers as
well that's true that's how he announced
a political decision that happened way
above us in relation to losing half the
programmers in the team this one I like
this one happen to be recently I'm all
about trust so don't mention any of this
to anyone
that's an outdoor manager there this one
again a recent one please stop
mentioning tech debt it's depressing me
and not in line with our innovation
strategy
these are adult lien teams but these are
hierarchical power plays that are
happening around and inside it you see
from my perspective politics is a
symptom it's something that comes from
frustration pain or fear so let's go to
my story so firstly I want to clarify
the tribe word it's getting very trendy
and I have a bit of a different
perspectives so the tribe the word for
me is a generic term and it doesn't
refer to the same thing or set of
behaviors it's a bit like nationality
that's how I see it
because tribal behaviors are different
around the world so you'll have
different behaviors for a rainforest
tribe because of the context compared to
a desert tribe compared to a tribe
that's located in the mountains say
where it's quite cold the one tribe that
I was in I was born into the under tribe
and then I grew up in the Bittinger a
tribe and just because I've been born
into the oven de tribe they always
called me up endure even though I only
lived there until I was 3 or 4 years old
and that gives you an idea of how strong
the tribal bonds are in the environment
I grew up in so when I hear everyone
using the word tribe for me I think that
means peer group so I just want to
clarify that however even though I think
a John lien really isn't a tribe I
wouldn't die for it it's not my
nationality it does have a tribal way of
working so let's just start by
describing what I mean about a tribal
way of working in my tribe lived in a
tribe or the UH Dunda tribe was out in
the middle of the desert there's a lot
of space limited resources a very harsh
context and we had specialists hunters
foragers elders facilitators and these
specialists used to have big kind of
like conferences and get
the ceremonies where they would assemble
as a peer group to test their skills and
abilities right
however they today we lived as a small
family group very nimble adaptable group
maybe up to about 10 people and we would
have a hunter a forager and elder or
perhaps one person who has a multitude
of skills and everybody else would be
supporting or cross killing and we
collaborated this way leading
interchangeably so when it was critical
though it could get very dictatorial we
were desperate for food so we would be
hunting and the hunter would be in
charge and you had to do exactly what he
said because he was the expert at the
time but if you were foraging the same
thing
the forager would often say well if
we're hunting for rabbits please don't
put your hand down inside the Burrow
could be a snake you kind of want to
listen you kind of want to do what you
were told at that point incidentally
instead you would get a long stick you'd
put some spit on the end of that stick
and put it down underneath and if you
felt something soft and pulled it out
and had fur on it that was safe so this
is what I've called in my head just as a
way of trying to communicate this made
up I call this rotational hierarchy so
you have a group of peers that you
personally compare with but day to day
you live as a family group collaborating
to survive and leading based on
speciality and what was required the ABS
are lean structure very similar uh-huh
these are specialists who are
collaborating to innovatively succeed in
a harsh environment so Tech's designers
facilitators but day to day we
collaborate in very small groups we get
our sense of mastery and value from our
external peer group and we collaborate
because that's how we get to get
something that which Avella elevates our
position in
the peer group for instance engineers
are Discovery junkies and if they
associate with those painful people you
know because we're all introverts they
get knowledge back and knowledge gives
them a sense of mastery and value in
their peer group now this is nothing new
political science thinks about this
stuff so this is clashing structures
really isn't it so we have a big
hierarchical structure and underneath we
have these rotational structures and
that's a john lean underneath encased in
this traditional static structure which
is a deep-rooted legacy from the past
think about class systems from history
think about factories that's where that
comes from and some alternatives to
traditional hierarchy come from
political science it people have been
thinking in this space for years and
years and years and I think I would
encourage any of you to go and actually
look into this much more deeply hadurok
e little tiny hierarchies interacting
with a main hierarchy adhocracy flexible
and adaptable and informal structures
which rise and form depending on demand
and holacracy correct me if I'm wrong
but I think you can go and pay a fee to
a gentleman who's done a TED talk and he
will tell you all about it so go and
explore that no need to reinvent the
wheel so you can imagine the 20 year old
me which is only a few years ago there's
a this corporate hierarchy was brand new
and I thought wow corporations fantastic
they had this side effect also called
supermarkets and you didn't have to
chase your chicken down to eat it right
it was ordered I love the idea of
uniforms there was a lot of stability
and you had this thing called money
right in the tribe you traded with
people with skills and abilities and
sometimes they could be a bit painful
and claim that you owed them more than
you actually do
you thought that you did oh them very
annoying so therefore money was great
wrote it down that's what you owe me
take it and leave
and on Dimity everyone in the tribe knew
what was going on in his corporation I
was kind of free right hmm then I found
this downside this new thing called
psychopathic behavior and it reminded me
of when the white culture took over the
black culture you know to make a profit
or to get to heaven and these guys
killed for power and we witnessed the
effect of that and I noticed that
sometimes these people in charge weren't
like the elders who were very wise and
had seen many seasons these guys were
self interested in manipulative they
were charming they were unfeeling and
could mimic epic empathy but they were
also sometimes idiots and when I saw
this particular documentary that really
did it for me that helped me to
understand this is called the
corporation and I think you can get it
on YouTube which basically a corporation
is considered an entity in the legal
world and so they go on this quest in
this documentary to class to find out
what sort of personality is the
corporation and they find out to their
surprise
it's a psychopath so I became very aware
that hierarchy was very powerful and as
I said the white culture used hierarchy
to dominate this rotational hierarchy
culture that I was in and it nearly
annihilated them and I witnessed death
very powerful so I was conflicted I
couldn't believe what about all these
people why are they not caring I was
amazed that this new world I was in
survived without caring for each other
and yet I saw such deep suffering
deep loneliness every day at work
bullying and I was drawn to solve it
wherever I was then I found technology
and technology attract psychopathic
leadership they say so you can see
Forbes has said in 2013 that many of the
jobs attractive to psychopaths is found
in the tech industry and there's a book
that I've partially read I must admit
but I when I do my workshops people
suggest books that I should read and
this one snakes in suits is one that
keeps coming back to me explains a
little bit about that so you can even
see the top ten professions CEO lawyer
media salesperson will got all them but
I'm not saying that everybody is a
psychopath I think they're only
something like 3% of the population what
I'm saying is that there is this
financial and legal structure that has a
legacy that as we get closer and closer
to the finance and legal side of things
we start to get more and more
psychopathic behavior or that's a
pattern
I seem to notice and this is the scary
thing then I found out
although Psychopaths can't become
compassionate normal people can turn off
their compassion and become psychopathic
in their behavior you must have seen
this where a developer rises up the
ranks to the head of a department and
you just think can you not remember what
it was like to be in a team there's
another study here where they looked at
some people that were deemed as having
management potential and they found this
group had a much higher rate of
psychopathic behavior than the normal
population so there's our future this is
highlighted by a story where I was
working in a very large nameless
organization and the we were working in
a very agile way was very very exciting
and we'd really push the boundaries and
the the guy who was running it the
managing director does it was time for
him to move on so he moved on and a new
guy came
to take over and we knew he was going to
be amazing because it was his fourth job
right it's going to be managing director
and he was from Silicon Valley very
excited so when he turned up he said to
me I hear that you're doing all this
age-old lean stuff so come and have a
chat with me so I did told him all about
how we're running things I thought this
is gonna be great because he's young and
he's gonna be right into this and he
looked at it for a while and he sat back
they didn't back in his chair mm-hmm
mm-hmm so Catherine I yeah I got to tell
you about this new thing that I've been
reading about most recently so talk yes
he said first you do all your
requirements and he says you get so much
more control it doesn't have to be chaos
Wow so then I had to stand back and
watch this framework of waterfall
suddenly trickle in and we had big
posters on the wall that said we are now
installing gates quality gates yes that
was fascinating watching it reverse the
other way around and there's this other
thing in the industry called introverts
you've got a few I am actually one of
them that has learned how to be
extroverted and there's a good book
quiet the power of introverts that you
can have a read about of we were very
unpopular for a while but now if you go
online and search introverts we're
starting to become very cool well my
friends have really good-looking wives
and girlfriends now this is something
that introverts have often said to me oh
yes we do want management to consider
our opinion we just don't want to
interact with management to tell them
about it it's a little trap so you can
see why technology loved waterfall right
because you've got your psychopaths at
the top and they can make a plan and
exert their power right and then the
introverts they don't have to interact
that much they just need to document
everything and then blame somebody else
beautiful that's where our instincts lie
but there's one big problem
just very irritating thing P we are an
industry where people are working with
people to make tools that help people
interact dammit
okay so even when they had waterfall
there was a lot of interaction and so it
waterfall started busting at the seams
because people are having to interact so
much because of the change that was
happening so much change so I started
using tribal structures in this time
because I was trying to adjust to this
ever-changing environment and relieve
suffering then I saw it in a book agile
/ lean and it had official practices and
everything amazing brilliant I'd found
my place so then how come politics
sometimes increases after a John lean
VIN well here's a hint
so introvert sphere we go from say
fortnightly meetings of just one and
then if we do stand-ups and we do
retrospectives and we do planning
sessions and we do review you're going
up to about 13 for nightly meetings
there's a bit of resistance there a lot
more interaction the boss gets to say do
what I say and we go yes sir
- maybe there's a lot of interaction
there all of a sudden so the reason we
have so much politics in my personal
view and we've got a lo of psychopathic
self-interested behavior we add to that
some introverted avoidance tendencies
then we put on a hell of a lot of
high-pressured change then we say hang
on let's collaborate even further and
ramp up the interactions and
collaborations and then we put all of
that under this big traditional static
hierarchical power structure and there's
a potential hotbed of politics so that
explains it then
however if I walked off the stage at
that point you wouldn't be very happy
with me so how have I dealt with it this
is just my opinion I'm not saying
everybody else has to but this is how
I've dealt with this problem so we know
how John lien has awesome tools so these
already help BDD TDD user story formats
the whole works we know that but we kind
of need a simplified strategy sometimes
on when and how to apply those tools
because people are so complex and
without a strategy we start to invent
more structure and rules and that's
where things like safe are starting to
come into play which is all very well
and good depending on what organization
you are but the more structure and rules
you have the less innovation and the
less adaptability to rapid change you
have so that's the the little discussion
you see often about whether or not safe
benefits and in a rapidly changing
environment we want innovation and
things that help us deal with tricky
technical people problems
so I boiled that down to a couple of
things I wanted help to always get
inside if I get insight aha often enough
I can work my way out of hell and I can
also deal with people I need help with
those two things and this is what I
found works for me so I personally
investigated Buddhism because they like
to eliminate suffering and I was looking
to eliminate suffering and Buddhism also
generally focuses on caring about people
I have a bit of that and what I found
was this strain of Buddhism called
Mojave Vipassana so the partner is the
process of doing simple things to
facilitate insight I'll have a bit of
that and Mojave was this guy that lived
in the last hundred years who tried to
simplify Buddhist practices right down
to the essential stuff there were too
many ceremonies and he thought look
people can't take time out of their
lives to get insight so what do we do to
just
away all the ceremonies and give them
the basic tools and it literally is
simple stuff like breathing walking
noticing surprising how difficult it is
but don't worry I've suffered through
all of that for you on your path right
not but I'm bitter after ten years so
how do we cool down politics here's my
strategy obviously we keep our agile and
lean toolbox handy and we fired but we
get a little less discriminating and we
find tools that you can put into that
toolbox much much more and that way we
can respond contextually to every
political situation because people are
really really different every time
they're never the same so we can't say
this is the only way that it will work
this is the only solution you learn this
you can solve every people problem you
have the first thing is to help people
gain equanimity and what equanimity is
not is high emotion bringing your
prejudice into the conversation your
personal opinion what equanimity is is
calmness openness curiosity scientists
work very hard to gain equanimity and
amongst the scrump description of this
is encourage inquiry without distortion
so look at something with interest but
without bringing all your prejudice with
it and the purpose of this is to get
clarity about what is because you we
have a lot of Dreams being discovery
junkies that we are so we really want to
be that in the future but if we don't
know where we are how do we know how to
get there it's bit like me saying you
know I would really like to get to
Denmark but I don't really know which
country I'm already in it's ridiculous
so equanimity is to find out the state
of what is and so you can choose tools
and practices to help you do that
Kanban boards visualizations
but here's the risk if you do this on
your own this is what psychopaths are
appreciated before they can distance
themselves I can get calm and get cool
right
but this can turn into indifference and
apathy for instance oh yes I see that I
eat a lot of junk food okay so you need
to facilitate inside because what the
monks say so inside is an accurate and
deep understanding now this is something
we're all pretty good at in our industry
because lucky we're surrounded by
engineers so what it's not is being
right that's not inside it's not knowing
best insight is understanding and the
purpose of this is we need to have
understanding or otherwise we will be
destined to repeat the destructive
behavior over and over again and when
the other thing we need to contemplate
to get insight is the context we're in
so one of the Buddhists you know these
this is a translation of the Buddhist
three universal truths that I've applied
to the industry just for the sake of
giving you an example so we know nothing
will satisfy meaning innovation is now
the norm just look at Apple they haven't
innovated enough we think now it's not
just about my perspective now speed and
demand and the industry means we have to
interact and consider others this is our
context now and everything is changing
all of the time so whatever we do is out
of date as soon as we started almost and
it's within that context we have to
think about what our effective action is
it's within that context that we need to
gain understanding insight but in sight
with equanimity does not necessarily
instigate action does it I think about
it I see I eat a lot of junk food I
understand why and I know I shouldn't
eat junk food
okay then so we have to add something to
instigate action and this is where I've
now become the uncoolest person in most
of these conferences okay because when I
discovered this I was very disappointed
I wanted to look very impressive you
know but here it is compassion so now
everyone needs to hug no ripples of fear
yeah because you see people are
interacting with people to create tools
for people to interact so we need to
understand the solutions that we suggest
because we're very good at equanimity
we're very good at insight but we'll
come up with a lot of solutions to pop
them in front of management that that's
the way it's going to be solving the
whole world's problems problem is we
need things that people will buy into
and we need things that people actually
follow up on and compassion helps us to
anticipate the likelihood of initiative
or solutions success so here's a
definition of compassion deep awareness
of the suffering of another coupled with
the wish to relieve it so it's not
sympathy which is just understanding
from a distance it's not empathy which
is I am experiencing it as you would
experience it it's a step further it's
kind action so for instance if my sister
Vanessa Spock was suicidal for instance
I might empathize with her and want to
jump off the building with her right
however if I had compassion I would see
the situation she was in and tried to do
things to stop it from happening and to
rectify the cause I get a sense of
action from that so cognitive
neuroscience some people say the science
is a little flawed but professor singers
book and research seems to map directly
to Eastern philosophy that I've been
looking at so it's some area that might
be of interest to others and she says
that empathy can be blocked
she also says it can lead to burnout
whereas compassion motivates and this is
this is the interesting claim which is
empathy increases negative emotions but
compassion increases activation in the
brain networks associated with
affiliation and reward so when we're
compassionate we act on that we get a
sense of reward from it and we're able
to repeat this indefinitely one would
hope very interesting so equanimity I
see I eat a lot of junk food insight I
understand why and no I shouldn't eat
junk food compassion I feel how much
this affects my body my family and my
future so I'm going to you see now this
is very interesting because like a past
night like being left out so they've
managed in the last couple of years or
so
Oh in the last year to put out a book
this is Andy McNab he's a psychopath to
say hey hey hey hey to our wonderful
leaders you don't need empathy get rid
of empathy focus on what you've got to
do ask yourself what am I here to
achieve because empathy doesn't help you
get there interesting but see here's
where psychopathic behavior fails us
they're not able to access that database
of compassion in order to understand
what a people orientated solution or
initiative might be like to experience
and therefore they are unable to use
compassion tools to increase the
likelihood of a people solution people
centered solution success very
interesting the fourth thing I do is
this is something the monks taught me
after 10 years of doing these silence
retreats you need a lot of grit you need
a lot of determination politics has been
around for a long time it doesn't get
solved overnight this is a continuous
challenge so we need things like
continuous short cycles of actions
experiments steadiness so grit is not
one ID
stubborn or repetitive action without
wisdom grit is patience experimenting
and learning wise resilience its
strategic and here's something that came
from some of the workshops I've done
sometimes it's fun fun keeps things
going much longer silliness and as other
people have referred to me joy another
concept that's gaining popularity at the
moment so if we look at this strategy
you need equanimity for clarity you need
insight for right understanding think
about Jeff patterns eternal quest of
building the right thing versus building
a thing right
we need compassion to generate effective
action that works with human beings and
then we need grit and determination to
create that sustainable action and pace
that suits the individuals that are
within you the solution you're offering
person Lance the monk how long should I
continue in the monk replies for as long
as it is wise to do so so in summary in
this ever-changing environment we need
to be aware that we're a bunch of people
interacting with people to make software
for people to interact we need to
consider the bigger picture which from
my personal point of view is we have
psychopathic self-interested behavior a
bunch of introverts we have high
pressure change we have our John Lean
ramping up the collaboration in and
interaction and then we have pressure
from this static traditional hierarchy
that squeezes us all together into a
potential hotbed of politics so it's not
your fault it's okay you just need to
get clarity focus on the right things
generate compassion and find and
incorporate ways of dealing with this
problem of politics a little bit more
long term so
maybe this is a different perspective to
you maybe it's not and I hope I open
things up for discussion and really do
encourage you to research a bit more on
the power of compassion thank you
thank you very much Catherine does
anyone have any questions on this talk
yes how do you differentiate between
stubbornness and resilience I think it's
about looking at the expectation and
assumption you carry with that emotion
if you're expecting people to take your
opinion above all others I think that's
a bit stubborn if you're resilient I
think you're looking at the context with
a little bit more clarity so you're
going to be responding to whatever's
there in a more effective way so that
makes sense in my head I mean we're
going to have issues because it's words
isn't it and I knew this and I went when
when I went in and discovered some of
these things from the monks I was just
thinking oh my god it's like wordplay
you know assumption into investigation
etc etc etc but then it was pointed out
to me that I could when I was
challenging a particular person they
said I could call you an absolute pain
in the beep or someone who's very
challenging it's amazing what different
words do so it's one of those things but
it's definitely area to explore no one
else I'm let off the hook yes thank you
