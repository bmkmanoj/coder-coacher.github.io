scrum what some of you have been
learning from the source today um let's
say we have a development project with
some goal the goal could be the release
of some software product and then in
scrum we create a cadence of checkpoints
and at each checkpoint we have a demo
and we assess our progress in terms of
soft working software then in scrum we
do not assume that we will make progress
according to some perfect plan in fact
we reject the notion that there can be
such a thing as perfect plan we start
development and then based on our actual
progress we reassess what we should be
making different reassess our our goal
perhaps even we may have new insights
the environment may have changed there
are all kinds of reasons why we may have
to change our plan now the question is
where does design fit into this and to
be quite clear with design I mean much
more than visual design when you say
designer everybody thinks of somebody a
bit weird who does lots of things in
Photoshop and that is certainly part of
design it's visual design there's only
small part of design the design as a
whole is much bigger architects in the
sensor designers right it's just that
most of us don't get much in touch with
with designers in our work some of us
have an engineering background few of us
have ever designed background so
where does design fit into this they are
based on this simple illustration there
are two possible places one would be
design could be done during execution
during the Sprint then another option
would be that design comes before
execution now who a few isn't familiar
with with the terms ready and done in
the context of scrum I'm sure Jeff
Sutherland has already mentioned that
you um now does anybody care to explain
that done is relatively easy would you
like to do well to achieve it is may be
difficult but to explain it is not so
difficult I mean what often happens is
on the team shows work at the sprint
review and then they say look that's
what we've done and then the product
owner may say oh great I love it let's
put that right into production and and
you know give it to our customers and
they can do their bookkeeping with is
with it and then then the developers say
well wait a minute you know it's not
that kind of done it it's not yet really
tested and there may be some bucks that
the computer crashes and so on and let's
better wait another sprint until we can
you know put this into production so
done is the the set of criteria really
that you want to be fulfilled for
something to be to be shown at the
sprint demo on there's this definition
of done and then people found out that
at the other end at the beginning we
have a similar problem sometimes the
team pulls backlog items into the sprint
and then they are confused it's not very
clear what exactly should they do how is
it supposed to
work what values are supposed to be be
sure and so on and when they they
introduce this this notion of ready
that's basically done for back back back
log items right so now we could say
design should be part of execution that
would be in the sprint and then that
would lead to to a done product
increment a done product increment is a
well-designed product increment
something like this and we could also
say that design should come before
execution that the team should not pull
backlog items into the sprint if design
is not yet good you know not you're not
you're thought through these are
basically that the two options that we
have now I would like to tell you about
our experience with to the development
of two features the product in each case
is our web application dividend perhaps
I should say a word or two about the San
esta casa as you may guess if you
understand German our business is
invoice processing and financial
services for dental clinics all our
software development is done by one
small team every month we have a sprint
review meeting with our CEO and
stakeholder representatives and most of
our software development is really our
internal software every year over 250
million swiss franc flow through our
systems and they always you know
possibilities for for further
optimization and so on so much of our
work is really on internal software
internally use software but then some of
our software is directly used by our
customers and then this feature of this
web application dividend is perhaps the
most important one at the moment and
that i would say false more intro into
this kind of software product product
software another question is is there
any difference Klaus and I argued a bit
about that Klaus has experience of
developing software for you know
extremely sophisticated expensive
employees you know like a little prima
donnas and you know I think in that case
really there isn't any difference but in
many cases perhaps there is actually a
difference for starters if you develop
software internally you probably don't
have any real product management
expertise you don't have any design
expertise you know your users personally
they may sit in the same room or at
least in the same building you know you
don't have a problem with scalability
probably if it's only a handful users
and so on what I'm going to talk about I
believe really fits better software
development in the case of products but
I do think there are also lessons for
internal software development both
features are going to talk about our
features of our web application dividend
which is used by our customers first
feature is called invoice status what
problem are we addressing with this we
we do have a data feed our customers
have many of them have a software system
they do their reservations with their
accounting whatever and what they need
to do as dentists in terms of
administration and so many can consume
this data feed and they receive status
updates they can see on for example
whether reminders were sent or whether
an invoice was paid when it was paid
this a very popular feature but not all
of our customers can use it because some
don't have any software system at all
and some have software systems that
cannot consume this data feed so we
decided that we offer this information
also in our web application that would
be a new feature in this case the
backlog item really was the request or
to offer this information in dividend
full stop it was up to the developers to
to figure out the details so we rolled
up our sleeves and so as the result of
some recent internal software
development we figured out we had some
nice new tables and if we make good use
of these additional tables we can offer
more detailed information now we also
figured out that if we use both the new
tables and the old tables and we we
still need the old tables on the results
sometimes needed some some let's say
interpretation but we didn't see that
really as a problem it was not that
difficult to understand the flow of
events and we thought really on the
whole that was a big improvement our
customers for the first time would get a
full view of all events associated with
one invoice
there was a release last year in
December containing this feature and
overall the reaction was very positive
um this is you see that it's a bit
difficult to to see details but this is
what the overview page looks like you
can enter some search criteria here and
you get search results here gets a quick
visual indication where everything is
okay green obviously means inverse
spades everything okay red is invoice
not paid and then you can click on the
link here and then you get details this
is what the detail page looks like
simple case invoice are created invoice
paid ready now overall the reaction to
the release was was positive but it
turned out many customers called and
said they were confused by this new
invoice status feature this is what one
of our customer service managers said he
summed up film you know the problems
with this feature as far as he became
aware of it the problem is the page with
details on this is a good example once
cases get a little complicated the iliad
case are not the problem but once case
get a little complicated the flow of
events doesn't make sense the text in
the column status and action is
confusing Oh what he mentions here this
example is this one as you can see you
know too many too many roles really I
mean you can't really expect anybody to
to work through this certainly not
customers um but but then it's it's it's
it's worse than that some are really
duplicates um it's not just to detail
but there's redundancy and then the the
sequence is odd for example at the top
you have the second you must read it
from bottom to top the newest events are
the chopped the second topmost event is
invoiced settled okay but then at the
top you have the actual payment now is
the invoice settled before it was paid
and then in the status column on the
right second row you have you know
invoice paid status invoice paid but
then above it status last reminder know
did it get worse from there or what you
know it was already paid and then again
last remind it doesn't make sense and
then here we have invoice created it was
created it was created it was created
last we made it here are also reminder
preparation debt collection but then
suddenly again in was created you know
it doesn't make sense so I guess this
feature didn't go that well and quote
continues for dental clinics the history
must be as simple as possible what is
more or less okay for employees because
they see exactly the same but they
didn't complain that much what is over
they may have had reason to complain
what is more or less okay for our
employees may may be incomprehensible to
our customers now this is the second
feature
we call it payment data what was the
problem that we had to solve them when
dental clinics work with us their
account that the accountants have to
reconcile their accounts with accounting
data from us accounting statements from
us and they have to make manual
bookkeeping entries for example in the
case of our fees in the case of debit
debits and credits in relation to that
collection and we were vaguely familia
where that that this is a burden for our
customers and I mean we we talked to one
of our biggest customers and they said
they you know they had a lot of work
with that and we we did try to help them
but this didn't really lead to anything
useful initially we just didn't have any
clear understanding of the problem and
of potential solutions and then last
November another very large customer had
a problem and that is really when when
we have this lightbulb moment but Amira
I can't be too proud of that the
customers really had to hit us over
there how do you say in English they had
had to hit us over the head with this
inside and bear it really the problem
was they wanted to send invoices more
often and they themselves were aware
that the more frequently they send
invoices the more menu allah bookkeeping
we have to do and since it was a very
large customer there was a real pain for
them there was days off of work for an
accountant
and that they didn't want this this
overhead they wanted to send invoices
more often they wants to receive money
from us more often but please without
this this accounting overhead and they
even came up with a solution they said
well if you could give us a summary you
know one number / accounting entry type
per month that would be great then we
would just have so many manual
accounting entries no matter how many
invoices how often we send how often we
sent these invoices a month it's just
one figure per month and since they were
used to getting lots of paper documents
from us they said look why don't you
just create another document you can
send it by mail that would be great that
would be very helpful now our part in
this is we had some experience with what
accountants like in these large clinics
and we suggest it how about we provide
this as an Excel spreadsheet and that
turned out to be really popular in
general as you may know accountants love
Excel and then instead of implementing
that right away you know in an automated
fashion that our customers perhaps could
download it on our website we started
with a prototype and first it was just
about the layout I mean Excel obviously
is a very simple user interface but
still you have a lot of options you know
you you can display data you cannot
display data you can change the order of
the columns and so on this is a
prototype of the customer service
manager you know the one who gave this
shocking verdict on the first feature
and this time I think he didn't want to
make this mistake again hold us to make
this mistake again and you said you know
before we before we take the trouble and
implement this
month of work perhaps let's just you
know figure it out in Excel what it
should look like and that is what he
what he did now um my specialization in
when it comes to development is really
you know database queries and this kind
of thing and then how to look at this
and said oh that is that is a bit
difficult this is difficult I can't do
that with with our data easily I really
wanted to be one query but if we change
a few things then that I can do it and
actually you know the result maybe maybe
even better this is what we ended up
with I will vote a very simple one
relatively simple query that gave us
this data was just a simple sequel
script you know it was mostly just
always the data of the last month and
the idea of the customer was hard-coded
in the script if I wanted to do this for
another customer you know it's really
copy and paste and change the ID of the
customer this kind of thing very
primitive then I i copied the result of
the query into excel i formatted in
excel how I wanted it to look and then
accounting check the numbers and we sent
it back by email to our one and only
test customer and it sounds are very
primitive but actually we kept going
like this for months and the custom of
the customer maybe accountant of the
customer was very happy with it with it
he said it would save him a lot of work
that was nice to hear but even better
was I it didn't take long for him to
come back and say well you know we still
have to do accounting for the last
business here could you perhaps give us
this this this data in Excel for the
last business here I think that was a
good sign then
we created this for 42 more customers
where we thought that would be
particularly helpful and showed it to
them and again very positive feedback
and only then when we had evidence
that's the data in this format in this
way is actually useful for our customers
we start to think seriously about how we
could offer this and so the obvious
obvious way was to offer this as a
download in our web application this the
download page but this really over that
was new in terms of user interface as
far as our test customers are concerned
they still get the same files and to the
extent that our test customers our test
users are representative of our
customers there's no very little risk
that that customers will find this
confusing or completely useless some
will find it more useful than others I
guess we had this you know we had input
in particular large clinics in mind but
even we have indications that even small
small practices can make good use of
this may they hand over the accounting
work to a so-called toy hunter and in
Switzerland and they pay good money for
it you know and if he has to do a third
of the work they save some money even a
small dental practice so that was the
development of the second feature now
the conclusion obviously these are only
two data points cannot say too much
based on this but as far as we are
concerned i would say on design in a
broad sense you know this is designing
you know the user interaction what you
offer really as part of execution didn't
work very well for us in the case of
that feature at least before execution
what brilliantly you know we could eat
iterate very rapidly
on the Excel spreadsheet certainly when
it was just done the dummy data but even
with vigor with a career it's easy to
change the query no fancy programming
there and then this prototype if you
want to call it that way became the spec
44 engineering or send it over to the
development team implementation was
quick and painless was really almost a
pleasure tool to develop this now if you
think back off of this way you can see
my background is not exactly in design
I'm not a Photoshop guru so I I went
back to my us key skills if you if you
if you think of of this diagram ready
done in the case of the development of
the first feature design was part of
execution in fact the design was was
basically derived from the
implementation we as developers we said
ah look we have these these tables and
then let's just show everything in the
tables and you know the result made
sense to the developers but it didn't
make sense to the customers in the case
of the development of the second feature
design came before execution was
basically you know we were ready to
develop it in full once the design was
done now
when it comes to design and products
there's the obvious authority to quote
that's a quote by by Steve Jobs just
after he got back to to apple and one of
the things I've always found is that
you've got to start with the customer
experience and work backwards to the
technology you can't start with the
technology and try to figure out where
are you going to try to sell it I made
this mistake probably more than anybody
else in this room and I got the start
you should prove it and I know that the
case and we have tried to come up with a
strategy and a vision for Apple it
started with what incredible benefits we
do with customer where can we take a
customer not not starting with fidelity
engineers and and figure out what
awesome technology we have and then how
we going to market
so that is really the key quote you've
got to start with a customer experience
and work you work work your way
backwards to the technology I mentioned
Marty Kagan in the beginning I think
Jeff Sutherland knows Marty Kagan
perhaps or at least Matty Kagan also
came to open your Venture Partners once
or twice think they they did some videos
there too SVP G stands for Silicon
Valley product group Marty Kagan used to
be vice president of product development
at and design at ebay and noise a
consultant and he's a strong advocate of
getting the design right before starting
with production software obviously in a
company like eBay or you know I think of
Facebook or companies like that I mean
if you have to scale up to a few hundred
million users then you have to be very
deliberate and if you want to iterate in
this environment you know you have long
cycle times even at Facebook where where
they release you know like everyday kind
of it takes a while to develop something
really new in a way that it scales and
before you you know check this effort
before you you spend the time of your
engineering teams in the case of
companies like like eBay and Facebook
you know really the elite mostly
Stanford graduates and so on perhaps you
should think through your design and not
just think think it through but but to
test it and so what Marty Kagan finds he
speaks of creating a backlog of good
design when you when you hear that you
know it sounds a bit like waterfall but
really it isn't what you have in mind
when you think of rapidly iterating and
getting getting feedback from users no
here's that in mind as well just not
with production software not not with
software that has to scale to a few
hundred million users in our case we
could do it with Excel you can sometimes
do with dummy data sometimes you use
live data but you know you can cut a lot
of corners in general but what what
Marty Kagan would advise you to do is
not to cut corners with design and also
the visual design try to get that right
and try to figure out if users are if it
makes sense to use us and then if it's
valuable to users and and only then
start to think seriously about
implementing it for production not quite
yet this is a quote by Marty Kagan
that's from a good book by the way
inspired and sorry I'm jumping a little
butter I before this presentation I did
get in touch with martikainen I thought
before quoting him so much I should
better find out if he actually likes
what I'm saying and say when he said oh
by the way just a few days ago I posted
an article on the Silicon Valley product
group block and basically it's the
content of this presentation very
similar on the blog article you you if
you visit the website you will find it
quite on the top the article is called
dual track scrum fits very neatly what
we have covered here and so he says user
experience design deals with the very
difficult questions of both usability
and value says companies have far too
much confidence in the specifications no
only documents you know make sense
perhaps but but usually they are wrong
even professional people are really good
at that you know maybe they fail half of
the time that's kind of the level you
get at when you are really good at
at this kind of thing and the rest of us
know to be quite honest most of the
projects we do don't reach the potential
we had in mind and it doesn't have to be
like that at least not to that extent
well the approach he suggests is to do
prototyping it right with prototypes get
good user feedback there's an art to
that so I'm getting good user feedback
with with prototypes and only start real
development once once you are sure
you've got something that is probably
useful now he says user experience
design deals with the very difficult
questions of both usability and value
and in order to come up with a product
that is both usable and valuable you
will need to try ideas out now that
sounds familiar right early and often
isn't that what we what we say in agile
development you know just try things out
and iterate and so on now he's actually
more radical than that says a good user
experience designer will want to try out
dozens of ideas and approaches in a
matter of days and let's perhaps with
usual user feedback you know it's not
just creating nice prototypes but
getting feedback on that as well so the
thought of waiting even for a two to
four weeks print would be debilitating
as the frequency is an order of
magnitude too slow that is what he has
in mind it's not like he doesn't like
agile development no he's a big fan of
of agile development he says really
literally everybody should do it and she
says very good things about scrum what
to this article but for a real design
and and most of us you know probably
have never worked with with such a guy
it is still way too slow and where they
want to not just change little here a
little there where they want to change
the whole approach you know they want to
make radical changes and try to that
with with an engineering team in general
they don't like that there they are good
at working with with production software
and they don't want to make these
changes all the time and anyway they are
far too slow even even if they're really
good they can't do dozens of changes in
a matter of days now of course there are
things that we can only learn once we
put software in production and you know
in production asst is also my favorite
definition of done but it's also true
that we can figure out a lot of things
before even writing a line of production
code and this perhaps something we
should think more about and then perhaps
get good at now this is the end of the
presentation and so I'm really curious
what Jeff Sutherland has to say about
this Jeff as far as I I know you work
very systematically with prototypes at
patient keeper the last company where
you were CTO before you joined openview
venture partners could you perhaps tell
us a bit more about you experience them
the contacts tent and
I totally specification we have the
specification patiently had the benefit
of having positions at users and because
they were so demanding if they saw a
iphone with something didn't like on it
they they throw it in the door and they
scream at us they said until you fixed
that we're never going to use the
product and in fact we had one position
that said one of our early releases he
threw it down he said I will never use a
mobile device for healthcare patient
treatment ever for the rest of my career
it sucks so bad and when physicians were
having problems we like to send our
developers to a hospital at least once a
quarter every to go on rounds with a
physician and see the position using the
mobile device at the bedside of a
patient then even who would die cancer
or whatever and when they see what they
would see a physician talking to a dying
patient and fumbling with that device or
worse yet the device hung up they got it
at an emotional level that there's just
no other way to get so it became clear
to even all the developers that you
could not assume anything about any
application going into production unless
that application had a had a fully
functional prototype test against a a
reference physician group who would
approve its workflow its look and feel
and its value and so the development
team literally started demanding of
product owners they would not write a
line of code until the product ever done
that a side effect of that was well
first of all the developers good
prototyping tools so the so the product
owners could do their own screen
mock-ups very quickly and with those
market markups the developers also have
typing tools that in a few hours using
the framework we had already created on
the devices we could create a fully
function functioning application on any
mobile device we supported most of them
so the work in a sprint for supporting
the product thought I was simply the
normal part of support of product or you
know should allocate five ten percent of
sprint to the product owner so it was
viewed not as any additional work for
the team product owner says I need a
part of that today okay that's probably
that's a product or a meeting basically
with only one person whereas most of
them had more more people one of the
side effects of that is was not only
good user acceptance but one of the
highest performing probably not patient
here at six and seven teams it's the
highest performing group of six or seven
teams that I've ever seen now
practically speaking if you go look at
what Apple does there's a good article
and pragmatic marketing and says why you
will never compete with apple and the
fundamental reason is they will create a
dozen fully functional prototypes of a
product and they will have a bake-off
and a shootout before they decide which
one to implement and because you won't
do that at your company you will never
be able to compete what happened this is
called set based concurrent engineering
if you look at the books on lean product
development which what that's what scrum
is in lead product development you
implement said base concurrent
engineering but and software very few
companies do the first scrum team did
patient equis did so forth I also want
to make comment on the fast iteration in
multiple companies he would be for
patient keeper I decided that the
applications needed world-class design
so for example what is now G healthcare
our CTO when I came in
we had eight different business units
each business unit had at least three
different products they all had
different user interfaces and they all
sucked so I pulled in a world-class
designer who I work with before it you
cannot afford to hire these people you
have to go and find them and you pull
them in at the right time that's what
Apple did to create the ipod and she
came in every night she generated six to
twelve prototypes of the look and feel
of a web product or IDF's at that time
now GE Healthcare and so for it took
about three weeks every night and
everybody looking at six different
options for the company to converge okay
this is the right one and then we've got
that only then did we start pushing the
user interface design into all the
business units at all and all the
products so any of you are serious about
selling product software I strongly
recommend you operate in this way this
is why Apple is the most valuable
company in the world because they do it
right
then I was an elegant lead to Jeff so
you avoid questions yeah so anybody has
questions to use free to shoot don't
shoot please long time for the
requirement speaker and the delivering
in general in general be the first PGA
presented here that was a bit special
because it was part of you know a really
big effort we rewrote the whole
application from scratch before it was
struts now it's ruby on rails so front
and got a complete rewrite we changed a
part of the back end authorization was
changed and this was really one small
part of the whole whinnies and and then
for once we got a professional designer
to work with us but it was more I'm
sorry I'm sorry to say that way but more
the kind of lipstick on a pig kind of
design you when everything is basically
done and then you say look make it
pretty and well it worked to an extent
it's really a big improvement on what we
have before but in the case of this one
feature it was just not good enough you
know you cannot develop it and then say
okay visual design and make it nice and
then everybody's happy doesn't work that
way if you haven't thought through the
problem and potential solutions and the
various options and so on and and tested
it I think it's very difficult to come
up with something that's really useful
and is like bye-bye customers so in
general we are quite fast me you can ask
Kunta interst my my colleague at the
science to Casa know if our boss wants
something fast he gets it fast we can we
can release something basically
immediately or whatever we do
would it make sense to short time boss
his race gurram well as you perhaps
could see from the ascii slides I'm not
a designer and I'm not I can't speak
with authority on this but from my
limited work experience I would say for
developing something really good as
designer in this broad sense you know
coming up with something novel it's
really really good solution that nobody
has thought of before you need
breakthrough insights and the first idea
is usually not the best and you can't
really schedule these this breakthrough
insights you're lucky too if you have
one at all so I think I remember Jeff
that once you said a patient keeper you
had ideas for four features or something
like that that would hang around for
months you know and so it would take a
while until they were mature enough as
it were to be actually put into
development um probably you it helps to
have this this scrum kind of rhythm but
it's not so much this execution focus
these designers I think have to be have
to have more Liberty and you can't put
them under under so much pressure I
don't think you can have a design
velocity not sure it makes sense one
thing that really helped at patient
keeper focuses we add more backlog than
we can implement for 10 years so we had
no shortage of backlog so what the
product owner came up with a new product
we weren't interested in starting on
that until in fact the CEO made it a
requirement there had to be four signed
contracts with customers before we cut a
line of code and we knew we could
deliver anything in in three months
which was the time period it took
hospital to sign a contract get the
install come live so it made no sense
for us to cut a line of code until the
deal was done and so in terms of fast we
just met match the speed to the customer
and we force the front end to be done
properly and the we in the course
tomorrow we're doing here will be
talking about enabling specifications
for things that really need proper up
front you need what we call it an apron
specification we take that from having
done a lot of patent applications
securing our intellectual property by
getting a patent from the US patent
office in the United States a patent
application is by law and enabling
specification which means a person
outside the company could implement it
from the patent without talking to the
company well this is exactly what you
what you want from a4a ready product
backlog the development should be able
to implement it without having to go
find the product owner and answer a lot
of questions it should be really
considered clear the average length of a
patent application is five pages and
that was the average length of patient
keepers specification so in terms of the
speed of development of specifications
it was an order of magnitude faster than
any kind of waterfall thing but the fact
that the product owners had to get or
big customers to sign with it's like
getting four big banks in Zurich to
agree on they want the state feature it
would take them months and a lot of
design work to get everybody agreed on
that this is the best design</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
