which is in the United States of America
but in the year 2000 I moved to Denmark
for a year and I lived here from the
middle of 2000 to the middle of 2001 and
the day after no the day before the day
before I moved here a bridge between
Sweden and Denmark opened everyone was
so happy yesterday I rode the train to
Sweden and I heard the voice say be sure
you have your passport ready for border
control and I thought oh my goodness the
United States has elected a misogynist
racist bigot for president
and you have border control what is
happening what is happening so this is a
talk about experiments and if you enjoy
it and you think it's worthwhile you
might wonder at the end Oh
maybe someone from my organization or my
family I wish they had been here they
could have heard this awesome talk and
they could see some new ideas about
experiments too bad they weren't here so
as most of you know I give away my
presentations there is no copyright on
any of these slides and you've got my
email address there I'd be happy to not
just send you the PDF but the PowerPoint
so that you can change it up you can
rewrite it and put it in Danish or
whatever you want to do with it as yours
and if you think it's worthwhile then
you can share all of that information
and as Christian mentioned we are not
going to have time for questions at the
end but please you can email them to me
or you can use the app to ask questions
and I will get back to you I promise
with any question that you might have so
it's Linda at Linda rising org so let's
take a survey how many of you are doing
agile something oh sure okay most of you
are doing agile something and how did
you decide to do that how did you make
that decision anybody you don't know you
don't remember just do it Oh somebody
told you to do it
do you suppose at any point in that
decision-making change
there was an examination of any science
did anyone look at the randomized
controlled experiments that show clearly
that provides scientific evidence that
agile is better than what you were doing
before how many of you
looked at all of those did you because I
have not seen any I have not seen a
single one I'm waiting I expect that I
am setting myself up for disappointment
because it takes a lot of energy time
and money we barely can scrape by doing
a project let alone a copy of it using
another process so that we could compare
the results and show that clearly agile
is better well you know it's not just
about agile we've been doing this
forever I have been in software
development for oh my goodness a long
time in fact this year I had a terrible
birthday I know some of you don't know
me are looking carefully under the
spotlight and saying good lord how old
is this woman so it wasn't a round
birthday I remember those from my time
in Denmark around birthday that's very
important and you must have a big party
and invite all your friends no no it was
sort of midway between two round
birthdays this year I became 75
so as you might imagine I have seen a
lot of change in our industry and it
seems to me that we have not destroyed
the pattern of just jumping on the
latest bandwagon that our decisions do
not involve any science that we never
look for evidence that we don't do real
experiments instead we tell each other
stories stories are powerful it's the
most influential way we have of passing
along information in fact stories are
much more powerful than evidence stories
are much more convincing than facts will
ever be so we hear those stories and we
think ah we should also use agile we
felt the same about a lot of other
approaches to process and tools and
programming languages it's the way we
are well I know people use the word
experiment but they're really not
experimenting think about it all of you
are educated you had an encounter at
some point with the scientific method a
scientific method does involve
experiments and there we talk about some
kind of hypothesis that we're going to
test and some kind of experiment that
involves randomization and a control
group as well as the treatment itself
and then we observe the experiment and
do some analysis looking for statistical
significance to validate our hypothesis
or not and we don't even begin to do
something like that I would like to
suggest that instead of the word
experiment we use the word try because
that's really what we're doing when we
say well let's experiment we really mean
let's just try it and we will never be
able to afford real science
in helping us make our decisions we
don't have a clear hypothesis in the
beginning we just have something we'd
like to try well let's just try it
there isn't any randomization usually
when we suggest we might try something
the people who say Oh me me I want to
try that those people are already sold
they're enthusiastic about it and they
will make it happen we know that's true
even in real scientific experiments that
if the experimenter has a bias toward a
result it's much more likely that that's
the result that he or she will get and
of course there's no control group it's
just I think we used to be able to do
this and then we have no data of course
for comparison we kind of remember the
way things were and we say oh it seems
so much better now oh and we feel better
about it
I hear that argument for agile all the
time we feel better about agile I'm not
sure how scientific that is some
companies do something called a bee
testing and I think they are delusional
believing that that is also science when
really all they're doing is trying
something and they can learn a little
bit in an a/b test and we know we are
the victims of a bee test constantly if
we are online and they are learning
something about us but most of it does
not force out some kind of theory
there's no theory building going on it's
just this seems to work better than that
and in fact given the context all we can
really say is this works better than
that here and now with the users that we
have very context sensitive it could
change tomorrow and we never usually
have some explanation that
makes any scientific sense we might make
it up but there is no theory building so
let's just say trial let's just be
honest and let's talk about trials and
let's be honest and transparent and say
we'll never be scientific about this we
don't have the resources usually for the
projects we run let alone for a
randomized trial or experiment with a
control group we can't afford it so
let's just use a nice pattern from
fearless change
it's called trial run and we will use
the word trial instead of experiment so
why should we do these I often get this
answer ah Linda we are going to do some
experiments or trials because we will
prove we will have proof that the idea
that we have or the notion or the thing
that we want to try ah this really works
here so one thing we know clearly is
that even in a real scientific setting
if you had real results from a single
experiment a single experiment never
proves anything it's only the first step
in a long process that involves repeated
validation your experiment needs to be
done by someone else if it's really
going to be scientific proof and even
then it's tenuous you need to repeated
validations the other problem is that
people often don't believe it
if they don't believe in your result
before the trial after the trial they're
still often not convinced so let's not
do it for the sake of feeling that we're
going to prove something what we know is
that all of us are biased and that the
results of all drug trials
if those participating in it knew who's
getting the real drug and who
not that they themselves the researchers
are the physicians running the trials
were able to sway the results by their
bias their enthusiasm their belief can
alter the outcome and of course it
wasn't until the 1950s that we uncovered
something even stranger about drug
trials even though they are run in an
experimental setting that is there is a
treatment group and there is a control
group
there's randomized assignment to the
different groups but they began to study
the results and found that after a while
the real drug seemed to lose its
efficacy we proved in a scientific trial
that it should work in the treatment of
this disease but over time we track the
efficacy decreases what is going on here
and finally someone realized that you
know people in a drug trial giving a
drug of any kind are gonna get better
just because they got some attention and
a chance to try a drug so they said we
need another group we're going to
introduce a group in the middle in
addition to the control and the
treatment we're going to have another
group where people get what looks like
the real treatment they'll get a drug an
injection surgery it will be a sham
surgery it will be a sugar pill it will
be saline an injection it will look like
the real treatment but it has no power
to cure the illness and what they found
was astounding that people in this
middle group got better in fact usually
about two-thirds so it can't be that
your drug is better than nothing it has
to be that your drug is better than
what's that middle group called
yeah it's not really English even so I
don't know whether is a Danish
translation it's Latin placebo placebo
how does that work how can somebody take
a sugar pill or saline injection or go
through sham surgery and get better how
can that happen
why hello yeah because you believe in it
you think that you are getting the real
drug and so your belief is enough to
make it happen I have a talk the title
of which is is agile a placebo I don't
often get a request for the tall
is that a bad thing if agile is a
placebo is that a bad thing it just
means that we can affect the outcome by
our belief and if we believe in it we
can make it happen is that a bad thing
given that we have no science to back up
our decisions can we run our industry on
belief does that sound like religion to
you so what can we do what can we do
well we're going to use the word trial
so you know we're not really doing
experiments and we can do a lot of
little tiny trials so small simple fast
and frugal and change it up don't just
let the most enthusiastic people get
involved in the trials let lots of
people try it
let's lots of people be involved in
these small tiny fast frugal experiments
and keep running them over and over
again they should be as small as
possible that's the question you should
constantly ask yourself because if they
are small then you're not as afraid that
things might not go as well as you like
and in fact we often when we talk about
experiments or even trials we use the
f-word so I'm suggesting we get rid of
it
let's not even say failure
hey I said it that's it I'm gonna talk
about failure and the reason for that is
simple
I won't ask you to raise your hands but
managers and executives do not like to
talk about failure and so they are not
going to be open to your ideas for
experiments or trials they're reluctant
to take even a small risk so let's
instead talk about we're going to learn
we're going to do a small and simple
fast and frugal little trial so that we
can learn whether this works for us
we're going to learn something so it's
not that we will succeed if it works and
we will fail if it doesn't know we will
learn it's all about learning something
learning something about the idea
learning something about our
organization learning something about
our team we're gonna learn and so
therefore we will get better keep it
small
keep it simple you want everyone in the
organization to feel that well I could
even come up with an idea I could think
of an idea for a trial I'm not a
scientist I don't have a lot of time but
there is something I've been wondering
about there's a question I have maybe we
could have a little small simple fast
and frugal trial I could come up with an
idea you want to encourage everyone to
participate in this exercise and always
ask can we make it even simpler I'm
going to read this to you it's a quote
from someone I believe runs the most
agile company on the planet it is Menlo
innovations it's located in Ann Arbor
Michigan the CEO is rich Sheridan how
many of you know rich or have heard him
okay two and a half people thank you
very much okay he's written an awesome
book called joy which everyone should
read establish a standard a fast
frequent and inexpensive experimentation
assume that many of your experiments
will fail we'll see he's the CEO so he
can say fail one of the most common
phrases you'll hear at Menlo is let's
run the experiment we are apt to say
that at least once a day
now we don't track them we don't count
the experiments we don't track success
or failure rates but if we did we would
look for success and failure rates to be
about even it's a percentage of failures
started dropping we'd become concerned
that fear had crept into the room and
that people were not taking enough risk
so fast do it quickly
my frugal frugal means cheap because we
are susceptible to want only one of many
incredible biases called the sunk cost
fallacy now I don't know about you but I
have been in many meetings that go
something like this
oh let's look at Project X I think it's
not doing well yes you're right it's not
doing well but we've already spent a
million dollars let's give it another 6
months how about six months everyone
raise your hands yes okay six months six
months later you know Project X still
not doing very well yes you're right but
we've already spent two million dollars
we can't stop now
let's give them another six months do
you see where this is going you're smart
people yeah
have you been in a meeting like that yes
finally Project X not doing so well oh
you're right
and since we have already spent 30
million dollars it has been running now
for two and a half years and has
produced nothing maybe we should cancel
it or how about this one well you know
we've been married for 10 years we have
two kids even though we can't stand each
other we can't I mean you know it's you
don't know what I'm talking about you're
so young you're so young
mmm so it works at many levels and it
has to do with an investment an
investment of time a mess my energy
money resources of some sort and once
we've done that we are so loss averse we
feel much more pain at loss than we do
joy at gain and so the sunk cost fallacy
always traps us so here's a little
suggestion for making any kind of
decision whether you want to cancel a
project or end a relationship ignore
ignore the sunk costs they are gone make
your decision based on what you have
learned up to this point yes part of
that is the money the time the resources
that you've invested but don't ever
bring that to the table it's what do we
know now about what we have based on our
experience and use that to guide your
decision not the amount of money or the
amount of time that you have invested so
that's not just me that's general
decision-making advice from people who
study that sunk cost color your
decisions
and they make them bad you want your
decisions to be better so that's one
thing that you can do and if your
experiments are cheap then when you look
at the results you're going to be more
open you're going to be more accepting
of what happened and you're going to be
more able to learn if you ignore sunk
costs so always ask can we make it even
cheaper I also want to add one more
thing to those experiments they should
be time boxed I see a lot of trials or
experiments and organizations that
somehow just keep running they don't die
and so it's very hard to determine
whether they have been successful at
showing anything or not because those
proponents of the experiment or the
trial are reluctant to call a halt until
they absolutely have convinced
themselves that it was worthwhile so
make them very small make them very
simple make them fast make them frugal
and put a time box
let's try having the stand up at 10 a.m.
instead of 8 a.m. for the next two weeks
and then what are you going to measure
what will determine what you have
learned and then let's see if attendance
is better and if we get more done in the
morning that's a very simple thing it's
simple fast frugal easy so why should we
do these trials to show those people
those other people so we will talk later
about something called the confirmation
bias and the backfire effect which shows
clearly there's a lot of evidence that
even though we are faced with real
scientific results we are not ready to
move from any conclusion where we
previously have a nap in
and when we really care so a trial is
not going to do that even real
scientific experiments are not going to
do that it's better to use some nice
patterns that I can offer you from
fearless change to move people in a
given direction why not invite them to
do the trials or experiments with you
the pattern is called involve everyone
let everyone feel free to participate if
you're trying to do an agile
transformation introduce it as a series
of small trials let everyone run their
own small trials not just some pilot
project there is no pattern named pilot
project and there's a good reason for
that and then when you have results from
your small simple fast and frugal share
those n stories remember we started this
discussion by saying stories are much
more convincing than facts so involve
others and share stories much better
than thinking that you're going to
overwhelm people with evidence from your
small trials we also somehow believe
that if we do some kind of experiment or
trial then it will address some large
issue that we have it's going to help us
solve a problem and what we know now
about you and your organization is that
you are complex adaptive systems and
while there is no science in software
development there is science in complex
adaptive systems theory and it says you
cannot wholesale pick up an organization
and move it down the road so that you
can say we will all be agile by next
July it can't be done all you can do is
small little tiny experiments and then
stand back and watch and look at the
behavior of the complex adaptive system
and on the basis of that behavior you
can make another little
trial stand back
observe do another trial and so on I'd
be happy to send you this paper it was
written by Joseph Pell Rhine on
understanding software agility a
software a social complexity point of
view where he talks about software
development as a complex adaptive system
and what we know is the only way to make
any change in it is to go through these
three steps probit sense respond a
little trial watch what happens on the
basis of that do another small trial so
give it up you're not going to make the
organization take big giant steps in any
direction but your best hope is little
tiny trials that affect everything every
little thing you do changes everything
ultimately and watch for more ideas for
more small trials because you don't know
what's gonna happen
I'm not a fan of Donald Rumsfeld but he
said we don't know well we don't know
brilliant and that's true that's true
so you can't proceed any sort of agile
transformation with any assurance that
you're going to be there by next July or
not they have no clue nobody should
expect that and there's always going to
be a little surprise anybody you know
who Alexander Fleming is you are
probably alive because of his surprise
he didn't come into his lab prepared to
make an earth-shattering discovery he
had been on a long holiday and he wasn't
very neat it was kind of a messy guy and
so when he got back you saw piles and
piles
things on his lab bench and he started
saying well I guess I'd better clean
this up it's a real mess here and then
he noticed a couple of petri dishes gee
that's funny I had been growing a
particular kind of bacterium and there's
a hole in the middle something killed my
experiment something killed these
bacteria I wonder if it's this leftover
sandwich from lunch that got in the
wrong pile and so he didn't come in
saying I am going to discover penicillin
it was an accident because he was so
sloppy but he was observant and he was
prepared to be surprised so you don't
know what's gonna happen you don't know
when that latest small trial that simple
easy fast and fruit is gonna change
everything
gee that's funny I didn't expect that
my second nomination for the most agile
company on the planet is in Dusseldorf
Germany and it's a company called sip
gate and they do something called open
Friday and on open Friday they bring in
our ideas for little trials and they do
lots of little experiments all the time
and when the results come along they say
something like we weren't even trying
for that the results we got were so
unexpected they say that all the time so
if you're going to start doing small
simple fast and frugal trials be
prepared you're going to change
everything now this one is actually
valid this is a valid reason for doing
trials because if you have anything
anything worthwhile some positive result
we did a little trial we found the
customer was happy with or we found that
we were able to do this faster or we did
a little experiment and we learned that
our team all of those things are
valuable management would love to hear
them the problem is if we don't go in
with the right approach to management
and I've got a list for you
remember you're gonna ask for this slide
so you'll have it make sure that it's
easy to understand that does not mean
that managers are stupid well actually
maybe they are stupid I know it means
they don't have any time they don't have
any time to listen I was in Sweden a
couple of days before coming here
talking to a big company that starts
with EE and the fellow I was working
with said how I'm gonna get ready for my
management presentation I have 40 slides
of data I said I think you could pare
that down could you do it in 20 slides
oh could you do it in 10
how about to take the most important
message that you have make the summary
easy to understand do you know this is
not just true managers it is true for
all of us if the message is difficult to
understand we think that it's
complicated probably wrong or if it's
easy and obvious we tend to believe it
we are much more influenced by simple
easy to understand things this is what
you want them to say why haven't we
thought of this in that way before keep
that in the back of your mind when
you're putting together the results of
your small simple fast and frugal trials
yes share that with management yes make
it so easy and so obvious that they are
going to open their arms and say yes why
haven't we been doing this all along
it's so obvious a nice quote from the
guy 'it's Shutterstock said if you do
trials you kill off the hippos the
highest paid person's opinion testing is
a way to get to the bottom of any
decision without relying on any one's
got instinct at Shutterstock if a senior
executive has an idea the responses well
let's try it let's test it no one has
any more influence than anyone else
there is no largest out the guy in the
room who's loudest and the highest
ranking has no more influence over the
decision it is always about well let's
do the little experiment it changes
everything
organizations that have adopted this
approach find that now instead of
endless ranting and raving in meetings
the suggestion is always well why don't
we just test it why don't we run a
little simple experiment
instead of arguing and debating bringing
in 40 pages of slides let's just try it
let's see if it will work for us we know
that we're subject to the confirmation
bias it's the worst bias we have it's
when we believe anything that when we
see new information we filter it out
even if it's scientific evidence we are
not convinced and we all do this it's
the biggest problem we face in the
United States I know you think is Donald
Trump no it isn't it's the fact that we
are incredibly divided at the moment
just right down the middle and nobody
listens to anybody we're not talking and
even if faced with facts about the other
side's point of view we will refuse to
listen it's amazing how quickly that
happened you say well this is a very
strong bias in us in fact my favorite
experiment has to do with two groups of
contentious people who looked at the
same set of evidence the same data the
same results and both sides said yes we
have looked at this data and in the face
of this evidence we can see that clearly
this evidence supports my point of view
and that both sides can say that having
looked at the same evidence the same
data and we wonder well how can that
happen and the answer is clear even
looking at scientific evidence if we
don't like it we will discount it and we
will say oh look at this study it was
done at MIT we know they don't know what
they're doing so we can just ignore that
or this other experiment well it was so
poorly done they only had a very small
samples
we don't have to pay attention to that
and we will find some way around it we
will find some way of ignoring it we
hate to give up that belief especially
if we've had it for a long time and
especially if we are part of what's
called a moral tribe I like this quote
from Warren Buffett who said you know
Charles Darwin knew about this even
ahead of all the research and cognitive
neuroscience and he said whenever he ran
into something that contradicted a
notion that he cherished he wrote it
down right away because he knew his mind
would begin to try to convince him that
it was something he could just ignore
man's natural inclination is to cling to
his beliefs particularly if they are
reinforced by recent experience Thank
You Warren Buffett so we don't see
clearly we don't even look at the
results of scientific experiments
clearly because they are seen through
the glasses that distort everything it's
the set of our own beliefs about how the
world operates and then if you're going
to do an experiment you have to be
prepared that what you hoped for is not
what's going to appear and that is also
difficult another very strong bias in us
is cognitive dissonance
we can't hold two opposing ideas at the
same time and so if we struggle to say
hi I was I was thinking that this trial
would show but it didn't it showed
something else instead this is a
difficult thing for us to be open to
whatever the results are even scientists
struggle with this even scientists will
distort the results so that fits with
their prior beliefs
a favorite quote from a physicists
friend of mine who said I wish for every
student that something they deeply hold
to be true is shown to be wrong once
you've had that experience then you get
it you get what science is all about so
we have to address these biases and one
thing we can do is talk out loud we can
say you know we are all biased say that
out loud you know we should be more
scientific we should be more rational
use the word science rational hypothesis
theory
it actually tricks your brain into
believing that you are going to be more
scientific that you are going to be more
rational say most people want to
overcome their biases we know that
riding with a real pen on real paper put
down your ideas track the results of
your trials putting it down on real
paper helps you to be more objective and
then we heard a wonderful talk today on
diversity have people with different
points of view involved in these trials
so that you can make sure someone will
have a hope in hell of being objective
about the results and then always slow
down the conscious mind is slow and
linear take a break get enough sleep
that's another talk so this was an
experiment that spoke to me personally
even if we're able to do real
experiments this is a trap we cannot
avoid this was a longitudinal experiment
it was done over the course of 30 years
attract a lot of males looking for an
interesting correlation of some sort
they weren't sure they had looked at
coffee consumption and incidents of
Parkinson's disease a neurological
disease and they did find that those who
dry
the most coffee were least likely to get
Parkinson's now you can imagine a result
like that this is a well done study 8004
subjects over 30 years how many of you
drink coffee so you're right now you're
saying yes yes there it is your bias is
working favorably toward this one but if
you don't like coffee then you're saying
oh there must be something wrong with it
and there is there's an interesting
correlation yes but it doesn't mean that
coffee is protective of Parkinson's or
any other neurological disease sorry
because this is my family history we
have a particular neurological disease
my father had it my brothers have it I
have it and my daughter has it and none
of us drink coffee because the genetic
tendency for this particular illness
also means that we do not like coffee so
it's not that those who drank coffee
were protected against Parkinson's it's
those who got Parkinson's we're of a
genetic makeup that made it so they
didn't like the taste of coffee and
hence did not drink it do you see the
significant difference do you see how
easy it is to get caught up in inference
you run your trial and you say look at
these awesome results it's so clear
let's call the newspapers drinking 5
cups of coffee a day protects against
Parkinson's no it doesn't got it wrong
correlation does not mean causation as
an enormous trap be careful so it's I
hope enough of a good story
and you'll remember I have this and it's
why I don't drink coffee that maybe it
will help you be aware in the future
watch out your results might not be as
potent as you think so now instead of
spending time wasting time someone
should say and and it should be you why
don't we do a small simple fast and
frugal little trial it will help us
address this instead of endlessly
debating and if you get in the habit of
that and others in your organization get
in the habit of that you will change
everything I often talk to people about
well culture change and and the answer
is you cannot change your culture oh
maybe you can but it's going to take a
long time and it's going to happen just
like this if everyone will do some small
simple thing you'll find that you become
a culture of scientists a culture of
experimenters a culture of people open
willing to take a small risk a culture
willing to learn and that's my
definition of agile so I have a list of
recommendations for those of you really
want to get involved and you know I like
to give away books so I have a copy here
of the y-axis so I'll just put it right
here maybe it will disappear oh it's
already gone of course I want you to buy
fearless change and more fearless change
and joy to read about a culture of
experimentation but before you tell me
oh Linda my organization is too big
we're a bank after all that's what I
heard yesterday we are a bank we have
restrictions we have rules here we have
procedures we can't do it
oh yes you can because here's the prime
example as part of the UK government now
talk about conservative talk about
restricted by rules come on what could
be worse than the UK government well
could be the US government I suppose or
the Danish government or the Swedish
government and they have a group of
people whose job it is to do fast frugal
small simple experiments and in the
process they learn and in the process
they are saving the UK government a lot
of money
are you interested now yes check it out
the behavioural insights team it's
actually moved to become more
independent now but that's because they
have been so successful they are not
just helping the UK government they are
helping governments around the world and
their approach is exactly what I have
been saying today lots of fast frugal
small simple ways of addressing issues
not with the idea of tackling a big
problem for instance how do we get
people to pay taxes when they have
refused up to this point it has a big
problem no we're not solving it but we
know a very simple way to encourage more
people to do that and I'm not going to
give you the answer to that I'm going to
let you go to that website then check it
out so if the government can do it you
can do it if they are getting awesome
results you can get awesome results if
they can be creative you can be creative
just try it
start running your own trials that's how
you learn to walk that's how you learn
to talk if you weren't a natural
scientist when you were a child you
wouldn't have learned to
anything you did lots of little simple
trials how did you learn to walk on
schedule did your parents come in and
say okay you're 2 years old now I think
we'll give you two weeks let's let's
start walking No
you stood up you fell down you took a
step you fell down you crawled forward
and then grabbed ahold of something and
then fell down over and over and over be
a child I think it's time for you to go
