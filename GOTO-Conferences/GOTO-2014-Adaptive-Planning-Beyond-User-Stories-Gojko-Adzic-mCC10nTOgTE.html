the story scanner in a form like this
have become the kind of de facto
standard for doing requirements
unfortunately for projects user stories
were never intended to be requirements
they were intended to be talking to
discuss requirements but we ended up
with these things being requirements and
more and more there's a kind of
disconnect between what people want to
achieve from a business perspective and
what gets pushed out which kind of
Gabriel talked about and all the other
people at the district talked about
today and I think the major reason for
the disconnect is senior business
stakeholders it as a consultant I mostly
work with senior business stakeholders
couldn't care less about this when you
go and talk to senior business
stakeholders all the stuff they care
about is always in PowerPoint and it
looks like this so sorry I'm flipping
tooth so always always always in
PowerPoint and this is how people start
describing roadmaps this is a road map
you can see roadmap dot PDF in the URL
and because this is being filmed I'm
obliged to say that I have the right to
use this in fair use policy because
there will be criticizing this later and
kind of generally what we tend to do
with this it is a huge disconnect
between kind of the stuff that we have
in this form and the stuff that business
people actually care about this here and
stuff that's like this typically is
buzzword compliant so there's something
that's kind of enterprise its mobile its
cloud you can't invent this it kind
of if I try to make it so bad I wouldn't
be able to do that so all the popular
buzzwords are there there's a plan for
the next nine quarters it's a fantastic
roadmap is anybody do been doing web
development in the 90s here there's a
couple of people do you remember cold
fusion in the 90s
cold fusion varieties was the platform
of the day it was amazing it was built
it was great
cold fusion today is a uniquely
irrelevant product where I I don't know
whether it's kind of because of this
I really like to think about Konami the
reason is white because they do road
maps like this so kind of what tends to
happen is there's a massive disconnect
between kind of user stories in this and
we try to plug the disconnect by putting
a ton of user stories into tools like
this and then it makes even less sense
and I love the fact that JIRA is an
issue tracker because by the time you
have 500 user stories in general you
have a massive issue that kind of needs
to be solved somehow and Jim Shaw wrote
about this in 2005 he called kind of
this story card Hell where kind of you
you can no longer do anything with this
and all this stuff is doing kind of both
this and kind of this is a bunch of
linear thinking plans all these things
need to happen and for some insane
reason we talk to people about agile
being flexible being adaptive user
stories being kind of we can discuss
these things later but we don't actually
want that most business senior business
stakeholders I work with all they want
is certainty they want everything darlin
they want everything done yesterday and
this is a shopping list of things they
expect people to kind of deliver maybe
in a slightly different order but it's a
shopping list of things that people have
committed to even worse
what I see in big companies is people
have to do kind of some estimation on
this stuff and then that becomes kind of
a huge commitment at the end and people
get held to that and then can we start
measuring velocity and all the other
stupid stuff that people have already
talked about today so what one of the
biggest puzzles for me is why do we have
to fight for flexibility because that
sounds completely insane in most other
industries flexibility is something you
actually pay for if you look at kind of
airline tickets a flexible ticket cost
twice as much a flexible train tickets
if the train people are not on strike
costs twice as much and things like that
so kind of it's it's really a big
problem why do we have to sell
flexibility couple of years ago I worked
with this team I took over a team where
they were a year and a half late to
deliver stuff
then the business sponsor started
panicking because they had to release
stuff in about four weeks where the
senior business stakeholder meeting
where we went through the whole list 90%
of the scope was discovered we kind of
kept the same people restructured the
whole thing and in four weeks we
delivered a minimum set of stuff that
people actually wanted now the big
question is why have they spent a year
and a half doing that nobody wanted
the UK government kind of a couple of
years ago cancelled the project that
went 7 billion pounds over budget it was
originally budgeted of 5 billion it wins
7 billion over budget at the point will
each need reached 12 the Chancellor said
well it's not really that important and
canceled it how do you even spend that
much money on something that's not
really that important I mean and this is
completely C now the problem with
flexibility in software is we have to
fight for it but I'm kind of all the
plans are designed to the very very
linear and the thing with flexibility is
flexibility has value because unexpected
things happen all the time
okay so um unexpected stuff happens
unexpected stuff happens not because of
us unexpected stuff happens because of
other people and their kids problems if
you're trying to do any kind of
long-term planning for example couple of
to two months ago there was a fantastic
time limited offer on eBay absolutely
fantastic it was a a to paly of
strategic bomba that the conditions were
really really interesting so that the
item condition is used um it was kind of
three million dollars uh and the payment
thing was cash in person absolutely
amazing offer if you you know you can
buy a strategic bomber ultimate cheaply
if you wanted the trick is you'd have to
pick it up in Ukraine because the
original owners were coming to get it
and kind of somebody had to get rid of
it really really quickly so this stuff
happens in business all the time it
happens because unexpected circuit
stances change the way we can deliver
stuff or open up new opportunities or
close some opportunities we thought we
had and this is where flexibility is
great if we are able to act on these
things and actually kind of spot that
the ground is shifting then companies
can get a lot of benefit from agile
unfortunately according to Forrester
Research by far the most popular agile
process out there is waters come fall
which they describe as all the business
decisions are made up front then you
children can go and play a scale and
measure velocity and whatever you want
and then we know we'll wait for it to
marinate at the end and kind of improve
so we actually take it live and in
situations like that the organization is
just not getting any benefits of a team
being able to deliver it two weeks
because all the decisions were made
upfront so then these things happen all
the time because of Russians or because
of Google or you know you don't know
who's more evil these days
and one thing I'm doing at the moment is
amun working on this collaboration mind
mapping collaboration tool and we had a
thing like this happening to us a couple
of months ago so this is our user base
as as it's grown over time and III have
a kind of a bit of bragging to do
because I know total number of users is
horribly vanity metric and it can only
go up and you can't make any useful
decision based on that but a couple of
days ago we went over 1 million users so
one minutes one minute I can
brag about that you know even if it's a
vanity metric so this part here a couple
of months ago when it really started
taking off so for two years we've built
kind of features and things like that
the part where it really started taking
off was a checkbox and I can say this
point you know all it took us to do a
checkbox but you need to know what -
which checkbox to tick and we we were
kind of at that part over there we were
working on trying to increase the number
of users and it kind of we had some
success you can see it was a bit rocky
and we got an angry email from a
university administrator in the US and
he said why we done it so stupidly I
need to add all of my users man
what are you talking about well you know
I need to go and approve all these
people to access Google Drive manually
sorry I'm kind of you know my brains not
processing this what we expected is
people want to save stuff to Google
Drive the dialog pops up would you like
to do it you say yes it proceeds and
that's it now I had no idea that in US
universities kind of there's a second
step where students basically say I'd
like to and then somebody else has to
say yes and this guy was really angry
because lots of his students wanted to
use the stuff and he got requests daily
to kind of click yes yes yes yes yes and
apparently there's a function that
Google provides to universities where
the guy can just say all of them it
doesn't matter it's approved as a domain
and while you I didn't know about that
so we got that email we investigated
that a bit I found the check box I took
the stupid check box all of the sudden
he cannot date handle of his students
lots of other universities cannot be
students and we shoot up so it's one of
these unexpected things that opened up
because I had no idea about that nobody
else knew I mean if I was the smartest
person in the world fine I'd find that
but this was an unexpected thing now
what we've done then is after the first
week or so we just dropped the rest of
the scope for that milestone because we
didn't need it anymore one check box
achieved much more than all the features
that we were planning to build and we
have achieved what we wanted therefore
we can move on to something much more
important now whenever I look at kind of
the you know 500 user stories in here I
ask people how would you know that the
first 20 stories have not already
achieved what you want how would you
know that you're not you know why why
would you need to deliver all 500 I mean
how would you know that even after 500
you still achieved what you want I mean
is there maybe you need 500 more and
most people kind of declare victory
based on time a sprint succeeds because
two weeks expired fantastic what you've
just proven is you know two weeks have
10 working days and that's brilliant you
know that's that's fantastic so I you
know if we are able to do this stuff
or systematically if we're able to do
this stuff not in a case of an emergency
like those people panicking because they
have to release tomorrow and then they
accept flexible scope kind of did you
know that they dare the burning platform
and then they had to they were really
open to flexible planning they were open
to everything we were proposing and we
got there on time now how do we do this
for a company so they don't have to
spend a year and a half delivering
stupid stuff then get into a crisis and
then in the moment of crisis expect
lexical scope so why don't you know how
do we do this more systematically that's
really been bugging me over the last
couple of years I have a couple of ideas
that I'd like to share with you and one
thing that's really really important
there is to realize that kind of if
scope isn't flexible the organizations
that will work and do not have any
benefit from agile looks zero benefit
there's some technical benefit in terms
of okay you know we're going to release
stuff with less bugs or we can kind of
have more we're more proud of the way we
technically the stuff but the
organization's do not really benefit if
we were able to do flexible scope we
couldn't recognize these unexpected
situations that all of the sudden make
it much simpler we can recognize
situations where a checkbox is more than
six months of development and really
really benefit from that so we need to
start doing this more systematically now
I've done a ton of research on this in
terms of flexible planning flexible
scope how do people engage their
business user and things like that and
they found lots of solutions for this
outside of software this is not a
software problem other industries have
had this problem for a long time they've
solved this problem already
so going back in history how far do you
think we need to go to find a truly
iterative project where the product
owner was involved on the daily basis
and he was kind of providing changing
specs and requirements the team was
reacting to this and kind of a really
big enterprise thing was delivered on
time and budget not kind of small stuff
I'm not talking about building a
doghouse serious serious stuff how far
do you mean do we need to go back in
history never happened okay so I I found
a project in
16:28 this is a big massive government
scale project where they were doing
iterative design they were doing
refinement they were doing kind of
everything that scum talks about and
fast feedback and things like that and
they deliver the thing on time and
budget although the product owner
changed his opinion 5 million times and
lots of scrum teams especially larger
organizations today I'm you know
government is horribly bureaucratic but
go go to companies this thing still
happens the product owner is not the
real product owner the product owner
just the proxy to a proxy to a proxy to
a proxy to a proxy to another decision
maker this guy was the product owner the
decision maker the product owner was the
king 16:28 the king pretty much owned
everything so he owned the land he owned
everything so and this was a government
project done in Sweden Sweden in 1628
was an up-and-coming European power and
what they were trying to do is they were
trying to make a statement they were
trying to make a statement there now one
of the kind of real powers of Europe and
in 1628 if you wanted to make a
statement what you would do is you would
build a big ship that everybody scared
from and they decided to build this
massive massive ship that would have
been the pride of kind of Swedish nation
and the technology at this point was
really interesting because 16 hundreds
it was just becoming viable to put
cannons ownership the size of the
cannons in 1500 was so big you couldn't
kind of really transport them to a more
kind of thick stuff sixteen hundreds
they were just becoming viable to put on
ships it's very like today where there
was a kind of shift in technology with
on premise deployments and cloud
deployments and people can't really
decide so the King couldn't really
decide if he wanted an on-premise
deployment where you put lots of Marines
on a ship you're Amish ship into another
ship they jump over the kill everybody
or whether he went to the cloud
deployment where you put lots of cannon
ownership you just come close you shoot
and you kind of sink the other ship so
he couldn't really decide so one day
he'd come and say bigger ship more
cannons other day he'd come and say no
no no kind of make it more narrow so it
goes faster make it really agile it's
faster we put Marines on
nord is not ready yet for canners then
he'd come and see know what we want
these two ships so pick the whole thing
apart and they've pick the whole thing
apart they started assembling two ships
then a month later he came and said no
no no no this is a stupid idea because
two ships are not enough for people to
be scared from ab large large ship and
this project is famous for delivering
one of the marvels of shipbuilding on
time and budget they were able to make
it on time and budget and they build
this marvelous thing we you can see
today in the in the kind of stockholm
museum it's amazing it's brilliant if
you're in stockholm go and see it
because we can learn so much from this
project the thing was shipped on time
and budget and because it's the ship it
was literally shipped so it was shipped
and then about the kilometer a half
later toppled over and sank into the
cold seas of Sweden because the day
before shipping the product owner came
he said more cannons on the top and it
sank into the cold seas of Sweden where
it was preserved for us to observe today
is a marvelous piece of kind of project
management so instead of kind of
everybody else being scared of Sweden
they become a laughingstock and because
they also almost bankrupted the country
doing this so kind of the real lesson
from this is that flexible scope is
horribly dangerous until you're working
towards a bigger picture lots of people
that do flexible scope today they do
this kind of stream of consciousness
where anybody can suggest anything and
anything goes and you know the fact that
I was drunk yesterday and I dreamt of an
iPhone app means that all my teams now
need to work on iPhones and stuff less
it's really dangerous to do this these
people almost bankrupted the whole
country lots of companies fail horribly
because they end up not delivering
anything for months and months and
months they deliver small increments
that lead to nothing so we need to work
out how to kind of fix this and I think
one of the really interesting things to
look at is again why does this happen
and and there was a Russian engineer at
the turn of the 20th century who
invented Lean Startup about 150 years
ago in a completely different
industry and he said that most linear
plans will fail because of the things we
cannot plan for things that do not
depend on us things that depend on
Google on Russians on you know somebody
else and where people assume that kind
of things are going to play out as they
think they will but on any kind of
longer project there's three
unpredictable dimensions that are going
to happen and this guy was called Peter
Paul schinsky I'll give you a couple of
references for his stuff later but he
said there's three typical dimensions
that mess up stuff this is a local
dimension where something might work
really well in one territory but doesn't
really translate to another territory
and we expect that it's going to happen
like that
and in this skinny nighty this might
mean desktop to mobile or it might mean
Geographic territories or it might mean
other stuff and for example on this
collaboration tool we had a big problem
one day when we started getting a ton of
end-user errors from Spain we have error
monitoring to kind of tell us if people
are experiencing problems and we started
getting a ton of end-user errors from
Spain and this is really weird because
the software is not localized at all we
should not be getting problems from one
country compared to any other country
and we started investigating this and he
turns out that kind of you you know
chrome started automatically translating
pages for people and Spanish people have
those weird upside-down question marks
that are not kind of an ASCII character
and because we were using button labels
in our code to figure out what maps to
what the translated label wouldn't match
this thing and actually broke a piece of
code because it was a unicode character
we started getting problems like that
kind of the it's impossible for me to
know that up front
things like this happen unexpectedly and
kind of the second dimension part risky
talks about is a time-based dimension
way you start doing something and then
you know the ground shifts for example
with this thing our original business
plan was to offer the single user
version for free but to charge for
multi-user collaboration in real time
halfway through implementing multi-user
collaboration Google again you know
released the real-time API which meant
that pretty much
anybody anywhere in the world could do
real-time collaboration for free on
Google's architecture it is honestly
gonna be better than what we can provide
and this completely invalidated our
business plan because we thought this is
going to be a unique advantage now
anybody can kind of implement this stuff
on their architecture I said okay you
know time based dimension hit us what we
can do is we can turn this into a
competitive advantage and if anybody can
do this for free we're gonna be the
first ones so we dropped a ton of kind
of our code we migrated everything to
Google we started offering real-time
collaboration for free and about a month
later when can we got reviewed in PC
while the live Huck the comments were
all you know we can't believe that these
people are offering collaboration for
free nobody else does that Google's
paying for it so I might as well get
something back from them for all the
private information they stole so it's
kind of so I'm and kind of the third
dimension that patiska talks about this
human we're kind of people you can't
really control them it's kind of they
can decide to use or abuse or misuse or
not use your software and or use it for
a completely different purpose or kind
of stuff like that and you don't really
know that because humans are
unpredictable that the best case about
this is the IBM PC junior that's I
remembered in the history of product
management is the second worst product
launch ever I think they did wasted
about two billion dollars I'm not
entirely sure about the kind of file
number and this whole thing was done
exactly according to customer
requirements antonovic was the program
lead wrote a book called what customers
want based on that and he kind of said
that they built the whole thing based on
kind of what customers were telling them
they want but then nobody wanted to buy
the machine humans are unpredictable so
kind of these three dimensions do not
depend on us these three dimensions
depend on everybody else that's why it's
impossible to plan for this stuff and
what we can do if we do this properly we
can turn unexpected circumstances into a
competitive advantage because pretty
much the same unexpected circumstances
are going to hit your competition as
well now the question is are you going
to kind of die or survive or actually
turn the
into a competitive advantage when it
happens and be faster than the
competition and I think this is what the
big advantage of iterative deliver is if
we can spot the ground moving we can be
the first to react so um but risky
defined three principles for adaptive
planning the turns this into a
competitive advantage and a guy called
Tim Harford who's a British economist
slightly reformulated them I like his
definitions better so I'll show you his
definitions and he described it in a
book called adapt where you can see lots
of really great kind of case studies
from adaptive planning in economics in
marketing civil engineering and a lot of
other stuff so the first principle he
formulate is variation which is
basically we have no idea what's really
going to work or not even with the best
ideas humans might not want to use our
stuff or might use it differently
what kind of local changes might cause
problems so the best thing we can do is
try out lots of different things and
then when we tried the lots of different
things what we can do is we can try
those things on a scale that's
survivable can none of these experiments
should cost us too much we shouldn't
bankrupt the country we shouldn't not be
able to do another ship if this one
sinks and the third one is selection
which is kind of out of the things we
tried out figure out which one worked
which one didn't work and basically you
can see he's going in to kind of lean
startup stuff that's why I said he
invented Lean Startup a hundred fifty
years ago
and kind of these things would be really
really great if we could apply them
properly and I think user stories have
the promise of being able to do this and
that's why I think spending five more
minutes per user story can actually help
us do this now what Paul Chryst is
talking about these kind of plans that
have options plans that have a selection
criteria plans that have survivable
experiments what he's saying effective
is this is not a road map as no options
no selection criteria this succeeds when
nine months expire and everything is a
must
what part rinsky's talking about
effectively is that these are not
roadmaps these things are roadmaps the
trick is in the name maps of roads kind
of if I have a road map like this and I
start here I want to go there well
there's a couple of options if there's a
train drivers strike on one of the
bridge
I can just cross another bridge if all
the people are stuck on one bridge and
the other bridge is completely clear I
can use that to my benefit and I can
replan and think that now the
interesting thing about this is kind of
maps like this I'll also have lots of
options and theoretically we could start
creating road maps like this in software
but this is where kind of flexible plans
start scaring people and if you think
about how we use maps like this in real
life that's changed quite significantly
over the last 10-15 years so I don't
know about you but kind of the way we
use this stuff changed dramatically 15
years ago my wife now that wasn't then
my wife and I would kind of plan a
journey by plotting the whole thing
through them up and then she would drive
I would try to flip through the pages of
kind of a small map and figure out where
he jumps to and things like that and
because it's just small chunks that get
lost very quickly trying to flip things
over and then about half an hour later I
think that consistently happened is we
would do the modern test who's the moron
for not knowing how to read the map
who's the moron for not knowing how to
drive who's an idiot for missing a turn
and things like that and kind of we'd
end up fighting and then we have to stop
we'd have to kind of chill out we'd have
to get a coffee and then we would
replant the whole thing only for kind of
you know half an hour later doing the
same thing over and over again so about
10 years ago we bought a marriage saving
device that stopped us from having to
argue all the time and I strongly
recommend if you're having marriage
problems get one like this because this
you know prevented the modern test we
could now you know if I do have to read
them a putana
I'm you know free to play Angry Birds
and kind of stuff like that to read my
Kindle and if she doesn't make a turn
well you know TomTom D plans magically
not a problem at all if Feraud is
blocked TomTom replants magically not a
problem at all we have live traffic
updates so if a bridge is stuck no
problem at all so the big difference
between this and this is not the options
there we can create options that's easy
and you know then lots of people talked
about either for
options are against real options options
are not the difficult part
anybody can get drunk and create 500
options that's not a problem at all
what GPS has that this stuff doesn't
have is turn-by-turn navigation that's
the that's the really value-add part and
that's the thing that i think we are
missing from software plans so my
challenge for you today is try to create
a GPS that makes the cost of replanting
cheap because the magical part about GPS
is if you take a wrong turn three plans
cheaply you don't have to stop you don't
have to rippln everything and it's kind
of iteratively planning as you go the
other thing the GPS has is a GPS it can
find where you are and it can spot kind
of how far you are from the destination
so it can pretty much tell you when
you're expected to get there so you can
kind of coordinate your other actions if
I know that I'm going to be too late I
can phone up ahead I am not really lost
at any point anymore so these two things
we need to start creating for software
and I think kind of going to but risky
principles we can start creating those
things by changing the way we plan and
we have to change how we approach user
stories so the first part in ski
principle is plan to learn now most of
the companies I work with as a
consultant they use the stories are
basically already commitment we decided
to do this we are not really learning
about the ground shifting or not
shifting if something happens unexpected
and kind of translated to user stories
what plan to learn means is kind of
don't approach user stories as a
commitment because some of the user
stories will be right some of the user
stories will be wrong if all your user
stories are always right you're not
really benefiting from the fact that the
team can deliver every two weeks and
kind of Design Thinking talks a lot
about two phases in plans he talks about
how we need to start creating a bunch of
options and then we need to start
selecting among the options and they say
that kind of analysis happens there now
with most teams I work with analysis is
mostly about trying to figure out have
we understood this user story correctly
and team Brown in his book about
thinking by design says that if your
analysis about have we understood this
correctly it's pretty much pointless
because the purpose of analysis needs to
be selecting among different options
that's how you build great products so
translate the user stories that
basically means let's just kind of
figure out what are the options there
let's try lots of different options
let's not consider that any of these
options is going to be necessarily right
or wrong and kind of we need to stop you
know we work with business people to
stop thinking about user stories as
commitments start thinking about user
stories as options we want to deliver
and start approaching them as potential
things to do and then kind of the whole
500 things in JIRA doesn't make sense
anymore at all because it's too deep
it's too far it's kind of too committed
already
and the second part risky principle is
selection where we plan to discard
mistakes if we know that some of these
user stories are not necessarily going
to be correct then the question is how
do we discover how do we discover which
one is correct how do we discover which
one is incorrect and this is the one
where I think we're really really bad at
because if you look at the typical user
story that's kind of something like this
the question is how would you even know
if it succeeded or failed all the unit
tests might pass for the acceptance test
my past the usability thing might pass
then we roll out how would we know if
we're shipping like the vaster ship that
is going to sink in a kilometer and a
half or I was shipping something that's
actually staying afloat because kind of
originally the intention for this thing
was for this part to tell us that but it
just does not have enough information
for selection there's no selection
criteria here there's no criteria what
would make this a success so the key
question is you know when we deliver
this user story this person is able to
monitor the inventory fine before the
user story was even started he was able
to do the same thing he can go to the
warehouse and count the boxes he can
look at the legacy system he's able to
monitored inventory after this thing is
done he's able to monitor the inventory
so what have we done and this is where
kind of five minutes per story comes in
one of my biggest lessons over the last
five years is start rejecting stories
like this and when they come in say well
how differently is this person going to
be able to monitor the inventory what's
the change you actually want to create
and then people start getting really
confused so what you make changes well
imagine we invest time and money in
delivering this and nothing changes in
the way people actually work it's
probably a waste of time or even we mess
up the way they work we change it in a
kind of completely problematic dimension
so what's your expected change so the
question is not will they be able to
monitor the material how differently
will they be able to monitor the
inventory and then let's say okay more
accurately and say okay so at the moment
the current system is not accurate
enough oh no no the current system is
great okay why are we doing a legacy
migration then um cheaper okay in what
way cheaper well now we need 10 people
to monitor the inventory when this is
done we'll need five so you're going to
find five people no so how is it gonna
be cheaper oh it won't
okay so how differently and then kind of
iterate on this and somebody says old
faster and if it passes the kind of
first test in terms of all it actually
makes sense then you can start taking
this story in as an option and whatever
learn is just discussing how differently
eliminates 70% of cap because people
can't tell you how differently and then
they realize it's a bad idea because it
won't kind of give them anything
so Gabrielle talked about outcomes and
outputs and things Leighton this is the
outcome the outcome is that somebody can
do something differently if they do
everything the same is they used to do
before then we've not generated any
outcome it's just stupid stuff we
generated velocity most schemes measure
they're kind of
iteration success on the basis of
velocity and velocity translates to time
it's a really expensive way to measure
how many hours that are in a week
it doesn't measure anything else it just
measures how many hours there are in a
week divided by team members you get how
many working days you had
so the best thing velocity can tell you
whether this week had a holiday or not
if you had a bank holiday I'll have less
velocity if you hadn't didn't have a
bank holiday I have more velocity that's
the only thing you can learn from
velocity you can't select the story
based on that and if we talk about
something that's doing something
differently then we get to a point where
user stories Italy become useful and we
can do selection so the critical thing
about doing selection 500 minutes per
user stories describe a behavior change
reject stories that are not about
behavior changes and try to get a
behavior change in every user story and
if you user stories can get to behavior
change then you get to selection
criteria you get the expected outcome
all of the sudden the stuff Gabriela
talked about you can actually do and
this is not such a big mental shift for
people it's no more than 5 to 10 minutes
per story because the really brilliant
thing about change is a change should be
observable a change should be
quantifiable when somebody comes to
assess faster the next question is well
how much faster
how much fast did you want this to be
10% 50% five trillion percent you know
is this user story at all a good
solution for that is it going the right
direction at all what do we measure at
the end and even without being able to
measure it lots of people say it's
difficult to measure and things that
even without being able to measure it
there's a huge benefit in quantifying
that Tom Gill talks about this Doug
Herbert talks about this just
quantifying stuff provides clarity even
if it's difficult and expensive to
measure try to quantify it somebody
might say okay with the user story like
this we need to make it 50% faster to
make it sensible and then you say is
this really gonna do 50 percent No
so let's do something else and kind of
the the third part is key principle that
kind of hartford talks about is
survivability
when we do these things we know that
some user stories will be correct some
user stories will not be
just you know they'll turn out to be bad
ideas so we should really do these
things on a way that is not going to
kill the company a nine-month plan that
comes together at the end is not a road
map it's a road it's a road going
through a tunnel that comes in on one
end comes out on another end and then
you realize that kind of you know you're
in the middle of an ocean and you're
drowning so the we need to do this stuff
so we sexually survive and not kill the
company now when most people sell use
the stories they sell use the stories as
a they're small chunks of functionality
we can fit into a sprint it's correct
but it's perfectly useless is an
expression because business people
couldn't care less about that because
kind of then you start talking about
different granularities of things so you
say oh this kind of some business goal
and then some business change is like
getting somebody do something faster
then is these epics that nobody
understands what they are but kind of
their epic and then you have these
stories and then kind of you have your
two-week funnel at the end and stories
need to be small to fit into sprint all
the business people here are at this
point is bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
bla bla bla bla bla bla bla technical
stuff you might as well talk in CSS for
XPath we'd see the same stuff so user
stories theoretically
are a great fit for this kind of horse
survivability thing but we're selling
them completely wrongly because we're
selling them as small sets of scope they
end up in JIRA they end up kind of in
crap like this that you can't manage
anymore and that's pointless what I
think we should be selling is we should
be selling a flexible ticket going back
to kind of the Eurostar ticket it cost
twice as much if it's flexible the key
question is to be how much would you pay
not to have to be right hey some of the
stuff is going to work out some is not
like how much we're willing to bet this
is a good idea and our selling insurance
policy against that and the insurance
policies we do a two-week iteration and
we do a quick test how much you willing
to pay for the insurance policy it's a
flexible approach it's a flexible ticket
has value because unexpected stuff
happens all the time now kind of going
back to this stuff when I talk to senior
business stakeholders on the level of
business goals
everybody knows that they might not be
correct everybody knows that the
Russians might do something Google might
do something your competitors might do
something people expect unexpected
things to happen there on the level of
business changes same stuff as you go
down more towards software stuff we
start thinking about commitment we start
thinking about linearity we start
thinking about certainty and that's why
I think user stories are great to raise
the level of discussion more to kind of
impacts on people and behavior changes
and then say how certain are you that
this is going to happen like this and if
you have no competition if you uses our
captive audience that can make no
decisions on their own so there's no
human factor there if there's no time
based factor so what you're doing is
incredibly stable nothing's gonna change
nobody's gonna mess up with you and
there's no kind of local context this is
going to mess it up you don't need a
flexible ticket I've never worked with a
business like that and you know if you
work in a business situation like that
agile is probably not a good solution
for you but once you start talking to
business people about all those
dimensions that can change and they
realize that all the stuff on the top
can actually kind of turn out to be
different then you say okay imagine
we've broken this stuff down so ever
business change of getting somebody to
do something faster we have 28 Peaks we
have 400 user stories for that now
imagine a fluke happens and a checkbox
does all that should you actually go and
deliver all the user stories probably
not
imagine you start delivering this stuff
and the first 20 user stories don't
really move anything in the right
direction they move it in the wrong
direction should you go and keep
delivering stuff or do we need to stop
and figure out where we are and people
kind of start getting the whole idea of
a flexible ticker there because it
allows us to replan so in order to do
this stuff we have to change user
stories from kind of stuff like this and
we have to change our language about
user stories from being small chunks of
scope to being small bets buy the
business and this is where we can start
kind of approaching user stories more as
a survivor of experiments like what was
the thing we can try first that's
relatively safe well we're not going to
make a huge mistake if you make a
mistake
and then we can start moving on to
something larger we can start moving on
to some other areas of uncertainty so
kind of if you remember one thing from
today remember that kind of good user
stories really need to be solved as
survivable experiments that's what
people understand that's what business
people can connect you to stop talking
about user stories at all start thinking
about survival experiments and one of
the critical things to put this into
perspective where we have variability we
have survivability where selection is we
need to start moving away from linear
backlogs but rinsky talks about linear
plans linear plans just give you an idea
that there is a certainty and we need to
start moving away from linear
backgrounds there's a couple of emerging
techniques from key for creating
hierarchical backlogs that put things
into perspective I don't really have
time to go through them today but I can
give you some you know a couple of
references to look at so the first thing
that I think is good to investigate is
called impact mapping but mapping is a
visualization of scope like
we do these things to create these
behavior changes for these people and
this is the business goal we have so it
kind of visualizes assumptions it
creates a map of roads that are all
assumptions that you can try out the
other thing that's really really useful
several people mentioned this already is
Jeff Patton's story mapping Jeff
Burton's tore him up in where kind of he
organizes stories into a hierarchy that
then allows people to kind of vertically
position them and think about options
and things that so all of these things
are pretty good but I think I'm kind of
as he did different tools apply to
different situation the trial can all
not work with linear backlogs tried to
create a hierarchical backlog for your
software that's going to help people
start thinking about options start
thinking about selection start thinking
about competition because when you have
20 30 stories that contribute to the
same impact if the first story's done it
well you have achieved what you want you
can discard the others and correctly the
first impact achieves the business goal
again you can throw out everything else
from the plan you don't need to spend
all time so all these things help us
have this conversation better so kind of
the key conclusion from today is that
good user stories if you want to correa
get a benefit from agile
need to be kind of survivable
experiments about kind of some potential
options for changing behavior chip for
causing a behavior change and that the
five minutes per story that I really
really encourage you to do to start
creating a turn-by-turn navigation for
your software is this behavior change
because you then you can know whether
you've made the next turn you know what
the next turn looks like and you can
figure out where you are on the map so
that's kind of um pretty much it so I
said it's not really important which of
these techniques you use because
different tools apply to different
contexts in February last year we had a
big meeting in London where lots of
people from different perspectives came
in to use something like this already
and we started comparing all those
techniques and we identified four core
principles that all of these techniques
allow people to do so it doesn't matter
which tool you use but kind of try and
focus more on the principles and we said
well that the really great results
happen when everybody pretty much knows
why they're doing the work so the
business goal is clear to everybody and
then we can make better decisions so
that kind of that the road map in
PowerPoint is useless if he does not
communicate some measurable business
goals that are going to be the center of
our map how do we know whether we've
reached our destination or how do we
measure the distance to destination
that's kind of that the middle part of
the GPS then the second thing is instead
of measuring outputs instead of
measuring features instead of measuring
velocity I mean velocity is good to
measure whether you're stuck or not but
it becomes less important when you're
moving at a reasonable speed so instead
of focusing too much on that
organizations should focus on kind of
delivering outcomes and impacts not on
delivering features and the third thing
is that we need to be able to kind of
get a decision what to do next based on
direct use of our stuff not whether we
think it's going to be used but is it
actually being used like that and
knowing with certainty whether we've
made the next turn or not
so although big level business goes
difficult he takes a long time to
measure you're doing something to
increase you know your your competitive
advantage or to reduce operational costs
that thing changes on a higher scale on
own or to kind of six-month period
changes in people's behaviors are
relatively easy to measure so you know
whether you've made the next turn or not
and that's why can we can use that as an
indicator for future planning and if we
can get our organizations to decide what
to do next based on immediate and direct
feedback on those impacts we can
actually start benefiting from being
agile and the last part we kind of we
put it in because everybody liked it
it's not really it's kind of one of
these same things be happy in life but I
think kind of after aftercare of people
start focusing this stuff I really see
that everybody starts really caring
about those outcomes and impacts and
business goals people stop caring about
features anymore and that's the real
kind of mental shift that they see in
organization so kind of that's pretty
much it that's what I wanted to talk to
you about all this stuff I've written up
in my latest book that's called 50 quick
ideas to improve your user stories and
as a thank you for spending an hour with
me today if you go to this URL you you
kind of you can get it for free because
the URL automatically applies the
discount code that reduces the price to
zero so um that's pretty much it I don't
arrive over on my under it's perfect
okay um so do we have time for questions
or okay does this make sense at all good
okay so does anybody have any any kind
of particular questions that would
prevent you from sleeping well tonight
anyone got a question yeah
hold on this gentleman he was first what
do you do if you don't have real contact
to your users so if you cannot really
validate your ideas immediately ah so
that depends on the reason why you know
lots of different situations exist may
be you know the regulatory changes
required to release once a year but then
you can do some user testing you
do demo workshops you can do stuff like
to prove that this thing will create a
behavior change or something like that
so the other stuff is where you work
with completely remote people and you're
working through five levels of proxies
we're a really good thing to do is just
start reporting on this stuff start
creating hierarchical backlog and start
coming up with a reasonable assumption
what behavior change you'll be creating
and then try and kind of measure the
stuff and important that people can do
log files you can do analytics you can
do lots of other ways of trying to
measure this stuff you can do use the
research workshops you can do there's
lots of ways of doing that but kind of
people very often give up on that
because it's kind of expensive to do
Doug Hubbard wrote about this in in his
book on how to measure anything he said
that most people kind of tend to measure
stuff that's easy to measure not what's
important because the cost of
measurement is the major putas factor he
said that's because people don't
consider the value of a piece of
information and there's a couple of
models in his book about the value of a
piece of information one of the models
it's really good is the value of a piece
of information is proportional to the
decision it informs so the question is
how valuable is the decision that you
can make based on this and if it's a
flexible ticket that's going to allow
the business to spot problems and kind
of save money and things like that then
this value in that information then
there's a value in kind of measuring
that piece of information and then you
can work back from that if it's kind of
you tried to measure stuff that nobody's
going to making decisions on then people
will fight you and very very often what
I see is people don't have context
contact with real users because all of
their measurements are kind of
irrelevant for the business so if you
start proposing stuff that's actually
relevant for business people to make
decisions they might start measuring
themselves and what I've seen in
contexts like kind of proxy proxy proxy
proxy proxy where you just start
reporting on this stuff and then your
first proxy sees this can't be right and
then they go and talk take you to their
proxy and their processes this can't be
right and then kind of it goes up and
then it comes down and then at some
point people actually start engaging
with you better so if you can't
proactively do that you can at least
start reporting on this so that's what
idea
thank you there's another question here
and then I'm totally fine with your
approach but I masturbation is since
developers are humans as we all they
would rather when they have the option
to choose from several routes and the
roadmap they would rather choose the
most simple ones or the things that
limiting story about this so I worked
with the day I worked with a big bank I
because he's being filmed I can't really
tell you which one and they were going
to go on a two-year rewrite and because
they're doing a two-year right of course
they're gonna do this color because you
know why not they replacing 20 different
systems with one system to rule them all
and we were starting to look at kind of
this stuff and we tightened to starting
to group these things into kind of you
know they already had a backlog of two
years we're trying to figure out well
which one first you know you have 20
different business goals you have 50
behavior changes which one first and
then they realize it's one of the most
important behavior changes is for
mortgage managers to make decisions more
consistently that's what we discovered
as a behavior change and then we said
okay why you know what's what's
important there and that's what the
regulator is actually pushing them to do
because they bought 20 small banks each
of the banks has a separate system they
want to do it differently and now
current is a lot of risk so we started
doing this and then one of the technical
architect said exactly as you said well
if that's what you wanna achieve an
Excel spreadsheet can do that for you
and there was a kind of moment of
silence there where people were kind of
saying well the regulator is never gonna
prove that so well does the regulator
have anything particular against Exxon
maybe you use you know numbers and luck
or you know the Google Spreadsheets is
Excel a problem no no the regulator is
never gonna prove that because you're
not recording the decision said okay if
we do an Excel spreadsheet it will put
the button that this is record this
decision that uploads the Excel to us
file share which is backed up look we
have recorded the decision it's not the
best way to record decision but it was
recorded people can start making
decisions more consistently tomorrow and
people look
you know then and the project manager
then said but if we do this and people
like it in the branches will never get
the funding for a proper solution and
the head of credit risk said well if we
do this and they like it in the branches
surely this is the proper solution and
they've done that you know they rolled
it out very quickly then kind of a week
later they decided a it's going in a
direction but kind of the whole file
system thing isn't really good should
they built a small website to kind of
try to do this stuff done they've
decided they don't actually have to
rewrite 20 different systems in Scala
because that was the biggest thing so
it's a brilliant developers want to do
something simple easy if I can find a
simple and easy way to achieve the
impact that is the proper solution the
problem with all the complicated stuff
is people have no idea what impacts you
wanna achieve we get stuff as oh you
know I'm a mortgage manager therefore I
need all these forms I need all this
date I need all these regular two
reports and it kind of if all you want
to do is make decisions more
consistently you don't need to replace
the old system you need to do something
that is kind of so that's an absolutely
brilliant thing that we can use that to
our advantage
you know developers are lazy I'm a lazy
person I want to do stuff easy and move
on so that's absolutely brilliant I
don't know whether I've confused your
hair or answer your question yeah mostly
I was more thinking about projects that
run out of time and then let's me so
often a bad idea to do the easiest thing
or the quickest things when they are
useless when you didn't but that's
because you know people are focusing on
pushing out features not pushing out
outcomes so you focus on pushing out
outcomes and you measure what to do next
based on that then you don't get into
that position so whenever I hear
something like that and look at what
people are measuring is success they're
measuring whether it's kind of it's
Friday afternoon our iterations finished
not whether somebody is actually doing
something 10% faster so okay the answer
says thanks last question I think
that's really contextual I don't know
the question is how how useful is the
stuff you built already in that
particular Indy in this particular thing
where I mentioned we we just kind of
threw away whatever what was was built
in a year and a half because they were
doing completely wrong things what they
were mostly focusing on what inputs into
the system they were not regenerating
and useful reports out and we just built
a way to get the same reports from the
legacy system so that's really a
contextual question I don't know it
depends but kind of I I think one of the
biggest fallacies people have is kind of
discourse anchor cost where you've
invested a year and a half into
something and then you need to fix it
because there's so much investment there
and again that's because people are not
focusing on outcomes and impacts they're
focusing on keeping their investment
there so if you think about oh you know
this is the impact we want to achieve
there's a way with the existing system
is going to cause this much there's a
way with kind of an Excel spreadsheet is
going to cause that much kind of then
give give doses to options I mean as a
technical person or even as an external
consultant very often it's not up to me
to make a decision but it's up to me to
present the options and then people can
make a decision
our company the controllers have goals
like you have to pray how could they not
they're not particularly good product
owners sob you found your problem that's
that's a problem that's not a conclusion
that's a you know you you need to kind
of get them to understand what the
product on erection needs to do so yeah
but is this gonna you know again I'm
sorry for your question not being fully
answered and I'm sorry there are more
questions but we have a meet the
speakers session in five minutes so in
fact you can continue your conversations
and get a more detailed answer and that
way we can be doing it in a relaxed
unfortunately we have to catch a plane
okay so maybe not but I I'm ridiculously
easy to find online it's going that
geico.com so send me an email and and we
can continue talking about that
