I am bent and i'm standing here to go to
Berlin with teeth marks Keith Martin the
author of the book infrastructure called
this morning a dispute with Maricopa
dick and she said something like if
associate code is part of the future of
engineering so we are really happy to
have it here Keith who are you and what
are you doing quality so I'm a
consultant with that works and what I do
is I go in with our software delivery
teams into organizations the wanna
deliver some software and find more
effective ways of delivering software
and I'm increasingly getting involved I
go in with them to talk about to help
with how we managed to pass the
production and how do we interact with
IT operations teams and what I'm
increasingly doing is getting involved
with working with operations size of
organizations and how can they adopt or
agile ways of working how can they use
the tools / of infrastructure automation
using practices from software
engineering so infrastructure as code is
relevant because now infrastructure is
becoming virtualized and becoming cloud
so it's essentially becoming software
becoming data so that means that we can
apply tools from software engineering
life version control systems and we can
apply practices like test-driven
development and continuous integration
and continuous delivery and apply those
to how we manage our infrastructure
which helps us to deliver more quickly
with more reliability than we could
before so the basic principles are to
make sure that we can rebuild any parts
of our systems of our infrastructure
very easily very reliably that we can
keep things configured in a consistent
way and that we have just a high level
of everything is treated as constantly
changing and being able to evolve and
make fixes in through
it's with very low overhead okay no
principles without parents it so what
you're getting into the three made both
involved praxis is such a difficult so
the first practice is to make sure that
you can define your infrastructure in
files that you can treat like source
code so rather than having you I driven
automation tools where you have to point
and click which may not be very
repeatable you want to put into files
that you can put into a version control
system which leads to the second
practice which is testing to apply and
use automated testing to test changes to
your infrastructure every time you make
a change you want to be able to
immediately testing it fast feedback on
whether it's going to bring anything and
I guess the third practice I'd advise is
around I guess continuous delivery so so
taking that testing then being able to
move changes through a pipeline
automatically and make sure in each
environment you're applying changes in
the same way so if you have a high level
of constant confidence that what you put
into production you can put it for us
and easily because you've already done
it in previous environments and you can
be sure that it's going to work and then
just resources inertia is cool to my
existing Susan or dwell to do something
so again shading but I think the best
way to approach it is to find small
chunks that you can start with and to
essentially build for words so rather
than taking an existing instance of
infrastructure and systems and trying to
kind of automate changes to it i would
say how can you replicate that system in
a way that's completely driven through
infrastructure as code so can I have an
image of servers that I can create and
reliably create new servers from the
configuration files to automatically
configure those systems so that you can
do that over and over and over again and
then get that into a position where you
can then move back to become your you're
running the system and do that for one
slice of your system and take that
through to production and
comfortable with how you make changes
then to that system through to
production and then start expanding on
to other parts of your estate oh how I
truly associated cold so the way you do
that assume that you're using a tool
like say terraform and chef to automate
how you create a bit of infrastructure
is every time you make a change you make
a particular change those those files
you want to make sure you have tests
that are going to capture that change
and detect whether it's it worked
correctly you put that test into an
automated script of some kind and commit
that gear your code then over time you
build up you two things you build up
that kind of library of tests which give
you the confidence you make another
change that you're not going to break
something you didn't intend to break and
it also helps to improve the design of
your system because in order to have
this automated testing on your system it
has to be well designed and clean and
decoupled otherwise you know that it is
too difficult to test control how should
I am here with secrets like David
password or so well a first rule is
never to put those secrets in plain text
in your version control system it's just
too vulnerable even if it's a private
repository it's just too vulnerable to
somebody getting access and getting at
those secrets so you can potentially put
them in encrypted form their tools that
help you to encrypt secrets to store in
the version control and then there are
also tools like hash equals vault and
and others which are essentially secret
servers which allow you to store
speakers and manage secrets in a very
controlled way okay thank you very much
and enjoy lumber thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
