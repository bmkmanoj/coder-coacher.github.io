booger coming away from Berlin Germany
Steve coming all the way from the east
coast from Boston yes actually you're
coming from a customer site in Europe
student from bachelor so you both giving
talks here I'm very happy of course um
so I just say yes for stalking I really
love that you went through like some
large-scale deployments and issues and
other problems I could have it and all
the mistakes you may hate along the way
I just have to say I really love those
kinds of talks they're not giving enough
credit because they're dead it's a nice
flashy talks about from vendors that
will explain how their father will rule
the world oh I'll talk as well it's goes
over a series of steps to take to get
your system to where it is today and
your system isn't just one way of doing
things your show about six different
games and how they're different in some
of them and using some use RIA like that
summer early our rubies are JRuby more
talks like that let's actually do that
and your talk is tomorrow I talks
tomorrow it's going to talk about Erlang
and react so how we what we benefit from
in terms of erlangen implementing real
the challenges we face from early
real so talks about her line talks about
react doesn't go into a deep dive into
either one of them but I already
bookmark oh good yeah so now if I'm good
so there's lots of things that we could
talk about I don't know one thing is and
it's interesting that you go to these
conferences like these and goal is hear
about these big flashy deployments of
super large scale systems and at the end
of the day when most people come home
from here you know their systems are
probably not as largely choice or as
some of your deployments so maybe they
don't need all these fences there's a
lot attention stuff well then North talk
to as sort of along those lines is
saying how we have all these patterns
people say you should use this this and
this factories and all these techniques
that kind of keep making things bigger
and bigger when a lot of systems just
don't need that level of complexity he
also said something that our job is to
good solutions so in the end we need to
have something that you can ship and
someone out there wants to use that if
he builds something testing piece of
technology and no one wants to use it
it's an academic exercise it's fun to
build yeah it's fun too good and that's
cool but we have paid for that and as a
profession I think we are well paid
usually so whatever asset value of that
you need to have some something that fee
said someone out there really wants to
use so that you get the money back
everyone I think that's that's all
dropping in and I think having talks at
conferences like this about some of
these larger systems is you know
educational for a lot of the attendees
their systems today may not need to
scale in the way some of these systems
do they may never get to that scale but
some of them will things that we assume
today our big systems in five or ten
years they will be average systems so
it's nice to know that the techniques
were described even if five or ten years
we find better ways of doing it that's
some of the techniques we use today may
not be used at that point it's nice to
have those talks captured as you do on
video so that developers are aware the
techniques but they should never get the
impression that just because luda or
other large-scale systems use these
techniques that Rosalie on that's the
only way to go that they have to use
those techniques so one of the things I
think the two we also have been comment
here is that you talked a lot about
operations and how developers on gauged
and operations and effectually and the
hard part of building a system is really
managing the database is managing the
data is and I think it's as also very
much the message in kind of the purpose
for reaction is to make managing data
simply so if you can talk about about
that so maybe you yeah you I mean you
had some really good points in your
your talk sir so the one thing that we
noticed over and over so he did have
many games difficult which game it's a
different team and that team comes up
with their own decision on architecture
and that always falls down welcome to
the same thing how do you handle the
state of the players of all games which
can be huge because you have many values
of plans and it's much harder to fix
something and you software that on then
fixing something in your data end i'm
not talking about accessing the data but
actually migrating data from one
database system to another because it
amongst forwards or to update a shrine
this is really hard tough takes weeks to
to migrate the data on demand to check
out that at once and also there is an
app from testing is huge because coming
back to which it is taught if you do
full from it was taken liberation your
updated state through one value and you
waste everything you erase the value of
report well so that's why you want dbas
and only using oracle and only using
kind of sublet backend technologies that
you know you can manage it's really one
to share the new version everything else
that might be a deduction but probably I
should do that competition one service
won't because you're just teasing that's
that's the thing so the thing is to
define a good compromise on low
operational overhead and still the
ability to innovate your product fast
enough to ship new version f a or this
is where we respect that man reacts a
good example I think of both topics
we've touched on it's simple compared to
a relation
databases out there the data model is
quite simple key value we can do
secondary indexes full-text search but
primarily key value is a MapReduce but
so that's a lot of people said well I
need relational database and kind of
goes back to what Dan said which is do
you really need to relational database
or are you doing that just because one
else uses ever national database so you
look at your application look at the
solution we try and provide a lot of
cases a key value store fits the problem
really well lets you provide a station
for a lot less expense than an Oracle
that sort of system here and then the
operations side you've now deployed your
solution and that that's where you're
making you money that's another solving
your customer problems and you know if
you need an army of DBA DBAs to take
care of the system you're paying a lot
of money for that and making something
operationally simple allows you to be
more agile about you be able to have a
new solution every week try something
new you don't have to have
about bureaucracy of working through
some special IT group that controls the
database and only allows certain changes
to it and so three outs operation
operational simplicity you know a lot
more flexibility the thing is if you if
you have development on one side and
people who operate the system on the
other side the people on the development
side they want to present the future
because this is what they basically pay
for and devise on operation side they
want to restrict change they want to
reduce risk to the live system because
they are paid for having making no
mistakes yes gap Cashin T and this is I
think where the whole DevOps Wilson come
from to combine these two and this is
finally a system that i can just operate
the same person can develop and operate
the same system so that means that the
guy ended the architecture decisions the
increment feature they also have to
operate that thing and something bad
turns out if the feedback circuit that's
not a powerful tells you just assume
that once this law of Reginald so how do
you manage to how do you do that you can
only make the developers actually run
operations we just tell them up front so
we first asked them how you want to
build your system starting this which
data center do you want to host that
stuff that along to cloud and all the
time when they're developing a design
system they know if something goes wrong
the middle tonight day of the text
message and then they got caught up in
the middle of mine so this influences
the architecture decisions so while they
have freedom to all the fancy stuff and
all the new things they know there's a
rule
that's a very good condiments and the
round robin is that you have two very
broad knowledge it's not enough to just
develop software and actually I think
that is a good thing if you just develop
soft and have no clue about what it does
in operation you probably will not
develop software that can be operated
easily so having a both in one function
actually is a good thing and people are
teams they have enough time to prepare
the context six months or year to
variable game so they have time to
prepare and there's a lot of knowledge
exchange communities so they have each
other so how about arm in terms of react
what what size system do you need for it
to make sense to to run react what's up
and is there like a lower limit well
yeah when do you what do you say no this
doesn't make sense because this is too
small it's just simple well there are
customers that come to the real users
mailing list and they'll say been
testing react on this single node and it
seems to be slower than this other
solution why is that and you have to
explain to them that it's built for
availability it's built to run on
cluster of machines so when you're
running it on a single node it's writing
by default three copies of everything
you write to it so you're you're one
disk is quite busy servicing those three
copies so the minimum number of gene
that we recommend is five and that's
basically due to even if you had three
machines you still keeping all of those
busy and if you have the failure of any
machine for a network partition that
takes out machine and the remaining two
would be extremely busy so 5 is a nice
good number that allows you to have the
operation continue with you know
reasonable latency and predictable means
even if there are failures of one of
machines or even two of the machines so
so your focus really is on
unavailability yes I mean it's the first
feature reality first availability first
mostly most of the reason I say mostly
is we're also working in the background
on stronger consistency features there
are cases where customers want the
option of saying for this bucket of data
I want strong consistency and so that's
something we're going to work on will
come out in a future version of Rio but
today's react really is primarily about
availability and when machine dies or
network partitions you can still read
and write and do something reasonable
something Everett's customer would
probably just say it needs to be highly
available and perform end and don't be
super good secure you know you can add
all these all these fancy terms and
customers you have everything basically
have to work with them to understand
their application
they really need because everything is
costly costs a lot fury it's obvious
it's rare that a real teaser trailer
speed is true flexibility is attractive
and even you know they may need at some
point in the future some high scale
high-performance highly available system
but they usually don't need it right
away they can get a rave up to that one
so you have to work with and understand
where they are today where they need to
be I think it's also completely
different type of application using I
mean if you're shooting robots to Mars
you will probably not be able to fix
anything like that they do that but it's
amazing that they can do so you need to
really low threshold of our and
everything so it's okay you in doing
such a program takes 20 years so we have
time to but for bank application also
you never want to lose money Beck
notifications down from phone now Frank
probably after day its mangled for game
we can literally
10 minutes that's not so bad so it's
really different depending on which is
actually interesting note on the
spacecraft side with all the spacecraft
that go to Mars like with I think most
recent Landers being an example the
software was actually nowhere near done
when the thing launched and they would
upload firmware on route so they had
next year and a half to eight months or
whatever it was to fill in a lot of that
data so they'd have the initial firmware
which you did you know crews software
and then as it came into Mars it would
replace it with Lander software and once
it landed they replace that with surface
over man so I'm on going up we can't
change a hardware that's a really
interesting trend because like it's kind
of like the Naza and other large
corporation they are doing it from the
software industry maybe it's a good
thing I've you do have some flexibility
mean when you look at this small robot
stand
situations and salvation of practice so
so the thing to make a brush successful
basically it's very simple know what is
really going on the system and then that
the needs to fix it so that some
gigantic black box coming back to the
ark example like if your relief a
problem what do you do call all record
two thousand years of that comes out in
coastal whatever and how I must take so
if the system underlying is simple and
it's not a transparent which is because
we are first night you can really
understand what's going on and fixing
things responsive menus there's many of
boxing usually works
so you've also picked up early for
personalization systems different tool
to watch your experience with that and
the beginning very frightening very
frightening here and the first guy came
to us and was like you know who has a
problem and the penny how would you
state the service this is not the right
thing we need something stateful and
that's frightening operation sense
because suddenly Nebojsa have some very
expensive commodity and all of this make
me stay for camping okay now we need a
different programming language and
framework to go to us and this hobby
ended up in my OTP so he didn't want to
try out but actually wanted to have
something extremely robust and but still
it was very fun because no one and
actually we had an extremely hard time
to find anyone to who have experience
with that so they're lost knowledge user
hope because for some people but then he
started doing this favor surprised how
easy some things became that before that
were so hard to do also for me it was
coming from Jarmo and then for being i
was thinking oh my god they really had a
hard time thing i'll be at Acoma girls
girls and it was kind of things
interesting things but after months or
so I was really amazed how productive
finals because the OTP framework was
accessing
addressing exactly the problem we are
facing and it was just 10 hours of
colored people do the main thing is a
nice because it was just right the right
fit for the California shit so very hard
very fine in the beginning and then
Impostors but isn't it the same thing
picking up Mugen well I think that might
be the other way at the beginning is so
nice and then ending into problems then
you get that and so he gets a status of
47 lines and see so many of the problem
rails it's very hard to find a good
cross I think it's actually the other
one so I think we're being armed they're
kind of like opposite twins will be is
very nice to program what an Operations
health so this is why you mix these two
so i only do systems that need to scale
a number where I'm trying to do another
but a lots of the infrastructure
scripting using chef for example small
things are talks tough record
prototyping to find out about the API
should look like you can't do that a
movie and I think this is very
recommended I think a good TV is a good
example the open telkom platform part of
early is a good example of what we've
been talking about terms of building
what you need because the ericsson teams
that built ntp were actually building a
product when they doubled they didn't
sit down say to minion framework that's
highly robust has all these failover
features and allows debug ability
I don't know what we would ended up with
that had been in their approach but they
were building switch and they knew what
they needed based on their many years of
experience in doing that so OTP grew out
of buying their knowledge of how these
systems were deployed debugged
maintained upgraded and they built those
features and just those features into
OTP and one of the points I'll make in
my talk tomorrow is that when you're
dealing with their billing programs
nobody goes off and tries to reinvent
OTP they just use OTP so any airline
program or system that you don't look at
you can pretty much any airline
programmer can go and read the system
because it's all composed of those same
frameworks there's no reinvention we
have very nice I think also alone so and
cougar we have kind of like people come
from different background and
and experience first and open community
and know that our own community which is
awesome Belanger right so we have been
working on a musical and half of the PM
come from google by at first I desk
there's a community party and it's a
different value system sometimes these
clash so it's roomy it's more like this
make it simple and really key to do this
less code and stagger assembler iterate
and and just put it all of the door
should get feedback and and improve and
with other and notice that that's more
like did more thinking ahead so what
really is underlying core problem that
we're trying to solve our a distributed
system how do we manage state across
notes what are the edge cases so it has
a bit more fun thinking and sometimes
they clash they have this architecture
discussions and sometimes yeah you can
see like okay this is one school of
programming this is another space for
prime both makeups off there was one but
it's different but combining the true as
reading off so what do you what are you
going to see harry to have at this time
well what maybe what you talked you went
to today I don't know today I want to
get Scripps College as we've discussed
was very good I'm going to see Jamal
spawns 1281 John is very much from these
DevOps background and I could listen the
job all day long
so John strongest let's go also got home
from me the guy the top beyond this
morning from you Alec because i really
wish like I would have had these inserts
for music oh because he had come with
the same thing it was like recognizing
exactly what kind of system you're good
so they started very small similar to us
and then they recognized the consistent
ended in all sorts of fancy very
specialized optimizations and that's
also the same conclusion that we came to
so that sometime it's really not like
pick the best tool what did other people
do but actually artists you know in this
case and then fix that so I really like
that also very technical specifically I
just wish they had it for me
this is actually an interesting question
do you think that that's a common issue
that that we encounter in software is
that when you're building when you're
building an application when you're
building the solution sometimes you
don't necessarily know what the problem
is you're trying to solve you're just
building something because you think
it's cool I wonder how much that
actually knowing what the core problem
is and being able to address it
accurately or not being able to do that
cause well it's definitely been the case
for for much of the last 10-15 years
that whatever you build you start with
j2ee yes and a relational database yeah
an order and sometimes people think they
know what they're building and they
build it and then they realize after
having built in early version but they
don't really understand what they're
building and certainly with react you
know Andy gross is here chief architect
of fashion and he gave talked just
before this interview about kind of the
evolution of react and that's really
what happened to pressure will build
things into react that they thought
would work well like active anti entropy
in early versions didn't work they're
meant to make the database which
consistency faster but they didn't work
very well so we took them out and then
once we figured out how to really do it
they're back in so that's back in the
system now but that's another reason
again going back to what Dan talked
about keep it simple we don't have to
buy into all these frameworks and
everything
figure out what you're going to build
and then don't be afraid to throw system
away and build another one and that's
why with our line it's so easy to do
that because you don't get invested
millions of lines of code get invested
in thousands maybe lines of code and you
feel it's easier to throw away a smaller
system it is interesting that reminds me
of the discussion I've had with the
fellow who does a lot of dog net and one
of his comments after doing years of dog
net development coming over to Java is
there's a lot of ways of doing the same
thing in Java and oftentimes and.net
there's really only one way to do it and
it seems like there's a similar thing
with your Langley with OTP why there's
this particular flavor that everybody
tends to use do you think that's a
strength of early is that something that
if more of these things are standardized
in Java that would make it easier to
develop in or is Jeff a lost cause good
job I've never liked personal I used Ron
Burkle 70s and yesterday's policies j2ee
oj
applications and offices coming defy the
job at a loss and Microsoft space and
come to jail bait floss like breaking
out of the cage because of all your
information source before was named as
the end Microsoft 11 apartment that was
Lee basically the only thing I meant in
java space yes as long as nothing
different developer communities value
different things examen de Pisan there's
Watson like to serve as many things as
well gettin worried is kind of like
they're these 15 basic abilities more to
like children I think was down to
personal taste having too many things
might hurt I think this is one of these
philosophical whatever he's not that out
so this is one of the things where you
can end this discussion about really
come as descriptions but having it
I think there's the things when I want
to please not bad this is the one day
one day you have to do it just like it's
such a really good way to do things so
deviating from that it's just not
necessary I think this is one of the
strengths of them yeah I've said before
in other talks and interviews that I
finally found her owning us kind of
happy happy and sad occasion because i
was happy to have found such a really
useful system sad that i'd spent so many
years trying to embed that system not
doing so well at inventing so i'm happy
that i can use it now okay thank you
very much take a left here thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
