wanting to talk about leadership for
quite some time one of the things that
that fascinates me about Kanban it's
it's got these different principles and
leadership at every level is one of them
and it got me thinking well I'm
Katherine asked me to be on this track
what would it look like if every single
person in this room could be a leader at
something okay so first of all just to
get a feel of who's in this room please
put your hands up if you're in a
leadership position a team lead scrum
master coach manager okay so have a look
around this is all the people who are
already in leadership positions your job
will be to pay attention the bits where
I show you how to make everybody else in
the room Aleta okay by the time we leave
this you'll understand not only how to
become a leader but also why you already
are alright
so I
I thought it was deliberate it's like
okay it's it's much much easier to do
the talk when the room is dark and I
can't see how many people are in it it's
like oh this is so much better okay so
for those who are in Gita's talking
don't see the imposter syndrome yeah I
get that too I get and you'll understand
why it's an awesome thing even more by
the end of this talk I will cover it as
well and so I wanted to go find out what
other people out there thought of
leaders and I came across this article
on Forbes so this is an article it's
basically says you know here's top 10
qualities that make a great leader you
can read them what I wanted to ask was
can you put your hands up if you've had
training in one of those okay put your
hands down if you've got it because you
are moving into a leadership position or
you already were in a leadership
position who's had training in this who
wasn't in a leadership position it's
about six people seven people eight
people son okay so we've got a few but
it's not many this is the the problem
people who are in leadership positions
get given the leadership training I want
everybody to be able to do the things
that make them great leaders now this I
found really interesting because it's
missing the one thing that makes people
leaders there's one trait that every
single leader when they're good or bad
has that isn't honest can anyone guess
what it is
followers thank you very much this is
what makes leaders okay so put your
hands up if you've got followers on
Twitter or Facebook or LinkedIn come on
everybody's got followers on something
these days right it's that anybody who
genuinely has no followers at all on
anything I really want to know how
you've managed that because I I get
followed all the time
when you have followers you have
influence and I'm sure that those of you
who don't have formal followers on
Twitter and Facebook you probably still
have influence over somebody's life and
this is what it means to be a leader
right and a great leader
influences people in great ways that's
really all there is to it
so I'm going to show you what influence
really looks like I'm gonna show you how
to make great decisions and how to help
other people make great decisions too
one of the things I wanted to know is
where this whole phrase you know
leadership at every level where does it
come from
I'm pretty sure it wasn't in Kanban so I
did some googling and I found all the
way back to 1983 was the earliest
mentioned it comes from the Marines and
the Armed Forces in the States and they
have this this thing of leadership to
every level and this is one of the
quotes leadership's found through the
ranks and at every level of the Marine
Corps every Marine is trained to act
instinctively and effectively regardless
of the situation and the reason is
because these guys they have to make
decisions very quickly they're trained
to work in chaotic environments where
there may be all kinds of things going
on and they don't have time to ask for
instructions so I was wondering do we
actually need leadership at every level
given we're not always in these chaotic
environments I mean the only time we
tend to be in those environments and
software is when we've done an urgent
production bug most of the time we're
not in that kind of stress software
development is ranked as one of the
least stressful occupations but we do
need to make decisions and it's useful
to not have to go and get instructions
every time to make those decisions it's
one of the reasons why at all works
because the people on the ground get to
change direction they get to talk to the
people directly that they need
instructions on rather than getting it
from some manager some leader who's been
assigned to them and everything is about
those decisions right
everything about leadership is how do we
do this what do we do who do we talk to
to get
it done those can be some of the most
awkward questions that you can answer
traditionally the decisions the answers
to those questions used to be made right
at the beginning by a bunch of people
doing a big load of documentation which
would then be passed to the software
developers and we really wouldn't have
to make any decisions first seven years
of my career I worked like that right we
I didn't really have decisions to make
I was just coding and it was very low
stress but now we have to actually make
these decisions ourselves and there's a
problem with it this is a quote from
Dave Snowden's
article in Harvard Business Review a
leaders framework for decision making
even though we know we have to change
direction a lot of the time we're still
making decisions far too early with
wrong people at the wrong time you know
and in the wrong way and he put together
this framework to help us make better
decisions so I'm going to introduce it
to you hands up if you've heard of can
even put your hands up if you haven't
heard of can Evan right so that's most
of the room have not heard of can Evan I
am going to keep introducing this
framework until there are more people
who know about it than don't okay every
single one of my talks has this in
there's a really good reason for it this
has been completely life-changing for me
this has totally changed not only the
way in which I live my life but my
relationships my personal relationships
as well so it's the most awesome thing
I've ever come across
apart from maybe cats cats are pretty
awesome okay kevin has five domains they
are domains not quadrants five of them
it's not a matrix the borders are fuzzy
and things move around this framework as
well and I'll show you show you that too
the easiest domain to understand is the
obvious to me and the obvious
situations where either a child can
solve the problem or if it does require
expertise the solution is obvious
okay so decisions are really obvious so
I go to a landlady in my pub and I say
to my landlady what do you do when the
beer runs out and she says well I
changed the barrel obviously now I don't
know how to change barrel but the
solution is still obvious and in this
situation we can just categorize the
problem we can go oh it's one of those
okay but as things become more and more
complicated expertise is required so
watchmaker knows how to fix and watch
when a car mechanic knows how to fix a
car but we know what a working watch
looks like we know what a working car
looks like so it's still predictable it
just requires expertise and analysis
works really well in this situation you
can go to an expert and ask them about
their ideas and ask them about their
knowledge and get some of their
knowledge in the new code and you
probably want to get feedback as well
because you're human and you will make
mistakes but you can use expertise in
this space and analysis works
it's the complex domain that trips
everybody up human beings have this
innate dislike of uncertainty and we're
always trying to look for patterns that
repeat themselves and in the complex
domain patterns don't repeat themselves
you can do the same thing and then do it
again and you'll get a different result
and you can see in retrospect how things
happen cause an effect can be correlated
in retrospect but you can't make
predictions so I'll give you an example
of this there was a company called
neuticle they had this big online game
called neverending and they said we want
more people to come play this game with
us what we do I know we'll set up a site
where people who share screenshots of
the game and then the players will share
the screenshots and everybody will how
pretty the game is and they'll want to
come join they'll see how engaged the
players are and want to come join so
they set up this site and people started
sharing the screenshots and their
holiday photos and photos of their
family and cats of course and that
became Flickr
and you can see in retrospect how that
happened but you couldn't possibly have
predicted it that's actually an example
of exaptation it's using things not for
what they were designed for and feathers
on dinosaurs becoming birds it's another
example from nature but we get these
emergent outcomes in the complex domain
and those of you who've worked on agile
projects you're probably familiar with
this you show something to the
stakeholders and they go oh okay that's
not quite right can we do this do this
do this and we steer our way towards an
outcome and it's not quite what we
predicted but we do get there what we
have to do in the complex domain is
called probe it means to try something
out in a way that's safe to fail because
it might not book the reason this is
important is because of this domain
chaos chaos is accident and emergency at
your house burning down it's somebody
bleeding to death and in chaos you have
to act and act quickly if it's a
transient domain it will resolve itself
and it might not resolve itself in your
favor at the end of 2012 there was a
company called Knight Capital Group they
released something onto eight of their
nine servers and forgot the ninth one
and when they turn the software on to
start trading the ninth server started
putting spurious trades on their behalf
into the marketplace 45 minutes later
they have worked out what it was and
switched it off by that point they lost
something like thirteen billion dollars
and the banks the big banks have this
agreement when something like that
happens they wind it backs if it's
obviously an error one day they know one
day it's going to be then so they wounds
it back but at the end of the day when
they taught up how much they really had
loss it was still four hundred and fifty
million and it prompted the company's
fire sales so that company no longer
exists as a result forty five minutes it
took for that chaos to resolve itself
and it did not resolve itself in their
favor and sometimes things are not safe
to fail
right if your house is burning down and
you don't get out that's not safe
chaos doesn't care the other reason that
is important is because of the fifth
domain the domain of disorder so
disorder is a domain where we don't know
which of these dominates so behave
according to our preferred domaine for
whatever the situation is and I'm a dev
that's quite like complexity which means
that we really hate reading the
instructions and I've got myself into
trouble failing to read the instructions
on something that wasn't safe to fail a
more common problem is that we treat
complex stuff as if it's complicated so
put your hands up if you've ever been
asked for an estimate in time or money
for something you've never done before
keep your hands up if you gave one keep
your hands up if that then got treated
as a promise or a commitment and
everybody's hands are up right that's
disorder it's when you do something new
you don't know what you're going to
discover the complex domain is the
domain of the unknown unknowns and you
can tell it's going to be risky it's
also the highest value stuff because
it's the reason why we're doing it it's
because it's new and yet we treat it as
if it can be analyzed as if it can be
predicted and I see people do things
like they put little process policies
like must have clear acceptance criteria
you might not be able to get clear
acceptance criteria or it's very new you
might have to try something out and do a
prototype do a spike so I'm hoping this
is giving you some ideas for how you
might lead people differently and make
suggestions even as a dev you can make
the suggestion well you know this is new
can I do a spike can I do a prototype
can we try something out that's the
leadership decision okay so in the
obvious domain we can lead through
control we could just tell people what
to do you know and parents you know what
you're like with your kids right you
constrain it so that it's safe for them
make sure there's nothing around them so
you're controlling the environments and
the complicated main we lead through
expertise these are my things
by the way I haven't checked them with
day Snowden so if you tweet them and
dave says oh that's wrong he's probably
right in the complex made me get
emergent leadership and this is why it's
important to have leaders at every level
because we don't know where they're
going to be needed and when a leader
does emerge we want to make sure that
that leader is supported and in case we
have leadership through action commands
and control actually works really well
in chaos you can tell people what to do
and Mayor Giuliani was praised for his
response to the 9/11 attacks
unfortunately he carried on doing that
after it was over and got voted out but
there you go that's the leadership
starts I also wanted to give you this
scale I found this scale really really
helpful from working out whether I'm in
complexity or not so I asked people who
in the world's ever done this before we
say 5 nobody in the world's ever done
this before it's about as complex as you
can get right for somebody outside the
organization's done it probably a
competitor not somebody that we've got
access to so we've got no access to
expertise it's still high discovery
we're still going to make discoveries
there 3 somebody in the company has done
it before so we have access to expertise
but remembering that were human and
human beings are complex we probably
also want feedback to someone in the
team's done it before and one we all
know how to do it just going to let
people take the photos incidentally this
is all on my blog if you look up Liz Keo
estimating complexity you'll find the
article about it but the thousand
thoughts are complex the threes analysis
works pretty well when you have access
to an expert to someone's you shouldn't
be spending a lot of time on its
familiar it's a web crud form what's the
chances of getting a web crud form wrong
right you know what it looks like it's
really predictable and now you can see
where you want to be putting the focus
of trying things out where you want to
be getting feedback and making sure you
get feedback early it's on those thighs
and fours I showed this to somebody who
was leading a
a target operating model team and he
looked at this his head Oh sort of flies
and falls that's where the risk is and I
hadn't told him this I said yes it's
pretty impressed he said but it's where
the value is to this is why we're doing
it I said yes he said so we should do
those first I said yes absolutely you
should embrace the uncertainty he said
but the entire industry does it the
other way around
like oh yeah they do that yeah they do
and I looked at what he'd done on the
wall he and his team had taken the whole
target operating model they had
everything that they could analyze and
was familiar and gaps for where the
uncertainty was they'd done exactly the
other way around they were hoping that
the analysis will fall out and of course
it never does what they were inviting
people to come see this thing and give
feedback and everybody's going yeah
looks fine right
that's not feedback you want people
saying oh I can see problems with that
that's where you start getting that
feedback and it matters okay so embrace
uncertainty do the Flies and force first
make it safe to fail I'm going to be
talking a lot about safety in this talk
it's how it falls on the Canarian
diagram I suppose of complex trees
complicated to to pub legal expertise
it's a little bit of expertise and ones
you know don't worry about it here's
something off the shelf for goodness
sakes if you have to rewrite to
someone's make it into a library and get
it out your build you don't want that
stuff in your belt okay
you're probably actually all familiar
with this does anybody remember the
first set of mobile phones with cameras
on yeah more people should remember the
ones went first the phones with cameras
on I'm old enough to remember them one
day there's gonna be a generation where
they all never grew up grew up with
those little wine phones to remember
like you had to dial them right and you
couldn't take them away from the lounge
with you you had to go to the lounge to
make a phone call I remember those okay
the point is that the first-ever cameras
on phones were differentiating there was
something new and not many people made
phones with cameras on and
s-sarah one of the early people who made
a camera phone if you go to Wikipedia
you can see it they've got it pointing
towards the user because they thought
people would use it for video calls and
Nokia discovered that wasn't the case
that people really wanted to take photos
so they did what's called spoiling the
differentiator and they made it so it's
easy to have cameras on phones
what does phone also need to do aside
from pictures nothing to do with the
camera at all sorry
calling it needs to call people rates
for phone you need to call people it's
what we call commodities table stakes
David Anderson calls and things you need
just to play the game right you've got
to be able to make a phone call on a
phone otherwise it's pointless hands up
if you've got a camera on your phone
keep your hands up if you've got two one
on the front and one on the back right
cameras have now become commoditized and
the great thing about it is once
something is that stable and that will
understood and there's expertise around
it you can then build on it with
innovative things like Pokemon go yay
right and you get innovation builds on
it and then innovation builds on that
and this is the innovation cycle and now
you can see you're all familiar with
Kevin but you can also see why the
complex domain is really important one
for software and why a lot of the
decisions we need to make need to be
made at ground level and it needs you to
step up and say let me try something
else and then we'll have a better
understanding okay so I want to talk
very quickly so let me grab a drink and
I want to talk very quickly about how
you can grow your expertise so that you
can actually lead in a particular field
in a particular discipline this is the
way that I tend to do it and it's based
on a thing called Dreyfus modelling
Dreyfus was a couple of brothers this
model of skills acquisition and there's
some debate about whether it's actually
true whether it's useful I find it
useful here's how I use it Dan North
introduced this model to me apparently
they made several but this one was one
of the first so the first level of the
Dreyfus model is a novice novices of
very conscious of what they're doing so
those of us who've learnt to drive
we probably remember what it was like to
learn to drive how conscious we were a
steering or stalling the car you know so
when we're really conscious of the
practices where we're doing and
somebody's telling us what to do and
we're just doing it the experienced
beginner is the dangerous one this is
where the dunning-kruger effect kicks in
and everybody thinks they get it then we
get to the competence level where we can
actually do it successfully so this is
like you've just got your license it
doesn't mean you're not going to have an
accident it just means you won't kill
anyone then we get knowledgeable
practitioners people who are starting to
understand the theory and starting to
collect multiple ways of doing things
and then we get experts and experts are
experts in the field they're using it on
unusual ways they're doing strange
things with it
so when I take this model the first
thing I want to do with it is replace
that word competent because somebody who
is not competent in one skill is
probably competent in another and I
don't want them thinking they're
incompetent so I replace this with
practitioner then I find there are too
many words so I'm going to reduce all
the molds one word just makes it easy
and I give them all a number from one to
five okay and then I ask people here's
some examples of how somebody behaves as
a novice right so a novice TT dear maybe
you're writing tests after the code
that's an okay way to start I mean it's
not brilliant TDD but it's a it's a good
start
you've started brilliant welcome on the
journey if you're not good at something
you know don't worry about it
I don't grow experts from novices if
somebody doesn't have any interest of
getting beyond a novice practice like
you do you you do your thing
find the things you are good at will get
you growing there when somebody is a
beginner and they go okay so now I'm
getting it I think I'm getting it you
can say okay well here's some examples
of what somebody who's successful at TDD
does I'm just using T disease as an
example right they write their test
before they write their code do you do
that Oh most of the time maybe okay well
there's an example of something that we
could do
so what I'm looking for is to get them
behaving independently of my guidance so
that they're successful it particularly
Gant becomes interesting when they want
to mark themselves to point five they're
like well I've got some of the
practitioner examples you've got there
I've got some of the successful
practices and that's a sign that they
want to be in that successful
independent practitioner level when
somebody is at the practitioner level
I'm completely okay leaving them there
if they want to be there right that's
okay but sometimes you find people who
go you know what I I'd love to be able
to do these things with this and I think
I'm getting this a lot I think I'm
becoming good at this and they'll give
you examples of things they're doing
that are a bit more than just competent
if you can find that desire you can take
them to the next level and the next
level is influential the next level is
where they start bringing up other
people they start turning into leaders
in that field now a really interesting
thing happens if you start finding
leaders in niche places so where there's
very few people who actually know how to
influence others with that skill or that
practice or that way of thinking those
people who are in that niche place they
start getting relied on I found this
with BDD I was one of the few early beed
ideas and people started relying on me
for teaching BDD and I could impostor
syndrome because they were treating me
as though I was an expert and I wasn't
iris just knowledgeable the good thing
is that if you're in that position you
will feel so uncomfortable you will run
to get that expertise and you will
become an expert oh yeah okay this is
why impostor syndrome in that situation
is a good thing you will become an
expert nobody needs to turn a
knowledgeable practitioner into an
expert they will do it themselves okay
how I do this with other people is with
a thing called the grow framework so
this is a really basic coaching
framework you can use this to help
people develop their life so you can use
it on yourself work out what your goal
is
see if you can find some nice concrete
examples of that goal what will it look
like if I achieve this goal look at your
reality where you are right now think of
some options for going forward and
closing that gap getting better at that
thing what books do you have what people
could you talk to what conferences could
you go to and then pick some it's the
way forward really really simple and you
can talk people through the Dreyfus
model and go okay you've marked yourself
a two point five on that we're all good
by the way if people ever want to mark
themselves high and just go now I'm
definitely a free unlike sure you can be
free I don't mind you know it's about
finding where they want to grow and then
you can find examples of where they want
to get to and help them close that gap
help them work out what they've got
available to them to close that gap and
you don't even need expertise yourself
to talk people through this I've helped
people work out how to go be a better
tennis player and goodness knows I can't
play tennis for toffee okay so you don't
need expertise yourself to use this
framework for those who have you hurried
to BDD anybody here at BDD fund right I
used this quite a lot but this is
literally the same thing as BDD we've
got a reality of context in which we're
acting we've got this action that we're
going to take this this way forward that
we've chosen and we've got some outcomes
that we're hoping to achieve as a result
you can use all same techniques you use
in BDD or the same conversational
techniques to start looking at and
exploring your own lines I'll show you a
little bit about that in the moment okay
so now I'm challenging you all to become
leaders and I imagine some of you are
probably feeling a little bit flowery
about that goodness knows I come up onto
stage and I talk and for the first five
minutes of a talk I like this right
every single time
one of the things that you can do if you
want to be an awesome leader is just
recognize when you're feeling stressed
and instead of reacting treat it with
curiosity there's probably a context
that is making new stress and if it's
making you stressed it might be making
other people stressed too I had a friend
who is our tester and he was a really
stressed guy he got very angry very
easily very frustrated very easily and
he said but Liz how do you stop you'll
always have calm how do you stop feeling
angry how do you stop feeling frustrated
I said it's not the feelings that are a
problem it's the reaction too so one of
the things you can do as a leader is
rather than just reacting go okay what
outcome do I want what do I want to
achieve for myself what do I want to
achieve for the other people in this
room and count to ten and then react
right I know everybody's session
accounts it's home before you speak if
you're angry this is why because this
allows you to actually treat your
emotions with the curiosity you look for
that context and go okay maybe we can
change that all right
I said I was going to talk about safety
I'm going to show you how I make sure
there is safety in the room so this is
useful for finding out if people are
stressed and I do this particularly with
retrospectives but you can use it for
anything where safety might be important
this is just a really simple scale idea
with numbers I ask people to write these
on a post-it and I've learned they've
got to be the same post it's the same
Sharpie pen and then you fold it into
quarters right so when I say the same
post-it not everybody writing on one
post-it everybody writing on the same
color post-it so you can't tell who's
written what and they wrote one I'm
going to nod and stay quiet
right I'm not very very safe at all and
two I might talk about some things I
want to fix but mostly I'm gonna stay
quiet three I'll share my opinions I'll
stay away from controversial stuff for I
will talk frankly but sensitively and
five yeah I'm good I will talk about
anything in this room with these people
now I used to do this not in
this way and it was really interesting
this one group vote advice I said I'm
going to do this safety check and the
manager wrote five on a piece of paper
and throw it in the middle they go
everybody in this team is safe and
everybody went yeah yep all safe and
they all wrote fives and I said alright
next week we've got some people coming
from offshore to join us and they might
not feel as safe as you do so what I'd
like to do I'd like to make sure we do
this anonymously and do it properly just
for them of course it was just for them
I was lying I said you know let's do it
anonymously and I unfolded the first
note and it was a fall and the
management who wrote that
right I've now learnt that you get even
more honest answers if you tell them
that you're not going to share the
numbers you're going to share the
average of the numbers or you're going
to let them know if there are any ones
and twos
I had one retrospective it was a very
big one company-wide retrospective for
the entire IT department all the deaths
all the testers all the BAS no managers
in the room just a couple of live
coaches and we had quite a lot of ones
and twos and I found that really
interesting because we were the only
leaders in an official leadership
position in the room and we said you
know what if one of the deaths we get
one of the deaths to do this we've
trained some of the devs in running
retros what if we got one of your group
to do this can we rerun this and the
coaches are going to go out the room
rerun the safety check do you feel safer
and they did the ones and twos almost
completely disappeared and we're like
okay they don't feel safe with the
coaches that's really interesting and we
let them run the retro and we actually
got some of the best feedback as coaches
from that retrospective if there are
managers in the room I might ask the
managers if they've mind leaving while
we rerun the safety track piece it's
more important to be able to talk than
it is for the managers to be there I it
actually emerged in retrospect as these
things do that's there have been a round
of redundancies and they thought some of
the coaches feedback had played into who
got made redundant and of course it
hadn't but that was the myth that was
going around that was why they weren't
feeling safe sometimes people aren't
even feeling safe enough to use this
safety trick so I have a different one I
learnt this originally as Explorer
shopper vacationer prisoner so does
anyone come across this hands up if you
come across as few people right and so
the idea is you're you you say which of
these you feel like an explorer is
somebody who wants to explore and is
really willing and a shoppers come for
some specific things a vacation is just
happy to be away from their desk for a
bit and a prisoner is being forced to be
there
what I found this nobody will ever vote
prisoner because they don't want to be
seemed to be forced to be there so I
replace it with worker you're willing to
be there right nobody's being imprisoned
for goodness sakes
so people will vote worker they won't
vote for a prisoner that they will vote
worker and you can get a sense of how
people are feeling about the retro and
it's an even safer thing than the other
safety check so you can make it safe
like that special note I sometimes run
retrospectives where I get people to
draw things we call it Art Attack people
will draw things that they will not talk
about this can be problematic if they're
not feeling safe if you are ever doing
an art attack retrospective make sure
people feel safe at first they will draw
the elephants in the room okay they will
draw I've had people draw some of the
most foul things you can imagine and go
yeah that's our server right they will
draw the elephants in the room okay so I
want to talk about some common elephants
in the room I'm going to use Julien
birkinshaws organizing models for this
because it's my favorite thing at moment
apart from Kevin and cats Julien
birkinshaw showed me this as part of the
ESP conference way back in the beginning
of the year and I looked at a house this
is magic this makes so much sense
he says there's three kinds of
organizations the first is bureaucracy
and in a bureaucracy decisions position
is privilege right position is is the
the people who are valued most in the
organization and ones higher up in the
hierarchy you make decisions by rules
and people are motivated by extrinsic
rewards might seek or donate with roles
you make city by hierarchy people
motivate by extrinsic rules if you can
move to a meritocracy once labor and
production aren't scarce knowledge is
the thing that becomes scarce and people
who have knowledge become privileged and
you can coordinate by mutually adjusting
it like an actual project
you make decisions theoretically through
logical arguments I have yet to meet a
human being who can do this consistently
and we're motivated by personal mastery
so those of you who are familiar with
damp inks work autonomy mastery purpose
right this is where the skills start to
grow it's really hard to develop leaders
in an organization that still
bureaucratic I don't have many solutions
for you except that bureaucracies happen
when production and labor are scarce so
you can automate your way out of that
once production and labor stop being
scarce you'll be valued because you
understand how the automation works so
you can grow yourself as a leader if
you're in that technical space hands up
who's not technical here it's a couple
of people don't be shy it's okay
I haven't program for three years it's
fine there are other things you can do
all right
the really interesting thing happens
when knowledge is no longer scarce and
information is no longer yes
once the things we need to make
decisions are broadcasted through the
organization you've got analytics giving
you the information you know everybody
is data-driven you get an ad-hoc recei
and action and conviction become
prioritized and you can you're in the
startup culture at this stage right
you're you're seizing opportunities
you're making decisions for
experimentation and you're motivated by
achievement but those who are looking to
try and transform into a startup culture
and are still prioritizing people
through hierarchy yeah you've got
another step in between that you've got
to get to first okay you can tell if
you're in the bureaucracy because you'll
be in one of those places where you
can't possibly pay the devs more than
the managers and I can see a few people
like
okay right so those are some other waste
decisions get made now you can see where
you are and you can find ways to move
yourself forward
the problem with information is we are
still at a stage where when we start
projects when we start our software
efforts information is often very low
very scarce and when we don't try things
out we don't get that information very
quickly and people don't like
uncertainty so they tend to try and
analyze and they'll break down all of
your backlog into tiny little stories
put your hands up if you've got more
than 100 stories in your backlog right
now right look at that it's a fair chunk
of the room okay so that decisions
already been made about those hundred
odds stories and we make decisions
really really early and then as the
project goes on that's when we start
getting information and the place where
we would like to be making all the
decisions is right here at the end so
I'm going to give you a very very quick
couple of techniques for getting
information early and for keeping your
options open so you can make decisions
later one it's from my neck down north
he took me bdd but he's also taught me
this thing called deliberate discovery
he's got these three rules
first of all assume those stuff you
don't know you have ignorance assume
second order ignorant this is the
unknown unknowns you don't know what you
don't know but you now know where it is
it's always in the new stuff optimized
for discovery okay
that means try things out in a way
that's safe to fail then you get more
information and you have better
understanding and now you're starting to
move into that complicated to me this is
pretty simple real options is even more
fun this is comes from my friend Chris
Matz and he's got three rules as well
they like having three rules for things
he says options have value so we know
that in finance options actually have a
value you can buy and sell options which
is the right but not the obligation to
buy or sell something at a later date so
we have the right but not the obligation
to do something
options expire at some point you have to
make a decision or a decision will be
made for you and this is the magic one
never commit early unless you know why
so I'm gonna tell you a story which
illustrates how we use this back in the
lien conference they had this thing
called the Brickell Key award it's given
to two people who've progressed the
state of the art of Leaning Kanban every
year and they have a shortlist of six
people so this particular conference
they had this short list they wanted to
narrow it down to two people and the
people who needed two votes were people
like David Anderson Don Ryan at CERN
cause Scotland all of them very highly
paid expensive consultants who have
based right around the world and they
could not get them into one room
together the only day they could do it
was the day before the conference where
everybody was finally together so the
conference started on Tuesday they
gotten together on the Monday Comfort
starts Tuesday the award ceremony is on
the Thursday and the lead time for
getting the Crystal trophies engraved is
four weeks they made six trophies they
got six trophies made they kept their
options open so that they could make
that decision later and this is another
way you can create safety you can ask
what would it look like if we were safe
to fill this is a graphic novel that
introduces that concept it's about two
three hours because it is a graphic
novel it's like a comic strip it's
really good fun and I'm on page 76 so
don't be surprised okay
I'm gonna skip a couple because I'm know
I'm running out of time so I'm just
going to skip a few slides and get to
the important stuff we're not going to
do this breaking things down works
really really well in the complicated
space trying things out works well if
you're in uncertainty if you're in that
complex space where things might fail
make them safe to fill right how do you
make things safe to fail this is the
most important thing I can teach you and
I've got about three minutes to do it
a safety failed probe has five criteria
a way of knowing it's succeeding
otherwise
you won't be able to tell her it's
working oh wait oh he's it's not
succeeding what I'm doing it's failing
you've got to be able to dampen it and
stop the effects of its failing and
you've got to be able to amplify it if
it's working and anchor it and make sure
it stays in place and the last one is
called coherence and coherence is a
realistic reason for thinking this probe
might have a positive impact and you
might be able to think of several
different outcomes that could happen
okay now I'ma be tedious so I like
saying can you give me an example right
it's a really simple question can you
give me an example of what might happen
if we do this think of a positive
scenario in which this happens okay and
i use the beatty template for it so I'm
going to give you an examples of these I
use well-formed outcomes when I am
dealing with real life and trying to do
BDD in real life
well forms outcomes are phrased in terms
of what you can see what you can hear
what you can sense with your body there
are two other senses and your
kinesthetic sense so you might say I
will feel proud when I've done this
thing you know what pride feels like to
you okay and proprioception which is
your sense of self Sally Anne Freud
about who's sitting at the frontier can
explain this way better than I can okay
the important thing to remember is that
when you come up with these outcomes
they're just examples of what might
happen
they are coherence they are not tests I
wrote a whole blog post called
correlated in retrospect which is about
what happens when you put targets in the
wrong places in complex scenarios right
so these are measurements these are
things you're looking out for they are
not tests to make sure it works okay
have multiple success scenarios if you
can here is an example okay this is a
real example and I can't remember the
pios name but it was a Pio who didn't
know much about her role she contacted
the coaches list and she's this one
coach said you know she has anybody got
anything which might help her understand
her role and I said well I've got this
guide I've written mister
in a little Word document that should
help her understand it better and he
said that won't work because this is the
most common pattern I see in human
beings at all like this is what every
single human being does when they see a
fairly scenario but that won't work
because and we avoid failure it makes us
feel bad we do not like it and we say
this to ourselves and he literally wrote
back that won't work because he hadn't
read the document he hadn't showed it to
her he had seen this fairly scenario and
he wanted to avoid it she might get
helplessly lost right I he probably had
some vague thoughts of all the different
ways this might fail and it was on the
certain whether it would work so he
didn't want to try it it was actually
pretty safe I'm pretty sure she wouldn't
have felt helplessly lost
we have disposition in unpredictable
spaces and I reckon that that document
and the context were disposed to work I
reckon the likelihood was high that they
would work but he could see this fairly
scenario so what we want to do is we
want to make it safe to fail we do not
want to have a way of avoiding failure
completely so you can change the context
you can make a context of safety it
might be as simple as saying you know
we're trying this out can you try this
out and if it doesn't work for you we'll
try something else it's going to be okay
it can be as simple as communicating
that you want to run an experiment
failsafe is what most people aim for we
want to try it out in our environment so
that we can be sure it will work in
production and then it will be failsafe
safe to fail means if it doesn't work
it's okay can you see the difference
between those two things
look for ways to make
safety in your teams and leaders will
emerge they will grow their skills
because they feel safe platen Ski
principles just a quick introduction to
this and the most important thing is do
it on a scale where failure is
survivable so do small things to try
things out and that way if they are
wrong you haven't invested a lot in them
you haven't made commitments on it seek
out feedback for me mistakes and learn
as you go along this is how you grow
yourself as a leader I'm gonna mention
this paper just so you can look it up
this is a paper about taking a things
which are working and anchoring them so
that they stay working it's the single
most important thing you can do as a
leader and I'm going to poke at this
book I'm nearly nearly done very nearly
done and this is a book by Paul Godard
it's about improv and improv teams have
one simple principle it's called yes and
your anchor what's there and you built
on it you go yes and I love that and
build on it okay if you find yourself
using the word but a lot try turning
round yes I agree with you
and I want to do this stuff that's how
you create safety that's the single most
important thing that you can do to get
better and better in every way every day
and to help people around you do the
same thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
