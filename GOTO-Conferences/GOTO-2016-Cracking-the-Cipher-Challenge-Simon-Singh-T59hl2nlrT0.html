case you haven't read of any of my books
I thought I'd start by just telling you
a little bit about what I do and why I
do it my backgrounds in physics so I
love science and I love technology and I
love math but I now write about anything
to do with science so I've written a
book about alternative medicine very
slightly offbeat topic for me but I'm
worried about alternative medicine I
think there's some risks and some
dangers some are alternative therapies
do work but potentially dangerous so
this book I wrote with a doctor called
ed Zod earnst I've written a book about
pure mathematics about fair Mars Last
Theorem I've written a book about The
Simpsons and so on and I write about
these subjects because I want to get
other people as interested in science
and technology as I am so this is the
kind of stuff I do
I mentioned this book do I mention this
book I mentioned this were briefly one
of the things when I write these books
for kind of general the general public
is I try and tell the stories of the
scientists as well as the science so I
tell the human stories as well as
explaining the science and another of my
books is the code book and then explain
that I talked about how cryptography has
evolved over the centuries you know
suddenly makes a code somebody breaks
the code somebody makes a better code
somebody breaks that code and so on and
so on
but rather than looking at the whole
history I thought I would look at the
back of the book at the back of the book
there was something called the cypher
challenge and the cypher challenge was a
competition there were ten coded
messages from ten periods of history
some of them were the early ones are
very simple and very ancient and the
later ones were very modern and very
difficult and the idea was that children
could break the early codes but if you
were really serious and you broke all
the codes then you could win ten
thousand pounds okay and the competition
was eventually won by some Swedish they
were actually jugglers in London on a
conference a juggling conference but one
was a computer science
this one was a number theorist one was a
crypt analyst one was an electrical
engineer one was a computer scientist
they went back to Stockholm and they
worked on these 10 codes and they won
the money they won the competition and
and when I wrote the check I tried to
write it in code in the hope they
wouldn't cash it but they they still
will able to cash it so they got their
money and these are the 10 codes they
had to crack so this is a two thousand
year old code this is a thousand year
old code this is a 500 year old code 200
year old and so on through to the First
World War Second World War right up to
the 70s and 80s so this is the challenge
that people had to crack and I'm just
going to look at some of these codes and
explain to you how how they were cracked
and so on this was the first stage a
very simple monoalphabetic substitution
cipher you replace every letter with a
different letter now that that code
would have been unbreakable 2,000 years
ago but it was broken the first document
we have on crypt analysis the first code
breaking document we have is this one
here by an Arabic mathematician called
al Kindi
who was living and working in Baghdad
and this document was only found about
20 years ago in Istanbul and in this
document what al Kindi says is that
every letter has a frequency so this is
the frequency for English I think in
German he is even more common and Zed's
probably a bit more common the
distributions change but for each
language the distribution is is really
distinct and so if E is the most common
letter in English and X is the most
common letter in the ciphertext then you
kind of know that X must be e okay so
today that's fairly obvious to us but
when our kindy did it when al Kindi
worked it out it was revolutionary and
it gave gave him in his his his
compactor it's a huge advantage in
breaking the codes of their rivals
so that was first stage one that was
easy - even though that code was broken
a thousand years ago by our kindy
it was still being used by Mary Queen of
Scots about 500 years ago she was a
Catholic Queen of Scotland who wanted to
become she was also Queen of France
briefly and she wanted to become queen
of England and she was a Catholic and
Elizabeth the first at the time was a
Protestant and Elizabeth was scared that
Mary would overthrow her and become
Queen so Elizabeth put Mary in prison to
keep her safe and locked away but while
she was in prison
she sent out these coded messages to
people in Spain and she was saying to
the Spaniards come and invade England
and let's get rid of Elizabeth you know
make me Queen make me the rightful queen
now these letters were were encrypted
but they were intercepted they were
given to Elizabeth's code breakers they
pretty much follow a simple substitution
cipher Elizabeth code breakers were able
to break the codes it was clear that she
was committing treason she was put on
trial for treason she was found guilty
and then executed so you can see how
important the making or the breaking of
a code can be it can be a matter of life
and death in this situation let me jump
forward in time stage so state one was
easy stage two was easy three and four a
bit tricky but but really most teenagers
I think could do three and four five was
the really tough one five was the first
one that really stopped people in fact
nobody could break this code for six
months and Stage five is what's known as
a book cipher and the way a book cipher
works is you take a book and you number
every letter in the book one right
through to the end so it may be a
million letters you may have a million
numbers next to each letter and then
what you do is let's say my book is A
Tale of Two Cities it was the best of
times it was the worst of time so I'm
numbering every letter one two three
four five six seven eight all the way up
to a million then I take my message my
message might be meet me at midnight so
if I want to encrypt the M well here's
an M here
I repeat replace M with 17 e he's an e
here I replace II with 8 I don't replace
II with a number 8 because I keep
with eight then it becomes obvious so I
find another e here's an e that's number
ten I put a 10 here T that's a two and
so on okay so every time I come to a
letter in my message I find a letter in
the book and I replace it with that
number and this code is almost
unbreakable unless you can guess which
book I've used you will have no hope at
all now I could have made this code
unbreakable I could have just gone to my
library and picked a book at random and
nobody would have been able to break
this code but I picked a kind of a try I
didn't want it to be unbreakable I
wanted to give people a fair chance so I
picked one of my own books okay I picked
a book called fair miles last theorem
which is my first book and but but but I
didn't number it from the beginning okay
because if I numbered it from the
beginning if you have the Dutch edition
of the book it starts differently it
starts in Dutch if you have the Swedish
edition it starts in Swedish so I
couldn't number it from the beginning
that would have been unfair
so I identified a part of that book
which is the same in every language
whichever translation you have it's the
same I picked a part of that book that
must be at least 217 letters long and I
picked a part of that book that's so
famous that even if you don't have the
book you can find this passage on the
Internet and if you apply those criteria
then you realize that the story of
Fermat's Last Theorem is a French
mathematician called pierre de firma who
solved a mathematical problem but he
never told us the answer and he wrote in
the margin of his book a message that
was about 217 letters long it's a
message that's so famous that it's on
the internet everywhere and it's a
message that was written in Latin so
which which ever Edition you have you
will have that Latin quote if you don't
have my book than you it's on the
Internet in a million places so it's a
very very famous Latin note
ferma says I can solve this problem but
I'm not gonna write down the answer and
if you take that piece of text and you
number it up and you you you reverse the
encryption then the message just falls
out very easily okay but nobody could
figure that out it took six months of
work before one person in Cambridge
figured out that that that decipherment
his name was Andrew Plato and if
somebody broke one of the stages they
would email me and I would have a
bulletin board and I would have whoever
was leading at that stage would be top
of the board and so Andrew Plata emailed
me he was right so he went to the top
and other people I would drop into other
discussion forums and other people were
saying well how come Andrew plate is so
smart how come Andrew plate is ahead of
all of us how come he knows something we
don't know and this conspiracy theory
began to develop and the conspiracy
theory was that Andrew Plato was in
Cambridge and I was in Cambridge for a
while
Andrew Plato did his PhD in Cambridge I
did my PhD in Cambridge and people began
to figure out then what's the connection
how I know what did Andrew play to have
access to and as a result of this
conspiracy for the first time ever
people went to the library in Cambridge
and read my PhD thesis they've never
read it before or afterwards so for
anyway so that was a five stage six was
seven was was again six or seven were
his trickiest age five actually it turns
out but stage eight is the one I was
going to concentrate on which is the
enigma cipher so the enigma cipher is
famous for lots of reasons but one of
the reasons it's important in the
history of cryptography is because here
it is being used by the Germans in the
Second World War
I think that's general Guderian and here
is a close-up of the machine you can see
it here and the reason why it's so
important in the history of encryption
is that in the First World War
you have a revolution in communication
you have Ray
for the first time people can send large
amounts of traffic instantaneously over
vast distances but on the other hand
other people could tune in their radio
sets and listen to everything you're
sending so you have this technological
revolution in being able to send data
but you need something to be able to
protect that data and so the Enigma was
developed as soon as the first world war
ended really in the years after not just
the Enigma there was a Swedish
encryption device there was an American
encryption device have a feeling that
may even have been a Dutch one and
people trying to develop these
technologies but all of these companies
went bankrupt apart from the Enigma
company started by arthur scherbius he
was just about to go out of business but
then the German military machine began
to gear up and they wanted his machines
in large numbers and so every railway
station every army battalion every
u-boat every airbase had to have one of
these machines okay and the way it
worked was a three-person operation so
you can see here you have somebody has
the message in their hand and he reads
out the message this person types it
into the machine here's a keyboard their
lights light up here so you might type
in hello and the lights bvz QA might
light up he writes down B vqz a he gives
it to the radio operator and then the
radio operator sends bvq z-day at the
other end the radio operator takes down
BV Keys la somebody reads that bvq said
a he types it in and the left lights
hello light up okay that's how the
Machine worked now I'm fortunate enough
that I own an Enigma machine and I
fortunate enough that I managed to get
it through airport security today and
it's here
and so yella if we can switch to this
camera oh great
so it's this is a genuine enigma cipher
machine it was captured in northern
France at the end of the war by an
American soldier he was also
cryptographers so when he saw it he knew
exactly what it was and he just picked
it up and took it back to America and it
lived in Texas for about 60 years and
this one was built before the war
started it was built in 1936
and some 80 years later it's still
working pretty well so we can type in a
letter if I type in the letter O the
letter D lights up can you see a deal I
tap great okay you can see pretty much
where I can see so I type an O a d
lights up if I type again a lights up if
I type again our lights up and then age
so it is a pseudo-random letter
generator I'm typing in the same input
but I'm getting a different output each
time so why is that happening well if we
lived if if we lift this lid here you
can see the lamps here but more
importantly behind the lamps you can see
three rotors three drums and I can take
those out if I take the first one off
here you can see it's got 26 contacts
and on the other side it's about
twenty-six contacts so when I type in
the letter A it goes in at the top
contact does ABCD efg background to Zed
type in a it goes in at the top but
doesn't come out at the top in the
middle of these discs the wiring is like
spaghetti so it goes in as an A it might
come out at B it might go to the second
one is B it might come out as M goes
into the third one is M and it might
come out as a J okay so the scrambled
wiring inside these rotors is what
changes the letter
but on its own that doesn't explain why
the output keeps changing because if I
keep typing a it would follow the same
electrical path and you have the same
output I think I said the output was an
M but the reason the output keeps
changing is every time you type a letter
this moves one step so you type a it
goes in at the top but that's a
different contact so it's a completely
different electrical pathway type A
again it moves goes in at the top
different contact different electrical
pathway different output so it is the
dynamic nature and when that does a full
revolution it kicks the middle one okay
so it's a dynamic nature of the wheels
that really causes the changing output
in fact if I operate it with the lid
open then you'll see you'll see that
happening so I type O again and you can
see the first roaster move sometimes you
might see the second rotor kick over as
well
every so often that will happen but I
won't wait for that to happen but you
can see that that rotor is moving and
that's the reason why the output keeps
on changing so that's how the encryption
works essentially but how does
decryption work well if you want to
decipher a message sent with the Enigma
machine you need to have the Enigma
machine but you also need to have it set
up in the same way now there are lots of
ways to set up the Enigma machine this
wrote this wheel has got this roughness
axle sorry this axle has got three
rotors so I could move the rotors around
to different permutations so in this
case I have three objects and three
positions that gives me just six
permutations but then I can put them at
different orientations 26 26 26 26 cubed
is about 17,000 times the six
permutations is a hundred thousand now
where this wheel kicks the next one I
can change where this wheel kicks the
next one I can change this one doesn't
have a wheel to kick
but that's still a factor of 26 and
another factor of 26 that's a hundred
thousand times 26 is two and a half
million times 26 is 50 million so this
little thing here has 50 million
different settings okay and then on top
of that I don't think you can see it
very well but just in here there are
some plugs and what the plugs do is they
swap letters around so if I plug a with
B it means every time I type a it
follows a path of B and every time I
type B it follows the path of a and I
can change the way those plugs are set
up and I think there are 20 plugs so I
could swap 10 pairs of letters and that
has a hundred million million different
settings okay so this the permutations
here the combinations here are much much
bigger than the combinations here but
these don't change once you've plugged
it that's it it's fixed for the day
whereas this is continually changing so
it's really that the large number of
permutations here and the the dynamism
of the of what's going on up here
coupled together is what gives you the
security but if you have an Enigma
machine and you have it set up in the
same way then encryption and decryption
is pretty simple let's try and send and
decipher a message let me close the lid
I just pick a simple setting to pick
this one two three maybe two three okay
now if I type the message okay Oh gives
me a s and K gives me L so okay is SL
okay so you get SL you think well what
is SL mean well your machine has to be
in the same position so I'm going to
move that back two spaces one two now if
I type in SL I should get okay s gives
me o and L gives me
you get the idea yeah yeah so so it's
pretty reliable too sometimes the
contacts get a bit damp and they don't
they don't work and we one of the nice
things if something goes wrong like like
now the wheels are moving the keys are
pressing down the plugboard might not be
connecting so one things you can do is
you if you keep your finger down you can
do a walk-through test now that wheels
are not moving over so nothing's
changing so that gives me an opportunity
so by typing the letter T I know there's
something wrong so I can begin to
investigate T a bit further without
anything changing if I think a bulb is
broken there's a nice feature these
bulbs are all originally these bulbs 80
years old and the spare bulbs at the top
are all original as well but if I think
a bulb is broken then I've got a battery
tester here if I think a cable is broken
I can test the cables as well there's
just nice contacts for testing cables if
if I think the battery's flat I don't
need to change the whole battery
completely I just have an external power
connections here so I can just put
externally connected to power and see
whether that's the problem so it's it's
well-designed in terms of
troubleshooting and trying to figure out
what what what's gone wrong as the
machines open and as we've got it on
camera now might be a time if people
have questions I'm happy to take them
now if people have one or two questions
you can just shout them out if yes how
do they share the key so every month
there would be a piece of paper and
every line would be a different day so
today is the 15th so let's say 15 pick
rotors I've only got three rotors here
but there may be five or eight that you
could choose from
so it's a might pick say pick rotors 1 4
and 2 in that order put them in
orientations C F and K make the kick
over points m and W and this is the
plugboard settings and if we're in the
same network we might be north atlantic
or we might be north africa everyone in
our communications network would have
that piece of paper and every month
somebody had to deliver that piece of
paper so you can imagine there were
motor bytes going across a Sahara and
that's a huge risk you know that person
may be hijacked they may be a double
agent they may be just incompetent but
you know the security relies on that bit
of paper not falling into the wrong
hands and there were times when those
bits of paper were captured and we then
put to good use and if you do capture it
you kind of want to capture it at the
beginning of the month not at the end of
the month although that's still very
useful yep so why is it why is it
symmetric okay so one of the things I
didn't mention is it actually goes
through the wheels twice so I've missed
out a few different things but but but
that's a very good point this thick
wheel at the end it actually sends the
wire back down a different path that's
called a reflector so let's say it comes
out the three wheels as an M it will
send it back as a P and it follows the
electrical wiring back again it might
come out as a as a Q but that means if
you type Q it goes through to a P gets
reflected as an M and goes back as an A
so that is what and that's a really
crucial thing I'll come to that a bit
later so thank you for that point maybe
one last question or I'll I'll push on
I'll be around afterwards if people have
other questions and do come and catch me
but I just mention one other quick thing
while we've got the camera here if
you're working at night the risk was
that the lights
the board might give away your position
so a sharp-eyed sniper might be able to
to spot where you are so at night they
would often use if they're working
outside they would often use this piece
of just green plastic so the idea is you
just place it over the over the lamp
board and now if I type L ya V has just
faintly lit up so this is a there are a
few of these machines around but what's
really nice about this one is that it's
kind of got everything that it had when
it was built and all the serial numbers
match and so on so as I say I at the end
of the talk I'll just need about five
minutes to put it away but if people
have questions after that I'll be at the
back of the room but let me carry on
with the story quickly so the story of
the enigma here here this is it may be
just a useful graphic for showing you
how it well if we can switch back to the
PowerPoint that would be great yella
if yellows there are great some ones
look great yeah this graphic might help
if I haven't explained it very well here
is a six-letter keyboard that's what the
rotor looks like I type a B the B goes
in here it goes up there up there and it
lights up as an A then then this wheel
rotates so now I type B again the wiring
looks different so it comes out
differently comes out as a C and in this
one you can see the reflector that I
talked about a second ago so you type in
an A there's the plugboard as well here
the a is swapped was a B and this comes
through here through here through here
through here through here through here
through here gets reflected back down a
different path and comes out or it comes
out as a C so that gives you an idea of
what the wiring that's going on inside
the machine now when the Germans first
started using these kinds of machines
people thought they were unbreakable
then the shin numbers involved made it
look like an impossible task to try and
break the Enigma and the French and the
British and the Americans and
everybody's just just didn't even bother
trying the only people who did
I am break the enigma before the war
with the poles because Poland you know
because of its geographical location
with Russia on one side in Germany on
the other it knew that it was going to
be in trouble sooner or later so faced
with such a desperate situation the
poles tried to break the Enigma and they
made a very important decision which was
to bring mathematicians into code
breaking
prior to this code breaking was all
about linguistics and and and and you
didn't see mathematicians or engineers
or scientists involved at all although
Charles Babbage worked secretly on code
breaking that wasn't known until about
30 years ago because if you're a code
breaker you don't tell people yeah so
there were scientists involved in it but
but it wasn't very common and it wasn't
very public and the poles were the first
they say right we need mathematicians we
need lots of them and we're going to try
and break the Enigma and they made
significant breakthroughs before the war
even started and just before they were
invaded they smuggled out their their
ideas to the French the French passed
them on to the British and before the
war started the British set up a
code-breaking center called Bletchley
Park and they started well they had a
great head start thanks to what the
Polish code breakers had given them and
you can visit Bletchley Park it's about
a 40-minute train ride
outside of London and right next to
Bletchley Park is the National Center or
the National Museum of computing which
is also really really worth visiting
they've got some terrific stuff there
and there's some silly rivalry between
Bletchley Park and the National Museum
of computing and they should really
patch up their differences and be
friends but you have to visit them
separately unfortunately but yeah this
is the code-breaking center of Bletchley
Park and this was the very first visit
to Bletchley this photo shows the very
first visit by government officials who
went there to bless you to see is this
place quiet is it secluded is it private
does it have good communication links
does it have space for adding new
buildings and after their visit they
were convinced
this was a good place to build a
code-breaking Center and as the months
and years passed this became home to
hundreds and hundreds of people who were
dedicating their their lives are trying
to break not just the enigma code but
other German codes and Japanese codes
and so on and I'll just speak briefly
about how they broke the Enigma so there
was a message one day a message was
intercepted by a woman called Mavis
Beatty and she looked at this message
she was a codebreaker and she looked at
the message and the message was 200
random letters because the output is
kind of pseudo random but it wasn't
quite pseudo-random because in the 200
letters there were no w's which is weird
because you would expect at least five
or six or ten or fifteen w's but no the
W's at all and then she realized the
only way you can have an output
ciphertext which is devoid of any double
use is if the input is all double use
because if you remember from the
question we had earlier know if no
letter can ever be encrypted as itself
because it goes through the fruit three
rotors gets reflected back down a
different path it goes back down a
different path it can't get back to
itself so no letter can be encrypted as
itself so if I type in W 300 times my
output will be everything except double
use so she'd cracked the code
she knew what the message was 300 double
use not the most interesting message in
the world but once you have the message
300 double use and once you have the
output which is what you have in your
hand to start with with it with once you
know the input and the output then you
can work out the exact setting of the
machine okay because you normally you
don't know the input and you don't know
the setting all you have is the output
and you have two big unknowns once you
know the input
and the output then you can work out the
only unknown which is the the machine
machine setting and she figured that out
she could then go back and decipher
other messages that were sent that day
and one of the messages that she
deciphered was about an attack on the
British fleet at Alexandria the British
fleet were warned and as a result it was
the first allied victory in the
Mediterranean all because of this
message being deciphered now that one so
the first question is why would somebody
send w 300 times now the reason for that
is if you if you think if I've got an
unbreakable code and I'm sending it
across a battlefield and you you just
can't break my code you've got no hope
but what you can do is you can count the
messages and if you see I'm sending one
message on a Monday one on a Tuesday one
on a Wednesday but ten on a Thursday
then you know something big is going to
happen on Friday and that's called
traffic analysis and just just by
traffic analysis you can begin to know
what's going on in my head or what we're
planning so i combat that by sending ten
messages every day and if my traffic is
flat you can't your traffic analysis is
no good so when somebody sent 300 w's
they were probably just maintaining
their quota for the day yeah if they
sent a random message it would have been
fine but they didn't they sent something
that was utterly predictable or
deductible deducible so that that worked
once but it wasn't something that you
could rely on and what Alan cheering did
what his great contribution was was to
say that with a lot of messages you
can't guess what the whole message is
you can't guess it's 300 W so you can't
guess the whole message but even if you
can guess part of the message maybe
that's enough and you can often guess
the part of the message you know the way
the message starts may follow a certain
format if the message arrives at
midnight it might begin with 0 0 0 0 if
the message comes from over there we
know the
Germans have a weather ship over there
then we may be able to guess what terms
they're using to describe the weather in
that part of the ocean Sochi Riis great
breakthrough was to say even if we can
guess a bit of the input and match it
with a bit of the output that will help
us work out the settings of the machine
and he built machines called bombs to
help sort this out and as a result of
his work and many other works and many
other breakthroughs it came to the point
where the Bletchley Park code breakers
were deciphering messages almost as
quickly as they were being read but by
the German military and I think it's
almost gosh 10 - let me just wrap this
up fairly quickly I'll just make two or
three points before I finish as I said
it was Alan Turing who broke the Enigma
working with many many other people and
Alan Turing never got any credit for his
work and he took his own life in the
1950s because their sexuality he was
being handed by the police and by the
government security forces as well to
some extent but he never got the credit
for his work and neither did many many
other people and people often wonder why
why didn't you know enigma the breaking
of the Enigma was kept secret not just
during the war not during the 1950s not
just the 1960s but it wasn't until 1973
that the story of Bletchley Park began
to emerge so people often wonder why was
this kept so secret for so long and the
reason for the secrecy was that as the
war ended the Allies captured lots of
these machines this machine was captured
and many many others were captured and
they were brought back to London and
they were kept in the government offices
in central London and the government
civil servants the government workers
would would ring up other countries such
as Australia and Canada and they would
say to these friendly countries they
would say look you know you're our
friends and we've captured lots of these
German machines and the Germans say
they're absolutely unbreakable why don't
you have some so the British were giving
machines to their friends
because the British knew they could
crack these codes okay and so the
British could spy on their friends in
the 50s and in the 60s and that's why
this was so top secret for so long
I just ran out I'll just wrap up the
story of the cipher challenge quite
quickly start stage 10 of the of the V
of the challenge was an RSA cipher and
these are the Swedish code breakers who
cracked the code cracked all 10 codes
and stage 10 was obviously the hardest
one and it involved RSA so you had to
factor a very very large prime number
and it was pretty much the biggest
number that had ever been factored it
wasn't much bigger than the record so I
knew that people could factor this
number if they tried but it would be
really tough and they came up with some
new ways of implementing factorizing
software and did some really clever
things and they factored the the the the
the large number and they could break
the RSA actually if you decipher the RSA
that gave you two keys and with those
two keys you could undo another code
called Triple DES okay so let me just
tell you what Triple DES is so so des
was a the data encryption standard it
was a form of encryption that was
developed in the 1970s in America and it
was kind of the standard form of
encryption that was kind of shared
around the world but then des became
weak by by the mid 80s probably and so
des was replaced by Triple DES so with
Triple DES you apply des once with one
key and then you you decrypt but you
decrypt with the wrong key you have a
second key so you decrypt with the wrong
key so you're making even more encrypt
it and then you re encrypt with the
first key just to get it in the right
format okay and that's Triple DES and
this is unbreakable you will never break
Triple DES or nobody at the moment can
break through
all days but you didn't have to break
triple des what you're supposed to do is
factor this not number under the RSA the
RSA would give you these two keys key
one and key two and then you could undo
this very easily okay but but the
factoring was a mammoth task okay but
this was impossible unless you did the
factoring but when I went to Stockholm
when they won the prize I went to
Stockholm to give a talk on how I made
the codes and they gave a talk and how
they break the codes and I gave him the
check for ten thousand pounds but during
their lecture they revealed that I'd
made a mistake okay and my mistake was
that when I did the triple des okay
triple des remember you encrypt with one
key you decrypt with the wrong key to
make it even worse Yuri encrypt with the
right key to get it in the right format
what I did was I encrypted with the
first key and then I decrypted with the
first key and then I encrypted with the
second key and that's only single des
and that could be broken in about two
hours okay
now luckily they didn't think I could be
that stupid so they didn't try this
approach until they done the factoring
which took them about three months and
then when they did the factory and they
realized that I've got this completely
wrong and and I suppose that that's a
really important message is that you
know the encryption systems that were
used today and Sven mentioned it today
that will act them you know a lot of the
the technology that we use today a lot
of the companies that are successful
today would just fall apart
and we rely on this effectively
unbreakable form of encryption that's
often used in so many places but if it's
not implemented properly and if human
error like like the 300 double use with
the Enigma the Enigma was actually a
very strong machine and often the way
Bletchley broke it was by people doing
regimented starts or predictable ends or
predictable time checks and so on so
whether it's him nigma or whether it's
Triple DES or whether it's me and my
cipher challenge and often it's the
human error that
leads to the undoing of these codes if
people I think we're probably we took
questions during the talk so we probably
don't have time for questions now I
guess but but if if people if people do
have questions or want to come and chat
then please just give me about six or
seven minutes to put this away and then
I'll be at the back of the auditorium
but but thank you very much for inviting
me to speak thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
