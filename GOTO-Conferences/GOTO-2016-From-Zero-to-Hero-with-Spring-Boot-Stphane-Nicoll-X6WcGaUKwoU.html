show you two things today one is how
spring boot can help you to develop
applications how you can focus on your
code how you can get started very easy
and very quickly so i want to show you
that and we're going to develop a small
application together to basically
illustrate that in practice and then i
want to show you what spring boot brings
the features that spring wouldn't brings
and so called non functional features so
the things that you need regardless of
the application that you are building so
whatever the type of the application
that you build you always need things to
administer the application manage the
configuration check what's going on in
your app introduction package your
application in various environments so i
want to show you how it works so let's
start with the first part of the
presentation and first of all maybe some
questions who doesn't know about spring
booth at all never heard of it okay
three four who's already using it that's
forty percent who's already using it in
production that's forty percent okay so
for those who don't know about it will
never use it one way to one way to get
started is to use the guide so we have
some guys on on the spring area website
so spring is rough guide which is a
spring boot application by the way and
open source so you want you want to
check it check it out on on get up if
you want to see what what the code
that's behind the spring area website
another one so this application behind
me is also a spring dude application and
it's really a small service that allows
you to generate a quick start project so
as you can see there's not no not many
options there you can basically select
the build system that you want to use
and the spring boot version that you
want to use and some basic coordinates
for your project and then you can shop
for the penalties right
so I want to build a GPA based
application with security and I don't
know I don't want to rest repositories
and h2 database h2o is two and then you
click generate project that's going to
download you something with an empty app
so just just what's required to start an
empty up with those dependencies and as
you can as you will see in a minute the
fact that the project as dependencies
springwood will react to that so spring
boot will react to what's in your
classpath it will find that you have
some classes available which obviously
means you want to use them and it will
auto configure something if you if you
don't have any opinions so read if you
don't have any user configuration so
clicking generate project basically you
create a zip file you can extract that
in your file system and then open your
favorite ideal top but you can also do
that right from the ID so I'm using
IntelliJ if you use a clip so if you use
netbeans they have similar features I
don't think that the NetBeans
integration is there yet but they are
working on it definitely so I'm going to
use this spring initializer tab as you
can see it using the same instance or
you can use your own same setup here i'm
going to choose the latest release
because i want to well the latest
milestones to be exact we are going to
release one dot for you know in a couple
of weeks now which will use spring
framework for the three for those were
at the previous presentation and i'm
just going to select web here so these
are all the things that I could use
obviously you can use more but these are
the things that we have call auto
configuration for I'm going to call that
go to a mess and that's it done
don't note the project for me extract
that whereas as asked and also configure
it in the ID which means i already have
it a run application here and everything
is set up in the ID so when you start
with a new project the first thing you
do is you do another world right and
this is a web application so i'm going
to create a neural controller so i'm
going to i'm going to create a simple
matter very obvious if you invoke the
root of the web application it will
return a simple error message easy
enough the purpose here is everything
you're going to see in this presentation
is focused on configuration and
infrastructure not really features by by
themselves so i want to show you how
spring boot helps you to architect your
application configure your application
package your application test your
application etc so i'm going to return a
string and i'm going to say it'll go to
em's to them to say something and i'm
going to map that to the root and i'm
going to say this is a restaurant folder
start so start interesting let's see
start is nothing but running a main
class so there is a demo application
here that was generated automatically if
we look at what it looks like this is it
a cloth with a spring boot application
annotation basically flag this this is a
spring good application and all kinds of
nice defaults will be inferred from that
and the main will single line spring
back swaps purification run so basically
run this application and if someone
passes come on line arguments pass them
along so that we can do something about
it in this case there is none and if I
go and look at most athe I've a nap
okay so worried stump cap where is
Jackie um I haven't gone into the build
system to run a war file that I have to
deploy somewhere I run a main class
right so that's the idea behind spring
boot it's really to help you focus on
your code stay in d id as much as you
can do as much as you can in the ID so
if you when you when you were in
university learning about computer
science or learning about computer
science anywhere at all you probably
have to do some exercises and one thing
that you have to do is create a simple
java application and the simplest way to
run that java application is to create
the main class and execute some code in
that so spring boot is back to basics
except that olden old all the modern
features you've used to you can still
use them so let's look at the build and
you'll see it's quite simple basically
brings two dependencies you'll see that
there is a common pattern in named
spring boot starter something so this is
on purpose it's it to help you identify
the things that that we support and also
have a common prefix because the ideas
of the completion as you'll see in a
minute so this application I check the
web thing if you remember in the in the
wizard I'm basically building a web
application so I'm telling I want to
build a web application please give me
the things that are required the minimum
amount of dependencies that are required
to build a web application and that's
going to bring because its opinionated
it's going to bring to bring spring MVC
GSR 303 validation and an embedded
container and this case it's tom cat so
this is why your main is starting a web
application it's actually starting tom
cat it's configuring spring MVC there is
a restaurant roller in your app it will
figure that out because it's in a sub
package of the application right so if
you look at Springwood application
you'll see three things important this
this is a spring boot configuration
please enable auto configuration so
please look at my classpath look at my
configuration look at my environment and
infer things if I didn't and the last
one is components can so we we are going
to scan this package and all the sub
packages for beans right so um that was
easy enough as an example but we want to
build an app with that expose some data
so i want to show you what it takes if
you want to expose some data from a
database as a rest endpoint so i'm going
to create a simple JP entity and i'm
going to expose that as a resting point
how much time do you need to do that
what kind of infrastructure could you
need to create to be able to build an
application like that so I don't want to
code all that by hand because you'll
probably die by then so I have this ok
maybe i should add the dependencies
first ok sorry so first thing to do i
want to build a JP based app application
now I want to expose that as a
respiratory so I need obviously also
database so I'm going to shop again
spring boot starter something and I can
see I have a GPS daughter ok again
springwood starter I want to expose that
my data as a rest endpoint there is a
starter for that and finally I need a
database i'm going to use h2 because
that's simple enough for my simple up
here but you could use my sequel
postgresql whatever ok so now my speaker
works and as you can see there is
nothing fancy about it that's really
playing jpa entity
i'm going to create a repository for it
again no spring boot related API so the
message is spring boot is not a new
framework to learn it's based on the
spring portfolio it's on top of the
spring portfolio and it helps you
configuring your app so if you look at
this it's a plane spring data repository
so if you don't know about to bring data
who doesn't know about spring data okay
for brave 56 okay so in a nutshell it's
provides an abstraction on top of many
data store and that's actually going to
create a beam that works and those query
those queries will be inferred
automatically based on the metal
signature so the first one tells I want
to find a speaker because the return
type is a speaker and not a collection
booth twitter account is the one that I
passed as a parameter and the second one
is I want to find all speaker whose last
name is the last name there is also some
rest related annotation there I'm going
to go back on those in a minute last
step I want some data in my database
when I started up so I'm using this
feature from having it that allows me to
do that so basically if there is an
imported sequel file at the root of the
classpath and having it creates the
schema it will also execute the sequel
statement in that file so if i restart
and I go to speakers I have this
and it's being exposed and I can also
look at one speaker so this is what it
takes to build a net point and this is
fully fully rest endpoint by the way so
if you post two speakers it's going to
create one if you if you do a delete
HTTP request to this that's going to
delete your gun which may be unfortunate
and if you do a get you'll get that
represent that JSON representation so
again nothing to do with bring boot
spring the spring date arrest project
does that for you but if you're not
using spring boot you need to wire those
things together you need to enable the
scanning of repositories you need to say
okay I want to deploy my opposite my
repositories in that namespace etc so if
we go back to the annotation you've seen
this by Twitter thing that's going to
customize the endpoint for the search so
if I go back on speakers this is fully
linkable API so i can see that i have a
certain point here and on the certain
point i can see i have a buy twitter
certain point and i can also execute a
query remoting so if you have a
JavaScript client and you want to invoke
that it's very easy to do okay so um
reminder I haven't configured anything
yet okay no configuration I'm just
writing code and this is what's
happening next step I want it's a web
application which expose highly
sensitive information so I'm going to
add security to it so what do I do
probably get that by now right I'm going
to add the starter and there is one
okay let's restart and see what happens
if for instance ok I have to log in now
so these are the these are the decisions
that we take we don't know anything
about your app you have had it the
security starter which brings spring
security you have no configuration
whatsoever so we are going to secure
everything use basic authentication with
the wonderful spring real that you don't
see you're supposed to see spring
somewhere but that's gone now and I need
a user and the password to login right
so what would that be admin admin no
nice try
sorry
could be but no I also had spring boot
like Scott tiger but that's not it
either so okay one hint the username is
user password nope nope nope okay so one
thing we didn't want to do and we had
the answer there thank you is we don't
want to write the default password in
the developer guide because if you
forget off if you're too lazy of
whatever you had a bad day not enough
coffee enough you may deploy that thing
somewhere when you're not supposed to
and someone can read the developer guide
and log into your app so what we do is
every time the application starts we
generate a password and we put that in
the log right here let me try that done
so there's two things about that one is
it's a changing all the time so every
time you restart the app the password
will change and two we make it long
enough so that it's really it really
bugs you and there is only one purpose
for it is that you do something about it
right do something anything so this will
be the first time in this demo that I'm
actually going to have an opinion I'm
going to say to spring boot okay find
the default password that's that's easy
enough for one try but it's bugging me
so I want to act on that so let's do
something so i'm going to write
configuration now here for instance
because my my springwood application is
a configuration class so i'm going to
write something like this and if you
look at the import that again it's not
spring boot it spring security so
anything you know about spring security
just reuse this it's nothing different
it's the same thing so i'm going to
create to user i'm going to create a new
translation manager in memory but if you
look at the spi
you have plenty of options you can do a
jdbc ldap and whatnot I'm going to
create to user and one is our hero and
one is it's a simple user ok so let's
restore that thing and see what happens
ok hero hero done and if we go back to
the to the log of this application there
is no password being generated anymore
because it doesn't make sense you had an
opinion so we're not going to do that
thing anymore and plus you see that we
still see that dialogue that basic on
that occasion dialogue opening so it's
not because you have an opinion on ten
percent of the security setup that you
will have to redo the ninety percent
will identify that you have an opinion
of the ten percent and will apply your
custom ten ten percent to the rest of
the auto configuration and we do that
for everything well whenever we can at
least right so there is plenty of things
I could show you I could show you for
instance template engines I could bring
time relief and create a template and
basically render the speaker if I had
time I would do that but there is a
session right after lunch springwood for
the web which will deeply focus on that
so I'm not going to show you this but
instead i would like to switch to part
two what the spring boot brings what
features the spring would bring so
really about things that you get as a
feature if you start to your spring good
so that i'm going to i'm going to add a
dependency again let's summarize those
features and it's called actuator don't
ask me what it means i got the question
every time I give this presentation and
always forgot what that means so go and
Wikipedia or something and what actuator
is going to add to your app is
management endpoints
administrative endpoints things that
allow you to manage the configuration of
your app or to debug your up remotely or
check if your app is healthy or retrieve
information about your appt okay so
first thing let me show you the
environment and point ah ok it didn't
work anybody know why it didn't work so
reminder it was it's something that you
you need to access to have sensitive
information about your app I have a
forbidden which means i can't access to
that i'm not an administrator right so
what does it take to be an enemy's
traitor what do i need i need a roll
okay what role would that be you said
admin yes I need to be admin and if I go
back to if I go back to my config here
on purpose as you would expect as you
would suspect by now I'm not an admin
okay so um what can I do I can I can
basically do this I can oh yeah spring
boot you forces me to do this whatever
and it will work but I don't want to do
that right I don't want to show you this
I want to show you that spring boot can
react to you need and your design and
the decisions that you make we provide a
default if you're not happy with the
default you can perfectly change it so
in this case I want to tell to spring
boot you know the default role to access
the management endpoints is admin in my
app I don't like admin for whatever
reason I I want it to be hero instead so
the way to tell that to spring boot is
to configure is to configure the other
configuration so to provide a
configuration key basically a property
that you set which default
use it admin and you want to set you
instead okay so there is 15 let me take
that down there is one file that we
haven't seen yet which is this
application property thing this is the
configuration infrastructure of spring
boot which is really really feature
there's a lot of features in it so you
can specify configuration in this file
you can put that file outside of your
app you can pass come on line switch you
can pass system properties you can pass
environment variables if you into gen
dia you can also connect to join the
iron and retrieve those values from jndi
so now the next step is the next step in
our journey is to find the key what key
do I have to use to set that role so
usually what we do is we go on google or
stack overflow and i've heard some
people actually read documentation also
do it doesn't happen very often so we
did we the spring would tip we really
won't want it to do something about it
right we want it to give a better
assistance and to help you and let you
stay so that you stay in the ids but you
don't leave the ID that's really our one
of our focus so if i'm in that file
napnap roll I get another completion
with the available options again I'm
using IntelliJ ID don't worry if you use
as yes on that beans they have similar
similar integration and the NetBeans
integration is done so the disorder
completion in the NetBeans works it
doesn't for the new project wizard the
thing I used are the winning maybe it's
implemented by now but that thing is is
there for a while so as you can see if I
tap roll the first option is the right
one and you can see that the default
value is admin and i'm going to say here
instead and we start the thing which
really annoys me now
okay if I do that it works okay if your
brain is melting by now ho ho
autocompletion wonderful wonderful
please um be aware that this
infrastructure works for your own keys
so if you have configuration for your
app you want content assistance like
that for your keys it's very easy to do
very easy I don't have time to show that
now but after the session if you want to
if you interested by that I can show it
to you so the environment first 10 point
that the actuator brings I can see the
system properties in my environment the
environment variables I can see also the
application config you can see that
there is one you can see the location
and the content so it is very easy for
you to connect to an app running in
whatever staging production look at the
configuration and clearly and identify
what the configuration is and where it
comes from it's a REST API so if you do
this you'll get the value for one key so
think about management infrastructure
where you have some complex monitoring
system and you need to make sure that
all your app have certain criteria I
don't know a certain java version is
required you have an HTTP end point you
just do a get you get a JSON back with
the value and you can assert that the
environment is compliant as as easy as
that ok so for the ones who use hot cold
spring users / beans another view of the
application context so I can see all the
beans that have been defined if I'm
using complex configuration with being
overriding by name anybody did that in
his life here in her life they will know
that it's a nightmare because you don't
really know where the overriding comes
from so this endpoint
tells you exactly which bins are being
defined and where they are being defined
so if my demo application I can see
where it's being defined security config
I have the name of the file and
everything okay and we see related
mappings which you RI are mapped to this
web application and you can easily see
that / is mapped to this this is the
thing we design earlier who knows what
kill mine you three the PID does on a
unix system still minus three anyone
sorry nope no trade dump so if if you
have a problem in production and the
application hangs and of course it only
happens in production I don't know you
but I had once to write to sign three
forms to get to be allowed to ssh to the
remote system to do the kid minus three
to see why the application was hanging
which was quite a journey so we spring
would you do that / dump and you
basically get a threat dump that you can
inspect remotely okay i want to show you
more things but before I do I want to
show you a new feature in spring boot
one two three core dev tools so dev
tools is something that we did to let
you stay in the ID as much as you can
again but for different reason so to
show you it works let me just add a
dependency it's a development only
dependency dev tools
all right let's restart that thing so if
i do that i have an extra extra features
in my local environment one of them is
live reload support we know is about
that we load a few okay so in a nutshell
live reload is you install this plugin
it's free it works in all browser if you
happen to be working with an application
that is live reload compliant you click
on that thing and the browser will
connect connect to the application and
as a result the application will be able
to send commands to the browser and we
do that so if I do this I'm connected
now even though it's not that obvious
and when I do that springwood will be
able to do something with the browser so
let's see and now let me show you this
first your standpoint so the earthen
point is yet another end point that the
actuator brings it's a common place so
again if you have a monitoring system if
you want to know if your app is up or
not then you have a single place to look
for for spring boot up and you can see
that there are many aspect to check
whether or not your application is up
you see that there is to that has been
defined that have been auto configured
so this is also something that we do
internally so the auto configuration
have a certain smart order that thing
comes last well last after most most of
the other auto configurations and in
this case spring boot has detected a
database so since there is a database
it's going to fire the start of the data
source or indicator if I added like I
don't know Mongo already so new for
j or couchbase or whatever then a
dedicated earth indicator would be
started with it now let's assume that
your application needs to contact some
remote service and you want to make some
to get some data out of it I don't know
and you want to make sure that this
service is up and if this if that
service isn't then either your
application is down on the application
as a warning signal or whatever it's
very easy to integrate in that system so
let's let's do some code and in this
case yes it's a spring with specific API
because that's a spring will feature so
I'm going to create a North indicator
that i'm going to call go to earth
indicator and okay it's going to do
something very smart you'll see focus
i'm going to say my app sorry earth my
app is up oh let's say it's down and i
can also add some detail i could add an
exception and that's going to be
included into the response i'm saying
like that right so I'm simply creating a
beam definition if i do that i have my
status I didn't restart the app in case
you gives you didn't follow I didn't
restart the app so that's the other
thing that they've told us and just to
show you if i refresh just the random
thing is not a joke is real it's popular
joke it's to show you that every time
you hit the endpoint it's actually going
to invoke the method and you'll have a
chance to say yes that party that
component is up no it's done oh there is
an out-of-service or there is a warning
order and you'll see that the status
will react accordingly there is one
other endpoint that you can use which is
tres Tew trace incoming request to your
service where you can get a dump of the
Heather the request headers and the
response and you can see also that we
are good citizen because if the
application is done we return the proper
HTTP status so that you can rely on the
HTTP status to know to figure out if the
application is 70 so um devtools two
things two main things reading one is
live reload integration so assume that
you are working on a template you just
edit your template you save BAM new
template is refreshed automatically in
the browser one that's easy enough to do
without the tools you have to configure
a few things become for instance for the
template engine we have caching so if
you change if you render the template
once and you modify it by default it
would be cached so nothing would be seen
dev tools make sure to disable the cash
when you add dev tools to your project
so that
dev tools is active you get a nice local
development experience and if you're not
you get the nice production default
that's 12 it monitors your classes it
monitors your classpath and when it
figure out that something has changed it
restored the application context for you
so if I if I change something here I
couldn't I could something I create a
new action I create a new method i
create a new rest controller i create a
new JP entity whatever you name it and i
compile dev tools we'll figure that out
we start the app and you'll have almost
immediate feedback what else matrix how
much time do I have
ok
matrix so we have a metric system
built-in in spring boot and with a very
simple API one API to recall contours so
something you can increment decrement
and one which is gauge which is
recording a single value we expose all
kinds of things related to the vm and we
also expose HTTP related information so
you can see here the access sorry that's
the gauge thing that's the polio sorry
that's all I meant the counter of HTTP
access / HTTP status so you can see that
I've invoked the Earl 10.3 times and it
returned that the app was down and two
times the web the app was up i also have
um the response time of the last request
so the last time i invoke the trace and
point it took 10 milliseconds to
complete and you also get incremented
auto configure metrics so if you have a
data source you also get statistics
about the data source so you'll know how
many connections are open for the moment
that's the usage thing the active thing
and you'll get the percentage of how
many percent of your connection pool is
being used at the moment which is like
zero because i'm not using using it we
also have cash support and cash
auto-configuration support for the old
major caching system so if you drop each
cash azelastine finished pan oj cash
provider guava cafe in whatever we are
going to auto configure the caching
caching system for you unless you had
your own configuration and we're going
to expose metrics for that so the each
ratio the miss ratio and the size of the
cache will be export for you if the API
exposes that information
so far we have seen a web application so
I don't want you to leave the room with
the impression that spring boot is but a
tool to develop web applications only so
you can build whatever kind of app you
want you can have you can build come
online apps if you want very easy to do
so just to show you quickly the actuator
endpoint is also available via gmx if
you happen to use that that might be the
one yes so if i go here i can see all
the endpoints and you see that my
customers endpoint is there right so if
you're not using if you're not building
a web application and you add the
actuator to your app you still have you
still have all those management
endpoints except there is no web
endpoint to call so you invoke that by
layer genex okay so um it's like I have
like 10 minutes if I'm counting right so
it's been 40 minutes to 40 minutes ish
the time coding and what I would like
you to remember is that I never left the
aggie that's really the impression I
would like you to stick from from this
presentation I never left the ID and I
build all that using only the ID so for
instance if you want to debug the
application what does it take it's dumb
cat right so remote debug suspend run
the debugger run the app the app will
connect to the remote debugger and then
you can remove the back that's the kind
of experience that you have with web
application if you want to debug a web
application with spring boot you run the
debug button because it's a main class
um but sometimes you need to actually
ship what you do and you're not going to
do that in an ID right so you probably
need something let
see so going outside the ID for once and
building so nvm package again simple
simple goal if I do that I have this I
have my original app so only my code the
one you would have if you were I don't
know developing your library or
something and the main one and i want to
start this app now so what do i do to
start this up well i do this so Java
dash John the name of the jaw and your
app we start this is very important
because if you think about crowd
environment that's really really suited
for cloud environments you have one file
you sit one file and you start a process
and the process is your app and if i go
back here will it so it's obviously
still up so you can do things like this
also if you can read so dash dash server
the fault 70 70 and it's gone just to
show it's not running no it's there and
i need to enter decade of course let's
do that so server that vault is one of
the many customizations that that are
available to from spring boot you can
find them here so if you type server
you'll get all these including the ball
okay
so once you have that you have one file
it's a process you can shape the process
if you happen to have a case similar
that requires you to build a wall file
which might happen unfortunately spring
boot supports that just fine if you want
to know how it works I could show you
but you could also do this choose war
packaging there generate the project
that's going to generate the war with
all this all the same features that the
thing I've shown you get a wall you
deploy a wall and when you have your
tradition traditional more deployment a
few more things about deployment let's
make that executes executable
let's see what it does
though executable flag on it on the jar
file yep
so executable basically brings
everything that's required to execute
your process executive up so you don't
have a bash script and the jar just a
jar is the thing you start if you think
further about any D support or anything
that unix provide you to win running
services we integrate with that so if
you do a simple inkling from OTC led
whatever to this and you do service
whatever start it will start without any
any further configuration and I think
that's it so thank you very much for
attending and I'm waiting for your
questions
and there have been some questions asked
through the app so I'll start with those
first an on boot question but for people
have that have been working with spring
for for a number of years already what
happened to spring roo and it's a still
a use case i compared to spring boots as
far as i know spring Roo is still under
development not under the not the spring
team working on it there is a company in
Spain I believe they are working on it
and they have all they were already have
released a 2 0 m1 i believe which is
based on spring do it by the way so if
you want to know about that stuff all
the all the links and the sides and
everything it's still up so but we're
not working on it actively anymore yeah
and do you have an experience to spring
boot in combination with AWS lambda not
sure if that makes sense no I haven't
sorry depending on who asked that maybe
you would like to clarify your question
sorry it's a way that should work but
it's it's a triangle service finally a
very detail one does spring boot work on
websphere a tot 525 I will because it's
recorded so I'm not going to positively
say yes but I did try websphere eight
dot five dot something recently and it
did work yes I don't know if the dot
five is important in the question but
eight dot five dot something does it is
really little ok I'll leave it at that i
saw that i want to other questions but
just please feel free to come to the
stage afterwards ok thank you very much
and don't forget to vote
