today I will talk about engineering
culture this is the same talk I
a tad bad con to a sweet weeks ago two
main differences it's in English second
difference I only have half of the time
I had last time so i might skip through
it very fast or leave out some parts if
you have questions interrupt me anytime
I think it's better to have a lively
discussion for 30 minutes and just me
talking for some advertisement again I'm
also really excited that coupon is
coming to Berlin I think after passwords
last year and this is another sign that
Berlin is really growing as a IT city
and I personally think the queue
Cumberland and go two hours are some of
the best conferences I know so yeah I'm
really looking forward to it whoever
doesn't know some clothes no okay then I
cannot skip this light and sound cloud
is basically for audio what YouTube is
for video of liquor for pictures you can
upload the audio you can share with
other people you can do all kinds of
things but the basic thing is a sound
sharing platform we have around 15
million users at the moment curve you're
adding one and a half million users a
month at the moment and we also have
some pretty interesting technology
behind it where Stefan oh we also have
to have a hybrid approach with
relational database and we'll see cool
store and but this is not the topic of
this talk the topic of this talk is
engineering culture so the question is
the first question is what is it what is
culture and what does it mean does it
mean we're doing scrum where we do it
can burn the set engineering culture
it's part of it but it's definitely not
the culture so how vika pedia defines
cultures is a set of common norms values
goals and practices that shape an
organization so it's way more than just
our we're kind of our job we have a
scrum master cool it is it is way more
and i will talk about what it is and why
it is important
so the first big question is is only the
engineering culture important and the
answer is no it's the over a culture of
company that is important and then you
need to think about what kind of company
that actually is so are you more red
bull type of company that means the
product itself doesn't matter so much
right i guess nobody can deter if you're
red bull from something else if you do a
blind test red bull is peeled about
marketing making deals and so on the
product behind is unimportant google
started as a very cool product right so
it was the first good search engine on
the web and it's still a very
engineering focused organization so if
google would provide a krabby product
they will prove at least in the early
years i would say there would be out of
a market now it could be a bit of could
be a bit different but i think that's
the first thing what kind of company are
young or are you even when I was really
impressed by Mark Zuckerberg I have to
say I know there are some things you
might not like about Facebook but having
an essay about hacker culture and the
IPO documents I'm not sure who read it I
was deeply impressed by it there were
some eleda saying that they thought okay
he's immature you cannot do it I
honestly think that that was great and
it showed that he values the most
important thing who who knows this from
from his company I've been on the
business for around 20 years and I've
heard this one sentence pretty often
it's about engineering is because driver
features of doing taking two slow and
the question is why are features taking
slow and why this perception comes and
often it is that doing grove of a
company mistakes happen so all engineers
are doing mistakes everybody is doing
mistake and the question is how do you
react to such mistakes do you keep on
innovating do you keep on move moving
fast and and and brake thing or do you
put
processes and around it and slow down
things in the end you will have this
statement in your company I'm pretty
sure so these are for me the most
important parts of the Nidge Indian
culture how important is engineering and
the product in the company how much
trust is there in engineers what is the
communication like in the company what's
the tone of communication something went
wrong and manager things oh I have to
write an email everything in capital
letters don't do this again otherwise I
will have to do something what kind of
rituals do have an organization I will
come to this later how does your
organization look like very important
for engineering and pretty sure a lot of
people from you know the sm could be in
product department that can be an
engineering department actually a
department and an operations department
and if you think long enough you will
maybe invent some more departments and
lastly what kind of processes exist and
the company so i'm not against processes
but they should help people and and not
you know them so maybe you short story
from a company i worked at which showed
showed pretty much failures on both
sides are you I mean all this was on
TechCrunch so i think i can tell it
nokia launched his own app store some
years ago OV store they did a big
marketing campaign around it so as
engineers they launched it on a friday
afternoon on two servers and everybody
went home so what happened then a lot of
people tried to sing out everything
crashed some people were called in it
was a complete disaster and on
TechCrunch there was a bit article about
the launch was a complete disaster what
happened then is oh my god we have to
deduce change management and the outcome
of this was one of those things I've
ever seen it was
for every little change you wanted to do
on production that could be just a minor
bug fig you had to fill out and big
extra sheet with seven pages which was
then uploaded to a change management
tool which cost which it cost about a
million euros but they didn't have
enough time enough money to customize it
so they use the exit so to review a
change request you had to duel icing 12
mouse clicks so nobody did it so nobody
looked at it and just say approve a
proof and this basically showed that
okay happens I think this kind of
error is not really acceptable but I
think there can be other consequences
and all the other hand was what happened
out of it that people just invented and
obscure an unbelievable process and I
fought against that for how many years
to at least one is it still there no no
okay cool see and so importance of
engineering is phone engineering culture
I think a very very important thing and
you have a company the engineers as
other people who actually built built to
stuff there might not be all the people
who invent what can be done but they
should certainly should have input and
encompass which try to very great
products the importance of engineering
should be pretty high we are soundcloud
we have around fifty percent of the
company in engineering and even though
not everything is perfect I think with
engineering still have a has a big say
and what happens on the ground Trust is
the next next big issue is an engineer
allowed to deploy the production without
getting several approvals or talking to
a lot of people or having a long queue a
process that engineering doesn't
engineer have access to all the
infrastructure components and so on and
so on I think this is a trust issue do
we trust people
to be responsible and to not completely
screw up the system communication I
already told you about the capital
letter emails which happen don't do this
otherwise I and it should be always like
communication been a wait of engaging
people of for example we had an outage
two weeks ago somebody did something
really unfortunate on the database level
I don't want to go into details without
was a longer outage and basically the
guy I mean he already felt really really
bad but he mostly got housing high fives
from us to encourage him and and to
continue and I know a lot of how
companies where this wouldn't have
happened although we have to change
something there and so this is um who
works in a company where looks like that
you know one but it's a very common
setup I saw a lot of companies and a lot
of companies are changing it right now
for example in abeyance card was was one
to one like this and there were all
these departments finger pointing to
each other so I pronation was fing apart
into Engineering's are not fast enough
QA were thing appointing to engineering
you're doing so many mistakes p.m. was
finger pointing to QA you don't find all
the bugs and ops well you only think
they had in mind was up time and
deployments were but not really possible
so and this also goes hand in hand with
trust issues and you can certainly you
can think you can deduct pretty fast
from the setup how long it takes to
develop a feature from from left to
right to get a feature phone
specification to being done i would say
in this a setup you can measure the
month right way and then it's about
processes what kind of project this is
this is an actual process from just pc
mi or something i don't know how
software is being developed how the
whole process looks like from
can I just put a feature on the Kanban
board on a scrum board and two weeks
later being deployed or do I have to
talk to 20 stakeholders do a KPI
evaluation measure the financial like
success and after four weeks of
discussion that might be on the backlog
somewhere so but these things
unfortunately exist in keyword
especially in germany and i will just
skipped last one so 4 minus GX
perspective are only it's only we are
the good guys engineering as a good guys
are the other ones the bad guys and i
think the obvious answers is no I've
seen a lot of engineering departments
with shots themselves in the knees and
they couldn't get anything going anymore
look the big question is overall what
can you do to change this kind of
culture so you are stuck in a bad
culture what can you do to change it so
I think one of the first question is
what about those guys so I meant
management with that picture are they do
they agree that maybe department splits
have to have to have to go and maybe
that continuous delivery might be a good
idea if they agree fine it's going to be
a big big task but it's a not agree I
mean what can you do I mean and I think
there's a lot of stuff in the nine kin
to do can do I think taking care of code
quality making sure that QA doesn't find
any bugs make sure that the software is
easily deployable and so there's a lot
of things which you can do to improve it
and to lay the foundation that the whole
organization looks better
um how much time do I have Gary enough
cool then i will start this most rent
about scrum which was my favorite topic
so a lot of process out there i think
the waterfall times are over and
everybody is doing scrum now right scrum
is a big new thing and scrum is the
solution to everything and for me it's
basically existing it's mostly high
power substance some of the basic ideas
are pretty sound and I don't want to say
that everything is bad about scrum but
in general it misses a lot of good
points and I've seen a lot of companies
who said ofs come master of a proud
owner I have a sprint planning meeting
for sprint review meeting and I feel
with respective sonar Joe and I think
this is so far from truth from from the
truth it's not even mentioned on I who
knows where this who doesn't know who's
this it is chef Sutherland he's one of
the inventors of scrum and I actually
did his grandma's a training with them
was watch which was two days long and of
these two days one and a half days were
marketing and financial success stories
and how much money my company's how much
money company saved with doing scrum and
so the basic fashion is what is good and
what is bad about sprung and this
heavily depends on where you're coming
from if your work if you're coming from
a enterprise water foolish process I
think scrum is a great step forward it
will change a lot of things which were
wrong and I don't I suppose that
everybody is familiar bus from here yes
no come on so at least you're doing
hopefully you deploy once in iteration
you have visibility about what has to be
done you
at least compose a team which is not
only engineering but should be also full
of management and mostly QA
unfortunately never ops if you're coming
from the startup and you're just deploy
stuff I personally think scum as a bad
idea and it's when you look at scrum
implementation you see a lot of
anti-patterns evolving out of crumb so
before maybe you did a big water for
this approach for three months you did
sweet weeks of specification for weeks
of implementation then you did QA and
that UD deployment and then after three
months you deployed something now you
have scrum and sometimes it happens that
you have sweet days of specification you
have three days of implementation three
days of QA one day of deployment and
then just an all done which is better
which is better than before don't get me
wrong but it's not what is being meant
with agile software development a lot of
focus is like I said before a lot of
focuses put on roads and meetings there
are a lot of sprung consultants out
there who have no idea at all about
software engineering and what that means
they just focus okay you have these
planning meetings you have the backlog
and then you are John you're doing scrum
and this place hand in hand with that
engineering practices often are not
improved
adults I will see that you have some
students are back I don't say AI mean
and yeah I mean anti-patterns are not
scrum any patterns at me yeah you can do
scrum right but in a general soft
engineering point of view I would claim
that these are anti-patterns I in the
scrum perspective it might be okay okay
then it's and these are things so to be
clear these are things i saw a lot on
the ground not yeah so this I don't I
don't I don't say I don't say this has
to come out of strong no that doesn't
have to come up with somebody yes and
and no there are also some things in
scrum which which happen and I
personally don't like but I think if you
do respective and you constantly improve
and you adapt to process to your needs
you might come to something good but I
always like to look on how things look
at the ground and how things are
actually being implemented and not so
much looking at the website and
everything sounds good and then see we
everything should be fine and I've seen
a lot of these things we're also okay
engineering practices are often not
touched at all and if you did waterfall
before and you have the same engineering
practices as before and scrum it just
won't work and the operations people are
mostly outside of the scrum teams is
nothing which is on the scrum website or
something but it's something I see a lot
i see a lot of that QA is being
integrated into the scrum teams if you
need create but I've rarely seen that
operations is being part of a scrum team
and that usually means that the Sprint
review meeting you show stuff on the
table server and not life
and and this is now I think one of the
core passwords in the ITC in continuous
delivery everything you do you just push
it out to to the public and how does it
feel that does that fit into scrum I
mean there's a sprint review meeting we
are the proton as opposed to mark or the
tasks as done but they are all deployed
already and and and used so this is
something which just doesn't fit m3
features like that actually are
possibilities but then again if you look
at it and you deploy something on the
first day of an iteration the
integration squeaks long and you just
show it to internal people it's
basically lost money right you have to
develop something it could be okay and
it could be out there yeah but then you
don't need to sprint review meeting so
it's a more constant processor so in
reality software development should be a
constant process of the leg value I see
it more like a can banish a kind of
approach where features move from
backlog to done and being deployed by
the way so maybe some short words about
how we doing engineering at a SoundCloud
around fifty percent of our company our
engineers we have a very flat hierarchy
until thing a week ago so I was the only
manager for 45 people which is kind of
crazy I have to admit right yeah yeah
hopefully good experience
yeah but 45 is too many you you don't
know what people are doing anymore
everybody and everybody can deploy your
life but we give it hats up in IRC and
if nobody objects and too much deploys
at least return today we have a very
open infrastructure I think except some
of the crow Reuters &amp;amp; Co firewalls
everybody can access everything and
change nearly everything our technical
decisions are really a very team driven
we have an architectural as a very
strong opinions but I think most of the
day to day decisions are being done by
the engineers or by the team and every
bigger feature is being reviewed other
than the bigger feature but everything
which is not the minor bugfixes being
reviewed and the pull request on a good
public fest so that people can see it's
a code ok and sometimes it takes a bit
too long to end those public this but in
the end it's a very good decision and we
we have not a single crew a role or a
single testin or company so we often we
have iOS we have Android we have mobile
websites we have all kinds of stuff and
we don't have a signature a role and the
company that doesn't mean we don't do QA
right but we don't have a single to a
role and how that happens is that we're
in a very good situation that people at
soundcloud a very passionate about the
product so everybody's constantly using
the product i'm now known in the iOS
team as a guy with the shower box
because i usually plug my iphone in a
big boom box in the morning and viola
shower I listen to soundcloud and always
was the latest alpha version and i think
in the last three weeks or discovered
four major bugs doing that and we have a
kickass community team which if we don't
catch up the back the community team
will be close to to our deaths pretty
soon
otherwise we have a lot of rituals in
our company which thinkin forces our
culture's we we have master classes once
a week where people can just talk about
whatever we have to master class about
feminism about electro punk about
whatever so it's basically people's so I
sorry no no community also a community
team is what in Germany is more called
the support team so they interact very
closely with our community of users and
their money to proactively Twitter and
everything and yeah they give us most of
the back reports who are then on life
sorry
yes yes but i was oscar snubs we have
tech talks we have every friday we doing
peer together we try to block very
openly about our infrastructure about
what we're doing the only constraint
years that we don't have enough time to
do that we put a lot of value on t-mo
tation that people don't stay within a
team forever and there's finger-pointing
between the teams too much eating is the
third or fourth t know yet the good say
yeah absolutely no and sorry like 55 on
average I think we have smaller teams
but we don't have the team which is
bigger than five I think where we have
our 10 9 to 10 teams now
we have people assigned to the team who
attends that there's a stand ups they're
not we don't have so many we don't need
ten operations people and especially not
for iOS or Android or the website but in
the backend teams one guy we call them
system engineer to not have those deaf
ops it's just a naming thing but they
are assigned to teams and they attend to
stand ups to see what's going on and to
help with all issues
person
he's the glory
yes nobody is forced to rotate with but
everybody can rotate obviously it's not
like all tomorrow going to the system by
this is not how we do it so obviously we
have to see okay what are the big
features here now but we usually find an
agreement so until now I think
everything went somewhere not
immediately but so we prefer journalists
but we completely see that we need
specialists in some areas so there's no
anti-spam team there's a machine
learning guy who I don't understand what
is going to be honest I just hope he's
doing the right thing and and you cannot
just rotate them to you you might able
to rotate him to something to another
team but rotate somebody else and
replacing him would be a major act so
it's in general it's we try to have
general this but we see that we need
specialist in some areas yeah we also
have ice I would say like our anti-spam
by we have one architect at the moment
yeah 45
this is T so the architects happened
when here what is a guy who would
develop the whole thing in the beginning
so he has very deep knowledge about
everything and is very opinionated and
so we won't create a big architecture
team if we promote more people to
architects that will be inside the team
is more important thing so if you're
thinking about using bra to go talk to
him it has a global experience but we
talked to him like proud about
so we have something like the twenty
percent thing at Google hairs we call it
hecka time you engineers can take one
day off and work on side projects this
can range from people taking machine
learning classes at Stanford people
doing iOS hacks people working on open
source projects and it's actually being
used which is a good pretty good thing
because we have a high very high
workload I have to admit and I'm really
happy that people just say from time to
time okay I'm staying home I'm doing my
hair cut on projects could be more but
at least people are using it it has to
be someone connected with SoundCloud so
if you write software which organize
your DVD collection we don't see it as a
hecka time for tech if you want to
evaluate the latest no signal store yes
so that's it there should be some
potentially some value to us but it
doesn't have to be something which will
then the production yeah we have oh that
I forget we have a company demo every
two weeks we demo what the single teams
have done and then people also from time
to time demo the hackathon vortex
they don't really do it today someone to
Jerry over all day but how would we
everyone
no not everyone I made a quick survey
and it seemed to me like fifty percent
of the engineers who have been with us
long as in six months because in the
first months you usually try to get
accustomed to everything are using
hackathon and it there's no formality
around that you can just say but you
have to announce it within your team you
burn your team ok next wednesday i'm
working on project x and then if nothing
really really urgent stands against it
and i haven't seen it being rejected so
far yeah so that's the basic thing we
try to put a lot of emphasis that on
that the thing a person can decide and
see what's best for the team and a wall
and it's not like oh can I take our time
and I have to fill out a document and
let it being signed persuade people
also groups we have a whole team taking
part in the k DD cup there's a smooth
use machine learning competition and
that's five people's taking are working
together one day in a week and trying to
win the competition I'm actually don't
know all they doing to you they gave up
okay bad example so you know I was
drifting a bit way but the thing is the
lesson from a lot of companies I've seen
and and watching watching them grow and
watching them react to mistakes is that
most companies become slower while
growing some of them some of these
things are natural because you have to
adapt your processes but some of them a
big part of it is due to introducing
top-down processes because people are
too afraid to do a mistake but they are
not afraid of being slower and I think
in the end it's better to do a mistake
here and there then the slow down the
whole organization and to move
responsibility away from the engineer to
some abstract processes which exists in
this organization and this is a pattern
I've seen a lot of companies and I'm
really curious to see how a company on
the scale of Facebook will evolve over
the next years they're obviously a lot a
lot of challenges with keeping that kind
of culture but I think possibly think
that's way to go so that was it
