to be here I wanted to talk about seven
top tips that I learned doing my role in
agile project management so what I'm
going to do is thread this into a
narrative a story a story about what
I've done it's a story of failure
Sasori personal failure it's quite
embarrassing in parts for me hopefully
not for you to listen to and then I'll
go through some of the experiences I've
had learning from my own failure and
developing things further it's going to
be based on the work that I've done with
BBC Worldwide that I finished a couple
of years ago I'm now working with a
large government client in the UK and 40
I'm going to talk about that work
publicly but let's go back and start
with my story and I want to start with
my first tip the importance of
understanding the purpose of what you
were doing
so Katherine mentioned that I've been
doing this for about 10 years this is my
very first scrum team and this was in
the investment bank in London and I'd
never done scrum before and I was really
looking for an opportunity I'd been a
software developer but I wanted to have
more influence actually wanted to pay a
program and so I went to this
organisation because I were doing a job
back in the day and when I got there
everyone that was doing peer programming
had left and so then I thought well gone
created team you can do things like peer
programming extreme extreme programming
the trouble was that someone had told me
that the senior leader hated agile so I
was faced with this dilemma I got an
opportunity to run a team I wanted to
use these methods that I believed would
be effective but I was told that the
leader hated it and so to resolve my
dilemma
I chose quite a curious technique this
is a fire escape this is a stand up that
we used to do a 10-2 for every day so I
thought rather than talking to the
leader about why I wanted to do it and
see if I could work together with him I
just used a very sort of controlling
passive style and do it anyway but hope
that no one noticed so this is how
stand-up every day
10 to 4 15 people would leave a floor
and stand in this fire escape doing the
stand-up so I guess when I look back at
that now I think I had good intentions
the methods were good the methods did
produce results but I would have
preferred to do what I do now which is
to talk to people if someone didn't like
it tests that assumption because
actually the joke on this was when I
finally left here I said to the the
leader said why you're leaving yeah I
thought what you did was excellent I
said really because I heard that you
hated it and he said no I mean I think
it's it I'm so impressed with the
standup because it makes me think what
are all the people on my floor doing
just sitting there all days they don't
speak to each other I wonder how they
understand what's going on so he was
actually probably quite a proponent of
it because but because of my own fears
about talking about something where I
didn't think I get my way I missed that
opportunity for the discussion and I
missed the opportunity for learning and
I created limited learning between us
which was quite sad I think well the
methods were good and the story is often
funny so what I was doing was really
focused on Kanban so this first point is
about starting with purpose and I really
got focused on method and not on purpose
and we had a great time and I learned a
lot of good things this was our board
originally we did wacky things like
following the principles of
self-organization everybody could choose
what they did so the board is organized
around people you can see these I'm not
going to point too high
the board has organized swim lanes with
people and but one thing is taught me
actually is the value of visualizing
things and showing it to other people
and also actually a key thing for me is
asking others for help in our own
learning because we're limited by what
we can see ourselves I took this photo
to a group called the extreme Tuesday
Club in London and immediately they were
very critical because you can see things
that I knew but didn't really take in
like one guy here the guy third from the
top has something in every column and
and I asked him about it the next day I
said you're doing something in every
column what's that about he said I
wanted to look busy and so it was an
important lesson that you get what you
measure I didn't realize this but in the
interest of allowing people to make
choices themselves we
organize the work around people and
people often act offensively and they
want to make sure that they look good by
whatever you're measuring even if you
didn't intend it so this is by focusing
on people we made someone focus on their
own effort rather than the team's work
and you can also see what I love about
this is all of the work is waiting in
testing and this was this reducing scrum
this is a day before the end of the
Sprint so it was a really exciting time
because nobody knew what would finish at
the end of a sprint we'd literally throw
it all over the wall we've done our bit
and hope that the tester could get
through it before I went to production
so happily by making things visible and
talking about them we were able to
iterate we did things like pin people to
the work you can see a more a more
steady flow of work across the board
particularly we we only took on we only
started what we could finish that Kanban
idea we iterated again and continue
doing the same thing visualized other
flows exit rules and it's got really
good but again we did this for a long
time and I haven't did crazy things like
every day I'd count all the post-its on
the board because I really believe that
Kanban was the one true way and and
great things would happen if I just did
Kanban properly and I counted how many
tickets were in each column and I did
this cumulative flow diagram that showed
that we've got a lot of tickets down and
sometimes there were bottlenecks but
mostly it just sort of flowed but the
thing was incredibly here for my voice
it became a bit depressing after a while
it really depressing because I couldn't
really relate what we were doing to the
purpose anymore
and I guess one thing was I was focused
on the method so I like this this road
stop boring managers to death by talking
about your methods okay managers or
people outside your team don't care
about your methods they care about you
helping them solve their problems and so
rather than focusing on method I think
this is a much more productive thing
which is to understand what problem
you're trying to solve and let's start
you're moving towards why are you doing
the work what's the purpose behind it so
this is a model that I got from a group
called Vanguard consulting and I really
liked this as a conceptual model that
what we should start by doing is
understanding why are we doing the work
the purpose and then we'll explain
understand the purpose the next thing is
to ask what measures could we use that
are helping us know where whether
whether we are achieving our purpose or
not and that's a very different thing
than using measures that tell us whether
we're busy yes I seem to constantly
fight the psychic weeds of shall we just
count story points and compare teams it
happens all the time but my question
with that is if we did more points would
we be achieving more of our purpose the
answer is probably not and then the
other thing is that the method should be
used to create an impact on the measures
which deliver the purpose so the key
thing here is I was focused very much
just on the method and I was looking at
measures like timeliness which is a
thing but is a different thing than
delivering purpose particularly in what
I do which is help software development
teams build public facing websites where
the purpose is usually to achieve some
user needs help them buy a thing help
them understand the price of a thing
help them submit an application or get
the money that they need for a certain
purpose so one thing is without if you
can't find the purpose in general I like
Peter Drucker who was a management
thinker in America in the 50s where he
says the de-facto purpose of a business
is to create and keep a customer and
that's that's what I shifted on and I'll
use this purpose when I talk about the
work I did with BBC Worldwide but I just
and so I tried to go back to the thing I
was doing the investment bank and focus
a little bit more on purpose so rather
than counting number of cards finished
and what column they were blocked in I
decided to look at the financial trading
products that we were building and
understand how long they took through a
life cycle from development through to
in production and then an idea I was
working with was the things are valuable
when they're used it's not always true
sometimes it's useful to have something
that could be used but wait until things
were used and what I like about this was
it was visualizing that we got 27
products done fairly quickly but some of
them which I chose to highlight in LED
were never used and and what I liked is
that at the time I was saying that you
should use empirical data to make
visions and just use the data the
numbers will tell you things but look at
it I think I spent hours choosing that
color of red to show them how poor they
were at what I thought they were
creating products that no one needed and
putting us under pressure as a
development team to produce them and it
didn't make sense what was the purpose
but what was quite interesting when I
went back was understanding what I did
with this information so I basically
presented this at a steering group
meeting with the senior teams and the
thing was I my view was that these guys
were idiots well they made idiotic
nonsensical hard to understand decisions
I could see the truth the truth was that
though idiots and I really I genuinely
wanted to improve things I wanted them
to ask us to do products that were going
to be necessary because we've got a team
that was able to deliver things fast but
what I said was you know here's a graph
that I think is interesting I was
wondering if we could talk about it and
the senior leader said I think this
shows that we're making very bad
decisions and I felt so bad about
potentially being critical of him in
front of other people that I just
laughed and we never spoke about it
again so it helped me understand that
just because you produced the data
that's not enough that you need to do
better than that and it started me on
this journey of trying to understand why
I wasn't getting the benefits that I was
hoping for and it included me and one
thing in particular clued me and after I
resigned this job someone asked me a
steering group meeting
how long was product 28 can it take and
a friend of mine was in the same meeting
and afterward he said to me Benjamin
when they asked you that question how
many seconds was it before you bit the
guy's head off and I had two reactions I
went wow firstly I didn't think I was
trying to bite the guy's head off but
now that you mention it I think I in
fact did because I went bananas dating
them he's not even using the ones you
built how can you possibly ask me about
that and then I thought I didn't I
didn't realize I bit his head off until
my friend asked me about that and I
don't think biting
one's head off is an effective way of
working together with others that
wrangling cats so I felt very ashamed in
fact to learn this about myself and
quite embarrassed and I thought I'd
really failed that I done all these
things right in terms of following the
methods of Kanban I tried to go up a
level and talk about the purpose but I
really hadn't produced a very effective
conversation if I had done the opposite
I I'd said I keep kept things secret I
hadn't talked or done anything like that
so I think a key thing for me and is to
look at how your own behavior creates
culture and I wanted to give some
examples after I did that work I did
some coaching agile coaching work with
another team and I asked if I could
record myself with my iPhone so that I
could listen back in a like the call
center so I'm recording this session for
training purposes and that was fine with
it and I thought this session hadn't
gone very well
and so I went back to my hotel that
night I thought well this is good
material for learning something didn't
work the way I wanted I was a bit heart
was pumping it was a bit concerned
and I thought brilliant I'm going I've
got the source material in this audio
recording to find out what went wrong
so popped the headphones in I'm
listening to the meeting then I still
get goose bumps around talk arose there
was a bit where I realized 20 seconds
before a certain section to tape what
I'd in fact said so this was amazing but
we're having a discussion about whether
they should have a review step after the
QA step before it went into production
and I didn't like the way the guy was
speaking so if I said to him no no don't
say it like that so basically I told
someone to stop speaking criticized
their form of speaking and basically
yelled at him and what amazed me about
this was that I did that and I
remembered doing it but not until 10
seconds before I heard the audio I was
so embarrassed because I wouldn't stand
up here and say you know what good good
agile coaching someone says something
you don't like
first thing is yell at them yep negate
them and use force that that is top
quality coaching so I didn't believe
that at all and yet I'd produced it and
even better than that I'd produced it
forgotten I'd produced it even though
I'd recorded
for my own learning and then only
realized that when I listen back to it
and I think this gave me an enormous
humility about how can I be effective if
I act like this under conditions of
stress and don't realize it and one of
the things that brought out was like my
own internal theory that I thought in
both cases when I bit the guy's head off
and when I yelled at someone that I
would have I would have understood that
I was being wrong because I thought both
those things weren't effective they
weren't affected by my own theory but it
highlighted that I had a belief that I'd
know when I was being wronged and I
really like this question by Katherine
Schultz it says what does being wrong
feel like when you're wrong when you're
being wrong what does it feel like and
her answer is being wrong so it's like
this really coyote Willie a coyote has
been wrong since that point right he's
left the edge of the cliff and so he was
being wrong but it's only at this point
here when he looks at the camera that he
realizes he has been wrong so this is
the thing that often where we had this
theory that if we're performing and
effectively we'll know it but actually
it's often not the case you don't know
that you're ineffective until after
you've been ineffective and what I
really like about this although it is
enormous Lee emotionally hard work for
me I find it's taken a lot of work to
sort of accept that I can be as
ineffective as audiotapes approve me to
be but it has provided enormous leverage
so being able to understand how I've
been ineffective and in what situations
and then accept that I can act like that
has been really helpful
Katherine was talking before about some
sort of Buddhist ideas I think one of
the really interesting things is to do
to do work on yourself we think about
how you've acted and how you could
improve often involves challenging our
own sense of ego and competence and
people talk about this idea that you've
got to let the ego die that you've got a
certain key I did act that poorly I
really did that just came out of my
mouth no no other defense that's exactly
what happened but the key thing is the
leverage that that gives you so this
phrase here if you're not part of the
problem you can't be part of the
solution if you understand how your own
behavior
police are creating the culture that is
an awesome awesome ability that you've
got them to make a difference to the
culture but as I said it does mean
pushing through at least me feelings of
embarrassment
you know sadness anger at myself for my
own ineffectiveness in order to get
better but it is possible so it got me
really interested in this idea that how
we think we act and how we tell others
we act isn't the same as how we actually
act that's what the tape recorder proved
to me and my friend proved to me and for
fun I used to run some workshops because
I felt so lonely I thought it can't just
be me maybe I could show others that
they're useless as well it wasn't quite
as bad as that but I did try and make
myself feel better by showing that
others could feel the same way so I ran
workshops at agile conferences where I
asked people to do an exercise where
they gave feedback to someone who'd been
performing poorly and I gave them a
sinner and said pretend I'm that person
who's performed badly and see if you can
help me I've come to you for help what
would you say to me and the scenario was
the person who performed badly was
giving feedback to someone on their team
so a member of the workshop said well
your feedback to that team member was
poor because it didn't focus on any
positive actions and it didn't use any
examples I said all I think this is
really interesting on if it's okay with
you I'd like to explore some of the
things I see here and just check in with
you said okay yet that's fine so I said
I think what you've told me here tells
me what you think good feedback is
you've got a theory of good feedback for
you good feedback uses examples and good
feedback focuses on things that are done
positively is that right do you think
that's good feedback said yep I said
well that's really interesting because
let's test your own statement against
your own belief in what good feedback is
so you've got two rules for good
feedback it should use an example so in
your statement was there any example I
don't see it what do you think is like I
don't see any example in that statement
either and so we've got a second rule it
should focus on something that was done
well it should be positive so have you
done anything have you referred to
anything that's positive here I said I
that might be was it
he hadn't and he agreed and so I said
that's amazing so you've got a theory of
what effective feedback is and yet
you've produced a statement that is the
complete opposite of what you believed
to be effective did you do that
deliberately he's like no it just came
out and so I'm using this as evidence
that it wasn't just me that made these
sort of mistakes yell at people when you
find them difficult or bite someone's
head off instead of talking to them but
it's a common human thing that you can
reproduce and I used to go to
conferences and find examples so a
little bit defensive but it was fun I do
like the humor to me I'm more accepting
that we humans are messed up irrational
creatures at times so we're all like
that we can all be like that this was a
group of coaches that wanted to
understand whether they were helping
agile team to be effective and some of
the things I'm trying to help teams get
more effective at was transparency and
so they wanted to know are we as coaches
helping teams become more effective
good thing yes valuable thing but where
I thought things went wrong was the
method they used to measure this what
they decided to do was to stand at the
stand-ups for the teams our coaching and
on a clipboard in secret score the team
for how transparent they were and then
take the transparency scores back to
coaching head office in secret and so
like this is brilliant on the one hand
transparency is seen as an important
useful thing and yet in their own
measurement of it they were doing it in
secret which seems contradictory to me
so I think as I said how people act and
how they believe they act is often very
different to how they actually act if
you can understand how you're actually
acting you've got far more leverage and
opportunity to change and so this
happens all the time
in actually other thing I wanted to
bring up is that you need to be able to
talk about things when they don't work
effectively because a lot of the theory
around Kanban was that you could set
working progress limits and they'd work
like magic and then I saw this tweet the
working column had a limit of two we
have three items in it I raised limit to
three there are now four items in it so
we do need in this wrangling cats
business we can't just rely on numbers
or
we need to be able to introduce an
effective conversation when we see
things that are different from the
belief system that we've got okay so I
want to talk now having failed at this
investment bank to a degree yeah I was
unhappy I think I was too hard on myself
so many things I did well but I thought
that I've acted in effectively at times
understood that humans have this
potential to act like that vote in me
and others so how could I start acting
more effectively so one of the things
that I've used is this idea of showing
people rather than just telling them
that we have a propensity to tell people
things you should do agile we should do
it this way let me tell you the truth as
one of the talks highlighted yesterday
but what can be more effective is
showing people and in my mind sharing
the information that you see saying what
you think it means and then
collaborating together to design ways
forward because the thing is we need
it's not just like that wit limit showed
it's not enough just to have a number in
order to drive change otherwise scales
would lead to weight loss it would be as
simple as just weighing yourself and if
you were too much then you should be
less but we know that humans are quite
complicated around these things so the
idea is to show publicly testable
information so I want to switch now in
my journey from that investment bank
through some coaching gigs to the work
that I did with BBC Worldwide and one of
the things there was they had a group
called Lonely Planet at the time and
they did a lunchtime talk
they were rewriting their ecommerce site
and they've been to a conference where
they come up with this this graph where
someone who presented it that conversion
rate falls off by how slow the pages to
load so the slower the page the less
people that bought stuff and then they
were building a new versions of Lonely
Planet websites and they wanted to test
this idea and they told their product
manager hey we should worry about how
fast the page load times are but they
weren't convinced they had other
features that they wanted to do so what
they did I thought brilliantly was
negotiate with the product manager they
had an old version of the site shown
here in yellow and then they built the
new version they diverted some traffic
to the new version and then they tried
different experiments in here like ABCD
and they said to the product manager
we'd like to make the pages faster but
our sense is you don't believe that
that's important would you be ok if we
ran an experiment where we deliberately
slowed down the page on the new site to
see what the effect was and he said sure
let's try it let's run that experiment
so they slowed that page down and higher
equals better performance on this graph
B which when they slowed the page down
so they put a sleep statement in there
to slow the page down by half a second
which produce publicly testable
information for the product manager and
the team to see that page load time
really did have a difference in their
environment on their site and on that
basis they were able to do more work and
invest more of their time in making
things faster so I was super excited by
this and thought they've done so well
because rather than having a stand up
fight about the right thing that page
load time was the only thing that
mattered they they negotiated small
steps to improve I think this is a key
enabler in product in the product world
rather than trying to get to the
promised land in one big step to go from
the bottom of the mountain to the top
instead let's do publicly testable
information making little steps that we
can negotiate together and one of the
things that really helped me was
remembering my background in
improvisational theatre where they have
this idea that - your goal should be to
make good offers and to be good to work
with and and this is something I think
about literally every day now how can I
help the client that I'm working with
what offer can we make are we being good
to work with - is the experience of
working as effective so I was now
working at BBC Worldwide I was building
some websites to test the hypothesis
that they could create some near news
websites on the international version of
the site that would attract advertisers
and bring in more revenue for the BBC in
the UK and we had an established site
and I wanted to start seeing if we could
learn what would make the site better by
doing some small things and at the time
I didn't think navigation was the right
thing to worry about
but everyone was talking about it was
the biggest concern what's in the header
and so we decided to start there and we
asked whether we could do some
Berman's where we change the navigation
because they thought it was so important
let's go test it so what we did was
people weren't clicking on the
navigation that was the first thing that
really bothered people that they spent
all this time structuring the website
but users never really cared about it
they didn't click on it so what we
decided to do was as the page was
scrolled we'd make the navigation bar
stay at the top of the screen if people
didn't click it god damn it we were just
going to show it to them more until they
did click it and so it wasn't
necessarily what what happened here's
what happened this is the number of
clicks per thousand users we did this in
a control chart so you can see the
period before we did the change than the
dotted line shows when we did the change
and every day after we did the change we
saw a performance higher than we ever
had before so it definitely helped and
it sort of built the sense that we could
do experiments and learn together and it
built trust between us and the editors
so then we went on to do it law we
changed the columns that we changed the
headers in another site and you could
see that the the number of clicks in the
navigation went up as well and so that
was very good we negotiated small steps
to improve and built this ability to
start changing but one of the things I
wanted to illustrate with publicly
testable information particularly in
website and product development you
can't just rely on the numbers you need
to understand what the people are doing
and we had an interesting scenario they
wanted to share with you now that that
showed that where we were trying to get
more people to watch videos because the
idea was that there was more advertising
money in video sponsorships and text so
we wanted to get videos people would go
into these video pages but they just
weren't watching them
I didn't forgot to look at this was
actually a headline I didn't set the
editorial as I haven't come here to be
so my favorite headline but this page
was actually a video page and we could
see from the analytics that lots of
people went to that page but nobody
watched the videos and so using this
principle of publicly testable
information what I decided to do was to
use Amazon Mechanical Turk to do a
remote usability test so Amazon
Mechanical Turk is something where you
can set up a job and this is the job
that I used I paid someone a small
money to go to a screencast tool start
recording their screen go to the site
and then do some things and I wanted to
show you what I showed the editors and
others to understand why we're getting
all these people come into a video page
but not actually watching the video oh
look at the BBC future stuff oh well
let's pull the airplane I think I was
unmanned probe vintage robots
interesting new that was kind yes
reaching Minds very cool stuff world the
3d now that's definitely something
honored check out oh yeah I love that
it's at yeah yeah we spent six months on
that footer you just gave it a year yeah
so sorry this is now where he's
searching for video but one of the
things was interesting what is reading
this is just that we were in the UK
making this and we were thinking it was
the BBC for us English people that spoke
English and it was amazing just to hear
that most of our inches America they
didn't sound like that it's a very
useful thing just to get the editors to
sit and watch this video here is
clicking on a video page there's your
mind and did anyone feel entire
attention of ocean life alright that's
my point
why is the video okay it's kind of I'm
I'm sorry I've got the Macintosh
spinning wheel of death so did anyone
see what happened there it happened
really quickly what happened was he
clicked on something where he saw a
video but the soon as he went to the
page a
Wow so glad I'm not a Windows give me
one second
recover my work go for it so what he did
was click on a page where he saw a video
thing but then the top of the page
he saw the page and then he scrolled
almost instantly because there was
nothing that showed a video was there
which is really hard for us to
understand because we always developed
on local sites with good internet
connections and the site was always
there so this was really useful publicly
testable information it showed that
people go into the page but we didn't
make it obvious that there was a video
there because it was too slow loading
and so what we did from that point was
basically we couldn't make the page load
faster in that instance that wasn't
possible initially so what we had to do
was just put in place a put in place a
placeholder so this works so
to show you this is a different subject
after we've done the change we ran the
same test again this guy's looking for a
video he clicks on a video but this time
importantly you can see a big black
rectangle and that was enough and you
can see he waits for that to load so I
just wanted to show you how publicly
testable information is hugely important
not and when you're dealing with things
not just to look at the numbers but to
try and understand the human behavior
underneath it and how we did it in this
case and that helped us find out what
was going wrong and what could do better
and just the teams I work with now in
government in the UK through my
consultancy we have user researchers on
the team we do this every fortnight with
participants in the office and we've
even worked at how to help the rest of
the team understand what they should
look at when they're doing the user
research so that it can be a team sport
rather than just an individual okay so
the next thing we'd like was to try and
make progress with imperfect tools so
the basis for this was I don't know if
anyone else a supermarket chain in the
UK Tesco's they had delivered this Tesco
Clubcard system which is one of the
earliest sort of analytics driven
Clubcard systems in the UK but what I
loved about them was that when they
started they didn't have enough capacity
in their networks or their register
systems to look at every item that
everybody bought in their basket but
what they did have enough what they did
have was an ability to detect certain
items that might trigger fraud where
they could notify a security guard at
the store to come in and find them so
rather than looking at the whole basket
to try and understand what type of
customer you were they reused the fraud
detection system to indicate certain
things in your basket like if you bought
champagne you might be a high net worth
individual whereas if you bought value
brand margarine you might be a low value
I don't know what they call some non
derogatory term for people that don't
spend much and they did this and that
was enough to help them understand that
this concept would work and then they
could do more and I was hugely inspired
by this idea of making progress with
imperfect tools but one of the one of
the things that really makes me laugh
about this though is that we come back
to their tents of ego and identity that
sometimes our sense of identity
is doing a certain technical thing then
making progress with imperfect tools can
generate embarrassment or threat so one
of the stories that I liked was Amazon
we all noticed they've been doing this
for ages customers who bought this item
also bought that item that was fantastic
this correlation they had this idea what
about if we looked at what people
started searching for and tried to
understand what they bought maybe we
could offer them suggestions there and
that might drive up sales as well and so
they did this and they rolled out for an
experiment but that was the problem was
that it meant that if people started
searching for one thing but bought
something else
the search would no longer be a
text-based search and the PhD is in text
search actually resisted this idea
because they said this will make us look
stupid we've done all this work to
understand how to do a text search
Panasonic TV isn't even in it so it's
only you can see here those suggesting
Sony TVs even though you started
searching with Panasonic it doesn't
match it's not part of the text search
and we find this a bit threatening and
embarrassing and so I think so it's
important to have skills that can work
with humans overcoming this
embarrassment and threat even when it
might impact technical pride like I work
with software developers all the time
that keeps saying a thing is a hack I
said can we do something quickly and
that's a hack and my sense is that
what's happening here sometimes is the
sense that it offends their sense of
technical pride and I understand that I
understand that and the challenge from a
product management point of view is we
don't have enough money in time to do
all the things we'd like to do so and we
need we're looking all the time to try
and find things that deliver more of the
purpose we can't afford to do everything
so is there a way that we could do
something that was small but not
necessarily hack so trying to unpack
what hack means so at the BBC Worldwide
one of the things was we I want to do
a/b testing to see if we could learn
faster what we needed to do to get and
keep customers achieve our purpose and I
wanted to use a be testing but the
problem is they spent two years talking
about an enterprise license for a tool
that everyone could use and I was saying
well could we do something could we make
an offer to do something smaller and I
went to the editors and I made an offer
expecting that they'd say no to this so
rather not talking about it because
I was frightened they'd say no to it I
decided to make them an offer so I said
what we can do is we could run an
experiment on one part of the page but
we couldn't change it once we started it
and it might be there over Christmas
because there's a change freeze and you
couldn't edit it I think this is a very
poor offer that I'm making but I'm
making it nevertheless and they said
we'd love it we'd love it so it just
shows that it's worth making offers even
not even ones you don't think a good
offers giving people the choice and what
we decided to do was rather than wait
for an enterprise a be testing tool we
would instead use the hour of the day
and divide it by two and when there was
a remainder show a when it was even show
B and it was amazing how much pushback
to Scott because it offended people's
sense of what the right thing to do was
but we did back testing and show that it
was always effective at showing a change
that was of a decent size so we were
able to do that and and experiment on
pages and we learnt things really fast
and one of the key things was it started
to challenge the way we were looking at
the page so these were the pages that
we'd written originally then we did the
test where we put something up and
switched from A to B and we could see
that the pageviews per visit increased
as a result of this thing and it was an
enormous the day we made the change
things changed versus what they've been
previously so that was pretty amazing so
one of the key things was building
psychological safety to help encourage
people to challenge their assumptions
around what we were doing so this is one
of my favorite examples with online
websites this this I don't know if
anyone recognizes this this is the Daily
Mail homepage and back in the day the
use of your theory that users don't
scroll that was the assumption users do
not scroll and just to put this in
perspective that is a height of an
average person and that is the height of
the Daily Mail homepage which has become
one of the dominant sort of media sites
it broke the rules what I like about
this is even the Jakob Nielsen who's a
usability expert I think my census is a
slightly defensive reaction for him he's
saying the site breaks also called
usability rules it's user friendly for
normal people not for Internet fanatics
regardless it just showed that we needed
to challenge assumptions
so where we were at BBC was using these
a B test to drive things that created
excellent results and then I started
talking to the editors about this idea
what's our current assumption about the
site what does the site reflect and so
the de facto policy if you like that
drove the site was it's okay to assume
users will care as much about the site
navigation and content as we do like all
those tests we did with the navbar
although we increase the number of
clicks it still didn't really make a
difference overall and it helped us
reflect that maybe we cared more about
the design of the site than our users
did because we had to build it and so
then we said well what would be a more
effective assumption or belief based on
what we've learned and so we came up
with this that users aren't hunting for
specific content as much as they're
foraging for interesting things right in
front of them now and that drove a whole
series of experiments with photos and
pictures and headlines and chunking
things up because originally they go
back a bit you can see the page when we
started was very blank
it was mostly focused on text it assumed
that people read and spend time reading
they used to Commission 5,000 word
articles because they come from print
and you saw in that video I think if you
just reflect back on how long that guy
spent reading like he spent no time
reading you know he spent no time so we
kept saying why are we doing all this
text heavy stuff instead of driving
photos and could we run some a B test
that would help us understand what might
do better and so then we did and so this
is what the site ended up like so you
can see here that was before content
light mainly focused on text a few
photos and then here we put a lot more
photos in a lot more options of our best
work because I was saying to people that
for a user to find interesting content
because this wasn't this wasn't timely
news this was often news so it was more
of a magazines done so we're able to run
experiments on nearly every part of this
page and drive performance better and
better and again it came from that
simple start where we made we negotiated
small steps we used imperfect tools and
we learnt from things and then made it
safe to start talking about assumptions
and changing our assumptions so the
final tip is to give people the tools to
help
them achieve help them measure are they
achieving their purpose so in that BBC
context it was are we getting and
keeping customers more coming are they
staying longer what's our retention and
one of the things that the experiment
showed was that we the driving
assumption was we should publish content
based on the time of day in every sort
of X hours which would switch the
content because people would be bored of
it but when we went and looked at what
people are actually doing this is a
graph of clicks per headlight clicks per
headline four thousand hourly visitors
so just normalizing the number of people
that came across the day and what you
can see here that's really interesting
is that some stories like this one in
red as well in red the raise the lost
heart is when it red here was at the top
and then they switched it for the blue
story and then it switched it back to
the red story and you can see that the
levels of engagement from an audience
were the same and I remember feeling
like a religious deity because I went to
the editors and said you know if you put
this story back up I reckon you'll get
more clicks and we did and it was like
it was a great trick and actually we did
test it and it's amazing how hard it is
to be given permission to test we tested
leaving something up there for a long
time and the decay rate was fast far
lower than we would have predicted
stories kept getting clicks even hours
and 12 hours afterwards and so that
started to change change people's
mindset around what the the work was and
one example of this was an editor said
to me I'm no longer talking to people
about writing the article I'm talking to
them about what their headline is and
what the photo is that we can use to
advertisers because unless we engage
people at that level it doesn't matter
how good the story is we're just not
getting the interaction that we want
it's not achieving our purpose of
getting and keeping customers so this
was done by me using Excel but it proved
the point that they could change their
publishing time schedule and leave
content that was working well up for
longer than they previously expected
they didn't have to keep changing things
around then happily we gave them a tool
this is a product called chart Beats
apologies it's been a little while since
I've looked at this world I don't know
there are better things but it measures
how long users are engaged on the page
reading so it checks whether the users
move their mouse in the last sort of 15
to 20 seconds
and this helped him understand whether
someone is engaged or not which i think
is a pretty good measure that relates to
the purpose just going back to that
model at the start that the purpose the
measures and the method if we look at
the measures here its engaged how we
want to maximize that because if we
maximize engaged time it's much more
likely that we'll get and keep customers
which is our chief purpose so they gave
this to all the editors and then the
editors we're using this to work out
what to promote in which parts of the
site and they were doing it based on
this engagement data rather than the
clock which they'd use previously so I
thought this was an excellent example
about how all the work we've done had
led people to understand how they could
challenge assumptions and change their
assumptions in order to better achieve
their purpose so that completes my talk
I wanted to just rattle back through it
the 7 tips start with purpose don't
focus on your methods you're not here to
do agile Kanban or even be digital it
needs to relate to a purpose for the
business get and keep customers or a
purpose that works in your environment
the biggest thing you can do I think is
the culture starts with your own
behavior because before I started
looking at how I was talking to people
and interacting with people I spent a
long time reading about how maybe there
are bad people maybe though Republicans
or Democrats or introverts or extroverts
maybe it was them instead of
understanding that I had the biggest
ability to make a change but it does
involve overcoming a sense of grief
potentially that you might not be as
good as you'd like to think you are and
humility and accepting that we can act
very differently than we say we act and
to improve on that you really need to
ask for help from others then the key
thing is get publicly testable
information don't just tell people that
they should do something
and ideally negotiate a small step to
try something to see whether things
could improve rather than bashing them
over the head saying they should follow
your orders make progress with imperfect
tools don't weights you've got the
enterprise a be testing system and then
create an environment where it's safe to
challenge assumptions and if you can
give people the tools that they can use
to measure whether they're achieving the
purpose rather than keeping that as
something only
