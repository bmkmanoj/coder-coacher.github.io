about story points that's me the strange
name cloud spook a lesson
I'll be talking about story points for
about 30 minutes and we're gonna have a
break then afterwards Jeff will talk you
deliberately let Jeff talk at the end
because otherwise everybody will leave
know what you listen to me
so then Jeff will talk about scrum who
in here things they know about 80% of
scrum okay so Jeff will lose of
introduction to scrum then questioning
whether he needs to do the introduction
or whether we more or less can go
straight to the question and answers
doctor's introduction to scrum we'll do
a Q&amp;amp;A session we'll ask people for
questions we will prioritize them and
then go through them by priority which
ones are the most important ones as for
the organization of the event is
organized by Fork you hope you've
noticed that by the email you've got
tripod is a Danish company they extend
it to Switzerland one and a half years
ago they primarily do I phone and iPad
and then I actually also mobile other
mobile devices applications and they
also concentrate a lot on courses and
conferences amongst how this stuff with
scrum me myself I'm from Oregon try fork
similarity in the name is not
coincidentally its sister company of
tripod you could say and we do primarily
consulting in scrum so if you need any
help
in introducing scrum to an organization
or to a team we come out and do a skunk
kickstart for you if you like you can
also come in as consultants participate
in meetings or work as a scrum master
okay
so story points about story points who
in here is using actually scrum it's
more than people that know what scrum
was not surprising actually okay so you
do less than 80% scum that I take it ok
so who's using story points 3 4 5 6 10
ish that that would be like 20 percent
you really short story points use story
points and they have time starting
points this is not anybody knows anybody
who doesn't know what story points are
yeah ok good so story points are is
there it's a relative measure of
difficulty or complexity save you have
two tasks and one task takes X story
points and the other task is twice as
hard
what do you think how many story points
does the other task take 2x brilliantly
excellent did well you listened are you
read so yeah our requirements list maybe
Jeff will get to go des moines detail
that which consists of a lot of user
stories maybe epics here at the bottom :
when user epics sometimes and here in
this graph now I represent each user
story the size represents how many story
points are it's it's worth so here we
have a story here we have a story that's
about half the size that we'll probably
implemented twice as quickly same size
etc after a sprint or maybe two sprints
you can determine the velocity of a team
and by that you can go through the parts
backlog see anybody can do that and you
can determine for instance if you do
two-week sprints and you can determine
after three months that would be six
Sprint's I think two four six this is
what you could do so not half the story
but these stories that's what you could
commit to in a three month if you have a
three months to there's a three months
three months release
so much for planning with story points
advantages with the story points is that
they allow for empirically
empirically measured velocity it's this
like in the first place you might the
envision is like this you just start
running if you've estimated your stories
in story points then you just stop
spinning and at the end of the Sprint
you look how many stories if you do and
how many story points today amount to
that's velocity and then if you
estimated everything correctly in the
future for the next sprint you'll be
able to do the same amount of story
points it's much easier to agree a
relative quantities in story points and
then time amongst others because of this
problem because if you say time if you
have a task and you want to talk about
that how long does it take to implement
that that story you automatically think
of a developer because of course it
takes a junior developer much longer
than it takes a senior developer all
right so you would have if you have to
agree on whether it takes two days or
five days then you have to agree on
who's doing it as well but that means
you have to do a project plan pretty
much assign people that are that it's
all against scrum and there's less
negotiation I'll come back to the
negotiation part do you know this cone
of uncertainty yes I don't think
everybody I've seen you before as
everybody seen it before yeah okay do
you think that's how it is constant
uncertainty means at the beginning of
the project your estimates will lie
around what they actually are at the end
but sometimes it would be four times as
high and sometimes it will only be a
quarter I should see opposite away it
was an opposite way around
sometimes you're underestimated by the
factor of four and sometimes you
overestimated by the factor of four
that's what the cone of uncertainty says
yeah however a study by top little it's
showing that this is what it really is
so we have a lot of cases where like
takes eight times as long as us tomato
and only very few cases where it took
less time than it was estimated why is
that
any ideas we're not good at estimating
softener yeah yeah if there's no
pressure
hi I agree there's no pressure then but
once you've done an estimate there
usually is a pressure but I agree that
if there's no pressure people will
continue everybody who has a home
project they're working on they know
that they're sitting there it's the one
o'clock at night and they do that for
the rest of their lives and they never
finish the product that's a typical
thing that happens anyway yeah
developers I claim developers tend to
estimate ideal time that's the time it
takes their best development we have at
hand to do to do this particular task
Hey assuming he completely understands
it he gets never interrupted he there's
no absences he's not getting sick
anything like that he doesn't have to
attend any meetings and particularly in
the unplanned meetings that he doesn't
experience any problems his ideal time
of interest to the customer or anybody
what's so interesting was it yeah the
final product and how much is it go get
it that's the two questions he's
interested in right so let's assume we
have a developer that actually doesn't
estimate in a year time you because we
would prefer that actually let me call
it the elapsed time it's not really a
elapsed time much it's the closer I get
if he if he estimates the elapsed time
instead of ideal time honey does that
what happens are you guys that's gonna
take me ten days
ten days is serious I need you job
across in two days myself in three okay
five then that's what happens I've
actually had guys tell me exactly this
job of course in two days and do it
myself and sweet so we get challenged
that's what they call challenging that's
a very positive term on a very negative
thing but em they challenge estimates
total in my eyes maybe to put
pressure on but I mean you're shooting
yourself in the foot doing that and why
can't I pressure because the left
elapsed time is an estimate that is
almost purely gut feeling
it's like I know it would take me only
five days but I also know it's like
heaven we always have these I'm saying
eating's and we always end up having a
problem and that's a defect but I can't
really tell the guy like well you have
to fix defects all the other guys
telling me why do you building defects
them so you don't really want to tell
them that so that's why it's very easy
it's an ego super easy target to
challenge that estimate and to push you
down on the five days again and that's
why you have this bone of uncertainty as
we saw before okay I've also story
points to some extent or two leaves then
prevent challenging I'll get to that
eyeballs at this conversation the props
owner she comes to me and says does this
feature how long will it take to
implement and I say well I'm really a
liberty to tell you because it's of
course something the team does and never
one single person but it looks very
similar to feature B that we already
have implemented that you spent we
estimated and spend twenty story points
on that so for your planning or like
it's not a commitment from the team or
me or anything but if you need to do
planning and take the twenty story
points she goes picked us your team
despite guys and you do a hundred story
points and to experience that means this
feature will take ten limbs and eyes
luckily she walks away because I mean I
already felt the pressure okay ten story
points and it's an act it's inherently
not morning we want to satisfy them as
well I didn't do it and she walked away
and obviously she can't really challenge
it because he agrees that we did feature
be in twenty story points so there's no
she doesn't have any argument to say
like why should this be half as
expensive it's for instance a report one
page report same complexity as the other
one but obviously story points so what
is what's the problem I mean I do agree
with her if it's ideal time it would be
four or five days in up to ten days as
the twenty story points correctly she
did the correct enough I mean there's
nothing nothing wrong with that the
correctly it's twenty story points
amounts to ten days
so what's the problem what does that
show us what's yes the complaining about
she complaining about the estimate
then what exactly she's comparing about
the hunger story points in reality she
probably didn't realize it she's really
complaining like the hunter story pause
it would have been five days right so
why is it hunter story points what do
you think what's why do we only do on
the story points instead of 200 actually
we started off with something like 35 so
100 was good already
what you could have didn't to a nerd
yeah let's hear the multiple reasons
yeah mm-hmm
skills quality requirements settings
materials doesn't equality of
requirements area exactly it's tons of
reasons meetings of course they take
away I mean it if I say yeah deal time
of four days or five days to implement
something I don't calculate him that I
sit in meetings for half a day or over
those Foreign Affair or five days in
general communication with the rest of
the team discussions design discussions
or mails that I send the questions I
have they have to answer if they on top
of that mean an interruption because
actually go over and interrupt somebody
interruption cuts across it I mean this
kind of stuff we can try and measure how
much an interruption costs I don't know
how you would measure that it's really I
mean we had an exercise today in the CSM
course which showed that it cost a whole
lot more than what people normally think
it does so interruptions they really
reduce our speed unexpected problems
like technical problems so we have to
redesign a certain part of the
application because the new story has
come in that we have to implement bugs
of course and fixing those absences
especially unplanned absences obviously
and skill at hand I mean if the person
who is really skilled to do this
particular report if he's already loaded
with lots of other work then he's not
really we can't use him we have to use
somebody else to do that
so that's why we only do a hundred story
points okay and that's where we have to
set in but it doesn't change the
estimate in story points it's still 20
story points and if we get better if we
some of these you can consider
impediments there's a skull mask to
remove some of these impediments and we
will speed up in the velocity the
consequence of using time estimates
instead of story points so if you have
our product backlog if this was
estimated in time so this task would it
would say like this takes one day half a
day one day two days etc what will that
mean like after each sprint three
estimate
I should be everything hey you can do it
easily with a factor to some of that but
in reality you would have to go through
and we estimate all the stories because
the velocity change right you got your
after once when you ships maybe you have
a little oh how about the domain you're
working in so you get past that maybe
you get a new - some new new new tools
you can work with that makes you faster
you've removed impediments or escrow
masses remove impediments etc also you
can't really move measure the
improvement of the team if you have time
because what it really should say is
like okay these if we add up but if you
follow all the velocity and story points
that's just three weeks if you have a
three week sprint right so can't really
measure the velocity if you measure
velocity in story points it's something
like this so in our last project we
started off like I said like something
like 35 points under that and increased
quite a bit in the first sprint on the
second sprint then to the sorry first
second third fourth or the fifth sprint
really heard it I won't ask if any idea
can be tons of reasons for why that
happened I can tell you it's because two
guys were added to the team actually
that's very unexpected by management if
they had team at people that you
actually get slower we did less story
points in the sprint after that but if
you can show that me of course it's an
investment in the future right
you might not have been up here without
those two guys might have been down here
you might also have been hired I don't
know but you would like to assume that
you actually gets more than were more
work done with more people but it's
really nice that you can show guys if we
are four weeks before in the development
or before I release that it doesn't help
to add people of course it depends I
mean if you get a super specialist TAS
and it is a very like he's he's
performance improving your Oracle
databases none of that that might help
or in general if it's if it's supposed
to be some developers that this just
added a team don't do it and if your
estimate in time you don't get this kind
of graph okay so conclusion quickly on
story points you get quicker estimate
because it's easier to relate to to
agree on relative relative differences
relative measurements it's more precise
because you've less actors I don't have
to factor all the meetings and absences
and everything in there that will come
out of the velocity they study over time
you don't have to be estimated cause it
makes sense once in a while you go
through a product backlog because might
be other reasons that I saw all of a
sudden is not as complex anymore
compared to other stories the velocity
is measurable it's not personalized like
a story doesn't have a tag already with
who is going to implement this I think
there's a huge problem with with time
estimates and yet not these challenges
are whole lot of you here less whole lot
less of these challenges like where you
could challenge on the estimates because
you're estimating the complexity and
that's your turf that's why you're the
expert and it's not just a gut feeling
that it's hard to argue for okay so is
there anybody who will now consider
using story points know anybody anymore
yeah I agree and start ones I have like
the first time edges in the path project
I used today was like story points is he
serious and you really have to stick
with and you really have to go yes I am
serious and we're going to do it and
today I mean after 14 spins everybody
has 30 points even the management like
the product owner and beyond the
stakeholders they think it's story
points now if they want to know like how
they used to get this and I just simply
refused I said we're not gonna give you
any time if you want to do the
calculation for the velocity and
everything be my guest of course I mean
I don't even want to stop you that's the
idea you're not going to get a time
estimate from us you want to get story
points and then I can take the velocity
and then can calculate okay when can we
have a implement this feature yes yes
there will be forces against it and
people are really reluctant to move to
story points which is a big shame
I can really say anything against that
because you said it all
I mean this is about a steady team and
not about I mean you would have been
better with it if you had estimated in
time or even if if you ask me it would
have been even worse because and you
certainly if the team changes if the
team changes a little bit maybe you can
stick somehow to the same estimates and
story points yes Ernie if there's a
bigger change and you would go through
the through the backlog again I mean
would we but we often did like when you
once in a while we went through the
backlog like of course we always within
the sprints
we went down to what amounts to
approximately two sprints and make sure
that those estimates all over done
then if the I want to release that
longer than just two weeks and two
sprints then we would go further down
made more but even once in a while if
we're trying I guess it's often if you
have estimated once already is pretty
quickly to go through everybody sits in
the meeting okay the story everybody
still 17 story course yeah next ok this
still 10 next is this till 5:00 oh no
that's some new information one guy
raises hands essentially I talked to the
brothel owner and he says like I wanted
in a different way okay then we we
estimated
references your personal reference when
you ask me so you guys know how to polka
planning words so I still have some
minutes so I'll do this planning cards I
have to open this one
okay so it's this deck of cards that's
four sets in there yes zero half 1 2 3 5
8 13 2014 honours and then a question
mark and a coffee cup coffee cup it's a
measure of complexity use there so if
you have to make everybody pick a story
you want to estimate the team sits
around the table everybody that's there
yes and anything okay this is so so
complex okay once you have and you for
you person you can pick any other story
you want doesn't matter which one
because they're all relatively complex
the relative complexity to each other is
estimated Oh any story that you have
estimated already and you can say okay
this one is three times as hard as this
one which was one story point and then
when everybody's ready you raise the
three and if somebody up another story
which is six and he thinks this to you
now estimating is half as complex then
he always three as well right so how do
you get to the first one well you take
you take user stories or tasks depending
on at what level yes tonight you pick
the easiest one I usually say a very
small one that everybody agrees and what
you have to do and you just said that
two story points that means you can't
compare story points on one team to
another team so it's an easy way to get
get your base
but you'll learn that tomorrow okay
you're not convinced as a matter of fact
we refuse to estimate stuff if it's bad
if it's not clear what we are going to
do yeah but then we don't estimate him
well it's a pretty risky business it'd
be a company if they just say yeah okay
we'll take it on but I have no clue what
the hell that is part of scrum
and what do you need a team to estimate
you don't want to have business analyst
estimating a complexity of stories
that's very important right I mean I
know from the old world we as it was
quite usual that business analysts
estimated complexity and and did the
estimation but that doesn't work what do
you want the team estimating the stories
not an architect function architect
anything it's like unless they are the
team here on the T the guys are actually
going to implement it those are the guys
that estimated you lose a lot of
motivation if you don't do that
and commitment I mean I'm not committed
if somebody asked me to answer like we
estimated you take three days to
implement this okay whatever
okay we don't want that we want business
people the user store that's the life
that called user story there from a user
perspective I don't actually I prefer I
said that earlier today already I prefer
a product owner the person who actually
gives me that product backlog I prefer
him to be a business person by far I
don't want a technical person to be
there I certainly don't want to use a
story that tells me like use this
database design I want simple user
stories saying like okay I need to
administer accounts we want to create
new users delete users or I want to let
do a deposit in a bank if it's a banking
web application you do or whatever that
a little bit more easier than just I
want to do a deposit but a whole lot
less than what you see today okay any
other question
to you sorry so this is manju allowed
you to agree that you do scrum
introduced okay good then your story
points and if he I mean if you wanna
start story points then I guess you have
to convert and tell them hours and days
or whatever but inside the G meter story
point I say I mean that's if you yeah if
you're doing the tactics which is very
common by the way it's lots of teams to
do that and it's probably a good way
because then all of a sudden the
management say why how did you deliver
so much software while the customers so
happy that's unusual why did leave a
deliver on time by the way yeah
that we be starting weeks probably
decided developers have better than
support but do give him a time when yeah
that's this definitely I mean I do do we
had this very beginning and go back here
so yeah you do need a velocity before
you got to you can't you cannot give him
a time that's true and in theory you
have to go through one sprint or maybe
two spins if you want to be the most
flew the most safe you have had your
estimation on mostly you can say how
much what you velocity is right so mind
of course you can also start here I mean
that's immediate on the first Prince
okay we we asked me at least user story
to define the base story to begin with
and we use a storage place on that then
we stood there so what is your opinion
what do you think how many story we do
on the first plane and you look at the
stories you said okay I think we can do
these three stories yeah definitely do
these six yeah easy ok can we do these
eight pushing it okay seven yeah seven
story points at these seven stories yeah
assume velocity and of course it might
be 30 story points about the 70 story
points you do but usually you'll you do
that wrong and basically is the same
thing you do if you do waterfall I mean
if you do wonderful it doesn't mean yeah
you don't have more data anything so you
stop feeling as rare as well yeah but it
cost you three months three months to
produce a specification that you now
estimate that you know estimating and
selling its cost in those three months I
could have done the first certain
sprints already and I would have a
pretty good idea of my velocity
oh you have to I mean obviously yes oh
yeah there will be people will giggle
that story points but it's definitely
one of the best things about scrum one
of the best lots of good things
yeah okay I didn't even get into that I
mean that's that's even worse okay that
people they don't implement it after
we're at the end estimated that's its
team to be wrong and I think that's also
a big reason for for this graph we all
know the sales guy that comes packages I
saw the system we need to do these
adaptions know what are you doing okay I
think that's pretty much the 40 minutes
so let's have a break for 20 minutes
then Jeff it's gonna say a word or two
and then we'll do a question and answer
and you can ask Solana also a certified
scrum Austin coach training you and the
scrum master course so all three of us
you can ask us questions also during the
gear drinking of course okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
