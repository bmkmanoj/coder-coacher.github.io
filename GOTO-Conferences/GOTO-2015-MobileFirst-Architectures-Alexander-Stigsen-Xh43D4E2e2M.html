for mobile firsts so mobile first is
this Oh new concept that every company
talks about how they have to transform
themselves to be like mobile first so
what does that actually mean at the
architecture level so why am I talking
about this
so I'm a really like former old-school
mobile engineer used to work at Nokia at
the big auntie Center they had with the
tons of stuff on how to optimize data
from mobile phones before even before we
had things called smart phones like it
create crazy time so I've been working
like mobile since like the 90s and it's
it's been quite a ride so today I'm
working at a company called realm and we
create a whole new modern database for
mobile devices and because of that I'm
of course very biased which you will see
through this talk that you really should
use the mobile device as much as
possible so that's the primary measure
what I'm gonna tell you about here
so everybody's talking about how mobile
is is the thing now this is everything
is drive by mobile mobile development
should drive your whole company but the
big problem we have is that mobile apps
are still being built exactly how we
build web apps in the 90s and you say I
mean what does that even mean it means
that if you look how things work with a
web app 9 this is actually a image from
the 90s where you have like some people
some person who sits at a website and he
does something and it said to request
back to a server which since you have
reply back and everything is this
request response pattern and of course
that's what you used to I mean this like
do something ping get a response back I
mean I mean that's a well-known pattern
but promise mobile that's not like that
and we're still treating mobile apps as
if we work with some clients and that
really sucks for the whole range of
reasons so why is this happening
why are we doing development and such a
stupid way well the main reason is first
of all this how we've always done so I
mean that's always the default answer to
why people tell stuff so I mean you have
like for the last decade plus people
have been building web apps so of course
they build up tons of habits of how do
you do stuff and the other thing of
course is that in the process of doing
that a lot of back-end infrastructure
has been built reflecting this way of
doing things so we have all these risk
services we have all this stuff out
there that's really built on this whole
recurse response way of building things
and those actually also have real
benefit to it I mean that's a the fact
that when you use this old pattern then
it gets relatively easy to make both a
web app and a mobile app against the
same back-end and that makes sense
that's a really good benefit of course
the big problem is that a lot of
companies are not even mobile first
anymore if you go to Asia most companies
they start to be mobile only they just
drop the web it doesn't really matter
anymore so but you can still say ok but
but those are that's a real benefit and
also the fact that people know how to do
it the fact that you already have API so
those are all good things it's actually
real valuable benefits so why shouldn't
we just keep doing this and the problem
is that it does have some drawbacks so
the main products of doing this in a
mobile world is first of all you get bad
user experience it's really hard to be
tolerant about connectivity because car
enthusiasts want these big difference
from web and then it's actually really
expensive and server costs so what does
that really mean well first of all user
experience the user experience is very
different on mobile than it was on the
web that's actually been studies on this
where they say the the fact that you
have a mobile device in your hand and
you can actually touch it makes you feel
that it's kind of like part of yourself
so you kind of feel like everything
should respond instantly of course
there's really no tolerance for latency
at all the moment you had like the small
you scroll and it does like tick tick it
feels weird
it's like why did it do that and it's no
excuse that oh it just had to go out
back to the server and get like the next
like 10 pages
that's just doesn't count as an excuse
and the other thing is I mean apps
people's expectation of how much apps
can do is just exploding again if you
have a web app people used to okay we
went from like the old Windows
application starts then we went to
weapons okay things got very simple and
everything was essentially forms now our
search is do I know everything it's just
the complexity get so much higher
because this is real app and again you
touch it you feel everything just moves
around you expect you can do anything
and you expect that it responds
instantly to what you're doing so the
thing is there's really no acceptance of
any kind of latency or wait times so
this is both in the interface that
everything should be smooth scrolling
the whole like 60fps movement where I
say everything should be see two frames
per second all the time and the same
thing every time you press a button it's
not like a website I press the button
and you sit around and you're like oh
that game on mobile you press button and
the insta mean it should be there there
shouldn't be any kind of wait times and
this is of course the problem it's hard
to build to do for developers it's hard
to make that happen and it gets like
compounded by the next problem which is
connectivity which again the problem you
never really really had in the old web
world I mean when you went to a website
mean even if your color of course is you
go back far after when the time went bad
modems and stuff you would have bad
connectivity but otherwise connectivity
is pretty much a solved problem on the
web because you're connected you have
Wi-Fi or whatever and it basically just
works and then you go to a mobile device
and it doesn't the fact is connectivity
still sucks pretty much everywhere I
mean I don't know I'm I live in San
Francisco and should be like this sense
of Silicon Valley and you can try to
take the part and you'll be like half
the time you won't have any connectivity
at all
it just it just sucks and I mean you go
out to look anyway here in the state you
got into the countryside and I mean
that's hardly any card activity and it's
really amazing and then we of consulting
when you actually really need your abs
the moment you have any and any kind of
crisis happening anything the first
thing that goes down or if she's just at
a big concert with a lot of people I
mean it everything just goes down right
away our conference that's for that sake
so connectivity is one of these like
really fundamental differences between
mobile and the web that the connectivity
is sometimes it's week sometimes parties
sometimes not that at all and the funny
thing is people still expect your app to
work of course I mean it's in their hand
they don't feel that this is a browser a
web browser this is something they have
in their pocket and this slimy and it's
hard for everybody I mean even for big
companies like Google I mean this is
actually a screenshot of you see from
Gmail that the moment you lose
connectivity suddenly you can't search
at all you can't access any of your oak
males and you're like what does that
mean why I mean I could do that on my
old PC like 20 years ago I could have
all my males and this one has like ten
times the storage what what's going on
and it's actually really a problem this
actually had this last time I went to a
conference I actually cream and I did
way I came I didn't have any
connectivity and I was like oh where's
the color of the conference or like
that's in a mail and it's like a bit too
old to be in the cache too bad and you
kind of expect that you have it on you
but the moment confuse you want you
don't and that's just because this is
built against an old I mean gmail
clients build against an old REST API
from running their own email services
web app let's just build her and this
old pattern and it's just it's annoying
annoying and the other fact of course is
if you're building after day in your say
okay where's the next peak market that's
in developing countries and that's a
whole different game than here first of
all they have even worse connectivity
obvious let that kind of sucks and also
they have very high data prizes
so that means that they're like data
plans I'm really very expensive so they
can't just get like pink back from dates
back and forth all the time things has
to be effective on the device and the
last thing on this which is pretty much
the same as as with the web is that
running a modern app again because of
the expectations that people have today
is really expensive server wise because
for better worse people have been
conditioned to the fact that everything
is instant so if you ever see like a
search bar in your application you
expected when you start pressing this
that of course they start out to
completing and sharing results while
you're searching obvious that's that's
that's just what you use so that's like
Google right the problem with that of
course is that means that every single
user out there every single time they
press a single button you have to go
back to your server and do queries and
whatever which all cost money and
especially now I mean I'm from San
Francisco has tons of startups and when
your startup you know that you had this
kind of problem where most of start most
out ups they need a few million users to
actually get off the ground which means
that you had this kind of problem where
your cost goes up like this at the same
rate as you use this and you kind of
hope that you take off either you raise
money or you get profitable before you
eat the peak and you dive because yeah
when you run out of money you die so
that's really a problem and for anybody
who's tried hosting the apps on Amazon
you know that Amazon actually is really
really expensive so so what is the
fundamental problem with this this like
cache approach well which is kind of
like the way you do with a web app where
you don't really you don't really own it
is you just like a thin client kind of
like showing everything essentially like
a web page and of course the problem
first of all comes with every object you
have in your data
I mean you essentially you work with
objects most of the time
jeanna objects as long as it's in the
cash everything is fine that's what we
saw with Gmail Gmail has like the last
20 miles or so in the cache don't you
look at them everything is perfect of
course the problem comes when you have
to access a mail that's not in the cache
that will either be a bit slow just the
latency of getting it which is okay most
of the time oh it won't be available
because the connectivity is not good
enough and that kind of sucks the other
thing of course is that if you do an app
that's just a little bit more advanced
and you'll need to do queries that could
be again in like an app like an email
app where you do a query for your mails
of course but it could also be much much
more than app to do to answer queries
internally as well just to show the
right information sudden you in this
situation that that will be slow because
every query you do has to go back to the
server and also again the whole thing
the moment you have no connectivity
everything that needs to do queries you
have essentially grinds to hold because
the fundamental fact is you can't do a
query on day two you don't have and if
you only have a subset of the data
cached well you can't really do a query
and expect to get a correct result so
that kind of sucks the other factors
that's very big is that when you had
this kind of thing where you have that
back-end that the rest API what you see
is that the mobile team suddenly gets
very constrained what they can do
because every time they say hey we
actually need a new kind of query and
you kind of datas I have anything they
have to talk with the back-end team who
has to implement it who has to make sure
that the REST API has the right commands
as it gave it back in the right format
and there's a lot of work I should have
been done to try to get around that I
mean if you follow the more in the web
space but also with with also mobile you
see guys like like Facebook trying to do
relay and Netflix trying to do Falkor
and all the things to try to see if they
can t cobble a bit so that the front-end
guys can actually keep working even
though they they don't really know what
they need from the backend yet which is
a huge problem
so in general when this approach the
it's really hard for the mobile team to
move as fast as you would like to be
because again this was there's so much
competition you just have to be able to
iterate really really fast and that's
just really really hard so the big
question of calcium what what is the
solution for this what can we do to give
the users a better experience and all
this connectivity issues and reduce the
server cost and the solution is starting
to grow now is something called endpoint
processing in point computing and the
idea here is to say well mobile devices
have changed again back when I started
and mobile device was really really weak
it could hardly do anything and
everything was constrained but today
it's crazy what you can do in mobile
device I mean these a modern mobile
phone is more powerful than a rack
server was just a few years ago it's
pretty crazy and we have they're using
that so the idea of endpoint computing
is to say well you essentially if you're
an app builder company that builds
everything you actually have access to a
gigantic cloud of massive power of all
these useless devices and that's it's
free power because they're the one who
paid for it the users they pay for the
energy they pay for the phone taxes they
pay everything
so essentially you had the ability to if
you can use that if you can offload the
work to the useless device you can
offload tons of both cost for yourself
and you can give the users much better
experience so essentially I just had to
use it so the idea is that you can
actually use the phone as the primary
store keep all your data on the device
work with it directly then it's always
available
everything is always instant there's
also a lot of thing actually you can do
around like stuff like compliance if
you're doing health apps or stuff HIPAA
compliance or things by having the
device stuff on the device owned by the
user
in this case you can also take that your
back-end
essentially get relegated to be
coordination of everything so that you
can share this between all the devices
backup and statistics and all these
basic things but that's hardly any work
you're paying in your back-end becomes
much much cheaper so fundamentally you
look this is how things used to look
well still looks a lot where you have
the cloud where you have your dates and
have all your business logic everything
happening and then you have the mobile
phone which is just as a small cash and
a UI layer and the transition we're
starting to see and we see this a lot of
constants we are I mean we create mobile
database we talk with tons in terms of
companies that build mobile apps now a
lot of the big companies doing mobile
apps and we see this transition
happening where more and more of the
smarts get put into the phone so instead
of having all this this logic in the
backend just moved out to the phone
because that means that the mobile team
can just work on their own they don't
have to talk with anybody else they
don't want to coordinate with a big
back-end team they just built water
whatever they need to build and iterate
as fast as they have to do and again
there's there's no latency there's no
overhead and having to go back and talk
with the server back and forth all the
time well of course this is not
something that this is something that
some apps are really good with and some
apps are not as amendable to do so you
can say why does this work well if you
look from the unlike with the data cloud
zone there's really only exist three
kinds of apps there's the single user
apps there's collaborative apps and then
there's the kind of work browser app not
in the web browser sense but in the data
browsing sense so a single user app is
essentially an app where the user owns
halted all the day time in the app so
that does tons and tons of these I mean
an example was like Minter of course
every bank app where you have all your
bank dates and there's lots of
note-taking app for just to your notes
and of course every email app it's like
your emails you have expensive five so
everything where you can say well this
is only about my data
and and those are obvious app apps to to
do this kind of endpoint processing on
because you can just keep all the users
data
on his device of course you still want
to have that backed up within a band the
back end because he can lose his device
in a day but he can essentially have all
of it and all the logic can be on the
device and it's extremely powerful in
that way but that's opposed not not the
only I mean this is a huge portion of
the apps but not all of them then that's
kind of what you call the collaborative
apps that's kind of like two aspects to
that collaborative in the sense that
it's not only your data it actually also
contains other people's data and a lot
of them you see I know I'm loved you
probably you slack that's an obviously
all kind of chat apps of this you have
your own words and using your other
people's messages and they kind of go in
and out and you have stuff like Facebook
and Twitter which is kind of like the
same and in different ways so that's one
way of doing collaborative and of course
that's what you could call like live
collaborative where not only do you get
other people's data but you're allowed
to edit it and it's like live edit say
you see each other's changes which is
much harder to do and those are general
also really good for this not always but
in general because they'll usually
always be like a subset that's kind of
like yours if I came here if your
Facebook your timeline that's yours
it might could be composed out of a lot
of other people's data but you have your
own timeline that's the one you search
and if you search that's what you also
could scroll in you can keep all that on
your device the same with you your own
Twitter stream was like all the channels
you are in that's it's a natural way to
build up so that's all stuff that can be
local as well on the device and some of
us that I'm off gets more and more fuse
and then there's the last one where it's
kinda like browser apps so these are the
apps where it's not really your data
you're looking at other people's data so
the obvious ones like YouTube YouTube
app I mean it's not your videos you just
browse around look at different people's
videos also stuff like tinder where you
look at other people's profiles
there's tons of these kinds of apps as
well and these apps are not a really
good choice for this I mean there's
really not much work you really don't
want to keep all the YouTube videos on
your device that would suck really bad
and again today and I mean most
you can do a bit of caching maybe some
pre-caching maybe stuff but you really
don't want to do what do you call like
in point computing with that even though
there's a little bit of thing where you
can say that there's usually a lot of
metadata your tracks I know we work with
all companies where they track a lot of
statistics and do a lot of measurement
on the users and things and that's all
stuff that's good to track on the device
but but that's that's you should minimal
so these kind of models can usually be
mixed together so so what would I say to
do mobile through and decide so the
first thing that is it's kind of a
change of mindset when a lot of apps are
kind of built in the sense that you have
a back-end API and then you say okay how
do I build a mobile app on this where
the the whole idea of mobile first and
mobile driven design is you say you
start with a up and say how can I make
the absolute best experience for the
user and what is the ultimate app how do
I get there how will you just want this
to be then you built that and then the
the backend kind of has to follow you
just have to do essentially whatever it
takes to make that app work and that's
quite a mind shift change for for a lot
of developers because again they're used
to working against standard REST API is
they're used to this kind of standard
way of working and having this say okay
what is the ultimate experience because
if somebody had started to build an
email app just starting with the app and
then they said oh do people actually
want to be able to search in their data
even when they offline well they
probably do and if they say okay to do
people IQ want to like click on an email
had to wait until it comes up they
probably don't this is all constraints
that came from the back-end service
because they started from that end if
you start with Mobile's okay what is the
experience that will drive the whole
design so you can see how does that
affect your back-end I mean you're
paying API for many problems it doesn't
really change it that much I mean if you
have an something that's mainly like in
one way API I mean essentially you just
ask what to change since last time
that's a lot of them if you're like
Facebook you can do some changes
yourself but you actually not that much
you write mostly you read other people
stuff so mostly we just do like some
kind of request
I can say hey give me everything had
changed since I last looked that's
that's a simple in fact they can just
pull that on devices store it from
pretty much fiber if you want so you can
access that the big problem of course
comes when you want kind like two-way
synchronization where you actually say
hey I'm actually changing this and I
kind of expect that the other people I'm
collaborating with they see the changes
as I do them and I see this and the
funny thing is today if you look at like
collaboration
everybody's collaborating because most
the time you're collaborating with
yourself because you have all these
different devices you have like your
iPhone your iPad your whatever tablet
your I watch your laptop and of course
you expect that they are all the same I
mean from a mental perspective this is
all one computer all these different
devices so when you change something on
one you have caused expected you see
that instantly on the other ones because
it's your computer I mean it's kind of
bring the whole if people can remember
back in time that Sun had this idea the
network is the computer and it's kind of
chased around that now all your
computers are your computer and that's
actually one of the things that's really
really challenging for developers to
build today there's really no really
good solutions most of the kind of
synchronization solution you'll find out
there breaks down really bad at the
moment you have bad connectivity so this
is actually kinda like how Cole faction
we really need much better tools and
backends and stuff to handle
synchronization for life because that is
what you expect you expect all your
devices to be one computer and you
expect to be able to share parts of that
with other people and it just comes
natural from the kind of devices we have
today so of course again this is this
always the right choice to go for this
current process it's primarily for apps
that ID user centric if it's any kind of
user centric you really want to keep all
the users data on the device so it just
works if you just browse other people's
data and you're browsing which means
that like the old web browser model
probably fits pretty well it's kind of
inherent and what you're doing
but what are the benefits I mean just to
summarize so the benefits of doing
things on the device is that you get
much more responsive apps again the
latency has this annoying thing that
there's kind like a limit like the speed
of light is you can't really change that
so you no matter how much you optimize
things you can never get faster than
that and then when the moment you go
mobile you also have all the like
cellular communication latency so it
gets even worse so if you want to
responsive apps you just you can't wait
for data to come
you need to get it before the user asks
for it and then of course the whole idea
that I mean it just has to work with no
matter how the connectivity is
connectivity is always bought here I
mean it goes on and off like depending
on where you are how you move and it
should just keep working the that's this
should be hidden from the user they
shouldn't have any experience of this
and then of course you really want to
reduce the server load I mean it's just
a huge it's and both thing it's not only
the expense it's also as I mean you just
heard how much work it is to manage the
distributed database how much
problematic it is to handle like big
data and there's no reason for that if
you you can have like we actually have
users out there who have hundred
millions of users and they have they
need a back-end because it's all on
useless devices it's naturally
distributed and that that is a really
unique situation you can run with 100
million fuses and you can have like a
back-end that's hardly anything it's
just like coordinate things and does a
bit of backup in there that that's
really an amazing thing it's huge huge
reduction in cost and complexity and
again it means that your mobile team can
just move ahead really really fast they
don't have to coordinate with anybody
let's just go ahead build whatever they
want total freedom on the device and
again a lot of the complexity again if
you talked said when you build stuff and
you have like a component that needs
some dates and it has to do a rest
request back to service to get it if you
have everything local on device and it
just gets updated the black background
thread development gets so much easier
because you're just working with local
data structures I mean that that's
something that every developer can do
you don't have to like think like how to
do synchronous requests how to like wait
when do I get in response back if I even
get one back and how to update thing
that's so many steps you have to get
through to get that to work that all
adds complexity and parks and stuff
well the moment you have all the data
local easy peasy when you just code like
normally and this this is not only for
mobile devices so this is a this this
demand of things being fast and local
that's really what you see coming up in
all the new stuff that's coming up at
the moment so of course like
collaboration is really big one
happening all the time I mean if you see
it's kind of like the expectation
everybody grows up with in with mobile
devices if you have kids you'll see them
play minecraft and see that it's a
social thing they sit together and
playing next to each other and you start
to see the same with business apps where
when you own your sitter and go to
conference room C super comfortable they
sit working together Google Docs
whatever they seen work so all apps
because I was starting to become
collaborative and it's and pretty much
every developers building has to start
from zero and invent their own solutions
which is not really like a really good
way of doing things and then of course
we have the whole Internet of Things I
mean it's it's really exciting thing
time to be in involved in data as a
general because like the best estimate
says that within the next five years
like 80% of the world's data will come
from more mobile devices and that
includes all the what we call Internet
of Things because the definition of
Internet of Things is devices that
capture data and so it's just really
really interesting to work with this and
these that have a huge huge about their
whole the idea of endpoint computing
came from the Internet of Things because
when you have all these Internet of
Things these sensors and stuff you want
to be able to capture the data there you
want to be able to pre-process that you
actually want to be able to do a machine
learning on it's just by classified and
do stuff before so you only send the
stuff home that's actually is
interesting so everything is about how
do we work on the
point with the data so you only send the
actual signals home that valuable
because otherwise you just drown and you
have you have no we're we're handling
all this and then we have interests off
like virtual reality I mean if any of
you have worked with virtuality see the
biggest problem with virtual reality is
that if you can't get the feel like 60
frames per second people get sick they
literally get seasick and again as you
can see that doesn't really leave much
space for latency for getting data or
the network really really hard I mean if
you have to wait like 200 milliseconds
to get to get something from over the
network before you can draw the thing
that people just came to look at that's
kind of shock so again you have all the
things like data locality really matters
I mean it's kinda like how useful with
big data that you want to bring the
computation to the data and it's the
exact same thing with mobile devices you
really want to have to come the data and
computation together so I can remove all
the layers of latency and we have the
same with variables of course and drones
are the same they have also they go out
there they capture data and they have
extremist particle activity usually
there's Goldman and they won't be able
to like give it off before they come
back so that this is essentially why say
like one like endpoint computing is also
called client cloud computing it's kind
of like I think Gartner saying this is
one of the big trends coming up I think
I saw if you saw an increase in Horowitz
they had lists like 60 things that are
most interesting in and fast in the
future and then like one of them was you
can find cloud computing as to say like
how do you harness this massive power of
all these devices out there which are
pretty much idling most of the time
right now we use like a million of what
our mobile devices are capable of so
that was pretty much me so if you have
any questions
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
