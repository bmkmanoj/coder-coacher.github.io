tripod and we H knew that price and
steve freeman at the ghost conference
i'm steve i met yes so maybe you could
introduce yourselves who are you and
what have you done we wrote the book
growing object-oriented software guided
by tests together often apart we're both
based in a little part of a very strong
london agile software FB community and a
lot of that material came out of a group
called the extreme Tuesday Club which is
now in its 12th year there's no visible
means of organization but there's a long
history of I guess a group of people in
London litter interested attentively the
sort of people that stumble into this
sort of thing here this is what we've
been doing for a while and having read
your work is almost like you your
Siamese twins know a lot of stuff
together we did yeah yes with your
present at presenting together develops
a couple of open source projects for
test and development together which
products we wrote J mock and ham forests
which is a library at the Jameson mock
object library and hamcrest is a span
out of that and became more widely used
and if you suppose also plays a set of
predicate that can decompose and could
describe themselves they're very useful
for testing because you can describe
what you want something to match and
then when the test fails and it doesn't
magically described very clearly what it
was looking for why wasn't that and
that's been picked up by a number by
that like the source testing projects
the orange a look and interesting people
using it for non testing purposes as
well which is not expected yes be useful
so women most of the work sensors are
our system and crafts so how do you see
programming as a craft measuring is
that's happening or what I'm not so much
what works in testing ok but it is a
little bit so you it's I think mostly of
you guys as you know the testing guys so
you not to that's not happy not that so
how do you see what has to work where
work I do is I usually help or join
projects and work on them apply how can
be bought them learn TDD there's not so
much a testing discipline as a as a sort
of analysis and design discipline that
comes up a lot ministers part of this
process and but also drives the design
of the software so software architecture
is also something I'm very interested in
I guess just software development as a
whole I don't know about the craft of
them and that house off across one thing
is something that every part of that
movement but yeah I see happening around
oolitic so there's over like the London
between the extreme Tuesday club and a
lot of the edge rock group sounds of a
sort of partnership movement also with
love the media startups of things i'm
also going on they are very much
involved
yeah and I think yeah exactly that you
did what it's really about of the stuff
is design often when i go into groups i
find the reason they're struggling with
test-driven or whatever it is it's
because you know not not because you
know better capable people but they
missed the tip of the generational thing
they missed the bit where you go to the
euro design particular certain schools
and can we tend to follow the sort of
the group that got back on okay this
says it's all about messages hmm and I
guess it's also probably because we have
both have a bit of background in
distributed systems which all my brother
calls hmm and so that's kind of how we
tend to see things mmm less where where
if you think about it in terms of the
other way that objects are talked in
terms of classification doesn't work so
well for us we work yeah that's not me
when I look at code you do in your
plants and stuff it's like you create
notes of classes really small and
focused and readable classes which is
nothing I had seen in professional life
yeah so why do we non-program us end up
with these huge classes mother for
classes that we can't break down what
what can we do about it I think maybe
it's a fear of adding code map win is
one of the cucumber guys really I wrote
that he's looking came back came up with
a classification of my design style you
know the very connected design style and
and that allows you to make progress
without worrying web design so much you
can have a modular design style way
after then worry about how you
decompose let me compose the system
those are in a project that compose the
other sort of connector stuff has to
make rapid progress but then as it gets
bigger your system becomes harder and
harder to change and you need to put
move to a more modular style so Matt was
experimenting with that in louisville
and wales was finding that he had a lot
more code and i commented well yes you
do but you have to think about a lot
less of it at any one time I think
there's the theorem alien code that you
know people talk about carrying cost of
code but that carrying cost is is not
all the code doesn't really have to meet
in order to make a change that imposes
that carrying costs unless you can read
to make a change the better so I think
maybe it's a misplaced fear of adding
co2 or syndrome but also there's also
did Benny different editions so wish I
she is i think is perhaps a more
interesting aspect to the craft the
craft day which is I mean for disappears
that I know of where we have real
crafters you know who you train with you
know who they train isn't you know the
different schools they all disagree with
each other and I'd feel more i think to
do some extent some some of the sony
said with a struggle that we've had
trying to get word out it's because
we've been dealing with people who are
from a different school and they just
don't know what we're talking about
because this is mismatch I think that's
part of you know in the good old days
you had to be a journey Manning you have
to go from shop to shop because you had
to learn different things you weren't
supposed to stay with more master go all
the way through it I think perhaps we
miss a lot of that
people so how many visits it's going you
know measuring programming yes
developers are we actually getting any
better better as a lot of focus on doing
stuff right you write brought about
writing proper code and all that
thinking a lot about you know it would
be a perfectionist but I'm not good
enough I think that I I think that there
is certainly be advances in what
programmers focus on in over the last 10
years technically there doesn't seem to
be know what a great change since XP and
agile sort of took off but in this sort
of immediate programming a city like you
like one huge scales you know that kind
of thing is like advanced in it but I
think that things like lean startup and
stuff has has focused people making sure
that they can program the right thing
you know something right and I think
that that improvement in in sort of
marrying sort of like technical changes
to your system to like a better
understand house by house achieving its
goals is is an improvement that's
happening both of our few years I think
the big thing is is that it's now
respectable to talk about testing and to
make it the first class part of your
process even if it's very few places
actually did it rigorously but at least
you can have talked about it and there
was a time when people didn't even talk
about
because it was too low status so I think
actually that's probably the biggest
thing to come out of the ex all of it
yeah i'm at the XP world I think we're
seeing a lot more stuff coming up
academia now empirical software
engineering that started to pick up
hopefully so this very difficult thing
to study appear a'kla but something
testing results are coming out of that
and they you know often pally with your
sort of hard-won intuition that you've
learned as learn as an actual on the job
programmer sometimes they're quite
surprising you haven't make sense so I
study recently found that defects
integration defects are correlated with
the distance between the groups of
producing a modules be integrated in the
organizational hierarchy sort of a I
guess in empirical support for common
law but you're the thing is it's not
about physical distance its
organizational descents okay just a nice
much funding yeah so so the things like
that can that's coming out of the
academic empirical so for engineering
community can directly influence and
influence your that sort of day-to-day
work because you immediately can see on
a big project world you know if you've
got a vendor relationship and some have
to focus on that the module
interconnections between your code a
vendor code into the big distant
organization between they have to think
or even if it's group of sitting over
here
throughout him to do something because
drawn up at the top of the corporate
tree for example so then you can focus
your technical testing design effort in
fact that kind of thing I think is good
and more more of that it's coming i see
a lot of oracle software checking stuff
coming out of the Exede conferences and
as more blogs about it now this of great
books by Greg Wilson on the subject and
it's not a great talks which you can
find on youtube in and stuff so all of
that I think this is it will improve
cleanser for engineering the great deal
i think it did a big shift so this
period has been the the cosmo
programming line which is in a bit will
they describe the approach to
programming where basically its body
bits and pieces together off the
internet for good and bad and there's
some good aspects listen not so good
aspect but again that's in my earlier
days with you know it was the time when
we didn't do that stuff wasn't on the
web when wasn't on the web yes google i
mean matching program with her
google sorry I used to and so you know
terms of next generation they have they
have opportunities whatever they just
weren't available and things like you
know you can scale if you want and you
get off the shop in theory if you know
what some level you know what you doing
you can do something very you just focus
on the bits that you need to and then
everything else just company then the
rest of luck debugging it's fiction
isn't but the downside of that and you
don't have to write I'm testing yes yes
so you know the world to change the
downside is that often if that's the
only thing you know which way effective
but you know that area and then a lot of
stuff they have their time to find out
mmm and that's the other thing is you
know between helps if you've been
through a few technology cycles mmm
because then you get different Twiztid
because that's also the functional
movement in a kind of sense that they
don't treat testing quite as seriously
you know it's just my sense and you know
quotes like marks I'm mocking you well
we misunderstood to me except maybe yeah
but last year we have this program will
just ask where all the people
programming in functional languages they
have their rebel and they just messed up
with missed with that then they got some
salt and then pasted the codes if their
application yes do you think there's
some different view on testing the front
world I think there is I think there's
always the hope that the toy system the
next great functional type system will
solve everything in a closure is
tightness the closure is our plan under
the Haskell world is moving towards
dependency independent types and great
types of street that is get rid of a lot
of things you have always had to change
all right and it's much better to
something design again I it's much
better to build your system design your
software in such way that you don't have
to test the certain things and it is to
test for them so not having tests and
not needing them is a lot better than
having good
test something got ignored and so you
know having completely stateless code
means an actor Texas State changing and
the aliasing effects and things like
that which is there anything but i think
it's not difference which is the people
call that the corner federal government
you know they're dealing with the
fundamentals and that's perhaps right so
s like what well it's more susceptible
to just sort of thinking very hard they
copied it and a lot of the systems of we
both are full of really messy you know
not real well but but human design
environments yes where the code is part
of the environment and effects a Santa
deployed what I mean is that is that the
actually the domain is very messy yeah
so it's hard to have come up with a
model of the horrendous domains that the
people just grown the ground up yet and
so you say that but then the Haskell
guys did just slowly picking generation
model financial converse which are
extremely messy but at the bottom of it
but else bottle that was like this this
virtual machine for fun but on top of
that it can asshole the actual trades
you can't copy that clear all right by
fingering there is no I think our style
should we write about in the book a
functional style is not they're not
incompatible they just you use them in
different places a lot of systems I
write when I can
so much control I'd like have a lot of
purely functional code even in job even
though functional code is quite ugly a
Java and it still pays off to avoid
mutability and then there's sort of you
can studies polymorphism in your
functional code to get the benefits of
that and then you can have some
event-driven telling us about arrow and
the sort of lower layers which are
handling the events of you know driving
the system but those events are there
being serviced by operation performed
functional calculation to calculate the
outgoing events so it's a very clean
architecture yeah we need to test the
different levels that's more us what we
did believes up in the book this no it
was a long example but not as long as it
should have been because there's a lot
more than order to do a lot of time
we're at a time filling the pages but
within that there's an awful lot of that
which is immutable which is a little too
little fractional transforms within a
larger from your bed ridden wrapper and
it's moving that direction the other
thing is that the vm got so much better
and so you can actually treat the for
transient objects is disposable and not
worry too much about the cost in in the
current systems that we built so in
general just in general what kind of
problems we'll see when you go out at
clients one of the biggest mistakes
projects do and if you have something
like the biggest mistakes I suggest new
problems every time you go to new
projects I think what I see a lot is
okay one thing is people don't spend
enough time maintaining
test so that when they fail their
flexure understand what's gotten wrong
there's both five maintain the
readability of the tests refactoring the
test said that they so the right testing
abstractions legal system pops out the
refactoring off the test code and I'm
just ensuring that that there's all
consistent easy to understand and also
worth on the diagnostic so that when you
wear the test rails who explains clearly
what's gone wrong instead of just a huge
stack trace but thread monitored doubles
and what have you yeah so that bad
things really important and I think the
other thing not so much about testing us
people don't take Conway's law into
account when they're designed in X
systems so often they'll have for
example they won't have any sort of like
clear interfaces between teams are on
other side of each no opposite side of
the world I'm going to talk by phone
every morning by and so it's very hard
to collaborate on a shared code base
with people and it's very hard to get on
top of sort of like design flaws of
start sort of coming into the code and
then like getting to a common
understanding of the direction of code
should be moving in I'm getting in front
to move it if the epic talk people half
an hour a day over in a crackly life and
so you know thinking about your
architecture and organizing
according to your communication matters
between the team members between teams I
see since when I doesn't happen just
degrades so it's asking a lot of process
come along and not necessarily
technology wrong well don't there's
really much of a difference you know
where it's just about organizing your
your work in such a way that you where
you have to agree on things you can
agree on as little as possible when you
can't have a lot of communication to the
people have to do agree i think so you
know when you do split your team up
around the world you have to do more
upfront design you can change it later
but it's very difficult to become more
difficult to change later the further
apart more sort of distributed teams you
have so the way you designed code
changes I don't have closely people able
to work are you telling Rachel Davis one
so he said she sees a lot of teams that
just don't talk enough XP teams where
they don't talk enough for that design
don't step back it up then so in fact I
think one of the failure motive so kind
of agile is this sort of a fetish where
if i'm not typing code in right now on
value to the customer then it's
obviously waste and we must stop doing
it and it's very hard to step back and
look at the real economics of the
situation and you look a lot of other
teams we're actually they've been so
focused on oh my god we have to survive
this week which may be on the trigger
that they haven't looked to the next
level up which is actually the disgust
misfortune and the next Lok Lak which is
falling I've got look how much time we
wasted and they're too busy just pushing
forward and getting the buzz of making
progress which is you know you need to
do but you also need to step back and
think about perhaps a larger picture and
I think one of the other things I seen
increasing sort of getting Redknapp
about is over the years I've been very
lucky to have been on
work with some very good teams but when
i see is i can again go back to crafting
i see a lotta teen lot of people who've
never worked on a good project and you
can go through the entire life in this
in this business I was working on
rubbish projects and you just might have
an inkling but a lot of people just
dumped a significant proportion of
people I bump into just don't know what
it could be like and the tricky bit with
a lot of the stuff sort of our
experience particularly when you go for
example full-on hardcore XP with all the
test driven and the real flora factory
all that stuff is that the quantity of
experience takes it to a different level
and 300 or random if you never
experienced it be to stop believes it
doesn't make sense of network and they
don't see the point of putting all this
effort in because that's just waste and
I'm not sure how to get there maybe it's
never going to happen to work with here
do I have workers are not lazy enough
yes I happened to do lots of repetitive
manual work instead of muscular
automating or avoiding work writing the
test so they don't have to spend ages
debugging yeah which is step makes it
why am I doing this stupid thing is and
so there's a certain laziness need to
posture programs to which wich as a
result makes a project modern easy to
work seems if you're not used to working
in that way likes to say it just looks
like an alien language you're speaking
in a try to explain but yeah
prefer to work in that lazy way for me
so what you're saying is basically when
you get into this reaction mode it's
pretty hard to go back into its forensic
yes it comes very very difficult and
it's very translator and because the
other thing is is that what happens when
you're in the mess on this other side of
the gook isn't always working and
transcendentals mmm because and so often
what happens is if I sort of what
happens on start with mutti end up the
first thing I'd love to expect in the
boat nothing remotely sitting in the
corner swearing for three weeks that so
pleasant so the world is if I was
dishing up my fees going one paying
money for this phone yet because I know
this all you guys it's unpleasant listen
and no visible mental book was actually
doing is is trying to get the wrist down
and you see teams that where they have
this massive hidden risk for they can't
see and just again unless you've seen it
us it's very hard to talk about it being
abstract and if they if they're being
taken or nicely and haven't had the
crisis what we're fine was prom hmm I
don't know what the tools are more often
than ever have a crisis mou you know
continue at a low level of mediocrity
and and and often that's what people
think well also fast bucks you know it's
quite quite usual dance about fixing at
the end of a project too lazy mmm well
again and I know the apparel mine who
worked on a project where a couple of
times there were an hour away from my
kill million pound losses because they
would have missed the other night batch
which of solvent for the rest of it and
they know well thought it was born
someone happened to be watching the logs
at the right time and it just seems to
be impossible to get through that
actually you know because this might not
be the best way appreciate proceeding
just don't know what to do Scotia mean
it's not often but just well I've run
out of questions so thanks a lot and
have a nice time at the cutting edge you
think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
