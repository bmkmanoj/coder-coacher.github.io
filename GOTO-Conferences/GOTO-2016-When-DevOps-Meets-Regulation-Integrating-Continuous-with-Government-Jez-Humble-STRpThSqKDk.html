delivery for today Farley and then I
actually have another book coming out
this week the DevOps Hamburglar Jean Kim
John Willis Patrick Dubois and it's been
amazing really that it's actually been a
successful movement and we thought this
was quite a boring corner of technology
deployment automation build automation
that's kind of a bit dull really and
then this whole movement kicked off
about how this is actually really
important so that was a huge surprise to
me very gratifying obviously and it's
everywhere now you can't escape it and
so last year I was kind of looking
around working out what I wanted to do
with my life and this organization
called 18f kicked off so 18f is actually
a consultancy inside the u.s. federal
government it's part of an organization
called the GSA the General Services
Administration which runs all the public
buildings in America and does
acquisition services so anytime the
federal government buys anything from
tanks to printer paper it's the Federal
Acquisition service that buys it and our
third service is the technology
transformation service which is a
consultancy which other federal agencies
can hire to do the agile devops
consulting for them so this is varying
the organization is only two years old
and it was inspired a lot by what the
UK's government digital service had done
and I thought well this is this is
fascinating it's a chance to actually do
the things that I'm really passionate
about but in a domain which is hugely
important in a vein of providing
services to the public which often are
the most crusty and an awful despite the
fact that they are essential and you
have no choice in the fact you have to
use them and the other thing for me was
you know I've been talking about
continuous delivery in DevOps for a long
time and people say well that's great
but it can't work in my organization
because we're special and of course
everyone's special so you know you can't
just take what's worked in someone
else's organization and Transplant it
into yours and expect it to work because
organizations are complex systems and
that just you know it doesn't work
so this is fascinating to me because I
thought well you know if we can make
this work
in the US federal government we can make
it work anywhere and anytime someone
comes up with that excuse I can you know
I can say well if actually you know we
can make this work in u.s. federal
government so assuming you're not as
regulated as then you'll be fine too so
that was my my hope oh my gosh
how my wishes have come true it's
extremely hairy and I'm going to talk
about a lot of the hairiness in this
talk and hopefully it will blow your
mind as much as it's blown mine
it's really extraordinary please do
click on the app and give me your
feedback you can ask questions on the
app as well I'll be happy to answer
questions at the end so I'm gonna start
by talking about continuous delivery
what's continuous delivery fundamentally
it's about making releases a low-risk
ideally boring process what should be
exciting is what happens when you
release the software not the actual act
of releasing it and that's really where
the whole continuous delivery movement
came from is a bunch of us build monkeys
sitting in a room having a miserable
time and thinking wouldn't it be great
if you could just release at the push of
a button and we could all be out of a
job
you know you want to split ourselves out
of a job we won't release to be
something that we didn't have to all go
in at the weekends and sit in data
centers and really my favorite metric
for continuous delivery is how many
person hours do you have to work to put
out a release
that's not normal business hours so you
hands up if in order to push and release
out of your organization you have to
work some number of hours outside of
normal business hours ok many of you
that is a sign that something is wrong
delivery deployment should be an
activity that you can perform in a
push-button way during normal business
hours and it has no impact and if that's
not the case that means you have a
problem with your architecture it's an
architectural problem and often a
process problem and sometimes a cultural
problem as well but it's a problem means
there's something that you need to fix
so you want to be able to get changes
out quickly safely in a sustainable way
any kind of changes for
firewall changes to data schema changes
to code changes to documentation changes
and in the course of actually doing
penis livery what's happened is a
movement of people have sprung up
originally from the world of kind of big
web services in the US a
cross-functional community of practices
emerged who all had to solve this wicked
problem of building evolving and
operating these enormous distributed
systems a huge scale both securely and a
rate of change that had never been
achieved before so he had all these
companies like Amazon and Google and so
forth building these enormous
distributed systems that they wanted to
be able to change multiple times a day
and now Amazon is a stage where they're
changing you know tens of thousands of
times a day they push some changes out
to production so the DevOps movement is
a community of people you had to solve
this problem and now we find this
everywhere so you know we want to do the
same thing in the US federal government
we want to be able to ship it often it
looks a bit like this in the US federal
government's you know it shouldn't be
rocket science to launch software but
often it is and the analogy with rocket
science is interesting because when
you're launching space missions you you
have a checklist and before you actually
do the launch you've got to check up all
the different tasks make sure all the
different systems are working make sure
everything's or all the different
preconditions are in place and so
hopefully when you're about to push out
a release you have some kind of
checklist as well so in the US
government we have a checklist that we
go through before we launch new
information systems information systems
is what we call software services in the
US government parlance so what does our
checklist it like well there's a law
around records management there's a
record schedule we have the Privacy Act
the ironically names paperwork reduction
Act
section 508 / Slee we've got acquisition
regulations anti-deficiency is very
important government departments are not
allowed to run out of money before the
end of the year and then be like oh
we've run out of money and now you have
to give us more money they got wise to
that pretty quickly you've got the
economy here at the e-government Act I
don't actually know what computer
matching actors and so you know you can
go on and on and on there's you know my
boss Noah Keenan who I took these slides
from he has actually got an enormous
binder with this all of this stuff
printed out in it Phipps is is law so
these two things are laws that are
written by NIST the National Institute
of Science and Technology and that we
have to follow this is particularly bad
142 that's the one that covers crypto
modules where crypto modules have to be
assessed by NIST in order to prove that
they actually work properly that's a
real nightmare and then the behemoth is
special publication 800-53 which I'm
going to show you some slides from later
that's a four hundred and something page
list of all the controls you have to
implement for a federal information
system and not listed here is special
publication 800-53 a which is an even
bigger publication about 480 phases
which tells you how to prepare the
assessment reports to show that you have
actually fulfilled the controls in 853
861 - unless not all by the way we also
have you know 818 137 which is
continuous monitoring we can go on and
on through this Einstein which is the
department of homeland security system
to make sure that nothing gets broken
into very clever FedRAMP oh and OMB so
MB is basically the presidential office
and management budget it's a part of the
Federalist that basically makes all the
rules about the policies that we have to
follow so they have lots of memories
that we have to follow as well trusted
internet connection I'm not even gonna
start on that so I mean how many pages
do you think this is any guesses 10,000
it's not that bad four thousand and six
pages so that's our that's our launch
checklist in the federal government four
thousand six pages worth of regulations
and that doesn't take into account by
the way
agency policies there's also reams and
reams of agency policy specifics your
agencies that you have to follow in
order to push something live 853 I
briefly talked about security and
privacy controls for federal information
systems and organizations this is law
there was a law called FISMA that was
passed I think 2001 2003 federal
Information Security Management Act
which is a law around managing federal
information systems and 853 is part of
the documentation that was put in place
as part of the implementation of FISMA
which lists the security and privacy
controls that every federal information
system has to have in place and there
are literally hundreds of controls so
the smallest possible listing of the
controls that I could find is seven
pages and these controls are pretty
complex and the interpretation of the
controls is even more complex this is
actually a picture of my boss's
relatives and it you know he chose this
to put this this caption on because it
demonstrates quite effectively the like
Talmudic level of interpretation that
you have to be able to put in place in
order to actually understand how to
interpret these regulations correctly
and and what you end up with is huge
groups of people like this whose job is
interpreting these laws and regulations
and their experts and understanding how
to interpret these regulations and how
to write the documents that you have to
put in place that show that you've
complied with the regulations so every
time you put a federal information
system live you have to have an SS PA
system security plan which shows that
you have in fact implemented all the
relevant controls and how you've
implemented those controls then you have
to do a security assessment report which
shows how you've you know tested those
controls and then since you typically
don't actually implement all the
controls before you go live you also
have a thing called a poem a plan of
action and milestones which lists how
you're going to implement the controls
that you haven't got around to
implementing yet so it's a
and these these documents these huge
documents are put in place
it's a public-private partnership so
there's people in government
particularly in NIST whose job is to
create these but they do it in
partnership with a bunch of contractors
and often the agencies end up hiring the
same contractors to help them make sure
they've implemented them correctly so
it's kind of interesting system in that
respect
you know you get contractors who are
like well you know you draw a continuous
livery so hard to do that in a
government context and I'm like well
okay fair enough I get into government I
find it's those people who help right
the controls in the first place
they're complaining about how hard it is
to implement it well you should and then
so this is the smallest possible listing
I could find of all the controls they're
divided up into 17 easy to remember
categories from configuration management
incident response identification
notification contingency planning so
forth so this is you know the first
three pages and there's more and there's
more but that's just the top level
controls each one of those controls has
sub controls so a c2 account management
has sub controls for you know automated
system account management removal of
temporary or emergency controls
disabling inactive accounts in activity
log outs and so forth so for each one of
these if it's in scope for your system
and again FISMA divides systems up into
three types well based on whether
they're low impacts moderate impact or
high impact so you'd see for a low
impact system you just have to implement
the base account management control for
a moderate impact system you have to
implement these things in brackets these
are called enhancements so you have to
implement these enhancements and for a
high system you have to implement you
know these extra things and there's a
whole bunch of stuff here that they just
put in but you don't have to actually
implement it they just thought well you
know in interest of being complete we're
gonna list all these things but don't
worry about that so it's possible to see
how you could actually implement some of
these things using continuous delivery
so you know here's a listing of one of
the controls is the actual text in 853
which tells you what
controls about so this one is
configuration change control I can't
actually read it on my screen because
the text is too small because I fit it
on one page but this is about how you
actually implement configuration change
control and he it's possible to see how
you could implement this using
deployment pipeline because it doesn't
tell you how to implement it again
there's a whole army of people who know
how this has been implemented in the
past and so they can tell you how it's
been implemented and they can check to
see if you've done in the right way but
there's no reason why you can't do this
in a continuous delivery way the problem
is not that you can't do this using
modern methods the problem is that the
army of people whose job it is to
prepare the documentation and do the
interpretation have never done it that
way and so you have to work with them to
convince them that you know it's
possible to do this in this completely
different way you've never seen before
for all of these controls and that is
the huge gargantuan task there's also
you know whole set of controls frankly
where continuous livery is of no use
whatsoever so you know for example media
marking this is a control which means
that you have to write on your media on
your disk drives flash drives compact
discs diskettes magnetic tapes external
removable hard drives flash drives and
digital video discs the information
that's stored on them and whether that
information is confidential and so forth
like it's instantly reason going to help
you that but honestly if you're still
using digital video disc snake ancillary
is at least of your worries it's not
going to help you with water damage
protection either this is a control that
makes sure that you have some way of
providing master shots or for isolation
valves that are accessible working
properly and known to key personnel in
your information systems since
deliveries are gonna help you without
either in fact continuous delivery of
water to your equipment might actually
not be a great thing so I mean this is
what we're dealing with it's it's nuts
and if you're talk about continuous
delivery you're making multiple releases
a day you know getting an early
prototype out a few months in you know
you might wonder
how long is it going to take us to get
through the documentation in order to
put our system live in the first place
and that would be a very good question
to ask because typically for any new
system you're building in the US federal
government your constraint is how long
it's going to take you to write the
documents that you need in order to get
what's called the authority to operate
which you need in order to run the thing
say takes approximately six to fourteen
months from my system is ready to go
live to I can actually put my system
live some members of the public six to
fourteen months typically so you know
John wall's Paul likes to talk about you
know high tempo high consequence
environments federal government
basically is is low tempo high
consequence environment because it just
takes so long to get anything done and
this is especially problematic because
we've moved from a world where we care
about mean time between failures how can
we prevent things going wrong by being
very careful about we do what we do to a
worlds where what we care about actually
is time to restore service we live in a
world where we now have to accept that
failure is inevitable any complex system
is going to fail people are going to
hack in to your systems and if your
system hasn't been hacked into that
either means it was in fact hiding to
you and you didn't know about it or your
system basically had no value and no one
thought it was worth hacking into you so
you know if those two things aren't the
case then your systems gonna be hacked
and the question is not how can we make
sure that that never happens it's how
quickly can we detect and restore
service when a CVE comes out for example
you know when one of them any periodic
SS SS age vulnerabilities appears how
quickly can we patch those libraries and
there are controls that deal with this
but there are a very small minority of
the controls and they're not the focus
of this and that's a problem because we
do need to make that the focus we do
need to make
it we need to change I mean I guess what
I'm trying to say is part of the problem
is actually implementing the controls is
hard and documenting it is hard the
other part of the problem is the
controls were designed for a world that
no longer exists where we didn't have to
worry about this so much and where the
technology and process wasn't in place
for us to be able to quickly push out
changes in order to react but that's the
world we live in and the compliance
architecture hasn't really caught up
that's not a problem we're going to
solve soon but what we can solve to some
extent is the problem of working within
this regulated system so coming back to
the DevOps problem in terms of these
controls some of them we care about from
a dead perspective most of these
controls are actually to do with how we
operate the system so the operational
environment is a huge amount of those
controls and the process around
operating the system and it's kind of
unfortunate because the way that the
federal government traditionally has
worked is that everything's being
contracted out and typically you
contract out the development of the
system to a different group from the
people who are going to operate the
system and the developers have to
implement all the controls or many of
the controls and it also prepare all the
documentation you need to start talking
to the ops people from early on and this
is not something that is very easy to do
frankly and that the team at 18f was
thinking about well how do we how do we
resolve this problem and I think the
biggest breakthrough we had is that
actually we can solve a lot of these
problems by putting in place
infrastructure as a service platform as
a service because what you can do is you
can take care a lot of these controls of
the infrastructure layer or there's a
whole family of controls to do with the
physical environment things like fire
protection water protection and stuff
around your data centers that can all be
taken
however the IAS level and so what you
find is Amazon has actually gone through
the process of getting an authority to
operate for Amazon Web Services Ashley
has done the same there's actually a
whole bunch of infrastructure platforms
that have gone through what's called
FedRAMP which is the process for getting
authority to operate federal government
systems so there's actually a whole
bunch of infrastructure services that
you can just use and they've taken care
of a bunch of controls at that level all
thinking at 18f was well let's extend
that and let's take care of a whole set
of controls at the platform layer and so
this is what we've been able to do we've
actually built a system or in the
process of building a system called
cloud gov and this is an entirely open
source platform as-a-service everything
we build at 18f is public domain so you
can go to github github coms / 18f and
you can see all the stuff we've built
and it's all public domain you can go
and use it right now and in fact you can
take cloud gov so cloud gov is an
entirely open source platform
as-a-service built on open technologies
like cloud foundry and Rieman and graph
honor and and a bunch of other stuff and
you can actually if you go to CG -
provision you can actually provision
your own instance of cloud gov so
everything required to stand up an
instance of cloud gov is open source you
can go to github.com slash 18f /cz
provision check that out and then stand
up your own instance of cloud gov in AWS
so this is currently going through the
process to get an ATO and that is taking
months but once we've gone through that
process we can take care of many of
those hundred control hundreds of
controls at the platform layer so you
can deploy to cloud gov and I only have
to worry about about 40 or so of the
controls that makes it much much faster
to be able to build something and take
it live if you read
the platform that we've built and we're
selling this start of the Gulf of
government agencies so they can host
their stuff on cloud gov the other thing
we've done is built a system to
automatically generate the documentation
for you so all of these documents are
typically Word documents and PDFs all of
an if sufis published as PDFs so you can
go download 853 as a PDF but the
documentation you produce in order to
put your system live typically is in
Word documents and it's also not
publicly accessible there's a kind of
level of information called controlled
and classified information and all the
system security plan system assessment
reports the poem all this documentation
you have to produce to go live is
controlled unclassified information
which means that you don't show it to
people because showing people how your
system is implemented potentially is a
security risk right because if people
can understand how your system is
architected they could break into it and
then hacky so we've done something which
actually proved to be hugely
controversial which was to publish our
system security plan on the internet and
if you go to compliance cloud gov this
is not actually up to date we're going
to update it once we've gone live but
you can actually see our system security
plan and how you've implemented all
these controls and that was hugely
controversial we had to fight a bunch of
people in order to be able to make that
live but that means that other teams can
now see what good compliance
documentation looks like and furthermore
this is generated from gamal so the idea
is you can describe your systems
architecture and control implementation
in y amal in a machine-readable format
and then this is a system called
compliance masonry so there's a repo
called open control or an organization
on github called open control and 18f is
can part of a consortium an open
consortium called the open control
consortium who's putting together ways
to produce documentation from machine
readable format in an open way and the
idea is here what we can produce
detailed compliance documents from y
amal just using a program revolutionary
and then other people can reuse it and
say you won't have to have these armies
of people
producing this stuff anymore because
most of it will be implemented as a
platform layer and the rest of the stuff
you can do in the amyl and create your
own reports just programmatically
and then the next step beyond that is
the ability to go and actually test
those things so you know behavior driven
development why can't we go and actually
test run tests to test if these controls
are implemented so write write tests
write automated tests to test whether
these controls are actually implemented
that's the next step after this is to
take this stuff and actually be able to
run tests and so you know a list of
greens showing that these controls were
actually implemented so this is the
journey that we're on right now we're
still going through the FedRAMP process
to get cloud gov actually the authority
to operate in production but once that's
in place it's going to be much much
easier to be able to deploy new services
to production and it has a bunch of
other advantages as well so the fact
that you have a platform for production
systems and the fact that you can access
that for your the systems you're
building you have now a production like
environment that you can deploy to you
from day one and if you can deploy into
that cloud gov instance there's non
production you can have a high level of
confidence that your software is also
going to work in a production like
environment as well so no longer we
building stuff in test systems that
don't resemble production environments
well no I mean our cloud bug of
instances it's the same instance whether
you're deploying to production or
whether you're deploying to staging so
you can go and deploy your applications
to production paragraph but just have it
be a staging environment and the only
restriction on is that you're not
allowed to use real information so the
moment you're using real actual
information then you have to have an
authority to operate so as long as
you're using dummy information you can
just go and use paragraph without an ATO
and actually be testing your software in
a production like environment from day
one
the thing which is both the good and the
bad thing is that we're forcing people
into the platform so obviously there's a
of agencies who are running these huge
legacy systems in mainframes or whatever
and they would love to lift and shift
into the cloud environment you can't do
that if you're deploying to a platform
you have to reallocate X and this is
obviously I mean who's using a platform
as a service right now okay not that
many of you actually a few of you this
is the problem you have to architect for
the platform and there's obviously a
trade-off to that my experience is that
many of the patterns that are imposed by
the platform are actually good practice
for distributed systems anyway things
like 12 factor patterns that Heroku put
out making sure that you know you're you
know logging is external and so forth a
lot of these patterns are actually what
you have to do to make sure that your
distributive system is resilient in any
case so people complain about having to
fit into the platform and then they
build systems that don't fit into the
platform where they're actually not
resilient failures of the underlying
infrastructure like these patterns are
there for a reason and it's because
you're building a distributed system on
infrastructure that's fundamentally
unreliable and you have to own that that
becomes an architectural problem that
you have to solve either in your
software that you build that is
resilient to failure or any nodes or the
network you know network partitions are
inevitable in distributed systems you
either do that or you put it on a
platform where the platform forces you
into a box and that can be you know
trade-off that you could be on one end
or the other ends accepts in the context
of the federal government where guess
what if you're not going to deploy the
platform here's the extra hundred
something controls that you're going to
have to write the documentation for
yourself so in a federal government
context that pushes you massively in the
direction of preferring to be on the
platform and taking the architectural
here because otherwise your critical
path is going to be preparing the
documentation pack in order to put your
system live infrastructure as a service
only takes care of a small proportion of
those controls that you have to
implement the platform takes care of a
much larger set of controls it does give
you push-button deployments
and you can just push a button and
deploy straight into production and as I
say most of the controls are taken care
for the platform there and then finally
the other cool thing is making sure that
you have templates for all your
compliance documentation we will give
you a bunch of templates that you can
use and then you can just run compliance
masonry and it will produce all those
reports that you need to produce just by
default out of compliance masonry that
you can then go and get your stuff
shipped so our goal with all this is to
be able to take that process that takes
six to 14 months and get it down to
weeks where it is at present for 18 F
system and systems and ultimately we
want to be able to go through that
process in days so four months two days
is what we're aiming for and where some
of the way there and we hope by
certainly next year when cloud covers
ATO that we actually will be in a
position where we can do 80 18 days so
the message of this is you can do this
in federal government we're doing it in
federal government and if you can do
this in federal government you can do it
anywhere continuous delivery and DevOps
are hard it's really hard to do but the
benefits are enormous
and all it all you got to do is keep
chipping away at the problem these
problems are being solved and whatever
the men you're working in however
regulated there is a way to do it you
just have to think creatively and and
chip away at it and really hope that the
software producing is of use to you
obviously all the stuff we produces it's
public domain go and check it out and we
really value your feedback so please
contribute codes or issues or please
reuse our code let us know how it goes
thank you very much
and we have some some questions like
that lovely so I have two questions that
I think are basically the same question
so I'm gonna read them both out and you
know what you think so given a lot of
the legislation you need to comply with
was written and implemented in a time
when modern technology systems and
development practices were not foreseen
is there any effort or intent to change
the law to provide more flexible and
responsive controls that can adapt a
technical innovation rather than
constrain it and the second question
which is I think is just a shorter
version than the first is is there any
effort to change the regulatory
environment such that the next team
doesn't have to go through what you've
had - the law is very slow to change and
the other problem is I mean the way the
u.s. system works is you end up with
these enormous bills because the bills
don't have to be all about one thing
what ends up happening very commonly in
US government is you have a bill about
one thing and then people stuff loads of
other unrelated things into that bill
and then it has to go from the house to
the Senate and then often back to the
house and so it's a very risky process
you never know what you're going to end
up with and then typically the law
doesn't talk about the implementation
then someone like NIST goes away and
determines what the implementation looks
like so it's a very blunt instrument and
I don't think realistically the the law
is is going to change significantly any
time soon however that still gives us a
bunch of flexibility so we have as I can
have showed you earlier you know these
these controls we have to implement and
we classify federal information systems
based on three axes come the
confidentiality of the information in
them the availability of the system and
confident and integrity integrity of the
system which you can sort onto a
three-letter acronym CIA
confidentiality integrity availability
and so for each of these it's low medium
or high and the problem is that the low
baseline is actually a lot of stuff you
can see that there's you know more
control selected than non selected it's
about you know I think about 50/50 I
haven't I haven't counted it sorry and
the problem is too that low baseline is
a lot of stuff and I think a lot of what
18f is trying to do is just put take
government data and make it publicly
available so that government data is
often public anyway you just can't get
it one of the projects we've been doing
in 18f is building an API for the
Federal Election Commission's data so
Federal Election Commission has an
enormous database full of every
contribution to every campaign but you
can't get it you have to submit a
request and then they send you it and
what we've done at 18f is build a system
building built an API so you can now go
to an API and download all the
information on campaign contributions
just through an API which is the way it
should be so that data is public data
there is ZERO confidentiality to that
data and availability will you know it
would be a bummer if it wasn't available
but you know no one's gonna I mean no
government business is going to stop as
a result that dates not being available
and again the integrity of the system
well that's actually reasonably
important we want to make sure that the
data coming through the system is the
same data that's in the FCC's database
but actually in terms of confidentiality
it's not a low baseline it's a zero
baseline and in terms of availability
again it's a zero baseline we don't care
if it goes down so that's not something
that's really envisaged here what is in
the regulation is the ability to what's
called tailor these controls so you can
say well you know these are the baseline
controls but we can tailor them we can
say well for this system they don't
really apply because fundamentally what
this is called is the risk management
framework and risk is something that's a
business decision and this is actually
in the rules there there's a person
called the authorizing official and the
authorizing official issues that
authority to operate and the authorizing
official can accept risk they can say
well all these controls are implemented
but I'm going to accept the risk of that
being the case and put it through anyway
so you can do that the law allows you to
do that the problem is it's very rare
for people to Taylor down
now people Taylor up they say well we're
using the low baseline but we need these
additional controls people don't like to
Taylor down and take a bunch of controls
out and that's basically because a lot
of work in government is that the risk
is actually not a business risk is am I
going to end up in front of Congress and
that drives a lot of the decision-making
process but it is possible to do that
and I think what we're trying to do in
18f to some extent is do these things
and have the rain of fire come down on
us and and continue to live so that
other people can then do it without the
rain of fire coming down on them to
prove that these things are doable and
that we can survive anyway and and you
know and be the vanguard of this so
other people can come behind us and do
it with you know having seen that it's
been done before basically and so this
is something we have been doing we've
been taking risks we've been accepting
risk for systems that don't fulfill all
these controls because we think you know
actually these things just don't apply
because guess what it's public data so
there's no confidentiality so that's the
approach we're taking to solving that
particular problem okay other questions
we have some and I will run around the
room or we could take an early break
so what kind of magic that you used to
convince people that this is a good way
of doing things like I have like so
there's so much pushback in our
organization when he came and say well I
can outer generate this in 13 seconds
that he have been using months and
months to do and there's always a little
king has a kingdom and don't want to
change things so what did he do what do
we do what we did is a little web site
called healthcare.gov who's heard of
healthcare.gov
have you heard I mean and the reason
you've heard of healthcare.gov is
because it was a disaster of epic
proportions you know this is Obama's
signature health care legislation and it
was going to be implemented by a website
called healthcare.gov and the website
did not work and what happened was they
got a bunch of people from you know
modern technology companies to come in
and fix that problem and what the White
House realized as a result of that is oh
this current way of doing things doesn't
work and it's going to cause our
legislation to fail
we had better changed the way we do
things so what caused us to be able to
do this was a massive crisis of epic
proportions what that was going to have
impacts on tens or hundreds of millions
of Americans and not enable them to get
health care and pull the president down
with it that was what enabled us to do
this that may be hard to replicate at
your organization and this is the
unfortunate truth it often takes an
enormous crisis in order to be able to
push something like this through this is
this is the trick of big organizations
big one wise agents which is successful
you can't change anything and there's a
good reason for that which is because
people want to keep on doing the things
that made them successful you like you
shouldn't do this and they're like what
do you mean we're enormously successful
why should we changing this
you're like well yes right now but in
about five years time no one cares about
five years time you've got your
quarterly shareholder report that you've
got to deliver and that's what you care
about no one's taking a long term vision
of the process and so you know winston
churchill's that had to say never let a
crisis go to waste
and I think you know that's the
unfortunate reality and a lot of large
organizations is that there has to be
some kind of crisis if all this happens
and you know if there's any consultants
in the room who know how to make
significant transformations within an
organization that's not in crisis please
you know I want to know your secret it's
really hard to do and even then it's
been an enormous struggle for us we also
are very lucky to work within the
General Services Administration which
despite the boring bureaucratic title
it's actually at the forefront of a lot
of this stuff they were the first we can
use Gmail at the GSA we can work from
home we're now using slack there's a bit
of controversy over that but when you're
now officially using slack so you know
GSA I work from home GSA is an
organization which is distributed you
can work from home we use Google Apps we
use slack we use all the you know we all
have Macs and that's because we work for
a very forward-looking organization but
again it's partly the way the
organization is structured that allows
that to happen
GSA runs the federal buildings we work
in the federal buildings if there's too
many of us working there it becomes
expensive to run them so in as much as
you know we have a very kind of
enlightened teleworking policy it's
partly about the fact that actually it's
cheaper for the GSA if people work from
home so a lot of it is about working out
where the pain is in your organization
finding the people who the pain is
affecting most intensely and working
with those people to try and solve their
problems in a way which is which pushes
you in the direction of your vision that
is really the kind of heuristic I think
for this you know if there's a part of
your munoz ation which isn't in pain and
you're going to completely change the
way they are going to do things they're
going to say no why should they there's
no reason for them to change so find the
possible
where there's pain and find ways this
conversation we're having just before
this this this talk which is exactly
right and work with them to solve their
problems and the questions as one right
at the back they'll thanks to exercise
for the day done you couldn't come this
way hi I actually used to work for the
federal government for about ten years
so I'm a little gradual ation sir I'm a
little curious about the procurement
process I mean I know about the
comparative process within the federal
government
how has the lengthy procurement process
impact your ability to cut your delivery
time from to six months to 14 months
from 14 months down to a more manageable
time period to bring your product out
the door yeah that's a great question a
big part of the problem is procurement
exactly as you say so one of the things
we've done in eighteen F because we've
actually created what's called an agile
BPA so the BPA is a procurement vehicle
basically and we've invent we basically
invented this thing called an agile BPA
where I mean the traditional way you go
through procurement is you know there's
you go to schedule which is a list of
vendors who are approved and then you
send them an RFP and then they've you
know there's just it's basically an
enormous exchange of documentation and
then at the end of the enormous exchange
of documentation someone goes off for
like five years and build something and
then you might or might not get
something that's fit for purpose at the
end of that process so what we did
instead is the outer are BPA companies
bidding for those contracts have to
submit a working prototype that's built
using open source code that we can see
and that's the only way you get in to
the bidding process and so we're kind of
surprised actually a number of big
contractors ended up giving us like
working prototypes built on open source
code for our first service that we put
out through the agile BPA a lot of them
didn't a lot of them were just like
working codes crazy talk and just
couldn't do it at all but we did get a
surprising number of people who gave us
working code and then one of the
conditions of the agile PPA is that the
code is open source so they have to work
in an open in open they have to build
open source code in a public repo and we
can see what they're building all the
time and at the end of it the code is
obviously open source it's public domain
anyone can use it so our rule is
basically if you're going to write code
paid for by government dollars that
belongs to the people because the people
have paid for it so all that stuff will
be open source
and so we awarded our first procurement
under the agile PPA last year came out
recently if you go to the 18f blog you
can actually see a really nice montage
of the images of the website is it
evolved from like website goes here to
an actual working website listing and
it's a website that lists all the
systems that have been given a FedRAMP
authority to operate so you can actually
go and see all the different cloud based
offerings SAS is and powers that have
been given a FedRAMP ATO on this system
that was built using an agile PPA you
can go and download the code it's
totally open source so that's our
approach to solving that particular
problem one more question from the app
then or not from the app from someone
using the app I presume and this is that
small already so some good questions ok
documentation documentation still needs
to be reviewed and approved
ok so although we can generate it
automatically it needs to be reviewed
and approved I hope and assume since the
question this still takes a lot of time
how can you make your goal of days
instead of weeks given all of this like
additional work yeah now that's exactly
right I mean what is going to end up
being the constraint is the review
process so we're just taking from the
agile playbook for this which is do as
much of the review during the
development process so the end all
you're typically going to be doing is
like running scans against the
production system
look for vulnerability so vulnerability
scanning is the big one that you have to
do against a real production system
rather than a staging production system
but all the other stuff we want to be
able to do in process at the same time
as the development process happens and
again a lot of this can be taken care of
the the platform layer saying you know
most of the most of these controls are
taking care of other powers and is layer
and they're subject to continuous
monitoring so they're running you know
continuous in the federal government
context is not the same as continuous in
you know the dictionary definition of a
term it's like monthly but all these
things are getting scanned on a monthly
basis of the person is level and so only
those 42 controllers are the ones that
actually you know 4050 controls the ones
that actually need to be tested before
going live most of that can be done in
process while the development is going
on only a very few of those controls
have to be tested right at the end once
you're in production that is going to
end up being the constraint which means
it takes days rather than hours but
again you can build that in so the
vulnerability scans you make that part
of your deployment pipeline you can make
code scans part of your deploy and
pipeline you can make demonstration the
configuration management process part of
your deployment pipeline a lot of this
can be taken care of just by building
deploy and pipelines making sure that
you're using you know infrastructure is
code that you can stand up your
production system purely from
information stored in version control
and by the way if you want to download
cloud gov if you go to github.com 18f
/cg for cloud gov - provision you know
you can download and do this yourself
but you know a lot of this is taken care
of by actually just following good
development process isn't doing the
validation in process as you're
developing fantastic there was one
question about how did you convince
government the automated test was a way
of validating stuff that's going to have
to wait for another day just humble
thanks Lance oh that's fantastic thanks
Jess humble thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
