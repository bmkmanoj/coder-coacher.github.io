32 years we both live in the Boston area
about seven miles apart and I would
guess that we see each other as much
overseas as we do at peet's coffee shop
in Washington area Jeff explained
something just now which i think is very
fundamental to to both of our work which
is the number of people that have told
us you know what a relief what a joy is
to actually be able to develop software
in a way where they can be creative
productive and work with their for their
friends and their buddies about it and
more than anything else that's just that
it gives you a sense of you're doing the
right thing now I've never understood is
clearly the difference between Jeff's
type of work and my type of work until
he explained how he was flying over
North Vietnam at 30,000 feet dropping
bombs because at the same time I was in
the Merchant Marine as a second mate and
we were i was in freighters going from
united states to vietnam up to saigon
river to deliver the material fighting
off river pirates in the Saigon River
desperately trying to stay alive while
you were flying at 30,000 feet saying
aha take that you had a good life and
that's kind of interesting um like Jeff
um I did other things before i got into
software but i remember still the very
first software project i got and it was
perhaps before some of you were born but
this guy said hey can we just bought a
mini computer and and we also bought
some equipment that it's got to control
because they're going to be used in our
order processing department and and
you're not going to believe this but
that computer doesn't have any of what
they call an operating system to control
those those optical character readers so
here's the manual go build with alpha i
mean what a great life this is
someone will give you you know open
blank problem like that and say you know
go do something with and this was an 8k
mini computer and all there was was
assembler and this to me was like the
Epiphany of our profession you know it's
a wonderful type of place to be and and
I worked on and offered different types
of work throughout the years and and I
was actually there when waterfall
started being introduced as a way to
create more predictability to control
uncertainty in software in 78 79 and and
I kept this thing that struck me as I
was working through this was what was I
doing wrong you know why was this so
hard why was it so difficult why
couldn't I pull the people together just
in this perch art and scan chart looks
good everything seemed but it didn't
work and that was very very frustrating
and finally in 1985 I decided you know
that this wasn't getting many or so I
quit working in large corporations
they've never been my best place anyway
so that was okay and I've run my own
company since then and that was where
Jeff and I had stayed in touch but that
was where we became reunited because I
was getting to be very knowledgeable but
what they used to call computer-aided
software engineering technology where
you could model structured methods
artifacts and later information
engineering and then objects and and I
got in touch with Jeff and where he was
working at a company saddlebrook
corporation building banking software
and and neither of us really knew about
it er ative incremental and the
advantage of quick transparency annoying
exactly where you where you were and I
remember we the guy in charge of it said
you guys have only a year to finish that
software was it a million dollars we had
our two million it wasn't enough and and
we weren't sure so we went over you know
and this is literally the state of
software projects you don't know so in
desperation we used Kokomo a planning
model estimating system and we came up
with her oh it looks like we're like two
years and four million dollars and
sure enough you know it did take more
than him here in a million dollars but
the point of that is the uncertainty in
these software projects and so I was I
was you know really working with the
keys vendors and in working with large
soft for large methodology companies
like Ernst &amp;amp; Young and coopers and
library and so I founded my own company
I figured that it must have been that
methodologies are very hard to use
because they are manual you know they
were just you know flipping pages two
pages and yet here was computer-aided
software engineering tools so I we built
the first alm product alm 0.0002 and
what it did is it automated these large
methodologies and it also automated
their linkages to the case tools and all
that and coopers and IBM of those places
resold their methodologies on it and i
was like wow you know this is good this
will solve the problem and as someone
told me they said you know methodology
is worse we're pigs and all you did is
put them on roller skates you know
they're faster but they're not any
better and I remembered back in 1985 I
been at a conference and I heard this
person get up and say waterfall is an
appropriate way to use it it's a
metaphor for the manufacturing system
that we use in our car companies and
it's just that we're using it wrong and
if they build cars very successfully and
I proposed and I strongly advise that we
all figure out how to use this system
because if they can build cars one after
another we can build systems one after
another it's just that we're using it
wrong so I got a call from Jeff um 93
sounds right and he said he was talking
to his very involved in object
management group and they want to know
what sort of methodologies or processes
would be most appropriate for all type
development and jeff says hey Ken you
know you're working with Cooper's and
those people and you're doing Oh
development too so which one to you you
I'm you're like summit dior navigator
those are names that are obscure now and
I said jeez you know none of them you
know if I used any of them we'd be broke
you know they're they're too inflexible
we have lot of change the technologies
of unstable and so we started talking
together and working together and
because we actually had very similar
ways of addressing small companies with
huge amounts of change and needing to
know where we were it was 95 uppsala
that we did that first paper I think
that was the first place if he came
visible and the good news is were still
alive no one's hunted us down and killed
us yet and since 95 we've done lots of
work with many companies to both help
formulate scrum better because some
there were some things that we weren't
clear of but also to help companies use
it now I got sucked into waterfall you
know it seemed like a really good
approach seemed like a really good work
so in ninety nineteen ninety-four I went
and worked with some people I knew at
DuPont advanced research facility who
were processed control experts and I
said so we're we're thinking about this
kind of approach and and I'm really
unsure before you know I go betting the
farm on this that they are ranking to
fool myself that this has some basis you
know there's some theoretical
underpinnings to this and they said well
tell us a little about what you do now I
said well you know what we what we do is
we have very long projects where we
spend lots of money and we do a lot of
planning up front and and then we
deliver a system he said well how
successful are you so well about
forty-five percent of them are you know
what they should be I said wow they said
that's that's a long time a lot of money
and stuff to invest in you know
something that he has such a high degree
of failure they said you know why don't
you you know just shorten it down you
know rather than doing it for that long
why don't you just shortened down the
amount of risk you're taking to
something much more reasonable and he
said this is um this is what we use when
we do
Plex work and this is called complex
process control or empirical process
control so rather than trying the whole
thing at once and finding out that
nothing worked instead do it for a much
shorter period of time and then inspect
and see if it worked and what didn't
work and then make adjustments and then
do it again and again and again they
said this is a really good approach if
you're building cars or something like
that and you have a very simple process
and you can't want for high-volume
manufacturing at the lowest possible
prices they said but the we always
advise as to people unless it doesn't
work they said forty five percent is not
working and so we recommend use this
where instead you are using empiricism
and you are planning just in time
planning throughout the entire process
and this is there the whole bodies of
work on this and and babatunde yoga naki
Jeff and I work with people with strange
names it's it's weird none of this would
happen if we with more reasonable names
hadn't taken it on strange no one named
babatunde will succeed so so studied his
stuff and and felt comfortable that we
had the underpinnings of this and that
this would succeed so we're using scrum
we're very successful in a number of
companies I'm still very low profile no
visibility number of places we used it
we never use the words we never exposed
instead we just said this is what we
always do you know let's get together
every day why don't we deliver more
frequently let's keep the number of us I
mean so in scrum you know even though we
discovered and have it found in
different things there's literally
nothing new in it that he hasn't been a
good practice in software development
for years and years and years that
wasn't overlaid and ruined by waterfall
and I'm not accusing waterfall I was you
know I was fully involved in it tried to
make it work it was just the wrong
approach so starting a was about
nineteen ninety nine I was helping some
of my neighbors friends find jobs work
there
through collagen found them jobs in
quality control and they were building
media neutral feeds for for publishing
systems and when they graduated I was
done going to help them you'll find good
jobs in the software industry and I
still remember one of them looked at me
and said mister mister Schreiber thanks
but no things she did you know that most
of the people in your profession don't
like it I'm like wow what do you mean
she said well you know like when I was
working in places we'd find bugs in the
Earth's and they would say ignore it or
they would ask us to modify a report so
it didn't look as bad people would ask
us for opinions about what was happening
and yell at us if it wasn't what they
wanted to hear most the people actually
to come to work you know it can cringe
and she said so you know that's not
really a great profession I'm going to a
place where our people have more
integrity I'm going to take a job on
Wall Street now I've been software
developing a long time and you know this
is like the frog in in water they start
scolding it's hotter and hotter you
don't notice until you experience
something different and this was like a
shot across my face because I didn't
know other people who were trying to do
our work of you that's the same way and
then I was reflected out and realized
that our customers actually thought the
same of us they didn't like us either
you know why can't you guys develop
something and deliver it on time so
since 1999 2000 scrum extreme
programming all that's become more
popular that's good one person into it
said he can we used waterfall then we
use another variant of waterfall that we
used Rupp than we used extreme
programming build your own agile process
what do you think is going to come after
scrum and the point is scrum is not
solving a single problem that's not the
intention of it it's a tool you can use
to gain engineering excellence it will
tell you how you're doing by creating
transparency in your organization and
when when we start discussing and
getting up in public and talking about
scrum I thought this would
like a one or two-year thing I thought
you know my wife Chris myself would be
in Barbados by now retired and you know
drinking pina coladas much to my
surprise when when we started working
with companies that were starting to try
to use scrum they were deeply trained
and habituated in waterfall techniques
they were used to cutting quality to
meet a date they weren't used to
actually getting something done in a
period of time they were unaware of
modern engineering practices like
acceptance test driven development
refactoring emerging architecture
because of course if you're rushing to
push out more stuff you don't have time
to do it right and I'm talking working
with their customers to help them become
what we call product owners with agility
and they're like they've been burned so
many times they could be bothered they
don't care if they don't want to be
engaged because they don't think it's
possible we could do better and so what
we've been finding over the years is
this is not a simple thing we saw GM
toyota and ford and chrysler observe
toyota since the early 50s gain
engineering and industrial excellence
with lean none of them took it seriously
or if they did there's no evidence in
their factories that it actually took
hold and as a result two of the three of
them declared bankruptcy and Toyota is
by and large ascendant over them except
for the earthquakes and tsunamis which
you know whatever so here we are in
almost the same situation where we have
an industry mired in practices which
caused defects which caused slippage
a--'s which caused the people in the
industry to dislike their work which
caused overruns which caused our
customers to distance themselves from us
which caused our customers to make a
sign contracts that will give them
penalties when we don't deliver as they
expect and and to change to a different
type of situation is a
radical change it says as simple in
radical as what I mentioned earlier
today where I'm talking to a chief
financial officer and he says so so Ken
what do you do for a living and so while
I help people build software in 30 days
he said I'll so I don't have to wait 18
months to get what I don't want I said
that's right I'll give you what you
don't want in 30 days that is a huge
shift in a company people are used to
you know find knowing that things aren't
going to work out engaging in plausible
deniability politics to cover things up
and here we have the possibility that
something that is different than what
someone predicted may be seen at the end
of a sprint that requires a fair amount
of integrity to keep that transparency
and make hard decisions around it much
easier to just cover it up and say oh
that really wasn't we'll fix that later
this is a very different way of thinking
this is a very different way of acting
and I have a lot of reasons I'm doing
this one my neighbor's kids it was very
embarrassing moment second I have had
tremendously good experiences in
software development and i would like to
restore that to us to whatever extent i
can the third thing is i think that we
are getting into hugely complex products
world situations there are a lot more
people we have advanced technologies we
need better software development
practices and people using them when you
consider is how many of the embedded
software products are now being inserted
in our body or being used in the planes
that we fly at 40,000 feet over the
ocean i think it's probably a good thing
if we get a lot better at what we do and
it's not going to get better it's going
to become more critical as we need more
of these things to cope with the
complexity of 7 billion people in our
world Jeff and I both try to work as
much as we can with companies who have
the sense of urgency and the
determination
to to change from where they are to a
more agile professional competent
company throw aren't that many it's a
very hard work it's a five or six-year
your effort to change a company to that
it's even one or two years to get their
engineering organization tools and
trained to understand you know this
whole idea of building a piece of usable
software in one iteration and reason why
I personally come and meet with people
like you is I hope to enlist you in the
crusade this is a quiet revolution at
the very bottom of it we're going from
people who are intelligent people like
yourselves who are used to coming to
work and being told what to do and to
make it look like you did what that is
or that makes sense or not to asking for
organizations where you are empowered to
figure it out yourselves and be as
creative as possible and what a huge
shift and one is a place worth going to
work to the other is a place where you
hope that you get to retire and so
that's just a phenomenal thing that
we're trying to do and if we can enlist
you if we can give you insights that
there are possibilities of this being a
great profession to work in if we can
give you insights that this is critical
to our world and to our profession much
less you know just our job satisfaction
and you engage in this we're delighted
so I hope Jeff and myself you heard Jeff
he has a cold he's sick he came here
just to talk to you and me yeah I don't
know I'm just crazy so I came here to
talk to anyway but I hope that in some
ways we have have reached you and I hope
that when we get a chance to respond to
some of your questions we can give you
some insights or help you with some
misunderstandings a key understanding
that will help you when you're asking us
questions that because you'll be looking
at problems and you'll be looking at how
do
do this in how to do that the very basis
of scrum is you can't be sure and what
you make often looking for our solutions
that will solidify and give you solid
answers we actually don't have any of
them because our basis is this is
complex works where all you can do is
try a little bit of something this is
fail often fail early and see how it
worked and they try it again and see how
it works a little interesting hard
because you can fail a lot requires a
lot of intelligence to keep on top of it
and see what's going on and so
unfortunately like unlike the waterfall
thing we don't have any solid firm
answers you can put in your pocket and
succeed with for the rest of your life
if we did we wouldn't be giving the way
like scrum we be charging an arm and leg
you don't have any to you yeah I don't
either so I'm glad to answer your
questions thank you for having us here
we wish you well we encourage you to
join us in this this some quest for
professionalism and self-sufficiency
thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
