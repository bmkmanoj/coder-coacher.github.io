how many people here are using some form
of scrum love it almost all of us how
many of us here are doing some form of
scrum outside software some of us yeah
how many of us are doing some form of
scrum in hardware building a saying or
manufacturing a thing okay it's not just
me
there's at least one more thank you you
might enjoy this for the rest of you
might I hope encourage you to try some
of the parts of scrum that you that
you're finding the best success with
maybe all of the framework in a broader
domain I'm Joe justice I'm the president
of scrum in hardware at scrum
incorporated I'm lucky enough to work
directly with dr. Jeff Sutherland the
inventor of scrum the co-creator of
scrum I own an automotive manufacturing
business that does have operations in 23
countries I've been written up in Forbes
five times I've had the luxury of giving
guest lecture at Oxford University in
England and MIT MIT Sloan Business
School Berkeley the Ecole in Paris
German manufacturing design schools
designs and colleges in Barcelona etc so
we might have actually met each other
before depending on where you work
I've had the chance to give a TEDx talk
the Discovery Channel has done a mini
documentary of my life that's ridiculous
to say I'm clearly just a normal person
here's why they thought that was worth
doing
I wrote what's called the extreme
manufacturing practices a set of 10
technical practices very similar to XP
very similar to extreme programming for
hardware manufacturers if they implement
those technical practices they would
then be able to scrum and release
hardware short iterations less than one
month some cases less than a week
CNNMoney sent a team of Deloitte well I
should say that differently Deloitte
consultants sent a team of consultants
to my car company wikispeed to audit our
scrum
they published an article in CNN money
and they titled it how every company
should train their staff depending on
where you get your news we might know of
each other I'd like to talk about
collaborating across the scrum teams
this track is are we there yet here at
the go-to conference in Berlin it's
we've been doing scrum since 1993 we've
had the agile manifesto thens since 2001
we've had XP practices since the mid 80s
are we there yet are we done and I'd say
some of us are doing great the top five
wealthiest companies in the world all
use scrum none of them don't
I bet they would say they're there yet
but I bet they'd also say we could do it
better they're all trying to grow all of
the top five wealthiest companies in the
world how do we collaborate across teams
what is emerging right now I'd like to
share with you the current state of
scrum at scale this is Jeff Sutherland
and the team at scrum inks framework on
how to collaborate in a lean way scrum
has three roles we have our product
owner our scrum master our development
team and we have five events sprint
planning daily standup refinement to
prepare for long lead items that's very
important in hardware our sprint demo
sprint review at the end and our
retrospective to continuously improve
our Kaizen event in lean terminology
then we have three outputs product
backlogs we know our long term vision
very important in hardware as well our
sprint backlog so we know how the team
is going to collaborate right now and
our potentially shippable product
increment this is where most companies
whether they're hardware or software run
into their first big problem they don't
feel they can get anything done and
usable all of this is done in a
framework of make work visible well how
would we scale this have any of us ever
coded a fractal like the Mandelbrot set
yeah yeah really a fractal the
mathematical thing where it draws a
picture of itself and then repeats and
repeats and repeats forever I see some
people nodding not just you there are
few behind you to say saying that yes I
know of this but who here is written one
coated one so it repeated just a few of
us just a few of us yeah it truly is so
for most of us if your experience was
anything like mine you coded it for the
first time and he hit compile and it
didn't work you made some mistake so you
tried a few more things and it compiled
and it actually rendered you saw
something on the screen but the second
layer wasn't the same as the first and
it broke started making weird-shaped and
you got a blue screen so you edited back
and it expanded expanded but already it
didn't look right but it lasted longer
and it broke and you got a blue screen
eventually you made it a recursive
algorithm where the same code is
executed again and again and again and
again passing along the same inputs
getting the same outputs or an expanded
version of them that meets the same
algorithm and it grew forever and if
your experience was anything like mine
you had this magical feeling like you
just created something that in some ways
alive it did it you got the algorithm
right it just keeps growing forever
that's exactly how we're attempting to
build scrum at scale each team has a
scrum master right I hope this is
familiar to us the scrum master protects
the team they visualize progress
impediments the burn down chart so we
can invest if we don't have a burn down
chart it's hard to invest in a scrum
team we don't have a trend on to when
we're gonna recognize a piece of value
or Explorer or answer a question
so for investment purposes I would
require a burn down chart even though
it's not mandated in the scrum guide
they have complete responsibility
through trust they do this without any
direct authority in almost every company
their their servant leader they coach
the team and the product owner in scrum
they implement the values of the agile
manifesto they facilitate the five
events of scrum they ensure work and
impediments are made visible
they make state maintain external
radiators of team progress they
encourage openness and transparency they
identify and ensure resource and
resources are removed resources are
removed and written they identify and
remove impediments and that resources
flow to the team they promote good
change or Kaizen thinking and waste
reduction and there's one scrum master
per team if we have one scrum master for
two
they don't speed up as quickly so it's
not a savvy investment when we're
talking about dollars in dollars out
well what if we have five teams after
daily stand up the scrum masters have
another daily stand up what do we call
that meeting when the scrum master is
meet together a scrum scrum so they have
a scrum of scrums and they all share
their mission and goal the scrum master
is our job is to make work visible so
they all share their mission and goal
and they all share their impediments and
they prioritize them by business impact
together they do that less than 15
minutes every day then they take that
list of impediments and they shop it
around to the product owners because if
our whole company's running scrum no one
does anything unless it's in a product
backlog so we have to get the
impediments in a product backlog this is
how teams help each other well that
makes sense what if we have more than
five teams that this would work great
with less Kraig Luhrmann's large-scale
scrum what if we have more than that
here's 25 teams one out of five of those
scrum masters meets in scrum a scrum of
scrums
makes sense it's a 15-minute meeting
after the 15 minute meeting and it
accomplishes what a scrum master does at
scale
remember scrum masters job is make work
visible and remove impediments or find
someone who can remove them so we do
this each scrum of scrums and it's
simply the daily standup after the daily
standup if it's the last day of the
Sprint scrum masters repeat
retrospective which many of you already
do so now we have retrospectives at
scale and we're dealing with
organization level impediments to try to
improve the whole company right which
many of you are already attacking what
if we have more teams than that the
final scrum of scrums of the day happens
in front of the most senior team in the
company that's running scrum it's their
job to take the impediments no one else
can fix and fix them I was interviewing
an executive at a company making jet
fighters with scrum they fly a new jet
or a new version of the jet every three
weeks that executive the head of
structures said if you're an executive
in this company and you want to do
anything except remove the teams
impediments you have to do that before
8:30 and the more
because from 8:30 that's when the scrum
of scrums happens in front of the
executives from 8:30 until the end of
the day your only job is to remove the
teams impediments so I am saying if
you're going to use scrum at scale it's
a very different job description that
most executives have now they're either
a product owner scrum master or
development team member on a team
removing impediments there's no other
roles we don't have a release engineer
we don't have jr. test platoon
we don't have DevOps squad and scrum at
scale those are important skills to
maintain it's not that those skills
aren't valuable we don't need a role for
them they're just scrum masters with
scrum masters product owners and
development teams with backlog of those
things each team has a product owner
right
I hope this part feels familiar to us
product owners they set the team
priorities they choose who we're going
to delight in what order but they are
not allowed to say how because that
would minimize innovation if the product
owner says team here's how we're going
to do it we have one point of innovation
if the product owner says team here's
who needs something and why they need it
and it's a priority how are we going to
do it now we have let's say we have a
team of five and a product owner we have
six points of innovation that maximizes
innovation and it's more respectful of
people's intelligence they spend half
their time with the customer and it's
not just to listen the majority of that
time is setting stakeholder expectation
for what the team can build have any of
us ever been on a team where we built
something cool and the company never
used it or the customers never used it
yeah me too
what did that do to our morale throw it
throw me a bone what did it do to our
morale it sucks
well that's the largest risk to a
project after technical risk so our
product owner spends half their time 20
hours a week talking up what we can do
to the stakeholders purchasers
influencers in the purchasing decision
users internal stakeholders regulatory
compliance officials to say here's what
my team can make
Henry Ford was famous for saying if I
asked my customers what they wanted they
would have asked for a faster horse the
product owners job is not just implement
what the customers want yes we do some
listening to validate our hypothesis of
what we can do but the product owner
role you're trying to play Steve Jobs or
Elon Musk you're trying to pull the
market to something even cooler than
most of the market is aware as possible
we spend the other half of the time with
the team so very often product owners
can spend an hour or two a day helping
the teams build stuff whether it's
hardware software business plans human
resource initiatives they own one
backlog of big and little missions they
own what we're gonna do and for who and
in what order that's the product backlog
yeah but they don't own how we're going
to do it the development team owns that
the development teams focused on the
Sprint the near-term goal and how we're
going to win it
the product owner is looking at a chain
of technical enablers if we can
accomplish this this spread that might
allow this emerging possibility if we
can do that that might allow this
emerging possibility and this way the
product backlog tends to be enabling
technology readiness stacks they have
complete responsibility through trust
and they're the only one interruptible
on the scrum team scrum is an object
oriented architecture the input is
conversations to the product owner to
prioritize the product backlog the
output is the potentially shippable
product increment at sprint demo if any
team breaks that we can't scale it it's
like trying to write that fractal with a
different object at each level it's got
to be the same or it can't scale past a
certain level if we have to add any
additional overhead to scale
now there's an upper ceiling right
that's how fractals would work so the
object oriented architecture does need
to be consistent level to level if it's
going to scale to any other any level
they would call that linear scaling if
we have five scrum teams the product
owners meet for 15 minutes every day and
what do we call the scrum event when we
look at the product backlog and we
prioritize it split big things into
little things what do we call that event
sometimes it's called an activity
refinement so the the product owners are
going to refine the parent backlog that
all the teams pull from if the teams
don't work on similar stuff you don't
need to run this meeting that would be
unnecessary overhead we treat them as if
they're a separate company and we make
their financials visible so we can
invest in them and help remove their
impediments but if the teams work on
similar work the product owners refined
together for 15 minutes every day before
their own team's refinement they repeat
sprint planning they pull from the
parent backlog to their teams in scrum
at scale there are no additional events
or rolls
there's product owners there's scrum
masters their development team members
they run the same five events at the end
of the Sprint the product owners repeat
demo they integrate their products if
they integrate right they integrate
their products and they have a scaled
demo of the integrated product one of
them plays the role of chief product
owner it's not a different skill set
it's not a different salary one of the
product owners plays it and they usually
rotate who it is once a sprint or on a
regular cadence it's their job merely to
help prioritize during these group
refinement meetings and to determine if
the integrated product meets the scaled
definition of done what if we have 25
teams same thing 15 minute meeting once
a day with all the product owners what
if we have more than that what if it's
really big
here's 125 people scaled I'd like to
point out it's still true the last
meeting of the day happens in front of
the most senior team in the company
running scrum this is typically the CEO
and members of the board and other cxos
if the whole company is scrum they're
prioritizing the mission and goals for
the company here's 250 people
here's Saab defense 4096 people in one
hour they build jets not just the
software on the jet the whole jet the
structures the composites the supply
chain they incorporate an engine from GE
the weapons platforms the whole thing at
7:30 their teams have daily scrum
everyone in the company at 7:45 they
have scrum of scrums at 8 o'clock they
have scrum scrum scrum
8:15 they have scrubbers chromis chromis
crumbs and at 8:35 scrum masters and
five product owners meet in front of the
executives of saab defense they say here
are the impediments that we couldn't
solve ourselves today and here's the
areas where we need prioritization
decisions and the executives we call it
the executive Mehta scrum for
prioritization and the executive action
team for moving impediments sometimes
that's the same team sometimes it's two
teams we've seen it run both ways they
both work and they're just scrum teams
here's a scrum room at Saab Aeronautics
Saab defense you can see the stations of
all the people working around the plane
the scrum team they're doing 3d part
modeling hardware is just software
anyway we do it on computer design the
parts we stress test it on the computer
we simulate the heat flow electricity
flow flow around the part on the
computer and then we build it and we
install it there also writing software
and you can see there scrum boards
around the room if you liked planes
would this be an exciting place to work
yeah they're the number two place to
work in all of Sweden where they're
based for graduating engineers number
one is Google they're number two they
say they have an overtime problem they
can't keep their people from working
overtime they keep saying can I please
work just four hours on Saturday these
people like planes and they get to
directly try parts on planes and fly
them they have eight pilots available to
all the scrum teams at all times and
they fly at every sprint demo or every
one that I saw when I visited them
here's 3m H is this is a 10 billion
dollar division of 3m this is their
actual company each gray Pentagon is a
scrum team each red Pentagon is a scrum
of scrums they're just escalating
impediments they couldn't solve
themselves and making visible their
mission and goal each gold or orange
Pentagon that's product owners meeting
the product owners and scrum masters
meet for 15 minutes every day that's the
whole thing it took this company 18
months to get here the fastest
transformation I've ever seen was a
company of 1,500 people and they were
all scrum in five days that's radically
fast the truth for your company if this
is something you want to do is probably
somewhere in between five days and
eighteen months have any of us seen or
heard of Tesla's solar roof the tesla
solar few hands few hands okay
Elon Musk said more of the world needs
to be using renewable energy wouldn't
that be fantastic
I believe the problem is some people
many people don't want to in his words
both a fishtank to their roof he said
how can we make a beautiful elegant he
thought this would be beautiful and
elegant I agree solar roof they
contacted 3m and said your phone screens
and laptop screens if you look at them
from a side angle they're black because
they have channels of ink in them if you
look at them straight on you see right
through what if we use the protective
film that uses the final layer on laptop
screens and phones on solar tiles but
the solar tiles directly on the roof and
from an angle they look like any color
we want but from the sun's angle they're
perfectly transparent what if we did
that 3m exact said that would be
interesting Tesla said great we'll
install them on three houses in five
weeks please invent the new technology
and deliver it in bulk here's their
product demo
if your user story was comparing the
durability of a Tesla solar roof tile to
traditional roof products is this a
relatively clear or informative demo
yeah how long was your last demo that
was 11 seconds
that's an excellent demo in subscribe
and hardware whatever the current user
story or however you word your backlog
many teams do use user stories and
hardware - as my experience but they
don't have - of course their demos are
very short and that makes them
repeatable and viral they had five weeks
to roof three real houses with a new
product created and installed some of us
can't build software in five weeks and
these people are working with production
plants suppliers making new adhesive
combinations deploying them in bulk
working with roofers and they knew when
they displayed the product Tesla doesn't
use patents they just put it all into
the public domain but 3m does they said
if we want to protect our intellectual
property we have to do it before this
demo on these three houses otherwise
it's visible that none of the patent
attorneys inside the company can work in
less than a five week cycle before at
this time so they brought in a patent
attorney to join in the scrum team so
the scrum team now had another member
member they hired in a patent attorney
so they also filed seven patents in five
weeks
again Tesla doesn't even use patents but
3m does I hope what I'm making visible
is that scrum is possible in hardware
and even scrum of scrums and Mehta scrum
and it scales linearly as the target
that's exactly what we're seeing here's
how a company like 3m gets started this
is 12 teams launching and they have the
three roles of scrum the five events of
scrum the three outputs of scrum and
they ask the teams to rate themselves
how well do you think your scrum is
going and they do this before every meta
scrum this lets the company see which
teams are scrum yet because they say if
a team doesn't have a circle great no
issues on all of the eleven rules of
scrum they don't have scrum yet this is
they gauge how much scrum is across the
company more importantly any company any
team member because this is
self-reported can flag any of these
items to say they need help this is how
3m corporate knows where to send coaches
oh you don't even have a product owner
we need to fix that no wonder you don't
have a product backlog and the team's
thrashing right so they can see it it's
now visible after the team's self report
they have all eleven rules of scrum as
phrased in the scrum guide they then
start working the scrum patterns these
are available on scrum PL o P org scrum
pattern language of performance org and
they work them just like software teams
had but in Hardware I'd like to take us
mentally over to a posh district in
London Chelsea many of us have heard
about it many of us have seen movies and
TV shows taking place there and a
extremely tasty restaurant there I just
had the luxury of eating this weekend
it's an Italian restaurant a Tuscan
Italian restaurant and they make a
wicked espresso martini and it's run
with scrum may I introduce the owner of
Ricardo's London restaurant run with
scrum please welcome Riccardo Muti
when I was starting with scrum I read
books and listen to lots of first
webinars and I had real problems sort of
finding real-world examples of how
people were using scrum and so I hope
I'll be able to give you a few sort of
alternative uses that might sort of
spark your imagination maybe come up
with some new ideas on how you might use
it so what what happened was at the very
beginning I had a recruitment problem
and sorry by the way that first my
restaurant I had a recruitment problem I
have four people leave the restaurant
very quickly just before the summer and
we had two students had finished their
studies they were meant to be staying
through the through the whole summer one
of them got invited actually to Berlin
strangely and the other one
advisor to Barcelona and they were just
gone within a week one person whose
parent had died and she left within a
day and then somebody else left just
because they wanted to go somewhere else
and in my team front of house team was
only eight people and so half of them
gone and so I immediately my strategy
for that was always going to lock myself
in my office at home and try to get some
new team members and what happened was
that the people back at the restaurant
didn't think anything was being done
I was working every day or all hours of
the day trying to get interviewing
people there weren't that many people
coming to London at the time because it
was the beginning of the summer and you
know they go off on holiday they're not
looking for new jobs and so I remembered
Jeff Sutherland saying that he had that
really making things visible was
probably the most important thing you
could do in scrum you know as far as
some just getting things out there that
everybody could see and I also remember
one of my first teachers when I did my
scrum master course was Henrik Nyberg
and he had a great slide about a
recruitment company and it kind of
sparked me to come up with with this
slide here so I put this board up in the
restaurant one day and I just started
populating it with all the different
applicants and so you see two phone
coming for interview coming for trial
shift and new starters and when people
were coming through I'd start putting
their their their details up on on on
the board now of course because you only
have certain amount of hours in every
day and so I had a situation where I'd
often be in interviews or I'd be in
another business meeting but people
would be coming in they'd be phoning
they'd be answering our our adverts we
were doing quite a lot of advertising on
Google and and so my secretary or myself
will come in and actually just put the
details of the people here and what I
noticed that the team started saying
hold on a second you've got this big
sort of bottleneck of people coming in
but they're not being seen I said well I
just haven't got enough time to phone
these people and so they says I can't
can we phone them for you can we get
involved in the in the recruitment
process and and for where I'd come
through that that had never happened
before you know is this kind of me I'd
put somebody say I think you get on with
these people and and always try and get
someone I thought would be a sort of
natural fit with the team but now you
had the team sort of putting their hands
up and really helping out and so we just
kind of visited this board every single
day for several weeks and we came up
with a lot of good ideas as well on how
to recruit new team members and where to
get them from and different alternatives
that the team had and within a very
short period of time we had all four
people we recruited in fact we had six
new applicants we started five of them
and I only pick one of them so the the
others were all picked by the team and
actually that was much better because I
think they picked people who were a
natural fit already so that was just
that was really eye-opening for me it's
just a simple thing just getting getting
the getting something up there that
people can see and that morale really
came up and we sort of started gelling
much more as a team I was talking to
Jeff Sutherland about frameworks and I
say you know I've got a real thing I
know scrums a framework and I kind of
understand how it fits around software
but I've never worked in the software
business but I how can I create a
framework for the restaurant and he just
turned around and said what you need is
a really simple set of rules that can
allow you if I've written exactly simple
set of rules that can generate a
customer experience that blows them away
but with half the people on your team
yeah and you want to be increasing the
quality and the speed quality of food
and service and and the speed that
everyone gets done he said you really
can get twice the work in half the time
I've seen it in other arenas and I
believe you can do it in a restaurant so
very inspired by that he kept talking
about this sort of swarming swarming
idea about sort of getting people
swarming and so I remember when Jeff
does his training he had this all black
TACA he used to play to this is that
sort of war dance they do before the All
Blacks matches and he used to play that
to his first scrum team first scrum team
ever I think it was every single day and
he'd say how can we become more like
this you know how can we become more
focus how can we become more aggressive
at getting that ball across the line you
know more as a team rather this whole
individual effort but you know I my team
members are under 30 is 85% of them are
girls of young ladies women and they
didn't we tried it once or twice but
they didn't really gel with this whole
rugby thing and and you know they kind
of look at music yeah we kind of get it
but you know it's all these guys running
around and they don't like it so I
thought of something else and I came up
with this which I thought was fun and so
I played this every day and we still
play it at every stage and I'm asking
the guys how do we become more like this
I'm also asking them where does the
manager here telling you what to do you
know that was under two seconds we have
some amazing conversations at the end of
it there's a particularly good part at
the end of this year where it kind of
captures the essence of what we're
always trying to get a restaurant which
is nice right here these guys yeah you
know we did it we got it right you know
when and that really is sometimes you
know even just as a simplest thing you
know when when we have a big party 20
people and you need to clear a table and
everybody swarms around like that they
just drop what they're doing so excuse
me madam they go straight over to the
table and they all help out they kind of
get that feeling and you can't really
get that feeling of this kind of coming
together nurse yeah and we do all our
daily meetings by the way we do we use
zoom conference calls anyone can dial in
and see what's going on so and that's
really help that you they kind of got it
and again we have a group what's
happened everybody gets told when when
the zoom meetings on and they just come
in sometimes at home let's just sit in
bed watching the thing and it's quite
funny
so scrum talks about self-organizing
teams and I know Joe has really came for
me to come up with this so I was lucky
that my manager left about two weeks
before I implemented scrum and she said
I want to go and work in a real
hierarchical company I'm a manager now
but I don't even know how well I'm doing
apart from you're the only person who
tells me I'm doing a great job but I
don't know I want to go work with the
general manager above me in a place with
multiple units and so on and she kind of
like she'd had the scrum book and I
think she knew what was coming so she
left and and so I said to the team I
said guys you know you've got a great
opportunity now do you want another
manager because Jeff Sutherland told me
that when you've got to work with
scrumming nobody ever tells you what to
do and I think that's a great idea for
us we could tell you what needs to be
done but we're nobody ever going to tell
you what to do do you want to be like
that and they were like yeah let's say
whoa Kay well one of the biggest
problems and areas that managers always
dealt with is the daily rotary you know
the scheduling of the team for the whole
week and so I said to the guys you know
would you like to do that so they said
sure so we got a together so we've put
all of the job functions down here so
since you know doing the bar doing the
door home delivery doing a runner and
then these are the days lunch dinner
lunch dinner right the way through the
week and then we just put a tick next to
each place where we knew we had a
requirement that needed to be covered
and then the team members just if like
this young lady there she works six or
seven shifts a week so she had six or
seven post-its and then they would just
line up one of them would take the first
thing and he'd take the first first
shift of their choice and they would
just rotate round until the thing was
full and traditionally this used to take
about six to eight hours for a manager
to do for one week's worth of rotor and
they were always trying to speak to
everybody and who can do what and this
person's got to go to the dentist and so
on and so forth we did four weeks in one
hour and it was a that was a really very
excite really exciting
you know for the team and for them to
see that as well so the next thing which
was really good fun was then we I said
to the guys guys you can have any days
off you want you can have as much
holiday as you want the only thing is
you've got to make sure that whoever
you've got to organize the person to
change with you so if once we've done
the full weeks ahead you've got to find
somebody from the team that can cover
you and they've got to have the same job
they got to be able to do the job so if
you're a bomb and they've got to be able
to do the bar if you're on home delivery
they've got to be able to do the home
delivery so suddenly was before we don't
had everyone really protective over
their jobs now they wanted to to train
everybody in their position and and it
was like magic you know now it was like
that had been sort of two or three items
down on my backlog you know I was
thinking yeah how am I gonna do that I'm
gonna get everyone trained but they
started kind of saying oh yeah I've got
so really I had everybody coming to me
and say could you put that person on for
an extra shift next week I know but I'm
going on holiday and I want to make sure
everybody on the team knows how to do
this so if anybody's off then and and
what then happened was a couple of times
if we were either shorter we decided to
be sure you might have a barman now
running out to take an order on the
table and then somebody needs a drink so
that waiter would just run back behind
the bar and help themselves to the drink
and then take it out and serve it so you
kind of really got this amazing flow
going around there's not just one person
sitting there polishing glasses while
everybody else is working which you get
a lot there and and and I think they're
much happier these guys you know the
teamwork were really really happy at the
end at the end of that how am i doing
for time by the way four minutes for me
have you want to yeah sure so I had told
that the team look all the hierarchies
gone here I'm I might be the owner but
I'm to member exactly the same as you I
know there are three roles in scrum but
we only have one role at the time and it
was just team member you know that's it
and now we're implementing the things
that are slightly more structured way
but you know
I got I got it here ah yeah so if they
had somebody they had to kind of if they
had a problem with the team member they
had to go in and they had to retrain
that too you remember they were in
charge of who was going to stay and who
was not going to stay and couldn't come
to me and say I've got a problem with
this person you know so they had to
start training each other up anyway
we're doing really well I have a chat
with Henrik Nyberg and he says look
after the euphoria of scrum wears off
you're going to come up with some really
deep issues and people are going to come
in and so on and what I realized is that
when the managers not there anymore
people are not scared to speak up so we
really encourage them to do that and so
I'm telling everybody it's got to be a
fair system for all a fair system for
all the fair system for all and a girl
called Lucy who from Denmark and she put
her hand up one day and said sorry but
it's not fair system here so why is she
a bitch because every time we're doing a
rota
you will defer to this other girl who
was a sort of a system manager stroke
manager before called posh and she's got
a child and you let her come in late and
leave early I have to come in early and
leave late every day that I'm working
I'm closing four times a week and she
never closes and she and this whole
thing erupting and everybody just went
mad and they were trying to kill each
other so we can't work for this really
sort of superficial happiness to the
issues coming up but and then you know
Henrique had said you just need to be a
really good scrum master at that time
you just need to just just facilitate
everything and keep everything together
but let the team sort it out so we had a
lot of tears and a lot of sort of
threats to shut the restaurant down and
a wrist half if necessary but you guys
got to sort this out and two weeks later
they did and I really really did I mean
they did these are the two people here
who had been killing each other and and
this was taken about ten days two weeks
after that so you know they they they
did very well
yeah but the only thing is the only
thing I'd say is that we've had to now
say that I think one of the biggest
problems in a restaurant business is a
lot of backstabbing people talk about
each other so we've introduced right now
I've introduced a general amnesty so at
the end of every week you have until
Sunday night to talk up and if you don't
you you can no longer discuss anything
to happen before that and we're done
it's still early day so I'll let you
know if I ever see you again
and and and anybody comes you know we
want this to be a scrum restaurant so if
anybody wants to come to the restaurant
you come and eat with me as my guest and
scrum people you you you know we've just
talked about it I'd love you to see the
teams and come round and come to any of
our daily stand-ups and so on it would
be a real pleasure to have you then sort
of show you how we do it in other places
thank you interesting to see it used
outside software for some of us I kind
of love it
the idea of teams of teams is if you
give everyone all the information and
then give them independent authority to
make their own decisions so they don't
have to wait on central decision-making
authority we get to have access to small
windows of opportunity well let's talk
about a window of opportunity spacex all
the must companies Elon doesn't say
we're gonna ship on this date or we're
gonna die trying he says here's the
trend line we're trending to build this
many model three cars by this date and
then he lists the impediments investors
if I had more vertical integration we
would have less risk when there's with
global transportation supply chains it's
all scrum SpaceX has Elon Musk desk in
the middle of SpaceX
the way I should say SpaceX is doing
half of all rocket launches in 2018 half
of all of them there are 60 scheduled
rocket launches in 2018
SpaceX is doing 30 of them that company
was founded in 2012 and they're doing
more than any country more than any
government more than any multi country
group so they've figured something out
that's disruption here's here's how it
runs
Elon Musk has a desk in the center of
SpaceX office it's not a cube there's no
walls there's no glass office it's just
an open desk like all of them on one
side of his desk there's a photograph of
the surface of Mars
on the other side of his desk there's a
photograph of the surface of Mars that's
been retouched by an artist
to show what Mars could look like if it
were terraformed to support human life
the epic at the top of the backlog for
SpaceX is as a human I have a colony of
more than 1 million humans on Mars so
that in the event of a catastrophe on
earth there's a backup of the human
species pretty big goal right I don't
think they can get it done in one sprint
so like any product owner it's been
chunked and each chunk funds the next
chunk the first chunk which has many
smaller pieces the first chunk is create
a profitable business launching small
satellites into space that's done that
then funds the next chunk create a
profitable business
launching large satellites into space
the first launch of the Falcon Heavy is
currently trended to be in December that
can launch a satellite the size of an
Airbus full of people in cargo into
orbit it's huge and they have chunked
missions each after that each paying for
the next here's what scrum looks like in
hardware here's the scrum team they have
their product backlog here there's Tim
Meyer here the Creator essentially of
test-driven development and hardware and
they have their engine
hearing benches I'd like to point out
hardware development looks a whole lot
like software development honestly
people that are doing electronics it's
mostly 2d and 3d CAD files of circuit
boards and then they simulate flows
through them some of them using modern
test tools connected into Jenkins and
gherkin using Fitness it's so much of
its the same if it's Hardware parts
these people are also doing the
enclosures still it's CAD 3d modeling
but these people are also machining
parts they have pic in play CNC machines
reflow ovens test benches because
actually building Hardware here but it
looks pretty familiar doesn't it okay
thank you wait a minute what does your
scrum room look like yeah
pretty similar I'd like to show you what
it looks like here oh pardon me what it
looks like for a company to get started
I own a car company right we build cars
with scrum we have the record of new
time to market from idea to on sale we
do it in one week
Toyota's number two right now at 26
months I'd like to show you how
companies get started with this method
and I think the laptop might need a
little bit more volume some Silicon
Valley engineers who work on top-secret
military space systems got to test their
problem-solving skills today Lockheed
Martin challenged them to a down to
earth project building a car in just one
day ABC 7 News business and technology
reporter David lui is live in Sunnyvale
David did they make their deadline they
did make their deadline precisely 9
hours later no engineers are always fond
of saying they're up for a good
challenge and though the executives here
at Lockheed Martin decided it might be
good to help them push their thinking
through think outside the box and they
found the perfect vehicle to do it this
car lifting off a tarp isn't quite as
dramatic as a spacecraft liftoff which
is a routine part of their work but
these engineers couldn't be happier
about how this day-long project ended my
name is Amanda foo and I'm a rocket
design manager here at Lockheed Martin
and what do you know about building a
car veera that's how these 200 engineers
started out their day their goal to
build a car rated to go 100 miles per
gallon it was a team-building exercise
by Lockheed Martin to aspire its
engineer
to rev up their creative juices and to
get them to be better problem solvers it
means that failure is not an option they
have to very quickly pick up the task
find their way through it make sure
they're doing it correctly the first
time because there's really no time to
cycle back through it and even in the
normal products we build that take much
longer that's still a truism that they
have to live with this wasn't designed
to be a simple assembly process curves
were thrown in to create challenges we
have about four inches of error in the
drive assembly so we have to adjust
where the tires are just where the wheel
assemblies are and adjust alternately
where the engine is
easier than the body the car itself as a
prototype created by wikispeed an
organization working toward a highly
efficient commuter car a buyer has paid
$25,000 to take this team assembled
vehicle home and by working all day as a
team Lockheed Martin employees hope to
walk away with new skills to use in
their daily work my group does a lot of
supply chain strategy so if we can see
how things are built see what the parts
do that that are that our group is
buying it really helps us understand
what you know how we contribute to the
organization in Sunnyvale David Louie
ABC 7 News to build these things we need
full stack teams right otherwise we'd
have handoffs and handoffs and handoffs
here's our full stack people that can
design build test deploy aluminum on
road-legal cars hydraulics brake lines
high-pressure fuel lines coolant lines
composites arduino that's our
electronics programming system we can
fire an airbag with it we can set a
cruise control with it we can run an
engine or an electric motor with it and
certified scrum professionals they wield
the material of making teams and the
goal is for everyone to have all of
these stripes we call them black belts
full-stack hardware developers folks
Tesla has automated this
they've made a hardware compiler
whatever they design in 3d CAD it builds
the next one Chevrolet announced they
were closing the Corvette assembly plant
part of it for 18 months while they
retooled for the next Corvette imagine
if your build server were down for 18
months between compiles that's
traditional manufacturing I think you
can see the cost of delay Tesla's made a
hardware compiler it'll build the next
one just as well as it'll build the
current one now it's all speed of
innovation well now it's all scrum and
end folks thank you very much I have two
questions maybe we have two minutes for
two questions one for Ricardo did your
restaurant have a product owner and
what's was there that's interesting
question yes yes I was a product owner
to start with but now and we just spent
three days at Bosch and we just kind of
brainstorming the whole idea cuz oh I
didn't say to think the kitchen I've
actually asked now because I only did
that front of house the kitchen I've
asked could they become a a scrum team
so we're going to start that as soon as
I get back and the chef will be a
product owner so you know he'll be the
one for his area and each team will have
their own product owner so taking it one
step further yeah yeah good and a
question for you Joe I'm head scrum at
scale to be introduced by top management
took down or can it emerge from the
bottom both but if they don't meet gosh
how can I say when what I what I think
I'm learning and folks if you have
better case studies from your companies
please share Joe at scrumming comm what
I think I'm seeing is if teams start
scrum but top management still requires
a phase gate delivery and a lot of these
companies especially the hardware
companies that's normal well they can be
undercover right but all they can do is
meet their next phase gate faster and
that doesn't give disruptive performance
that won't give us twice the work in
half the time
because we're not changing the company
structure that's why the scaled out
framework which 27% of companies with
more than one team used that's why none
of the companies using it double revenue
it doesn't change top management phase
gate delivery in fact it creates a lot
of layers in between so that you can
protect top management from scrum here
right so they they do get higher
transparency and a more regular cadence
of planning but it doesn't change the
phase gate delivery they don't get twice
the work a half the time it's still ball
the handoffs if it emerges from the
bottom that's the best you can do so you
I think you either hide it and you meet
the phase gate faster a little earlier
but not twice as fast because you're
still only meeting the gate
you can't inspect and adapt the whole
cycle if you discover a problem at the
end you still have to restart the whole
cycle so how agile is that right in
order to have any organizational change
that is the entire organization the
entire organization has to do it right I
don't mean to be too obtuse but yeah
it's very quick and easy if the policy
of the company changes whether that's
lobbied from the bottom up where it's
mandated from the top down or hopefully
the most mature way it's discussed with
both wouldn't that be fantastic and
novel right if they actually respected
each other and said well how would we
like to wield the company together but
if the company policy is changed then no
one's undercover and there's no process
to be defying or breaking you simply
take the 14 page scrum guide you put it
on the company share and you get in get
it endorsed by yes this is also okay to
use I think then it's allowed instead of
phase gate delivery well then you can
have refactoring at any stage and you
can collapse the phase gates I mean
that'd be real lean right that'd be an
actual Kaizen event which is why scrum
ain't works with Toyota so much the
people who invented Kaizen culture the
people who invented lean the Toyota
Production system are now deploying
scrum across the business as for that
reason a more regular cadence of scrum
events and any team being able to not
just work in their given phase but work
across the value stream so I think it
does have to ultimately involve everyone
if you want it to actually scale but it
can start either places
far as I know did that answer the
question oh okay maybe um I should say
there's a free book if you want it Paulo
say hello Simon celli in Italy has
published through lean pub a book of
scrum hardware you can learn more about
scrum at scale at screaming calm if you
want to you can download the free copy
of scrum hardware this is only if you've
been in a presentation with Paulo or
myself so I don't think everyone the
world has it but here you use the code
and the case studies that I've shown are
in the book scrum the art of doing twice
working half the time this is what the
German cover looks like okay I have
phoned them last request for you as a
team please review this talk and provide
Joe and Ricardo his feedback via the app
and trade the talk and give some
comments so that they can improve their
own work thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
