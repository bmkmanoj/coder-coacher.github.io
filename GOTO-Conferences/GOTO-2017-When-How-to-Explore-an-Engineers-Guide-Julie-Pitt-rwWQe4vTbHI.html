name
everybody all right nice to meet you now
we can chat so I've noticed that there's
a bit of a theme running through this
conference over the last couple days
David talked about the fixed idea and
how ideas can get in the way of new
ideas and then this morning Brian
brought up an interesting point about
debugging and how debugging is actually
the process of better understanding your
system forming hypotheses and testing
them so I'm going to be expanding on
that theme quite a bit and then later
Phil talked about developers as
researchers so I didn't actually think
of this in terms of research but I think
that these themes kind of mesh pretty
well so I've been a software engineer
for about 15 years and over the past
decade and a half I've come to rely more
and more on my past experience to guide
my choices so if I'm coming up on a new
project and I need to pick a programming
language I'm not going to go oh let me
see a survey ten languages that have
come out recently and see which one to
pick no I'm going to go
I know Scala I know it works so I'm
going to go with that but there's the
tension here which is that we live in a
very or we're working in a very
fast-moving environment and I actually
became fascinated with Scala about 10
years ago
and at the time it seemed really
frivolous and kind of you know
self-indulgent to get into it I was
really attracted to the functional
paradigm but I'm really glad that I did
because it did become mainstream and the
functional paradigm actually helped
shape
the way that I think about code and
programming so today I'm going to tell
you the story of a classic dilemma that
we all face and that's the trade-off
between exploration and exploitation and
this trade-off was made in a real sense
at my company so I'm going to get into
that story but first I want to remind
you please give me a rating I thank you
all for coming at this late hour so
would appreciate your feedback to see
whether it was worth paying for
so I'm going to start at the beginning
that's the founding of my company we
started in 2014 and we are called
order of magnitude lab so the founding
team was myself Greg or Zell and
Christian Kaiser and we knew each other
because we had worked at Netflix back in
the early days when Netflix was a DVD
business and streaming was a hypothesis
and we liked working together enough but
after splitting ways for several years
we got back and did another startup
together but we got to talking and
realize you know we can break off on our
own let's let's try this well the first
thing we had to do was figure out what
what space we were going to be working
in and it didn't take long until we
keyed into how much is going on in the
AI space ai is a big field right what do
I even mean by that well we were
fascinated by kind of this sub-problem I
don't know that it has a name but I'm
going to call it intelligent machines
and what I mean by that is machines or
agents that learn not from being
force-fed huge piles of data but that
learn through experience and interacting
with the world and through that our
hypothesis is that they would learn to
perform a multitude of tasks
common-sense tasks like communication
locomotion foraging so interestingly
enough one of the unsolved
problems in the space is actually
exploration there's not a real good
answer yet how to get machines to
explore and so hopefully if we can peel
back the layers understand how we
explore we'll be better able to build
machines that can do the same thing so
we started out with a business
hypothesis after kind of a brief survey
of the landscape we have this hypothesis
that the basic building blocks were out
there to build these intelligent
machines and so all we needed to do was
apply our engineering background to this
problem and we knew how to scale things
so that was good and then amazing things
were going to happen on the other end so
we set to work with prototyping and we
chose Scala IRA I listed all of these
wonderful reasons why Scala is great but
going back to what I said earlier the
real reason was we used it and it worked
so we built several prototypes in
parallel and my first one that I was
most excited about was this idea that
you know we're building a neural network
and neurons communicate through messages
and they have state and I have used echo
before which is an actor system for
Scala and so I thought what better
paradigm because we're trying to scale
this right so I built it tried it out
and it didn't really work it really
didn't work and so after examining why
what I realized was I didn't really
understand the domain that I was working
in I understood the technology and that
distracted me from getting into the
domain so even though I knew I could do
all these wonderful things what I needed
to do is slow down so just because you
can do something doesn't mean you should
in other words when you're entering in a
new space cultivate a beginner's mindset
even if you have familiarity with some
aspect of it
okay so we went on to prototype number
two and this prototype was incredibly
simple a whole bunch of case classes if
you're familiar with Scala it's just
these immutable classes with some pure
functions attached to it I ended up
presenting this version of this
prototype back at Scala days in 2015 so
follow that link up there in case you're
interested side note a little
little-known fact I didn't randomly pull
this image off of Google Image Search
this was actually my spouse here messing
around with on his son's bikes back when
he was little
anyway so we built that prototype and
that kind of worked but it didn't really
work and since we had thought more about
the domain it started to dawn on us that
there is a disconnect between our
business hypothesis and the reality we
thought that we had kind of this meet
journey of climbing this hill we knew
how to climb hills were engineers but
the reality turned out to be that we
needed to survey a landscape and
determine well which mountain or
mountains should we try climbing to even
figure this out so we're kind of at a
crossroads and we have to decide at this
point you know this isn't what we
originally thought so should we do it or
go do something else so Gregg one of the
original founders said it was a very
sensible guy and he said you know I
didn't sign up for this so he ended up
doing something else Christian on the
other hand was really enthused about
this problem and thought I'm not ready
to give up yet let's give it another
shot so I had to think about this aside
from being just really passionate about
solving this problem despite not knowing
a lot and just wanting to see it solved
and the value that that could create I
also had a personal endeavor in mind and
that is as a child I was more like the
kid on the right
I was very just artistic and creative
and some point along the way I
discovered math and computer science and
I loved those disciplines
I loved the orderliness of it I can
understand it and so I became more and
more like the kid on the right so I knew
that somewhere buried was this artistic
person but I felt like that person had
been neglected I thought okay what
better way to get back in touch than to
try something kind of crazy okay so
little did I know that what I was doing
was evaluating this amazing formula that
we believe all of us must optimize in
order to choose a course of action so
formally this formula is known as
negative expected free energy and it was
formulated by professor Karl Christian
but don't worry about that fancy title
and don't worry about these symbols the
big point about this value function is
that it includes two terms it includes
exploitation which is the value that you
get out of performing a course of action
that you already have modeled that
you've already mapped out versus the
value you get from the information you
might gain through exploration so let me
just put it into more of a schematic
form and this might illustrate why
exploration is so hard as we get older
at the end of the day the more
experience you have the more
sophisticated your model of the world is
and the easier it is to predict some
course of action that will reliably
reach the goal that you're after so if
you know something that works why would
you try these some other things that may
or may not work so how do we flip the
teeter-totter the other way well we have
to convince ourselves that the knowledge
that we would gain through this
exploration
is going to lead to better and better
outcomes in the future it's intangible
we can't really quantify that other than
kind of recalling other experiences
we've had where we explored and actually
gained something so I decided to do this
but it wasn't as easy as I thought I had
to shift my mindset to explore so here's
where I was starting from this is this
is kind of my view of the world at that
time which is that no problem is
unsolvable without with with without
with whenever you apply engineering best
practices right you're on this side
everything's going wrong
the engineering best practices build a
lovely bridge across this lava pit and
everything is great right which I
thought okay I can engineer my way
through this problem and I kept doing
that and it really didn't work took me
an embarrassingly long time to realize
what I was really optimizing for with
those engineering best practices it's
all about building to a spec yes the
spec changes we know that but at least
there is one I was optimizing for
shipping code and operating you know a
server farm let's say minimizing tech
debt but in reality in this space that
we were exploring these things were not
terribly important as kind of first
class goals so here's what I should have
optimized for should have optimized for
formulating hypotheses testing them and
then rejecting the ones that didn't work
out so I had to learn a few lessons
about how to best go about that in a
software setting I mean the first thing
that was really jarring for me was that
facts can change and yes I kind of knew
that at some intellectual level but this
was really driving at home the other
thing is you're working
in a laboratory not a factory and you
have to think about how to outfit your
labs near laboratory and then the third
thing is how do we communicate and work
together as a team
to push this process forward so let's
get into each one of these as far as
facts go I remember many occasions you
know Kristen and I would be having some
kind of very animated discussion about
some technical aspect of our algorithm
and we would end up deciding based on
our chain of reasoning X must be true
and then the next day we'd come in and
Christian would say hey y must be true
except Y directly contradicted X and
that really threw me for a loop so like
what well but but we just said X was
true okay so I didn't realize that I was
making the subconscious assumption that
X was some kind of a spec what it really
was was our best hypothesis at the time
so I recently came across this really
fascinating book called the half-life of
facts and it really underscores this
idea from science that we're not living
that the science is not itself
necessarily arriving at the truth at
anytime it's approaching the truth and
so we want science to build us better
and better models that more accurately
predict the world so will the fallout
from that though is if we're currently
we're always improving the model
something we used to think was true is
no longer true so fact change over time
the summary of that idea is that if you
want to grab hold of the truth you have
to let go of a lot of untruth in the
process
okay so I'm going to tell you a little
love story here this is me falling in
love with an idea that I had a
hypothesis and it was hard to say
goodbye to so we needed to build
something that would give us insight
into what our experiments were actually
doing right what does this algorithm
doing and so my hypothesis was a huff
we need this app that will present
dashboards and have real-time streaming
data coming in to them and wonderful
visualizations so I kind of built this
whole fancy thing by the way if you're
if you have any curiosity at all about
using Scala in the front end I did a
talk about this app that's called by the
bay there's a link down there but anyway
there's really nothing wrong with this
app except for the fact that where we
were at the facts were still kind of
oscillating way over here right we
didn't have a good fix on the type of
data we even needed to collect or the
type of visualizations we even needed to
build and so what it came down to was it
added a whole bunch of friction to the
process of testing our hypotheses and so
finally I admitted this was too heavy
weight and the low-tech compromise kind
of was embarrassingly obvious afterward
it ended up being well let's just put
out some HTML files and some SVG files
and link them all together and open in
the browser right you would not
recognize this in any production setting
this is not this this does the scale but
for our purposes it was great because we
could move much faster that way so again
if you have an idea you start building
on that idea the more that you've built
on top of it the harder it's going to be
to admit that you're wrong this is a
really really important point so I'm
really going to beat it to death here by
saying it in one
more way and this is really kind of in
my mind a guide to help understand when
it's time to start exploring if you need
to add complexity in order to refute
contrary evidence so you have an idea
and you need to add more and more
complicated assumptions in order to keep
down these contrary evidence to your
hypothesis that's the point at which you
want to apply Occam's razor how many of
you guys know what Occam's razor is okay
almost everybody good but it's a very
simple idea which states that if you're
choosing among a set of hypotheses to
explain some phenomenon choose the one
with the fewest assumptions and so it's
always good as an anchor point to step
back look at the hypotheses in front of
you and see whether any other ones that
are not the one you chose make more
sense so that's kind of the mindset
piece of it but you also need some
workspace and I think what it comes down
to is what kind of tools you have
available we've all heard this old
saying when the only thing you have is a
hammer everything is going to look like
a nail so I'm going to add a corollary
to that which is let's say that you add
a screwdriver to your toolbox now all of
a sudden you can tell the difference
between a nail and a screw so what that
tells me is that the tools you have in
your toolbox actually shape the way that
you see the problem so I think it's
probably easy to think about some kind
of feedback loop between the hypotheses
you have in the experiments that you run
right you might run an experiment it
gives you new information and that leads
to a new hypothesis well tools I think
are the third leg of the cycle because
the tools that you have shaped how you
see the problem and they also of course
enable
experiments so what's a good way to
think about tools I mean for us it's a
library that we share and I've come to
think of it really as an index of the
knowledge that we've acquired in our
space and once I realize that I became a
lot more comfortable with what I used to
think was dead code because in
production dead code is a huge
distraction but when it comes to
equipping your laboratory with tools
unused tools are just tools that you can
apply to some problem in the future
right that maybe you're not using them
now but it's a reminder of what you know
so the tools themselves need to be
versatile you don't want to fashion them
for a single experiment and the other
thing is don't over engineer them right
if you're really kind of in this early
stage where facts can change rapidly you
know it's okay to print to console just
to give you an example we had to we had
to create some bar charts of categorical
probability distributions and my first
instinct was oh yeah well you know put
it into some PNG or whatever use a
library but Christian was like well why
don't we just do ASCII art you know like
there's these Unicode characters that
have different heights you know filled
in boxes and we can print bar charts to
the console you know it works it works
great so we're using Scala so we have
the advantage of types right we started
out with a set of very primitive
operations because we're dealing with
math it ends up being a bag of numbers
right we've seen a lot of mathematical
libraries that kind of have this bag of
numbers approach like MATLAB or numpy
right what do these numbers even mean
and we had to interpret those and I
found it really a high cognitive load to
try and interpret what they mean so we
started adding types
that would define what types of numbers
can interact with other types of numbers
so the types kind of acted as an
instruction manual for the tools so
that's the tools but what is our
workspace look like well first
requirement is the tools need to be
within arm's reach we want to set up to
be as little as possible so we can get
right to testing and we don't want to
have a lot of distractions so depending
on you know what technology you're using
the details might be different but I
kind of think of it in terms of these
three tiers but depend on what type of
test you're running now you're trying to
just do something quick and dirty and
try something out within a couple
minutes in that case hopefully you're
using a language has a ripple available
if you are trying to do something that's
still lightweight but maybe something
you can reuse a little bit takes a
little more time hopefully your language
has scripting and then of course if
you're doing an ongoing project perhaps
even collaborative and you do want a
full-blown build system okay so what
about working on a team that also needed
a little bit of tweaking in order for us
to be most effective so getting back to
David's talk where he mentioned the
fixed idea right that that if you have
one idea it's going to get in the way of
other ideas right imagine back 150 years
we didn't know how to build flying
machines and there was a set of perhaps
equally plausible founding hypotheses on
how to go about building flying machines
so what if somebody had said look guys
let's focus our efforts and work on this
form factor and let's tweak our design
based on that I can guarantee you we
never would have come up with flying
machines so requiring
the whole team when you're this early on
to be in one code base rather than kind
of expanding the search space it's
limiting your options so in other words
that downplays the level of ambiguity
that you're dealing with it's saying
this is right and nothing else
okay so here's another side effect of
having everybody on the same code base
which is you're probably going to be
doing code reviews and if you're doing
code reviews then you're going to be
talking about code
how much whitespace should we put in
here or where should the curly braces go
or things of that nature
so the discussions are all about how
we're going to do it when the what
hasn't even been figured out so for me
not requiring the code to merge into one
branch allows our communication
bandwidth among the team to focus at the
higher level so in terms of what to
share hypotheses we should absolutely
share those among the team and the good
thing about doing that is that your
teammates want to sound smart so they
will not be able to resist the
temptation to perform on the fly thought
experiments and poke holes in your
hypotheses and the ones that end up
surviving that discussion are the most
plausible now even if you disagree with
your colleague and say no I think this
could be right that's okay too you don't
have to come to a consensus you can say
all right I'm going to go test that
myself and see if this actually will
work you should absolutely share tools
all right getting back to this idea that
your tools are this index of what you
know share that index with your
colleagues because you might see a tool
that you don't have a use for when you
share it with them they may go oh yeah
it'll solve that problem that I had and
then in terms of converging on something
that you're ultimately going to build
and put put into production you want to
share requirements as they become clear
right if you have hypotheses that you
can no longer break a despite collective
effort those start to become your
requirements and when you have enough of
those that don't completely shatter
within a few days you can probably start
putting together a project plan so I'm
going to switch gears a little bit and
talk about just the the set up that I
think is needed in order to be creative
and this is kind of inward focused so
the first observation that I want to
make is that creativity and execution
are two different modes because your
brain needs to be in conflicting and
different states in order to execute you
know follow a plan versus being creative
right one involves kind of narrowing the
options the other one involves expanding
the options I've tried to be in both at
once and I still been trying I even
during this conference I thought oh I'm
going to set a few inside a few hours
and do some creative problem-solving my
mind was not in the right mode so it's a
lesson that I just need to remind myself
of over and over and over again so I
want to point out where these two modes
fit in with kind of this exploration
process that I've described both of them
are necessary throughout the process and
you're going to continually go between
them so formulating hypotheses would be
largely a creative effort whereas
testing them yes it's also creative but
it also has some aspect of execution
because perhaps I know what I'm going to
do and I'm going to write the code same
thing with building tools so it's not
strictly stuck in these categories but
you kind of get the idea
so I'm going to bet that you guys are
pretty familiar with execution mode and
maybe slightly less familiar with
creative mode so I'm going to spend the
rest of the time talking about creative
mode
so we've all heard the story probably of
Isaac Newton's sitting under the apple
tree and the Apple falls down and he
goes aha
it's gravity I mean what a wonderful
story right so what a magical moment
described by the story and similarly we
might have had experiences where our
colleagues come up with some pretty
amazing insights and you know I've had
this experience where I wonder you know
TV must have something that I don't how
are they coming up with this and why am
I not coming up with this well the
problem is the stories that we all love
keep the boring parts out so Thomas
Edison had famously said that genius is
99% perspiration 1% inspiration problem
is the red part of that circle is a
super boring story and the white part is
the magical exciting one so the good
news is it's not some special thing that
certain people have and other people
don't the thing is we need to structure
our day or our time to best do that work
that leads to creative insights so what
doesn't work first of all creativity
doesn't really like management it's hard
to put up a project plan that says hey
by the end of May we're going to have
you know solved X Y &amp;amp; Z right it doesn't
also it doesn't stick to a schedule
either you can't really force yourself
okay by Friday I'm going to have 10
creative ideas so you can't really
manufacture it but you can cultivate it
right think more like you're growing a
garden and I've kind of found that
there's a few ingredients that end up
really helping with this process I won't
say this an exhaustive list but it's
really been a big game-changer for me
so nourishment X
sighs and rest and you're probably
thinking about the body right now you
know eat well and exercise and sleep
well this isn't a health class so I'm
not really going to talk about that I'm
going to talk about how to get these
things for your mind so I think the best
way to think about it is how you
structure your time and this is kind of
a schematic of an ideal day of being
creative so I say ideal because this is
not exactly realistic to do this every
day I just want you to get a flavor for
how you might fit in these ingredients
for whatever way works for you so let me
break it down for you
the first ingredient exercise is really
the what we what we classically think
about when we think about creative
problem-solving you know you're you're
sitting there with your notebook and
you're writing down ideas or your
whatever it is so this is the time
you're actively working on the problem
and I found that the Pomodoro Technique
is a fantastic one for doing this how
many of you guys have heard of the
Pomodoro Technique ok just about
everybody how many of you use it a few
ok so hopefully this will inspire you to
use it again the features of it I mean
it's very simple right 25 minutes you
identify your problem you focus on it
five-minute break right the features of
it are that the the goals that you set
are not based on the outcomes you want
to achieve it's based on how much time
you spend and that's an incredibly
liberating concept the second one is it
gives you permission to take breaks I
don't know about you but if I'm working
on a hard problem and I haven't solved
yet solved it my first instinct is to
dig in and think really hard to solve
that problem as opposed to walking away
which is what I should
really be doing so the key thing about
the rest period is that it's long enough
you can get up stretch have your glass
of water but it's not so long that you
can get distracted by other things you
know of course the the timer helps
motivate you to avoid distraction
there's only ten minutes on the timer so
if we really need to check social media
you can do that in ten minutes and then
the other thing is it ideally sets you
up with a daily quitting time so you can
say I quit every single day which is
much more liberating than you might
imagine so the other piece of exercise
this is kind of both exercise and rest
and this is really kind of switching
modes of thinking what I described this
Appel Maduro technique is really focused
mode you're staring at an individual
blade of grass you know working out
what's going on there but what if you're
staring at the wrong blade of grass
that's when you need to pull back and
let your thoughts bounce around more
broadly because that's when you make
connections that you would never make by
thinking really hard so this this
concept comes from a pretty amazing
course that I took from Coursera it's
called learning how to learn and so the
basic idea is you want to make sure that
there are several periods in your day
where you're switching between focus and
diffuse mode so this is how I do it I
have a dog so I take them outside and
walk the dog because I work from home
some days and so that outdoor exercise
really kind of takes my thoughts into a
more expansive form and oftentimes when
I'm stuck it'll get me unstuck and if it
doesn't at least my blood pressure is
lower when I come back now we're going
to talk about rest you've all probably
heard you know sleep is important you
have to sleep for all these various
reasons so let me give you one more
reason why it's important over the
course of the day
you're accumulating stuff in your
short-term memory you're accumulating
your experiences in a very unfiltered
manner it's not exactly a videotape but
the essence of those experience hasn't
been distilled that memory that you're
building up is incredibly complex so
many things going on but what you really
want is a much simpler model insight as
you get older you kind of have an idea
of the rhythm of the days and you
remember individual days less and less
lots of result of having this simpler
model so how do we get from here to
there this process called sleep so
here's the thing about sleep though you
only do it for so many hours a day so
think about the fact that you only have
so much capacity to reduce your model
complexity that leads you to that
insight which brings me to my next topic
which is nutrition nutrition for your
mind and I found that mental nutrition
is more about what you don't put in your
mind than what you do put in your mind
all right there's all kinds of
distractions that we love to partake in
and we kind of like I often think oh
yeah I'm getting a break you know I'm
playing some stupid game on my phone or
whatever right I'm getting a mental
break but unfortunately know what what
happens is these distractions build up
in your short-term memory which then
reduces the ability for your mind to
process the complexity of the problem
you're trying to creatively solve so you
know I can't say oh don't ever you know
do anything distracting but I can't say
if it's incredibly beneficial to limit
when you do that during the day to a
very specific time so just to wrap up
kind of summarize what we talked about
in the beginning act like of the inner
so if you're coming at something
you might be an expert in one thing but
just forget that you are don't be afraid
just build the embarrassingly simple
version first you want to optimize for
hypothesis testing right when you're
getting in this exploratory mode facts
can change this always is the case we
just feel it more when we're exploring
so I mean I would hope that this would
start to seep into sort of more everyday
work and remember when you're exploring
think about how you're working in a
laboratory not necessarily a factory so
get get it well equipped and then think
about what level you want to interact
with your colleagues on keep it at the
high level at first and then lastly
creative creativity is not something we
can we can make happen but we can
cultivate it so recognize winner you're
in creative mode when are you in
execution mode and give yourself the
right conditions for creativity thinking
a big step back I'm guessing that most
of you came here because you're curious
you want to explore you want to take in
new ideas and new technologies so I hope
this talk has given you some food for
thought to take these ideas these spark
that might be there and turn them into a
raging fire of exploration so please
give me a rating and thank you for your
attention
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
