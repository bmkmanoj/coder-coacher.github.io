he asked me to do a short talk on neone
and how it fits into cloud and
infrastructure in that kind of stuff so
this is kind of ad hoc let's keep it
informal all right questions in the end
I'm David i worked for neo4j a show of
hands how many of heard of neo before
all right quite quite a few people all
right well I've been with neo for about
six years now I worked three years in
the US and now I work in the Nordics
with our customers in the Nordics but
we're global as an organization so today
how many read the the abstract for my
talk or remember this is the abstract
anyway in case you haven't seen it and I
figured we'd use that as the agenda as
well so let's start by looking at how a
graph database like neo can help right
let's take a stroll Ike this pretty
standard right you have a hierarchy
people report to each other looks pretty
easy right turns out modeling and
querying this in a relational database
is incredibly hard to the point where
actual books have been written just how
to handle a hierarchy in SQL right ok
now add on things like dotted lines and
all kinds of other facets right how do
you model this and more importantly make
sense of that data inquiry it in real
time that's where neo comes in neo is a
graph database so its database just like
MySQL or whatever but we don't have any
tables underneath it's all nodes that
are connected by a relationships like
this so this is our developer interface
super cool product show you some
visualizations this is the Eurovision 12
votes from last year pretty cool you can
see the different loyalties here with
the different countries this is just a
sample supply chain from parts all the
way over to customers this is a backhaul
network microwave links that kind of
stuff for a telecom network in a
European city
the product hierarchy for a major
retailer graphs can be anything right so
and of course these are some of the
customers we work with so the biggest
companies in the world use neo to do
cool stuff that they cannot do otherwise
in an efficient way so modern
infrastructure in the complexities I've
put together a small cartoon for you
that I hope encapsulate seeeeee what
it's like to to learn about modern
infrastructure today it's it's not as
easy as you would think right and and
there are a lot of things we need to
kind of care about today as as
developers as architects write our apps
today they need to be well 12-5 to write
they may be scalable stateless
configuration driven disposable
continuously deployed all these things
that it's it's not always easy it's the
second container picture you had one
container picture as well but I don't
know if you get this pun but I thought
it was funny so there are tools that do
this already right lots of different
tools and they all do similar things in
slightly different ways and they all
overlap like it like a Venn diagram
flower right and you always end up
tweaking them and figuring out what
should I use now okay we've used at CD
for two weeks should we switch to this
thing now because this thing does this
also but at CD also does this okay well
there are some benefits to rolling your
own solution and let's let's recall this
this scenario that occurred a few years
back with Knight Capital Group where a
deployment engineer forgot to deploy
some code an update to the eighth server
in their cluster and that ended up
basically doing some high frequency
trading in a not-so-good way such that
they lost about 10 million dollars every
minute for 45 minutes not so good so you
want to keep track of your environment
Lending Club is one of the world's
largest can peer to peer lending
companies they use neo for this right so
they have a screencap their slides right
so they have the app instances and
various services that come up they all
phone home to service that's called
MacGyver I didn't name it so don't shoot
the messenger and it stores all this in
neo and it's pretty cool right why would
you store it in neo is it really a graph
well it turns out it is right because
you have virtual services up here that
contain pools that contain virtual
servers the Maps app instances that run
on compute instances that use data
stores down to storage volumes right
turns out it is a graph and if they want
to find out for example if storage
volume 3 goes down what services are
impacted basically from here up to here
that query looks like this in neo right
in sequel that would be many many rows
and the schema would be unmaintained a
bull right it basically wouldn't work in
sequel and it wouldn't work in any other
kind of database either you do it in
memory otherwise but neo actually does
this as a database and in the end these
are some of the benefits that they saw
but I think the really most important
part is the ad hoc query capability
right so the root cause analysis
question that's one thing but they could
do all kinds of other things like
capacity analysis other things so it's
never been easier to get started looking
at your data in a different way this is
a quote from ebay they use Ernie oh and
I think when you combine the fact that
you can build something that's about a
thousand times faster in real time
runtime performance with orders of
magnitude less code then that kind of
translates to in your budget box time
box can actually deliver some stuff you
can deliver before so how do you get
started well first you go ahead and
download neo second you go to a
developer guide if you're a developer
you go here to to learn about how to
query the database get
started and then if you want you can
slack us so we have our own slack
account so you can you can join us and
talk to us there and actually out of the
fourth step here if you're looking at
any kind of commercial project do talk
to us I mean we are the experts it's the
only sane thing to do right you wouldn't
go and perform surgery on yourself right
now you would consult with an
experienced surgeon who's done this
before it's the same with graph
databases talk to somebody who's done it
before all right all right so thanks
very much and do get in touch please
everyone tweet hashtag near forge a very
much appreciated thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
