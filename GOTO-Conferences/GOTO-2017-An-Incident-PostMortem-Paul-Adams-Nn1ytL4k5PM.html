can we really describe open source
conceptually as a success probably most
of you in here have benefited from using
open source building on top of it a
couple of faces I recognize have even
built companies around it I think for
many definitions of success is very hard
to point to open source as a concept and
say it has not been a success did we
really push the button though as the
open source community have we really
taken it as far as we could have done
and more importantly should have done by
now in that sense is open source a
success I'm gonna be cheeky at this
point and posit that it's not as you're
about to find out as we go forward I
care deeply about this subject matter so
you have to accept that as someone who's
standing here saying that I don't
believe it's a success this makes me
deeply uncomfortable I have built an
entire career for myself around the
subject matter I'm hoping to be part of
the solution as my career goes forward
and I hope to take you all with me I
think there's some systemic failings
with the way we treat open source
communities we produce some amazing
software and it's not by luck
but we're producing amazing software in
some very specific domains and to put it
negatively we are not producing amazing
software in many domains and I truly
believe there's some systemic problems
for that for those of you who have never
worked in a large-scale environment for
technical systems you might never have
been through a post-mortem before so I
want to take a moment just to talk about
what a post-mortem is especially in
micro service environments they're
complex environments with different
systems talking to each other
when things go wrong it's not always
obvious why and your team's usual
retrospective is probably not the best
environment for working out what went
wrong how I went wrong how can we do
this better in future typically the best
way to do this is to have a dedicated
meeting for analyzing what went wrong
and making sure that we don't do that
again thank you very much and typically
these get called post-mortem normally
these particularly happened because
something quite dramatic happened in the
case of open source I'm not about to
suggest that something very dramatic has
just happened and we need to deal with
it in fact quite the opposite I want to
point out that I think there's been a
systematic failing that we have either
not noticed or we have turned a blind
eye to for about 35 years the good news
is for those of you who have been in
post-mortem before you know there's a
sort of industry-wide joke that it's
like you know five engineers go in and
only four come out no ones no one's
getting fired today
but I apologize in advance I
intentionally I'm gonna say some things
that if you care about open source might
make you uncomfortable
um this is by design and like I said at
the top these things make me
uncomfortable
and my hope is that if you agree with me
that these things are uncomfortable you
might also want to be part of the
solution I work for a company called
solando if you don't know what we do we
are Europe's largest e-commerce company
we're also just one of your largest tech
companies . we ship boxes of clothes we
have about 20 to 23 million customers a
year and across europe it's we're like
the go-to place where if you want to buy
some shoes or a nice dress online a
today I work in the search Department so
when you go to solando and you search
for red shoes I work for the team that
makes sure that you know you get red
shoes and not just any old red shoes but
the red shoes that you might actually
have a chance of buying on that's what I
do day-to-day open source by night
there's been an open source flavor to my
works
forever and I have been involved with
many communities I'll get back to that
in a little moment so now however let's
talk a little bit about what a retro not
a retrospective what a post-mortem looks
like because you some of you might not
have been in one I am going to start as
a you know relentless self promoter by
talking about myself a little bit
because I figure it's importantly you
know a bit about me if I'm the guy who's
about to make you very uncomfortable
then we'll talk a little bit about what
is the actual problem we're addressing
here what is this systemic failing that
I think is happening maybe you don't
agree that this is a systemic failing
maybe you do maybe you don't agree with
my wording maybe you do but at least I
want to make it clear what is the
problem that I feel we need to address
in this session once we understand what
it is I'm talking about then I'm going
to talk a little bit about the timeline
when do I think this thing started and
when did I personally become aware of it
and where are we now what's happened
since and now we're really addressing it
then we talked a little bit about what's
the impact like what because we perceive
this problem what has happened and what
actually caused it in the first place
and then to wrap up the end I'll talk a
little bit about what we've learned
along the way as part of the journey and
potentially start to talk about what so
their solutions might look like
I appreciate this track is called
solutions Friday I will warn you in
advance I'm not proposing any solutions
in this talk whatsoever but instead I
just want to make you aware of the
problem and hopefully take you along on
the journey of finding the solution so a
little bit about who this clown in front
of you is like I said I work at solando
now I've had a whole career working in
engineering leadership always with some
form of open-source context before that
as a academic at a PhD which was all
around open source I contributed my
first line of code when I was living in
Scotland at the age of 16 so more than
half of my life has been dedicated to
the subject matter and I've worked on
lots of different projects a variety of
different projects
content management desktop groupware
database I've pretty much walked all the
way up and down the stack and outside of
Technology I do evangelism work as well
so I'm a fellow of the fsfe I'm a member
of KETV which is like the steering body
for the KDE desktop and I'm a fellow of
open forum Academy which is kind of like
an industry body think-tank around open
source I say this just to remind you
that I do care so before I start
complaining and ask you to be better
I just want to admit I'm also part of
the problem and I do care about the
problem the other thing just as a
warning because as much as possible I do
want to treat this like a retrospective
so when we get to the questions at the
end I would appreciate if all of your
questions are couched in terms of we
there is no I there is no you we have
collectively failed and we collectively
should be better
yeah please right along with this so and
off of that let's get to the actual
problem open source or even free
software as I originally remember it has
been around since the 80s it's been
around for a while now we have produced
amazing software we have undeniably as a
community or as a set of communities
change the world in a positive way we're
particularly good at making tools for
engineers right you would be crazy too
if you're running your own DNS you'd be
crazy to not use bind we're really good
at building for each other the domain
where we're not so hot at is when we're
not building software for engineers I
assume as I look around the room and I
see a couple of heads nodding there's
always been this historic viewpoint that
open source always triumphs when you
have to look at it I see a few people
laughing already I fail to find this
funny this has always been true and it's
still true now there are a couple of
classic examples of where we did get it
right and everyone whenever I mentioned
this says things like you know look at
Android right the world's most
distributed operating system you can
look at a couple of other things as well
like you say like look at Drupal right
if you're trying to use a content
management system actually not as Drupal
but also Joomla plone and a few others
you'd be you'd be crazy not to use the
open source option we don't get to work
this way right you don't get to
cherry-pick the few successes and then
say there's not a problem right overall
and the volume of open source that's
produced if we stop talking if we ignore
products for engineers and just look at
everything else there's a lack or
there's enough there's enough lack of
success that we do on really should ask
ourselves is there a systemic problem
here is there something we're getting
wrong and the question that I really
want to focus down on I really want to
drill into because this is important
when we think about building products is
open source community - or I say here
unnecessarily focused on code that is
what I want to drill into because this
is what I posit is actually the
fundamental problem I'm also going to
posit the IU we'll get to it I posit
things later on so timeline now you have
an understanding of what it is I want to
talk about and what I want to drill into
um let's talk a little bit about where
this came from and we can I'm gonna
argue I'm gonna predict them something
I'm gonna say later on and predicts or
argue where I think the starting point
was and I'll talk a little bit on a
personal level about how I first
acknowledge the problem and where we are
now so
like I said back in the dawn of time
there was free software there was not
open-source as a quick aside I would
just like to throw out there if you're
still the kind of person who thinks that
open source and free software are not
one and the same thing please come to me
for reconditioning afterwards these are
different viewpoints on the same thing
right these are fundamentally still the
same thing being spoken about and back
when it was free software back in the
late 80s the definition of free software
was positive in the form of four
freedoms and the nature of those four
freedoms and how they were written is
where I'm gonna suggest this problem
started and that was back in February
1986 since then time has passed
open-source thrived we went on to
produce some truly amazing software by
now we're maybe at some kind of tipping
point I would argue by now it
open-source kind of is the default
method for developing software but only
just
if you think about how software is
actually developed in real terms I would
say the majority of it's still done
in-house proprietary and by that I mean
it's never distributed at all but
otherwise we're at this tipping point
where I would say now it is basically
the default methadone in 2015 I was
speaking on the topic of open source at
the right the docs conference in Prague
and I was talking about the involvement
of tech writers in open source and if
you ever have the misfortune to go to
youtube and see the recording of that
talk on about five minutes before the
end you will see the moment where I
realized that what I was about to say
was fundamentally wrong and I went
totally off script
I was looking people in the eyes and I
realized that what I'm about to say to
you is totally wrong now that
realization and what I was about to say
this is what I did say is not important
what is important was I realized that
something was wrong here because I made
an assumption as an engineer
about how a tech writer feels about open
source and now I mean years later a
couple years later I'm now standing here
talking to you about what I realized
then what I have heard since and what I
would like you to also and take away
this is the best example of it I have
had numerous actual conversation it is
just a tweet but I've had numerous
conversations with people Twitter
Facebook LinkedIn various platforms
about how dismissive open-source can be
of non code contributions yeah it
happens all the time and the thing I
want to really draw attention to here is
is look at what this person said they
did not name check some specific project
they levied a complaint against open
source as a whole right they did not
cherry-pick something I don't know which
individual projects they may or may not
have been a likely not been involved
with but they have levied their
complaint against open source as a whole
and again I'm seeing enough nothing
going on in the room that I suspect
there some non coders in here who have
probably been made to feel the same by
the open source community the next stage
in our evaluation of this problem is to
work out what the impact of all of this
is like what is the result of being too
focused on code rather than other things
with inside the open source world and
the first thing we would normally look
at is the customer impact known in the
world of open source that's kind of like
a foreign concept we tend to be more
focused or we should be more focused on
user than the idea of a customer that's
not to say that there of course there's
plenty of businesses that make a living
out of open source and of course they do
care about customers but at a community
level fundamentally what we care about
is users right the freedom 0 is couched
in the terms of users right you are free
to use the software for any purpose so
normally as a business if you're doing a
post-mortem you think about customers
but for today's conversation let's talk
about users
adoption of open source outside of
engineering tools is not great I've said
it before and I'm going to remind you of
this numerous times before we all leave
the room I am welcome if you want to
challenging me on this afterwards please
do but I am gonna keep telling you this
is a fundamental problem yes there are
exceptions but this is the customer
impact we make amazing tools for
engineers we have a few cases of where
we have succeeded elsewhere but in
general the elsewhere is where we truly
suck and it is systemic how do we know
that we are not succeeding in these
places is this very notion of we
inherently know that we succeed where
open-source does not get seen right we
know this it's this feeling that
everyone has sometimes people want to
talk about this is the customer impact
that no one wants to talk about business
impact is it a really foreign concept in
terms of open source community but the
question here effectively is is the
problem that we have created somehow
harming ourselves right so beyond beyond
the impact on the user what does it mean
for us here's where we get lucky I think
if you ask the average person what their
view on open source is in the grand
scheme of you know negativity to
positivity
I think people by and large see open
source is a fundamentally good thing I'm
not going to say everyone is super super
happy about it but I think by and large
people see open source as a positive
thing and certainly has the potential to
be a really positive thing so um we've
kind of struck it lucky here again I
mean if you have a different viewpoint
I'd love to hear it but I think by and
large the viewpoint of open source is
pretty good so um we've managed to get
through and again I think it's largely
because we have been doing good work we
have been producing great tools
people don't think negatively others at
least my personal viewpoint is I'm at
least willing to admit that we can do
better to give ourselves a 6 out of 10
no one really complains internally right
the the problem here is whilst we
continue to make amazing software while
we continue to make this journey toward
being the default method for developing
software we stop to have moments like
this
very infrequently we're so focused on
what we're good at and what we're
successful at largely because of a harsh
historic you know argument about why
open source or free software is better
than proprietary we're so focused on
what's we're so good at and why what we
do is so important we very rarely take
these opportunities to actually admit
what we're bad at as a result of that
when you don't do that retrospective
when you don't do that post-mortem and
are honest about it this is when you
miss out on some important fundamental
failings this is where you miss out on
your opportunity to realize you know
what I'm really not so good at that okay
so we've done a little bit explanation
of exploration of the problem looked a
little bit about what the effect of this
is let's talk now about what caused it
in many organizations the way to do your
root cause analysis is to start asking
yourself why why does this happen and
then when you have an answer to that you
ask why does that happen and so on and
so forth until you get to a point where
you're like I can't be bothered asking
why anymore
the magic number is usually five for the
sake of brevity I've got three questions
today so my starting point is why we so
unnecessarily focused on code um this is
a supremely open-ended question there
are dozens of answers to this question
everything up to and including shot up
all your wrong but I'm gonna throw out
there as one potential answers one very
specific thing
because the entire ecosystem is totally
dominated by Coda's now when you think
about how software development works in
any context yes there is always more
coders than anyone else that is
different from being dominated by coders
right there's a culturally this is what
I chose this word for a reason right yes
there are always more if you think about
the companies you work for and how many
developers do the development bit right
there are you know your team probably
has five developers for every product
specialist you have time you have five
developers for every people leader you
have five developers or six developers
for every user experience expert right
the industry as a whole is develop a
heavy necessarily actually if you look
at your organization as a whole
especially if you sell a product the
developers actually turn out to be in
the minority because for every developer
you've probably got three sales people
but inside the tech part of your
business yeah you have lots of
developers in open-source not only do
you have lots of developers but they
also dominate the ecosystem and this is
a completely different thing
how did this happen why is the ecosystem
dominated by coders again open-ended
question there's lots of answers to that
including shut up Paul you're wrong the
one I'm going to throw out here is
because we're not very good at welcoming
anyone else coders come coders code come
come to your coding thing
please welcome how it even go as far to
say as we're actually pretty good at
being somewhat diverse on the coding
scale we have an undeniable problem with
recruiting women we have an undeniable
problem recruiting people of color in
fact if you're not a white beardy fat
man right you're not part of the cool
Club at least open-source is pretty good
at diversity in terms of skill level
it's always been very good at bringing
junior people in and giving them
experience so it's not like it's an
entire
you know it's not like it's an entire
fail but in general if you don't work in
code you're not necessarily all that
welcome here thank you very much hearts
back to the tweet I showed you earlier
why why are we convinced that we don't
need people how do we come to this
mindset that the code is all we really
care about all we really need to focus
on I'm only halfway through but I'm
gonna tell you the punchline to my whole
talk right now it's because we
misunderstood how the system was started
in the first place
and by the system I mean free software
or open source or whatever you want to
call it that is why we don't really
value contribution beyond code and I
hope in five slides time when I show you
how this happens there's going to be
this collective kind of like oh I see
what you did there because even this
passed me by for a very long time so
what are the lessons we've learned along
the way
so between realizing that there was a
problem and between starting to want to
fix it now you kind of have to learn
some things along the way right and this
helps you understand what can we do
better these are normally couched in
terms of understanding what did we do
wrong in amongst all of this what did we
actually get right and perhaps you know
where did we get lucky what went wrong
the system's fail when you see a system
found here I'm not talking about a
social system and to us not talking
about technical system talking about
social construct systems tend to fail
because they were either designed badly
or they were designed well but then set
off on the wrong track not even
necessarily implemented badly and you
could just take a good system and point
it in the wrong direction um I'm gonna
argue just now that actually the system
was badly defined what I am gonna say
and I'm gonna show you how is even if
you want to say that the system was well
designed it was very very badly and
and we should all collectively be
ashamed and when I realized that my own
interpretation was bad I was deeply
ashamed because I had this bias as well
before I come to the next slide I'm
gonna say in advance what the bias is as
someone who cares deeply about free
software I always ran with this feeling
that freedom and free software were
couched in terms of code if the four
freedoms had been couched in terms of
code it would be very easy to point at
the origin of the system and say there's
the failing and when I first started
thinking about this topic as someone who
cares and thought he understood a thing
or two iced told people that you know
there's your problem the whole thing is
defined in terms of code and that
implies all sorts of no I it includes
all sorts of biases inherently here's
the four freedoms freedom zero the
freedom to run the program for any
purpose phenomenon easy to understand
lacks ambiguity no problems here freedom
number one the freedom to study how the
program works and to change it to make
it do what you wish and come back to
this one freedom to the freedom to
redistribute and make copies so that you
can help your neighbor I'm going to lump
this together with freedom zero it's a
fundamentally good thing and it's well
defined and I think the intent is pretty
clear and finally freedom three the
freedom to improve the program and
release your improvements and modified
versions in general to the public so the
whole community benefits it's in bold
because I'm lumping it with freedom one
when you look at freedom one and freedom
three it is very very easy to confuse
yourself into thinking that these are
talking about code contribution and that
is collectively what free software and
open source has done since four
that is the fundamental understanding
breakdown that is a community we have
made since day one
nowhere in these freedoms does it
mention code and yet we treat it
religiously as if it does very
explicitly it says that freedom one you
have the right to study how it works and
to make it do what you wish that is not
necessarily a coding task that can be a
design task that can be a user
experience tasks that can be
documentation this can be anything about
making the program better and yet we
always interpreted this as you have the
right to alter the code fail let's look
at freedom free you can improve it and
you can release your improvements it's
exactly the same thing I can improve a
program by writing better documentation
I can improve a program by putting
better marketing on top of it I can
improve a program by helping out with
user experience I do not have to write a
line of code and yet for 30 odd years
that's exactly how we have treated
freedom 1 and freedom 3 this fundamental
failing is how we collectively as a
community have let ourselves down it's
not all crap we did some things very
well we did change the world for the
better we did create some incredible
software we did not just create
incredible software but software where
you would be totally bonkers to choose
absolutely anything else right there are
so many domains in which free software
and open-source have really kicked ass
that I'm not even going to go into it
now you know what they are um we just
didn't push the button right we just
didn't take it further right we didn't
get beyond engineering products where
did we get lucky well like I said
earlier on I think the thing where we
really really got lucky is in perception
people do despite our problems despite
infighting
despite
our inability to produce certain types
of product despite a lack of
friendliness in certain quarters the
world does perceive open source as a
positive thing and it should and this is
good but we have to admit now we got
lucky if enough people with great skills
come along to open source if enough
people send out that tweet saying I'm a
user experience expert and I was made to
feel deeply unwelcome I'm a woman I was
made to feel deeply unwelcome I'm a
person of color and I was made to feel
deeply and welcome that is wholly
unsustainable and is a tarnish on your
personal brand or community's brand that
we would never ever get away from
there's no coming back from that the
fact that we have not got that far is
something where we undeniably we got
lucky
so resolution as I said at the very top
my mission here today was to make
everyone aware of the problem and to a
certain extent make everyone feel a
little bit uncomfortable there are
smarter people than me in the world I
hope some of you are in the room who can
help me work out what the solution is
intuitively instinctively I would like
to look back at definitions like the
free software the Four Freedoms
the ten facets of open-source and a few
other things and say like can we is it
now time to reword these is the time to
make them less ambiguous and more
welcoming a naive assumption that that
might work
hopefully someone way smarter than I am
is out there and maybe watching the
video afterwards and will come to me and
say here's a better approach but it's
definitely time to do something
I hope having been through this today
that everyone in the room at least takes
some time to think about what the
solution might be and how you can be
part of it because ultimately as an
open-source community community as a
concept no matter which project you
might be involved with ultimately all
we're trying to do is make great
software that people can benefit from
and I think as long as we always
remember that freedom zero you have the
freedom to use the software for any
purpose as long as we remember that that
means we have to create software
excellent software for any purpose that
can be used for that purpose please join
me in the journey thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
