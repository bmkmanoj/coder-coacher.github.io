for the go to conferences interviewing
list q without a title and then North
without a title and welcome okay so
first I'd like to hear from you now the
reason why we invited you together was
called a little three other thing the
BDD see you and can you can you explain
very very shortly what BDD is and when I
say shortly I mean it should probably be
less doing it no I don't just said
generation anything anything you want
your bracelet azimuth okay it's using
examples talk through how an object from
the years to defective having
conversations around those examples okay
I should probably mention the automation
thing but I hate the automation thing
these days you hate the automation thing
yes I hey I'm so sorry we're rotating
iridium and Joe had one was fine because
nobody ever used it yes there was a it
was great it was a thought experiment
the whole point of Japheth even I wanna
know what Jane it would look like if you
vote in a BDD style and the answer was
they behave I was quite pleased with
that it came out kind of how I expected
come out yeah looks like it is made it
usable if people started using it which
was a disaster so drew into purpose you
think I think I think as a way of
getting people to have conversations and
carrying those conversations into the
code it was fantastic you know
absolutely fantastic the problem I'm
seeing these days is people are not
having the conversations and most of the
time every time I see people having
problems with EBD having problems with
cucumber having problems with JPEGs and
look at the center
and it's really grinding the orchids
from the language of the scenarios they
are frequently too detailed frequently
talking about the actual UI components I
no no these had a conversation you know
yes so what was happening with any sins
anything we've tooling is that the focus
shifts on to the tooling and there's a
lovely quote from that name from Harvard
Business School that people that want a
quarter-inch drill by one quarter inch
hole yeah and so now let's assume that
we were courage hole and we've just come
up with a drill and now suddenly all of
the conversation isn't drilling
technique yeah which make of drill
should use are you should use a hand
drill yes real real truth is a hundred
I've got a palatal you've got
lithium-ion battery like remember the
whole words over there yeah that's no
work has been animal and it's the same
thing it's like ddd is using using
descriptions of behavior of a system
from the point of view of all kinds
different stakeholders and these able
thinking a bit more from a risk
perspective so when you're trying to do
is surface risk from all different from
all different stakeholders so you've got
you know one of the security scenarios
what's the security risk what's the
compliance regulatory risk when about
the business correctness does it
actually solve the problem we thought
what about their operational Patrick
like availability let's have
conversations about those and let those
surface rich and that drive the way we
do development oh no easing aspect or
you know our behave or RNA was it J
behave and blend it is this hundreds of
these things and it always becomes like
a rite of passage that you need to read
be the framework unless it seemed very
sorry about I'm seeing lots and lots of
people using the Englishman
frameworks like cucumber go baby and the
business taunting him reading so you've
got an extra level of abstraction in
there an extra level of maintenance
you've gotta do you've got to get it all
break it up with your bills and
everything else just hear ctso like
something nice at the time you des
haven't used that for ya I say most of
the Biddy they I've ever done we were
just saying before we started the
recording bida tears after 10 years old
so the first time I was talking about I
was talking with programmers about
lexically how to do TDD but without
using the word test within 2003 and the
first likeness of j behav were written
at the end of two thousand three I'll is
likely 2013 and now the next ten years
old it is it showing signs of fatigue
usually empty parents coming up hasn't
imploded what's happening with it right
takes load is rather than imploded it's
exploded yes we've added things like
feature injection so taking up all the
way up to the initial perfect vision I'm
doing a lot of work with Kevin the
Canarian framework which models
complexity particularly and looking up
we're being ideas appropriate to wear it
isn't and how you can actually tell from
the language people using conversations
so I don't think it's showing signs of
fatigue I think as dad said we have at
all therefore people focus on the tool
and I think that's a real shame because
a lot of the power of it it's actually
in just in those conversations it's an
analysis tool do you think it's because
it's easy for people to discuss the tool
than to discuss the real problems that
they do that I think I think it sees
what is the
rather the drug guy they're looking
around under a lamp post for his
receipts and the guys the way you look
at it alone right I've lost my keys
we're way I drop them over there ended
up wait again with on Facebook is his
light over here yeah you know I I don't
know how to have the conversation set
about the conversations so I have the
conversations about to let Nick sec oh
but what's your question warehouse
Hamilton had changed it in 10 years i
think i've been really delighted i'm
really delighted by the way it has
evolved and i've been particularly
delighted by the fact that it hasn't
been me you know so you've got folks
i'll is doing a bd4life do and I mean
applying the same thinking to how you
structure goals and in your own sort of
lies that self coaching anything you've
seen your first life graco a ditch with
specification by example which I I still
maintain is the BBB book that he wrote
way better book about b2b than the light
could've and it's brilliant you know
he's doing that stuff and that's now
given rise to the impact nothing an
impact man thing is again it's a natural
evolution it's like war okay given that
we took me the as basically as as a
reframing tdv and proper Kent Beck tdv
so like at all different levels of
abstraction locks down in the code where
the most people think TVD happens to you
did a full stack thing as well to take
them out what have you took that right
out into the business as the product
vision as the goals as though you know
what would your data look like well hang
on that itself becomes as I discipline
which is really exciting place and so
now it says for that and then actress
personalized Muslim with the real option
stuff yeah which is just fantastic and
all of these things you know certainly
BBB didn't cause those things but it's
it's that same space your senses it was
my new assistant
this is it's certainly one of the
factors the influence agent and that's
why I'm so excited about life and what I
love that they nourish me go next what
do you see as changes um it's really
interesting i went back and looked at
some early blogs and we were still
talking about how should allow the
uncertainty to exist way back well
actually thousand for the word shirt
allowed people to question is allowed
some uncertainty to exist when you're
having these conversations so i don't
think that's changed I think we've got
better language around it I think we've
got more ways of having those
conversations with the kinetic framework
and things like that one of the big
changes that i see no I'm having so much
fun with right now is with the future
injection the way I do which is a little
bit different to how Chris does it but
it's how Chris taught me and identifying
different stakeholders and actually the
recognition that some user stories
aren't actually about users and so you
can start looking we normally say given
a contact when events happen said and
outcome occurs and I've got this big guy
called context questioning is there any
other context which leads to a different
outcome you can do that with
stakeholders if we go live with this
thing's there any stakeholder who's
going to stop us going lives there any
stakeholders just going to get upset as
you know and identifying different
stakeholders with it and surfacing
things like if you've got any new
requirements you've got new stakeholders
you've never
made happy or stakeholders got a new
goal you're providing this capability to
people that they've never had and as
soon as you start seeing these new
things come up you know there's got the
uncertainty in them you can actually
hear it when people talk through the
examples you can hear the uncertainty in
the language they use and that's great
because like as they were saying that
surface is the risk yes you know that's
what the right questions makes its
surface yeah so you're talking as if I
know you have the persons in BBD do you
have the answer pattern too yeah i mean
i get old yeah i guess it's about within
a bit involved we really say pads the
anti pattern is not recognizing patterns
while I mean by that is patterns are
about context the whole point of patents
all kind of pattern language a whole
point of Erichs elders original work is
that a is that is that there is a
pattern for this thing it's you you
identify a combination and ecosystem of
patterns that naturally resolve and
balance out all the forces is a complete
hippie right so in the same way there
are a bunch of patterns the resolve in a
given context now if you don't have
context if you don't have a contextual
awareness you'll just look for root
because that's how we're that's how we
learn this is the dreyfus novice level
yes I am I need rules and recipes I need
quick wins I need to I need that stuff
so if you if you give me what you think
of patterns I I'm going to see rules
that you might need them to be rules and
the hunt pragmatic programmer I am
become as a great story about his
teacher patters design plans court and
one of your students in one of the
breaks that I have fiercely coding away
or whatever they said that what you do
know that I'm up to seven thing simply
why I've got 17 patents in this code I
know I need for round up a whole book
this block is stopped spoke of it and
this is the thing is that an exactly the
same thing with XP you know Kent Beck
original conception of XP is the values
nothing else I if you talk to him about
it funny he says exactly the same thing
I expect I said that baby i want to get
business people I technical people
talking I want to get on the same page
XP is I want to get business be quite
technical people on the same page okay
it's not so so the book is here are here
are some things I have any communication
simplicity feedback you know courage and
by the way he's an experienced report
here's some things that we did on this
on this on this whole bunch of projects
and some of them work for it like pair
programming was called TVB was cool
continuous integration school hears
about that's not XD X piece those values
X please get those guys together here's
some things that might be useful know
though they became the 12 commandments
right yeah baby needs always have the
tagline software matters writing
software that matters no that's good
evening if you're writing software that
doesn't matter because you didn't have a
conversation with the business first
you're not hoping to do yeah you're not
doing anything really you know anything
valuable but you don't know that that's
the thing is a second order if you don't
know that you don't know that this thing
is useless because you're not getting
the fever and then again is to the lean
startup grants been validated learning
you know you're not putting this in
front of people and a great way to put a
hypothetical code in front of people is
to talk about what it might do and then
you're right back to the behavior again
so let's get back to the term NT parents
when I asked your soleus use it there
were tons of energy panels do you have a
German name for for an antebellum that
people used to be silent I've got one
called too many scenarios yeah people
seem to stop and start with a really
basic skeleton
scenario and then they'll adds an edge
case and then adds another edge guess
and another educate and another edge
case and the first scenario is the
boring ones here are now included in a
really interesting ones but nobody ever
seems to want to delete them for some
reason so you end up with these files
with you know 25 scenario Singh and all
the really interesting scenarios are
find down the bottom of the file they
had been to the bottom instead at the
top so he's oh it's not just too many
scenarios there's also a prioritization
always a billion see you yeah it is
you've got to make these things
interesting otherwise nobody ever looks
at them nobody reads them yeah I I say
put the interesting ones at the top and
when you're reading them if you get down
down page you'll probably find at some
point all of the scenario so for
instance if I say given thread ball to
microwave 400 pounds when I brings
microwave back for a refund then you
should get a hundred pounds right that's
a boring tomorrow if we do one where
there's microwave got discounted and
here we get to 90 pounds back that'll
include all of the behavior that's in
101 so they'll start with the basic one
and then then I'd one with a discount
and then then that one where the ice who
gets put back into stock but nobody F
deletes that first snoring and it's now
boring you notice that there's no you
don't learn nothing from reading that
story I think I think I mean you it's
easy to lose sight of fantasy
documentation the whole point is
executable specification its
documentation yeah and in the same way
and because because people think I'll
know this is tests more tests must be
better because tests are good right more
documentation isn't better the right
documentation is better the right level
of documentation in the right focus is
better so if i can give you the smaller
subset of examples of this part of a
system that tells you exactly how it
works and why it's different from other
ways we could have done it and the kinds
of things we will probably
thinking about what we wrote it that
should be Clinton so so that's actually
a bozo i think i think the the the main
that kind of intimacy is is the more is
better yeah where it really isn't the
other one st ironic cuz i vlog this 20
years ago if you going back to this
thing and physically son being still
really relevant which is mixing domains
so in a sari typically you have a whole
bucket of anything or the solution
domain what was the problem trying to
solve it's a bit a healthcare system and
the domain is his diagnosis patient
diagnosis and okay what's another
scenario we'll talk about you know when
I when I put these values in these
fields on this form whoa hang on we've
just went into the domain of data
capture right there's values and fields
and form okay then and then you end up
with our two or three different domains
all mixed together so you so the
implementation the user interface and
the solution domain all or interspersed
in this scenario makes this thing
incredibly brittle if any part of that
change is something here is going to
change so then you get the inertia thing
oh I can't move fast because of my tests
you know I can't new fast because of my
documentation is just crazy and surely
that means you've got the wrong name is
articles and still yeah yeah I love one
last question which is not related to be
deep and that it's haiku poems and
software is yes so um the thing about
deaths is when you give devs half a
problem they'll come up with an entire
fish with no trouble at all so we like
to fill in gaps yes and heike does the
same thing so one of my favorite IQ a
guy called Michael came up with and one
of the workshops which was hot air
rushing past my face mind the gap and
for anyone who's been to London that
you feel yourself standing on the edge
of the platform of the tube tracking you
know you can actually loose up there
your mind has made that image out of the
discrepancy between the lines of that
home and so it's what we call haiku
moment that gap in there is light and
it's your intuition kicking in basically
it's like yours audit refactoring code
falls into place green bar Greenville
absolutely yeah yeah next year will be
the 10th anniversary of my blog post
where I got my first ever green pub oh
I'm going to do a respective on you know
how my career's gotten since Mike
