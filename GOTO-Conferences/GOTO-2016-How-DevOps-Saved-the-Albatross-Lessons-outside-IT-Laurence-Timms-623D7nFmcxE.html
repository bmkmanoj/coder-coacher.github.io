the Royal Society for protection of
birds I am the head of application
development support we do a lot of
technology stuff believe it or not we
are Europe's largest nature conservation
charity and it's not just Birds actually
despite the logo it's all nature because
it's all connected we have about 200
preserves up and down the country 1,500
staff several thousand volunteers we
can't get by without all our volunteers
that gives some idea the size of us
we're not a tiny charity we're
reasonably large but what I want to talk
to you today is about solving complex
problems subject to the discussion today
before I dive into that I'd like to talk
to you a bit about albatrosses albatros
is hey elegant creatures are kind of
weird as well in many ways it takes five
years before they come to sexual
maturity before they're ready to start
breeding and have a very long courtship
and they pair up for life and even when
they do that it can sometimes take up to
another five years before they're ready
to lay an egg it all happens really
really slowly and when they do lay a
neck it's just one at a time
the chick is fed on this really gross
stuff called stomach oil that the
albatross is produced from their guts
and they produce it by taking very long
trips out to sea where they feed on
stuff like squid fish crabs up to push
that kind of stuff their surface feeders
they sit on the surface of the water
sometimes they dive down sometimes they
get whatever is on the surface and they
digest it and make this weird stomach
all stuff which by the way really stinks
if it get it on you you can't get rid of
the smell like forever they come back
and they regurgitate it into the chick
and chick loves it and they grow slowly
and eventually the chick pledges and
goes out while one bird is out feeding
for the chick the other parent stays
with the chicken looks after it and then
they swap over that's how it works with
albatrosses and the other thing is they
say so infrequently sometimes they only
lay an egg and razor chick once every
other year so another thing that happens
really slowly the trouble is we can
killing them for years we've been
killing them their feathers for the
feather trade we've been killing them by
either deliberately or inadvertently
releasing invasive species like mice and
rats that spread disease and pro date
them we've been hunting them we've been
chucking rubbish in the seas they
plastic they think it's food they don't
they can't digest it the chicks don't
get fed but above all else the thing
that kills more albatrosses than
anything else is commercial longline
fishing
this is a commercial fishing boat
travels for weeks at a time laying out
long lines I explain the how that works
in a minute it's a very effective way of
fishing works really well it's used all
around the world and the way it works is
like this the boat goes along and a main
line comes out behind it up to several
miles it's suspended by boys and on the
main line you can see there are multiple
branch lines they're called snoods if
you want the technical term each branch
line has bait I think Huck and a weight
to make it sink to the right level you
get bought you get lines that sink right
down to the bottom of the ocean or they
sit near the surface turning what kind
of fish you want to catch pretty
straightforward it's very effective it's
also very good as far as the fishermen
that are concerned because the fish tend
to stay alive they stay fresher for
longer so commercially it's a good way
of doing things this the bait that goes
on the hooks is stuff like squid I
mentioned squid early one it's the stuff
that albatross is lie to eat now I'm
going to apologize in advance for the
start i'm about to show you
this is what happens the albatross is
another sea birds are attracted to the
bait when the main line comes out of the
boat the bait sits on the water for a
few moments before the hook sinks while
it's there on the surface the birds the
albatrosses inevitably want to eat the
bait it's the food they eat they get
trapped on the hook they can't get
released at best you got an albatross
that is trapped on a hook and needs to
be released and it's injured at worst
and usually it sinks and it dies it's
drowned not just one dead up choice but
to because the chick and the other
parent waiting with the other parent has
to go and eat itself it's getting hungry
it ventually has to leave the chick
behind go out feed itself and the chick
staff to dare out to dead albatrosses
research in the 1990s showed that in
excess of 100,000 albatrosses were dying
each year because of this and the
calculation in 2007 was that nineteen
out of twenty one recognized species of
albatross were threatened with
extinction the rate of death was
exceeding the rate of birth simple as
that
in 2005 something called the albatross
task force was formed it was a
cross-functional team scientists
conservationists volunteers specialists
experts in the area and they recognized
the problem they saw where things were
going with extinction they knew
something had to be done in nine short
years in one particular fishery around
South Africa they reduced the problem of
bycatch which is the socially acceptable
word we use for dead albatrosses on long
lines by 99 percent barely any dead
albatrosses at all it's an incredible
statistic how did they do it it's all it
sounds a bit like a sound bite
statistics isn't it how are you naija
nampa so that it was genuinely
ninety-nine percent the question is how
did they go about doing that how are
they so successful now just moving back
to our industry for a minute the IT
industry the entry of software
development there's a tendency in some
quarters let's call it the business to
think of there being a nice solution to
a given IT problem we talk about
solution architecture we talk about is
the solution ready it's the solution
complete when will the solution be
delivered as if there can be one single
solution to a technical problem but we
all know it's not really like that we
all know that the first solution you
deploy is simply the first step in a
whole world of change there are bugs
there are feature requests everything
changes you're constantly adjusting the
solution solving problems that's the
reality of it
the ATF understood this as well they
realized from the outset that they is
the albatross task force could not
simply go out there and fix this problem
one way once and fraud and have it done
and dusted I understood that so rather
than trying to sit in a room and come up
with a big plan of how to fix this they
established a mechanism of being cereal
problem solvers they knew they weren't
going to fix this in one go that was
their attitude and when I read about
what the Albatross task force had done
on the intranet and I went and spoke to
some of the colleagues that actually
been involved with it I realized that
what they've actually doing is DevOps
and that's what I want to talk about now
in 2006 when the Albatross task force
really starts to get to work all of the
necessary pieces to solve the problem
were there now these yellow things
you're seeing on the red lines there
bird scarers streamers they just made a
color plastic and they took exactly what
you expect them to do they scare birds
away you can see here the birds aren't
getting close to the streamers why were
the fishermen using them they work why
was nobody using them they know the
South African government had passed
legislation to say the fishermen had to
use these because they'd been convinced
that this was a good solution to the
problem but despite the legislation no
one was using them why
the ATF wanted to kick-start the system
get these mitigations that are out there
already in use so they made two key
decisions after two days of discussion
first decision they're only going to
work in one place South Africa they're
going to go to work in South Africa
their first target even though
albatrosses were dying all around the
world if you imagine a circle all around
Antarctica all the way up to tiffa South
Africa tip of South America that's where
albatrosses are all around they just
said let's go to South Africa start
there the other decision they made was
to get on the boats they'd spent time of
governments and trying to change
policies and done a lot of work there
we're good at that rspb and all our
partners but they said we're not really
going to understand this until we
actually get on the boats and talk to
the fishermen and ask the captains and
find out why these mitigations aren't
being used try to kick-start the system
and if you can imagine what it's like on
a fishing boat let's see stinking of
diesel and fish guts being thrown around
in the waves possibly with fishermen
that speaking a language that's not the
same as yours it's not a particularly
pleasant environment so many ways these
two decisions are pretty bold it's bold
to allow other albatrosses around the
world to continue to die and it's bold
to commit your scarce resource your
charity funded resource to go out to see
a weeks on end those are the decisions
they made
this is DevOps thinking this is the
first way this is systems thinking there
was a system it wasn't working it wants
to kick start it they wanted to get
results the first thing on a draw
attention to is something called the
Theory of Constraints you may have heard
of it but basically what we're talking
about here is in any given system that's
not working there would be one
constraint above all else that is the
one that is most responsible for
stopping your system working find that
one constraint elevate it understand it
for all your attention into it and
flatten it out as much as possible once
you've done that move on to the next one
don't try and solve all the problems at
once that's what they did they went to
work in that one place with the
streamers which we call mitigation for
bycatch get them working on the ships
they were regarded in 2005 when they
started one fishing vessel using
mitigations one time to save one
albatross as success so this points to
the second point here established flow
of value what is value in any given
system to the albatross task force value
was fewer dead albatrosses that's quite
simple they took that as their key
measure of value from the outset and as
soon as they could see fewer dead
albatrosses they could see those flow of
value in their system and by working
only in South Africa and nowhere else
they were effectively limiting work in
progress they could've got their
volunteers to start walking on all the
ships all around the Antarctic Circle
all at once they decided that was an
unwise move because they didn't
understand the system well enough to
know that would be successful limit work
in progress in the fourth point here and
I will point out that I have cherry
picked the points of DevOps anybody that
knows about DevOps knows there's a lot
more to it than this but these are the
key ones
deploy to production soonest get working
get out there don't just sit around
thinking about it don't sit around
planning about it and theorizing about
it go to work even though you might
understand and you might accept that
actually we don't know how successful
this is going to be we want some success
we want some value we want some flow
that was their attitude from the outset
and that's how they began
so they're out there they're working
they're on the ships and they're getting
the streamers deployed behind fishing
vessels and all the time they're doing
this they're learning their learning
things they could not have possibly
known by sitting down and planning and
they're learning things they could have
not possibly have known are sitting in
government chambers talking to
politicians I'll give you an example one
of the ATF volunteers working on a
fishing vessel was talking to one of the
fishermen and the fisherman saying I
don't understand what what the fuss is
about what do you mean well is that dead
albatrosses we don't like it it's real
inconvenience we're going to hold them
in their very heavy but what about all
these baby albatross is out here on the
water as well and the volunteers going
what baby out Ross it's that they're not
that's and the fisherman pointed to
these other birds small white birds that
you could imagine might look like a
miniature albatross they're called storm
petrels think I albatrosses but the
fisherman quite reasonably had thought
they were simply young albatrosses so
the fisherman had quite reasonably
assumed that because there were lots of
baby our crosses in his mind there
wasn't a conservation problem they
didn't particularly want to kill
albatrosses but they couldn't imagine
that the population was going down
because of all the babies no way we
could have known that if we hadn't been
on the ships the ACF also began to
understand that their initial metric of
value dead albatrosses was simply not
enough to understand the complexity of
the system remember we talked about
complex problems here any complex
problem there are multiple metrics
multiple measures and until you get
close to it you don't understand what
they are the albatross task force
quickly realized that the only way to
get a handle on this was to actually
baseline everything they spent the
entire year of 2008 collecting data
barely doing anything more than
collecting data but multiple points of
data for multiple factors and everything
they could imagine and everything
they've learnt about
such as whether the lines are being set
at night or day what time of year it was
in terms of fish movements and bird
migration the date and times of fishery
closures according to the government's
little things like the position of the
weight on the branch line was it quite
high at the branch line are quite low
down the branch line size of the hook
temperature the water they use special
devices to collect this data they
literally had as they described to me
where tongue-in-cheek oceans of data and
only then did they begin to begin to
start to get a picture of what was
working and what was not working they
discovered some very very important
factors seems obvious now as I say it
but the amount of time the bait is on
the surface of the sea and how quickly
it sinks is the key factor in how many
albatrosses died no it's not enough just
to know that it's you have to get all
the detailed data to understand what
changes you make to that system have a
positive result in the flow of value
they focused very much on the exact
position of the weight on the line and
they spent ages just refining that and
collecting data on it and they discover
by the end of 2008 just that one factor
alone could make an eighty-five percent
difference in the number of dead
albatrosses just focusing on that one
mitigation they also discovered being on
the ships that position of the weight on
the line tended to be moved upwards by
the fisherman because it made it less
dangerous when you're laying a base line
and you're putting out there is
something gets snagged and pings back
you can imagine the difference between a
weight at the end of a line that comes
flying back and the weight at the top of
a line that comes flying back fishermen
have died being struck by these things
so having understood that other people
within the atf went off to discover how
they could prevent this Maggie from
occurring to increase safety for the
fishermen all part of the system
thinking that they were doing and all
the time they were collecting this data
they were constantly feeding it back to
themselves to other scientists to other
researchers and two governments so that
governments can improve the policies and
so other scientists could improve what
they were doing this is the second way
in action feedback loops first point
here amplify and shorten feedback loops
and in fact what I haven't said here is
make more of them in software
engineering we tend to think well let's
put some software out there and then the
users will use it and they'll tell us
what they thought about it and we'll
feed that back into the backlog and
we'll make some changes and we'll go
again and maybe have a loop of a month
or a week or a year whatever it is
that's your feedback loop there's just
one of them we want more of them
happening all the time all levels all
the time more feedback all the time and
you power that by measuring everything
understand all the factors that affect
the performance of your system and the
flow of value as you do that refine the
system think about what color
mitigations what what the color of your
plastic lines and in the streamers where
are the weights adjust them what dated
you get build testing in some quarters
in software development still think of
testing being that inconvenient thing
that happens at the end I know none of
you do but you understand what I mean
there's that thinking is still out that
it's somebody else's problem that
happens at the end and you do it once
and they'd all be fine the Albatross
taskforce built this in at the beginning
and the middle at the end all the time
they see fused their approach with
testing they assumed nothing everything
was tested everything was evaluated that
everything was data-driven
all the time the second way talks about
testing as being something you build him
from the outset so by the end of the
2000s the Albatross task force was
beginning to expand its work out into
different fisheries around the world I
had established a resilient practice of
going into a fishery understanding the
problem understanding the unique factors
that were there in that fishery in terms
of the ships that are being used the
practices of the fishermen the kind of
catch that was being landed the kind of
albatrosses that were there and all the
data points they needed they're setting
the problems up and they were knocking
them down setting them up and knocking
them down they had a culture of problem
solving they didn't go to any fishery
expecting that what they'd done in South
Africa was going to work somewhere else
they didn't make that assumption so as
they went to Argentina and the Falkland
Islands and South Georgia they
understand the complexion of the problem
they pull their skills out of the bag
and they start solving it that didn't
mean that it worked everywhere either
Brazil it's a massively tough nut to
crack somebody sniglet last time I said
now I didn't realize the pun Brazil nuts
but in all seriousness Brazil culturally
for some reason is very very resistant
to applying these mitigations to prevent
bycatch as soon as you run into cultural
problems things get really sticky how do
you solve cultural problems how did you
overcome them you can't just wheel out
the data and say well this is good
that's better do this do that sometimes
that's not enough
but the important thing here is that the
ATF had established a culture within the
conservation areas that are affected by
this of innovation experimentation
risk-taking and an absence of fear of
failure so when Brazil was being really
really difficult they weren't put off by
it they kept on trying and at the same
time something they've been in
development for several years called the
hook pod this thing here had a chance to
flourish the hook pod is an incredibly
simple looking device you can see that
it encapsulates the sharp barbed hook
completely little plastic thing hanging
down is a scale model of a squid so the
bait is attached to the hook the hook
pod conceals the hook and as you can see
by the fisherman laying out there it
goes in the ocean when the hook is
covered the albatross can't get caught
on the hook and the magic happens when
the hook pod sinks at a certain
pre-programmed depth the hook pod opens
the hook comes out and it catches fish
it took ten years to get this small
enough and economic enough to be usable
and deployable but the important point
here is without the work that the
albatross task force had done in the
first place there never would have been
any of adoption of the hook pod even if
it had been developed successfully they
created a culture where the hook pod
could be taken on and used on fishing
vessels
here's a quote it's for a Brazilian
fishing boat captain I really like the
equipment and I intend to keep using it
he's decided to keep using it they
haven't had to force it on a fishing
vessels he's decided in his opinion it's
a mitigation measure more efficient than
any of the other things that they do
that here's the key this man regards it
as a pleasure to help develop this
technology rather being part of the
problem the compart the solution he's
helping to contribute this is the
culture that the albatross task force
created
this is the third way of DevOps
continuous learning continuous learning
encapsulates experimentation taking
risks being prepared or in fact
inspecting to fail you've heard it said
I'm sure there is no progress without
failure the Albatross task force
actively searched for failure because
they knew without failure they would
never understand which mitigations
worked and which didn't where success
was their vectoring towards them you
continuous learning we also talked about
the scientific method the scientific
method or the empirical method being
transparency inspection adaptation
transparency being open about your data
open about your successes open about
your failures clarity of all the things
you're doing clarity about all the
places it's going wrong all the things
you try to do that messed up all the
things that refuse to work properly was
no shame about that inspection looking
at them analyzing them understanding
them adaptation meaning continually
steering based on what you've learned we
tend to be fairly politically correct to
the RSPB outward-facing we're not
allowed to say things like killing two
birds with one stone although we do say
stuff like that in the office and in the
office we also have a little analogy we
like to use here at the scientific
method we like to compare guns and
guided missiles so the gun you aim it a
new hope that when you pull the trigger
the bullets going to hit the target once
it's fired nothing you can do it's gone
you know hits the target or it doesn't
the scientific method allows you to
build a guided missile we paint a target
of pretty much where we want this
software product to end up something
like that some over there bit like that
fire off it goes guided missile and as
the data comes back from the guiding
this off the
product team that are building the
product as they go along we start to
understand what's going on we learn more
from the users we learn more from our
date and we adjust as we go along
sometimes we self-destruct pull the plug
stop doing it it's not going to work
sometimes we adjust sometimes he paws
sometimes I'm can we continue that's how
it should be surely very easy thing to
say very hard to put into practice
because your barriers our culture so
what is this thing about culture I've
wrestled with this for quite a while how
do you change culture how did you create
a culture like the albatross task force
did that permits experimentation that
permits failure what I've begun to
understand if you don't create culture
you create a climate by what you do what
you say how you behave how you treat
people the role models you set out
creates a climate in which culture may
emerge over time now I could drill into
that a whole deal that's a whole other
conversation but the actions that you
take and the passion that you show and
the behavior you express gives rise to
adjustments in culture over time the
albatross task force had the advantage
of building this culture in from the
outset in everything they didn't said in
the way they worked so they were able to
establish their own culture and that
followed on through with them in an
established organization if you're
somewhere where people play the blame
game like they all you did that badly
all that didn't work that was terrible
what I'm what a mistake no wonder mr.
failure you don't learn anything one of
the first things you have to do as a
leader is submit to your own mistakes
admit to your own failures and show
everybody else that it's okay for them
to admit to their too tough thing to do
hid the Albatross task force no they
were doing DevOps they didn't understand
that when i spoke to ollie Yates who is
the man of the RSPB who's the head of
the albatross task force in the UK and i
talked about this than I talked to
DevOps talk to him about DevOps he
understood what it all meant Tiger get
that never heard of it sounds great yep
that's exactly what we did didn't know
it but definitely what we did that's a
really good way of working that's what
they did that's how they make this thing
work that's how they save the albatross
the reason is they understood from the
outset that the problem they are trying
to solve was a complex one your problems
are complex to IT problems are
complicated if they were simple everyone
will be doing here they're not simple
they're complex problems and people that
work in OT software developers tend to
be extremely good cereal problem solvers
like the albatross task force as soon as
you fixed one bug another one pops up
and I know you throw your hands up in
despair but then you get on with it and
again and again at all levels repeatedly
as a team and individually that's what
you do so I would say that the
scientific method embodied by DevOps
transparency inspection adaptation and
the passion the emotion related to
wanting to do a good job wanting to make
things better in the case of the ATF
wanting to save the Albatross of the two
things the two ingredients you need to
drive you forward to success without
those two things you really won't make
the progress that you have as your
potential
the Albatross Task Force has told me
they're not going to exist forever they
go out there they solve the problems
they make it work and then they hand it
over it's their intention to hand it
over to local government agencies so
they can teach them how to do the same
kind of thing get on the ships make sure
things are working and do a five-year
review make sure the mitigations are
still being used and then come and fix
it they need to they don't feel they
themselves need to be the heroes they
want to expand that culture of cereal
problem-solving into other places around
the world
so I recommend to you as development
teams that you embrace the teaching that
DevOps has to offer take what you can
and learn from it because it does work
it works in all walks of life whether
you know your new doing DevOps or not
take what you can from it put it to work
and see how you can benefit thank you
