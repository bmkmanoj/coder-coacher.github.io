to take a few minutes of your time
explaining to you the program of go to
Chicago 2016 I'm the program chair of
the program committee for this
conference which means that I get to
work with the people who are inviting
the speakers and if you look very
closely you can see me as the tiny pixel
in the right wrist right behind David
Somers on the stage but less about me
more about the program we had for
keynote speakers at this conference
divided on three different sessions
first we have Eric gonna he is a member
of the gang of four the authors who
wrote the very famous book about design
patterns in the 90s he was also one of
the leaders of the Eclipse project and
the J unit project and he's a
distinguished engineer at Microsoft in
this keynote he's going to talk about
how he is developing something like
eclipse for developing in the browser a
huge tachbrook system build web
technologies until of the electron shell
note j/s and hundreds of open source
components he wants to share with you
how much fun it's been working on
something like this with modern
technologies next we have last back and
kissed or learnt from google last back
is what you'd call a virtual machine
serial monogamist which means that he's
been working with a lot of virtual
machines in different languages over the
years languages like self be tears from
talk hot sport opium small talk and v8
out of these you probably only one or
two one of the most famous being the v8
for google chrome he's feeling with
hezbollah who's got more than 10 years
of industrial experience in designing
and implementing virtual machines when
he says that he has more than 10 years
of experience working with virtual
machines it means a and he's worked with
last back for more than 10 years because
nobody else works on that for so many
years and be that he apparently has
worked with virtual machines more than
half was his life judging from his
picture we also have Deborah Harris from
a whole nother field she's worked on
neutrino interactions and oscillations
she's a scientist at Fermilab she's a co
spoke spokesperson of my nerve and
experiment whose goal it is to measure
neutrino interactions on a variety of
different nuclei
unprecedented accuracy in her keynote
she'll help you understand neutrinos and
how they behave and why they are
important we know that this keynotes got
nothing to do with IT per se but our
experience shows that people in our
field are very interested in other
technologies as well and can get ideas
and inspiration from listening to
scientists from other fields even though
it's not something they can use in their
daily work we also have to choose which
topics we have in the conference
choosing the topics means that the
program's committee has to look at what
what is popular at conferences around
the world what is popular in Chicago at
the moment we have to ask the user
groups what are the technologies that
you're working on what are the
technologies that you'd like to work on
what would you like to know more about
we also speak to developers and
engineers in different companies all
over the world and last but not least we
ask the attendees what they would like
to know more about at the next
conference with all this data in hand
will then choose which of these topics
that we'd like to have some of our
topics that we're really interested in
have to we have to let them go and these
are the topics that we ended up having
microservers is of course every IT
conference need to have a track about
micro services at the moment financial
services we needed to have that because
Chicago always on very interesting track
about the challenges of running systems
that cannot go down with some great case
studies and technologies to support it
programming languages well because the
program committee loves programming
languages so we need something like Elm
C++ and go the data and distributed
systems track merge together because we
found that we couldn't have one without
the other in our presentations and there
were spaced practice is because we've
had DevOps tracks in the past but what
we hear from people is that instead of
instead of having the developers in the
operations motion together in the DevOps
group but some people end up having ins
developers operations and DevOps which
means that we now have three silos
instead of two so the best practices is
again how do we actually make it work
high-performance organizations is a
track describing how organizations
become highly performing so instead of
focusing on it has to be the people it
has to be the process or it has to be
the methods we try to show different
examples of high-performance
organizations and what makes them high
perform we need to have a drag about
JavaScript nothing more to say about
that we have a track called the fun
stuff which is entertaining
presentations but they all are but these
are the presentations that we couldn't
really fit into the rest of the program
but what we needed to have like looking
at your code as a crime scene looking at
the versioning system learning how to
learn learning how to teach children to
program and we have also the solution
tracks which are real-world examples and
tools presentations from our sponsors if
you look at the list of speakers that we
have accepted at the conference so far
there are more to come you can see that
we have a very diverse crowd of speakers
what we do when we choose the speakers
in the program committee is that we try
to find some that fit our topic but we
also work the other way around sometimes
there's a speaker we just need to have
and then we need to make them fit into
the track we look at three different
things when writing speakers do they
know what they're talking about are they
good speakers and are they well
respected in their field of course we'd
like all speakers to have all three but
two out of three ain't bad so if they
know what they're talking about and
they're good speakers we don't really
care that they're not famous yet and
actually speaking of go to Chicago might
take them a step in the right direction
so be open-minded when you come to the
conference go to some other
presentations by the speakers you know
nothing about and try to just learn what
they could teach you we also have
workshops which is full day
possibilities of delving into a subject
so instead of just having 15 minutes of
the session where you can be inspired to
learn something about a topic or where
you can fill in the gaps of things that
you know most about or where you can
just have a good laugh
or be provoked we have workshops the day
before and the day after the conference
where you have a full day to delve into
a subject and actually learn about it in
between all the talks with keynotes and
the workshops we have something almost
more important we have all the ways that
you can network and communicate and
learn more from your peer so maybe speak
to the speakers and a more relaxed
setting so we have the breaks we have
the exhibitors hall we have the parties
but this year we also have something
else which is programming for children
the Sunday before the conference so if
you have a child interested in
programming or a child who you'd like to
make interest in programming you should
come along Sunday before the conference
there's a lot of good testimonials about
the go to conferences over all but one
of my favorite go to conference since is
the Chicago conference because it's
still small enough to be intimate and
it's in a very interesting City with
their interesting attendees and very
curious attendees as well so I really
enjoy coming to go to Chicago each year
and with that I'll just hope to see you
in Chicago have a nice day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
