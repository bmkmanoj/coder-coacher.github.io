welcome to this talk called a quick
introduction to angular 2 before we get
started by show of hands how many of you
have done in angular 1 okay a fair
amount of number how many of you have
done angular or have looked at angular 2
quite many okay so you already started I
not sure why you really need a quick
introduction to angular if you already
started to do that hopefully you'll get
to see some some new things the angular
2 it's actually newly released a couple
of weeks back came as a release version
it was in the work for almost or
actually over two years because google
announced their their intention of
coming out with a new framework about
two years ago so let's start by a short
presentation my name is deborah Kovich
short DB i'm originally from romania
moved from romania 1996 and ever since
I'm actually traveling the world at the
moment I'm living on Tenerife it's a
very nice island in the immuno in the
Atlantic Ocean outside of the coast of
North Africa I've been doing programming
since 1991 so it's all its 25 years
quarter of a century a lot of you know a
lot of development I know my experience
is almost as old as the people doing
front-end development today isn't it so
yeah I've done I've done a lot of these
I've been a trainer for the past 12
years and not only trainers I was I
worked as developer as well because I
really like to keep them you know keep
it real and try to understand exactly
what other people have to you know
suffer in order to be able to create
those teachable moments I've been doing
a conference speaking for the past seven
years I do a lot of mentoring everything
to.net and web technologies if at the
beginning was only a speed of net I
realized at some point that I really
need to do more you know looking into
JavaScript subtitles side of things and
then from there doing a lot of different
frameworks in order to see how
can I improve the work I'm doing I'm a
microsoft MVP and an ASP insider if you
are on the you know like SB insider it's
some kind of a list with people that
Microsoft things they are specialists
and we are entrusted with with their
plans and their secrets and then you can
see on that list a lot of discussions
about everything but Microsoft
technologies because there are a lot of
them out there I'm a father I have two
daughters and a geek of course otherwise
I wouldn't be here if you are on Twitter
you can find me at Tibor 19 if you do
any tweets today please use the hashtag
go to cph because then you'll get to see
them on the big screen you know whatever
you have to say to show up for other
people now my powerpoint presentation
was not that important the thing that
was on it was this this slide I have
actually a little agenda what we are
going to talk about that's a history
lesson then we are going to look at the
Quick Start Guide so again apologies for
the people that have already worked with
angular 2 because there may be a little
bit of a disappointment but let's see
then we are going to talk about the
modules components services and some of
the out-of-the-box stuff that you can
get with angular 2 so you don't have to
reinvent the wheel whenever you start
and you a new project with angular 2 so
the history lesson angular angularjs is
a JavaScript framework by the you know
by the hands that you showed me more
than half of the people at least have to
know about what angular is what Google
try to do is to create a framework they
said we don't want to be too
prescriptive we don't want to be MVC we
don't want to be mvvm but what we want
to create is 20 way for you as a
developer to augment the HTML why
because the declarative programming it's
much more powerful than the the
imperative 1 and imperative programming
was the stuff that we were doing with
jquery I usually like to do a comparison
you know to when I explain to people the
difference between the clarity of and
imperative in a way that they can
understand even if there are no
programmers goes like this so assuming
my wife wants me to you know to buy some
milk in an imperative way she will come
to me and said please go to the whole
way take your shoes up on the door go
downstairs and then turn to the right go
200 meters turn right go inside the
store pick up the box and then you know
do all the steps back until you come
back home and then put the milk in the
fridge well this is ok it's very
prescriptive and you know exactly what
you do step by step sometimes the
meaning the fact that I have to buy milk
it's deep inside the whole you know the
whole chattering stuff that you get
around in a declarative way should have
just said something like go buy milk you
know the implementation it's up to me at
the end of the day so few people would
do the implementation because you know
after a while I think I'll be able to
optimize all this trip and I might
actually take the elevator because I
lazy today I might actually take the
shortcut oh whatever you know for her
still doesn't matter because I end up
bringing the milk at home so that's you
know in a way the difference between
them now angular 1 done right can be
actually very powerful because when you
start creating your own directives in
angular 1 what you get actually you get
new HTML like elements that show the
intent so what you want to do now
there's been a lot of problems they you
know like 23 years ago not not to two
years ago Google realize that the way
they started the whole angular stuff
might not be the best suited you know it
was okay for their their own projects
especially when you have the people
working on the framework doing the
projects as well because then you know
exactly which stuff you want to avoid
but when it got them you know the
attention that it got today a lot of
people realize oh my god it doesn't work
Oh angular 1 it's so stupid it takes so
much time it has not it you know it has
a lot of performance issues it has a lot
of days and a lot of that and a lot of
people were complaining so they said
okay what we need to do now is to go
back to the design board we need to
understand what we've done wrong and how
we should do it how should we make it
better so the whole the whole project i
would say
it's sometimes in january 2014 and it
culminated with a big announcement that
they've done in September 2014 when they
said angular 1 is dead long live angular
2 and then everybody freaked out
including me and then you know I was
very very upset because and I'm still in
a way upset because what I said to them
then and what I will still say to them
now is that you know you could have
chosen a different name you know you
they try to pull a Microsoft honest I
would say you know they choose the name
that was very resounding with the
developer community they said let's do
that again you know let's try to
replicate whatever we've done so far and
then use that name well then being a
search company you know they should have
known that if you go on google and say
show me something related to angular
most of the relevant answers would be
related to angular 1 at least for the
very first adapters and that was one of
my biggest issues you know when I
started to work with angular 2 and I
tried to find the problems other people
had where would I find them not on
google that's for sure and that would
have been the platform to go you know
the place to find it so it was a lot of
trials and a lot of fighting the you
know the lack of documentation and you
know the way other people are thinking
so that was pretty pretty hard but then
they worked very hard and they managed
to do by the end of last year actually
2015 they managed to come out with the
very first better that what I think in
the beginning of december they have
alpha for a while and then they started
to come with bettas and then they this
year did they start gaming out with with
the release candidates and they've
changed they kill it a lot I mean I've
done already two workshops and every
single time when I've done a workshop I
had to rewrite the whole stuff because
you know the change is in between and i
will do a workshop in two days and i'll
have to rewrite the whole stuff again
now this is a release version hopefully
it will be able you know around for a
while longer so the next workshop i
could reuse some of the work although
i'd you know my hopes are not very high
when it comes to this one anyway so
that's angular 2 now if you are here
thinking that oh I've done a lot of
angular 1
I know angular2 sorry you know my
condolences but that's not what happened
that that's not what is going to happen
either they're conceptually how to say
equivalent if they are not really you
know the same but the idea behind them
is almost to say now they've done other
choices they decided to use typescript
so the whole angular 2 is written in
typescript and talked about you know the
big Giants working together the result
it's again pretty impressive one of the
things that happen being an ASP insider
and being an EVP for Microsoft I get
invited to the Microsoft headquarter
once a year they do a conference where
is you know closed-door only Microsoft
people and those MVPs and we have
India's over in das that we are not
allowed to talk about any of the stuff
that they are showing and so on and just
as a side note we got to see the asp.net
core back in 2013 so we've seen it three
years had everyone else more or less
because you know that was one of the
advantages or in it still is one of the
advantages of being an MVP by Microsoft
the point being last year in November
one of the speakers was none other than
Brad green Brad green being the program
manager from google that in charge of
angular 2 so he was inside those closed
doors telling us what Google is planning
to do with angular 2 and how they are
using typescript and so on which was
again very impressive and in a way it
felt like Google was poaching you know
as the developers in the Microsoft
community to adopt and then start being
you know advocate for their for their
technology as well I was already working
with angular 1 I was already working
with angular 2 and then of course I had
to tell him that I don't like the name
and he said yeah I know you're not to
only one we had this a lot but now it's
too late we can't go back and do
anything about it so this is a very
interesting time now being times creep
they develop it in typescript most of
the examples are in typescript actually
for four days and the reason they chose
typescript is because it plays very well
with javascript it actually plays better
than Java
I would say in most of the situations so
how many of you do not know what
typescript is everybody knows what type
script is okay perfect a superset of
JavaScript it makes life easier so if
you just take a JS file and you rename
it to TS you get exactly an idempotent
file it will be exactly the same on the
other side and it will just work now the
advantages of using this is because it
compiles at the end of the day into an
es5 again versioning you know years five
years twenty sixteen years 2017 and so
on so when you get a TS file it compiles
back into an es five or sometimes you
might need to compile it into an es 2015
and then you run a bubble transpiler
that takes it from you is 2016 into an
ds5 wide all these stuff because not all
the browsers are born equal some of them
are more equal than the others if you
you know if if you may they don't have
the same support for all the stuff so
some of them might need polyfill some of
them I need other things so there are a
lot of things that that happened so my
ID in order to do a quick introduction
you know of that too weak to use the
quick start guide that Oracle the book
for google it's one of those big you
know big giant sorry they do the Java
thing that the javascript thing yeah so
Google put together a very good
documentation if you if you haven't used
it so far please do so it's actually
very good there are a lot of tidbits
there there are a lot of good
documentation they are explaining a lot
of things very well and it's so happened
that I used to work with the guy that's
in charge of documentation actually and
I know him and he's he's he's quite
Gooden when passionate about what he's
doing so let me show you what I got I
got the quick start guide does everyone
sees okay is the code okay good so we
got the angular quick start I just
followed the steps i actually did copy
and paste with you know with the normal
mistakes when you do copy and paste and
then I've luckily found what was wrong
with it before I show
here so I I copy all the files from from
google site actually from angular io
site and then i put them in a project
and then I by run npm install as they
instructed and then I run npm start to
make sure that everything works and
apparently works so first of all npm and
package.json that just tells me what the
dependencies are what do i need in order
to be able to run on an angular
application so i need some common stuff
i need a compiler I need the core stuff
i need the forms and then the HTTP and
then something that has to do with the
browser in the browser dynamic now a
platform browser in Brussels dynamic is
the way for for the angular team to
abstract the way to you know the
implementations that are necessary in
order to work with the dome or to work
with a native application on a on a
mobile device then i'm using router and
then upgrade in case that you know I
really want to combine my angular 1 and
angular 2 project in one single project
you know using some existing some some
some of the existing coding here other
things that are necessary it's gorgeous
gorgeous is actually the module system
necessary in order for us to be able to
to help the browsers understand what the
modulus and again when we talk about
modules we have two different kind of
modules here at play one is the
JavaScript module or the typescript
model which is the same which is the way
for me to encapsulate the code and make
sure that nothing goes outside the scope
of you know of that module if I'm not
explicit about it so pointing you know
but the point being when I want to show
something outside you know a file in
JavaScript you show everything outside
the file unless you are not putting it
inside a function which is invoking
automatically and use the side effect of
running the function well when you want
to do a module in JavaScript or an
es2015 you just declare it inside the
file and then you don't export anything
from it it means that everything is
local to that file so that's one of the
modules and then of course
to have the notion of angular modules
which were newly introduced and then
they finally made it to the final cut so
now they are part of the of the new
specification an angular module is a way
for us like in angular 1 actually to
group together stuff that we really need
for our applications so going back to
this i'm using reflect metadata the
reflect metadata it used you know it's
actually used for the dependency
injection and then some some other some
other libraries that are in there by
default in case you want to go further
with it and use it then we have the
index.html index HTML is as simple as it
could get it says you know what this is
an angular quick start we need some poly
fields those 44 lines are necessary in
order for me to be able to run this
application on several browsers
including ie9 you know they send modern
browsers but they went back into their
word and said let's use it for I 92
because there are quite a lot of people
using I 9 out there and then this is
where my application starts it says
please configure the system j syst MJS
would be the one that would be in charge
of loading all the modules and then i
start my application by saying system
dot import app now this would be more or
less than ng up directive you had in
angular 1 this is where I wear my
application starts I don't need to
explicitly load any of the angular stuff
why because my app would do that
application we do that so two more
things i have here for configuration
purposes one it's the TS config this is
a configuration file for my typescript
whenever i edit something into a
typescript file because i have run it
inside Visual Studio code Visual Studio
code knows about it and then I
automatically will use this information
to compile the file and create create
JavaScript files out of my type script
files and then I have a Taipings just
Jason typing's Jason it's our DTS files
definition files for my top for my
script libraries because JavaScript you
know normally when you work with
JavaScript you can get a lot of methods
and it doesn't really have the type
information and because of that when you
press thought you don't get you know the
the resharper like functionality you
don't get all the methods that you might
be able to use you might get some other
errors and then we have the system J so
this is our very first file as this
should work with es5 as well not only
with with TS files it uses the
immediately invoked function here in the
execution and we are configuring system
system JSI say that whenever you see
something starting with m p.m. please
use the node module folders this in
production would be changed to my CDN
probably or to something similar so it
knows exactly what to bring the files
from and then I'm doing some mapping so
whenever I'm putting something inside my
import section if you don't know what
import sections are just hold that
thought for two more minutes and then i
will show you what it is so in my import
section whenever I start something with
app it will know oh so I'll need to look
in the folder called app which it
happens to be this folded inside my
application whenever I see something
like n p.m. i will have to you look into
the node modules folder and then go you
know and look for this at angular core
bundle score um DJ s and so on so all
those things are actually part of my of
my configuration of system jail so I'm
just helping my environment to
understand how it should work and then
I'm doing stuff like creating different
packages I can say for each and every
one of them how to behave so for
instance if someone wants to use the app
package will say the entry point the
main method of that particular package
is main.js file of course I don't have
any main.js I have a main TS file but
when I compile that it would be
transformed into a nap into a main.js
file and then I'm saying the default
extension is Jas what default extension
JS does it helps me save my keystrokes
and I don't know if you if you're
familiar with Scott Hanselman he was
doing the keynote last night he always
says that people have a limited number
of keystrokes so you should use them
wisely
you know sparsely so by putting that
here it means that whenever I say to I
say in my in my file that I want to
import from something i don't have to
put a dot chess at the end of every
single every single name out there so
that's why I'm using the default
extension and that's actually all for my
application so going back to index HTML
when I say import up what I'm actually
saying I'm saying go to the app folder
and look for the entry point which was
the main TS file and from there please
start my application now next part here
it's a body and then I have a tag here
called my up my up is nothing that is an
HTML standard but what I having said
instead I have my application might I
have my angular application defining
what my app is and again I will show you
in a minute where that comes from so the
very first thing we need to define it's
a module now my module it's a way for me
to put stuff together to create reusable
pieces of code so i create you know if i
have them if i have a feature here i
will put it in a module and in there
i'll have all the all the declarations
or the directives all the components
that i want to create and so on
including the imports meaning if i have
dependencies on another module then
that's where i was specified them again
if you remember how you've done stuff in
angular 1 you whenever you declare a
module ii declared the mode you'll by
name and then you specify all the
dependencies now maybe I want I was a
little bit too quick let me go back to
the very first line of code the very
first thing I'm saying there please
import ng module from angular core what
I'm actually saying is that inside the
file angular core which if we go back to
system config J as we will see there
exactly which file it is I note that you
have a definition of something called ng
module then ng module I will use later
here this one because it has an ad in
front of it it's called a decorator how
many of you are familiar with decorators
very few okay how many of you are
familiar with attributes
meta programming and metadata okay so
what I'm saying here please enter this
class I want you to add extra
information it has nothing to do with
the implementation itself it's ambient
information about my class nobody cares
at least inside my inside my class I
don't care about the ambience interior I
could just take this class and then move
it and somewhere else and just work with
it but because angular knows about this
particular decorator it will say okay so
you want me to use this up module class
as a module oh and by the way you want
me inside that class to add all those
components to create a declaration to do
a bootstrapping to do some importing
maybe some exporting because I would you
know some modules might be reused in
other applications so please shove all
those inside there and create this you
know this starting point for my
application now inside the declarations
you need to put all the components that
you want to use even inside the module
if you don't have stuff inside that then
angular will tell you at some point
sorry but I don't see any import for
that particular for that particular
component or for that particular
directive are you sure that that what
you want to do because I don't see it
where it comes from and then i'm using
up module and I'm saying okay for in
order for this module to work I need to
import another mode you'll call the
browser module this is the one that does
all the Dom manipulation and all the
stuff where I got my you know where it
knows about my interpolations and my
band and the data bindings that I want
to use inside my application and then I
say I want you to start from the app
component which are component in its
turn it's a class that has nothing more
or less inity just have a definition
another thing that's in there is
actually the component decorator again a
decorator we've seen it before and then
its angular that is its familiar with it
it knows about it and it says oh so you
want this class now to act as a
component so how would you like to use
it well if someone inside the HTML that
you will parse so when you start the
angular application angular 2 has a
compiler
and it goes and parses all the HTML that
it finds and it tries to make sense out
of them so it says oh so inside this you
want me to do to do stuff like you know
like look for a selector selector it's a
css3 selector if you worked with you
know with CSS or with jquery that should
be very familiar so whenever you work
you know where you set dollar you know
whatever selector II put in the
parenthesis that's what you would do
here so what what would happen is that
my when when angular sees this file here
index.html and it sees my app it will
say oh so actually you want me to put
whatever your tube to invoke that
component now that component if I go
back here it has a template template
it's actually the HTML that I want to
use attempt so if you look at the
definitions actually a template
component is nothing more than a
directive that hasn't that has an HD
component it's a directive that has a
template so if you don't have anything
to show or if you are just behavioral or
you modified up you know the you're if
you're a structural directive then you
don't have to be a component but a
component is everything else so when you
were working with with directives most
of the directives you are creating were
actually components some of them were
behavioral where you would go and you
know make maybe add some some
functionality to the existing elements
or to your own elements but most of the
time you were just creating components
to combine them together and yeah
because we are in legoland to create
like a Lego you know like a Lego
application or put stuff together in
order for them to work so what I'm
saying here is that whenever you see my
up please use this piece of HTML there
is one more thing left here which I
skipped over which is my main entry
point the main entry point you know like
in every application you have void main
void or whatever you want to you know
you call it in whatever application here
is the main TS which was you know which
is the very first one that i'm importing
when I'm this is you know this is a copy
and pasting that you'll always do the
main the main module inside your
application the Google recommendation is
to call it up module the main component
you should call it up component and so
on so what I'm saying here is that
import the platform browser dynamic so I
want you to do a dynamic compilation of
the of the content of the files and then
I want you to import the app module from
the file called up module if you
remember I told you that my default
extension is jas so i don't have to say
ab dot module DOJ's i can just say up
module and then the no then everything
else is done automatically I create a
platformer bra a platform browser
dynamic and then with this one I would
say please start the application from
app module so that's what we'll do and
then it will go inside my module it will
see the bootstrap component and it will
boot up this component which will say
whenever you see in my app please use
that my up and then replace it with this
so with that being said I can just go
here now and just run this i would say
npm start what npm started runs two
things one it runs the typescript
compiler and then the second stuff that
it does it runs the typescript compiler
in watch mode meaning that whatever
changes I'm making it will automatically
reflecting here after recompilation so
let me do this okay where are you like
this
likely so whatever change I'm making
here it should be reflected in here so
if i say my second angular up it should
recompile and then it should be shown in
here as simple as that so it makes it
much easier for me to actually do
development of course I won't do it on
one screen I do it on three because I
need the CSS on the other one and
actually stack overflow let's be honest
you know on the third one so yeah you
need to you need to have this to have
this in front of you one other thing I'm
doing when I'm doing these kind of
things I do like this f12 just to have
all the information down here so I
understand what's happening I have two
errors let's see what they are saying if
there is any interesting one here or not
in the console come on I think it will
tell me that it cannot find the
style.css and the econ file I'm okay
with that I I forgot to copy the style
file that's okay so now we can start
working a little bit with our angular
application so the very first thing i
would like to show you i have this class
now we can do stuff like data binding
now data binding became in angular 2 it
became one-way data binding the world
lot of discussions a lot of people said
that angular got actually scared by
Facebook and react because react does
not really use does not really use data
binding what it has one-way data binding
everything else it's event-based and
they said we want to do something
similar so why not doing doing that so
i'm creating let's do something like
this i'm creating a variable i will call
it date I and I'll give it a value of TB
and then I want to use this one inside
my template now this is a string he is 6
introduced something called the
multi-line string but you do that using
the back tick like this and then of
course you can add enters you can do
whatever you want we did the delete and
this one perfect so now i can create
actually a multi-line string out of this
one and make it easier how many of you
have
reactor yes whew okay it's actually why
I I start to like it I still hate the
fact that I have to put HTML with
JavaScript of case of course you'll tell
me no it's not it's gsx I I am Not sure
I heard all the stories and all the
arguments I've been in this industry for
way too long to realize when you have
spaghetti code you are actually asking
for for trouble it might work but I'm
not sure so I always you know I always
like to actually separate my HTML from
my JavaScript even when you know we used
it and we said you are not allowed to
use any JavaScript win inside your
render function you know like you just
do the rendering the way it's supposed
to be done and you still get people
doing all kind of mixed things you know
it's been the same you know over and
over and I don't know other people if
they don't let their history that's what
they end up doing you know they think
that they can do better than and their
precursors and it turns out sometimes
they don't but let's move back here so I
created that and now this is actually a
simple HTML i would say deve and then of
course with my dear i would put here the
data so this is my very first data
binding it's a one-way data binding so
it doesn't send anything back it just
looks inside my model inside my
component class and it finds that I have
a prior variable called date or actually
a field called data it will take this
value and it will show it in there so if
I'm saving this it will recompile and
it's supposed to show something in here
yes you're right because this is not a
data type him thank you you see Stack
Overflow would have helped with that so
going back here right now I have this
i'm showing that i'm showing the things
and I can you know I can I can work with
it I can use one-way data binding in a
different way I can bind to different
properties one of the properties would
be styles not color and then of course
styles it's one of the known attributes
and it takes
it's actually a style subject so
whatever stuff I can put in there like
the color background color font and
whatever I can actually put in here as
well and now I need to shop in a value
and the value needs to be a name of a
color I can't put red like this because
if i put red like this it would actually
start looking for a variable called red
and it doesn't find it i need to put a
string red so I can do like this instead
and save it so if i put the string red
then it will show TB in red Stiles dot
color is red okay save maybe this one
tied know why not because it's a
singular style like this sorry so the
style of color it's red so then you get
it like this now again this is a one-way
data binding I can do more I can go in
here and take some data and I would say
you know what I want to create an input
element and then i would say input type
equals text and then i would say of
course the value of that text would be
the data that we just add it look
so now i have to be in here it's exactly
the same data but what I want normally
is when i use stuff like input elements
i want the data whenever i change it to
be out a bulimic now i don't get the
chance to I don't have to you know the
possibility to get the data so what I
can do it's to specify not that I want
the data and the way you do that you say
that whenever someone changes the input
that's an event now so that's the other
way data binding I will say the data
binding one way to source so I'm sending
data back now but this is a method so
this is an event it expects me to send
the JavaScript method so the way this
will work would be to either write a
method or actually write the code
directly so I could stay something like
this dot event dot target both value
equals data so i can save that now and
now whenever i'm changing something i
have a two-way data binding now it's a
kind of two-way data binding and the
thing that the reason they read they say
that we don't want it to be to be
everywhere it's because that was
creating a lot of issues with all those
you know digest cycles and older you
know observe of observing of all the
changes inside the input were creating a
lot of issues and then you get a digest
cycle that triggers another digest cycle
and so on and so on so they wanted to
avoid this and that's the way they did
it but now it becomes a little bit too
cumbersome and every single time when I
want to do something if I have to do it
this way it feels a little bit too much
so one way to alleviate this problem is
to start using different to use a
different approach and that different
approach is to use something called ng
model of course when you use ng model
this being too way you need to do it in
a you know a little bit different you
need to say that is both you know one
way from source and one way to source
and you use something that they call the
banana in the box why it's called banana
in the box because it looks like you
know if you remove this it looks like a
box on the outside and then the banana
on the inside you know so that's why
they call it like this there is another
practical reason for that every time at
least at the beginning you see didn't
think so which was the right one inside
the you know inside the parentheses or
the parentheses inside the right one so
now when you think about it is banana in
a box you know exactly what you have to
do so it's like this now if I just save
this and say use ng-model it will tell
me sorry I have no idea what ng model is
again I have the error here if I look at
ever it's actually quite explicit
another thing so if you you know if you
look at the error message now it's much
it makes much more sense it says
something like I can't can't bind to ng
models it isn't it isn't a known
property meaning that I have something
that it's missing so yeah this is where
I find it i don't really know exactly
what's happening so maybe you should
show you should tell me where ng model
comes from so now what I have to do I
have to go back into my module and say
oh by the way we have some dependencies
here so one of the dependencies will be
import import come on it's called the
forms module because now we are we want
to use stuff like you know related to
two forms input and then it's from
angular / form forms semicolon and then
i would say please import that module so
make make this module and its content
available to whatever components I have
inside my inside my module so if I'm
going back and saving now we will see
that this is back here and i can do
changes and everything will show their
one more thing i can do with that going
to my component by the way i can go back
here into my Visual Studio code and
change a little bit my references and
the way i'll do it i will say that i
want to exclude some of them some of the
files let me go back here i think i have
here somewhere settings then go back
here and what it does it actually
removes my javascript files and my
JavaScript map files so let me show you
how it looks like it looks like this it
says whenever you see a dot J's file if
there is already a TS file with the same
name please remove the GS file if you
see a J's map file if you see something
that you know like a JS file already
there please do not show me everything
else so it makes it much easier to for
me to do that how much 10 minutes ok
good so we got we got that far now so
let's see if we go back now here let's
take this one so let's show it in here
let's do this this is to know come on
this is already made this is the k1 okay
and then this one in here so then we
have back this one okay so now we have
this one of the things you know the data
is hard-coded so I'd like to get the
data from a service so another good
thing and another you know things that
they've done actually very good it's to
add that the dependency injection so I
can say something like create a new file
that would be my upload service dot TS
this is a service which is export
whenever I need something to be visible
outside I need to export so if you get
errors and telling you okay you tell me
about the app service but I don't seem
to find it you know that you forgot
actually to export the class itself
export class up service and then I'm
saying actually no parentheses here
sorry for that let me close this app
service and then inside my app service I
have a method called get name and then
of course the name would be returned
from service TB okay so we know it comes
from the service and now I can go here
into the app component and inside my app
component i would say import app dot
service no observatory from up dot
service and it's in my current folder so
i can use that and then it's saved
nothing changed actually so it doesn't
make any difference but now i need this
one to be part of my application so i
would have to or to be part of my
dependency injection so i would say
providers and i will add up service as a
provider o.k of service here and in
order to have that injected i need to
add it inside my semi constructor so
constructor and in the constructor i
have an application object private
actually SVC service object of the type
app service so if you remember reflect
metadata that i was showing you as one
of the packages now what it does it
looks here and it says okay so no you
now you have a typescript file and you
want to inject in that one an object of
the type of service so what angular does
it looks into my providers because
without this provider it doesn't know
exactly what an appt services and how to
instantiate it so it will create an
instance of that one now the nice part
is that every single child components or
whatever component i'm using now in this
component will use this instance so all
the services are Singleton's so if i
need to create the second singleton I
know it sounds a little bit you know
devious even you know because it's not
really singleton anymore I need to
specify it at a different level so if I
need a chilled a child component to have
a different instance of that service I
would need to specify it again inside
the providers list if I don't then
the component will go to its parent to
to its parent to its parent until you
reach the module and then we to look at
all the dependent modules I have as well
so all the imports as well will be taken
into the consideration in order to find
the information about the service where
it is actually injected so now I want to
use this I would say something like SVC
dot get name and this one I will
actually say this dot theta equals days
so one of the mistakes I'm always making
you know it's forget to put the DS
because C sharp background you know
tells me that this it's always you know
it's always the implicit one typescript
requires you to do that so if you'll see
you're never saying data is not defined
just see if it's not something that you
missed so now it shows from service TB
of course inside the constructor you
should not do any of those kind of
things you shouldn't call other services
one of the biggest problem we might have
here is you know when when you start
calling out to services that are are
actually a synchronous or services that
take a little bit longer so one way to
do that is to use a event hook life
cycle called on in it so let me do this
I will do an own in it so my up
component yes will do an implementation
implement on in it on in it but on in it
does it says oh you need to have a
method here called ng own in it and then
the energy on init method will be
automatically invoked so I can do this
inside my and join init method the
implements only in it is actually not
really necessary because JavaScript
doesn't care about the interfaces but
it's very good for me because then it
makes me honest it makes me not forget
to add the engine in it so if I put it
there at the component level I would
know for sure that I have to do that
there are others like ondestroy so
unload and so on so they are the
predefined which you can which you can
use so again now it's working if
now to call it HTTP service I can do
that now there is one more thing that I
need to do with my service because my
service might not live in isolation
let's assume that this service would
like to use now an HTTP service to
invoke the data what I'll have to do I
will have to decorate this one with a
net with a decorator called injectable
injectable again the name might be
misleading because you might think oh
this means that this one it's an
injectable service all of them are
injectable by default when you add
injectable you say oh actually I want to
be part of dependency injection and
whenever you see a dependency inside the
service go up the stock and find the
dependency it's also included in there
let me show you the final say solution
yeah yes just just quick i want to show
you that some the end solution here with
with the service I have the up service
and I say I need a I need a dependency
on the HTTP service and because I inject
HTTP service automatically I can use the
HTTP service as a dependency without its
injectable I will get an error telling
me sorry I don't find injectable 50
minutes I don't know how you know how
good it is to get a good introduction
hopefully you get enough information or
at least a good you know tasting menu so
you will go out there and try to use it
if you really interested I don't know if
there is an interest under code show me
the hand and I can put it on my github
okay then I'll put that you'll see the
routing as well so it's github.com /
Tibor 19 I would actually add now I have
to give you the presentation I would add
on the last slide that the github repo
name so you can you can get it from the
presentation we've talked about some of
the stuff we looked at out of the box
stuff like you know forms and ng module
we looked up not really looked but there
is an HTTP service one thing you'd have
to work out is to look at reactive
extensions if you worked a lot with
promises and if you don't want to spend
time into the reactive extensions world
just remember one single function it's
called to promise and then that will
solve you know it will bring you back to
the promised land you know not to
observable land
pun intended thank you
we got a lot of questions and we only
have two minutes okay you got to be
quick there's one here do you recommend
migrating existing production angular 1
to angular 2 migration is a it's a
strong word you know how I i don't know
i know i know angular tries to sell the
story that is very easy to do the
migration I will tell you from my own
experience you know like not with
angular but with other frameworks you
know in spite of the you know the
promises they are making or the observed
observations they are trying to make you
know it still it still doesn't doesn't
work as easy you know go back 10 years
and talk with Microsoft and they'll tell
you sp2 asp.net is like these do you
know vb you know vb.net you know they
were just using exactly the same
marketing trick to to keep you on board
with their things if you don't have
performance problems 1.5 it's still you
know it's a very good version try to
migrate 1.5 stay to it for as long as
you can you can steal the development
Google will continue to support it and
they will continue to to invest in it
and to continue to actually improve it I
you know I'm a consultant and i'll give
it up you know the two words answer it
depends yeah look at your your your
things yes I think we've got 30 seconds
or something in what use case do you
prefer and glutes you would wreck is 0
so thank you are too is very very quick
yep line-of-business applications big
enterprise applications is very good if
you have a lot of data that comes from
the server you know we'd react the react
actually shines at that like you know
you have a lot of subscriptions that you
need to make on the server and then you
need to update only partial size of the
screen I think react is far more better
than angular at the moment but they are
working there is a war going on you know
it's a quiet work at the moment again if
you have stuff like Facebook where you
have a stream of data and always
updating you know you don't want to
refresh the whole screen you don't want
to do a lot of components around that
needs to be rear-ended I would
I would use reactor it's the perfect you
know use case scenario and they are
using it perfectly while stuff like
Gmail you know where you have a lot of
data that you need to read and you need
to update and you have a lot of
independent things that might need to
work with with each other angular 2
might be dancer thank you all for coming
and give him an extra mile thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
