petit penning work for Angie I see that
the line has found its way to the top of
this nice billboard good to see that
well case is getting our gear ready for
the presentation let me start with the
introduction so we're going to tell you
something about what blockchain means
for developers and I couldn't be happier
than than standing here in front of you
today because go to in its statements
about what its purpose is states that
this is about lifelong learning and for
developers by developers and especially
the lifelong learning part resonated
with me ever since I was a very curious
inquisitive little boy growing up in a
house that had a few books learning has
been has been a key part of of who I am
and how I've made my way through life
when I was 8 years old
I convinced my mother to become a member
of the public library and ever after
ever since every week I went to the
library got my books you got my learning
and I haven't stopped reading and
learning ever since so very nice to be
here
part of my storyline actually is not
just about learning but also about
unlearning because we feel that this
technology is actually so different and
so new that part of making this work for
you and part of becoming a meaningful
member in into this wonderful world
it's about unlearning and that's what we
what we got to tell you I'm gonna start
regardless of the resolution okay
you all you all have the app please do
not hesitate to ask your question via
app and certainly give us or give us a
rating because that's very important for
us and for the future of this event
we're going to tell you about how
today's reality actually looks like from
our perspective tell you a bit about
Bitcoin tell me a bit about
aetherium literally the impact on you as
a as a software engineer and what ing is
doing at the moment who of you actually
owns Bitcoin fair amounts aetherium a
bit less and the other cryptocurrencies
good good good we have a good audience
great ok so if I can get the clicker
then yes I will click myself through the
presentation I feel a bit like a deer in
headlights in this in this room so the
room is very dark for me I hope you can
see me well because I have a lot of
light on me but if that's the impression
that and that's the background so let's
start about today's reality how do we
build applications basically what we do
is you are part of an organization or
you put yourself into the perspective of
being part of an organization and you
model your world accordingly the object
that you have the domain
level specifics that you have are from
within an organization and then
subsequently you build software or you
buy software and then you integrate that
and you put it into a data center or you
put it into the cloud okay so now I have
given this talk a few times before the
example we give here of modeling is from
a educational organization so higher
level education universities but you
could take any domain it could be a bank
could be telco could be anything
so what the way you model the world
purely depends on the perspective you
take this picture says very simply that
depending on where you stand here this
is what you will use to describe your
world but more fundamentally you get
various versions of the truth in this
picture the the circle is just as true
as the square now if you try to
recognize reconcile them and then you
run interpreting the problems so what do
you do technically speaking you create a
class diagram you create some attributes
methods relationships between objects
and you build it with a front-end
application layer database tier and then
you implement it further technically
into what is here a database scheme and
every organization does it like this so
the example I gave you here very briefly
of the world of University which which
has students which has teachers and and
courses each and every educational
organization has varieties of that kind
of model within the boundaries of its
own organization so and here you see a
large set of logos of universities and
and you can see the difficulty with
every organization modeling it
own part of the world from its own
perspective and having its own set of
data it replicates a lot but you also
get a lot of differences and if you've
ever tried to get your grades
transferred or your diploma transferred
from one education organization to the
other you know the incompatibilities and
the difficulties in getting these
information exchanged so that way of
modeling is actually quite inefficient
it's inefficient because of the
boundaries of a single organization
within which you work but that is
today's reality that that's how we do it
so it's not not very efficient
it creates huge amounts of redundancies
and how do you keep it safe this data
within a single organization basically
you store your data in a database as we
just described and then you get all
kinds of measures to keep your data safe
so you define which version is
production you define who has access you
define logical access controls you
define network access controls fraud
detection mechanism all kind of measures
to protect your data and in the end with
all these versions of the truth lying
around how do you know that your version
is correct you reconcile because you
think that maybe there is a very a
version of the truth out there that
should be in sync with you and then you
start reconciling that's basically how
it works today so they're just used to
illustrate you you store it physically
in a data center you have access
controls very extensive security control
frameworks and then you hope that your
data is well protected and safe and well
let's have a look how that's working for
us the reality is that almost on a daily
basis we are confronted with all kinds
of hacks data breaches software being
malicious software being installed and
there is no really no end to the number
of cyber threats that we are facing on a
day-by-day basis so the current way we
do application development is not only
very redundant because each and every
organization has its own data it's also
very very difficult I won't say
impossible but at least very very
difficult to make it secure and with all
of us relying more and more on these
solutions it is increasingly becoming a
problem so and that's where our story
then starts about a new paradigm and
what I just explained to you about how
we do it today
that's the unlearning part that's really
the part that you will have to leave
behind that that is going forward so
flawed because of his redundancy and
because of the inherent insecurity
that's a paradigm that we will have to
leave behind all the Bitcoin let's see
how it started it started with a white
paper by a person who called himself
Satoshi Nakamoto and if you want to do
yourself a favor and indulge in reading
a document that that is that is
outstanding and it's crystal clear
thinking and writing please read this
white paper because it is a marvel of
clear thinking a clear writing it's we
can't give a person and that's your
personal credit because it we don't know
who the real world person is behind the
pseudonym but we can only give it the
highest praise launched in 2008 the
white paper software 2009 built upon
dozens and dozens of failed experiments
in the 90s and the early nearly zero so
before 2008 this did not come out of the
blue it was built on many many lessons
learned and I have here
part of the value of Bitcoin and there
you see that first years it literally it
did almost nothing and then 2013 it
showed up show up decline and then a
steady steady growth again so a
fascinating history behind Bitcoin and
this is a screenshot of the market
capitalization of the cryptocurrencies
of February 14th one case and I prepared
this presentation for a lecture guest
lecturer at University at Utrecht so
when we revisit that the market gap
screenshot we saw Wow
should we just replace it with a new
screenshot or should we should we make
you part of the story that that we
experienced that in three months four
months that have gone since we started
this kind of talk something spectacular
spectacular happened just focusing on
the top three Bitcoin 16 billion
etherium 1.1 billion and Ripple 232
million and this is a screenshot of a
week and a half ago I deliberately did
not take street show this morning
because you we can amaze ourselves every
day this was June 4th Bitcoin 41 so it
was 16 now 41 billion aetherium 21
billion up from 1.1 and ripple at 11
billion up from 232 million and this is
real money because you can trade all
these currencies cryptocurrencies on
exchanges so we have witnessed something
truly spectacular if you talk to
economies the first word that comes up
when you see these graphs is bubble
speculation could be true it could also
be that the future is happening as we
speak and
that it's a bit unevenly distributed as
the saying goes but in any case it's
truly spectacular and did not want to
keep this part of the story from you and
maybe the most important thing that
happened in the last three months is
that the dominance of Bitcoin has
fundamentally changed it used to hover
close to ninety percent of the total
cryptocurrency value and today it stands
around 40 percent so a spectacular drop
and there's all kinds of stories popping
up now about when aetherium will take
over Bitcoin as the main cryptocurrency
platform so clearly this is not a random
speculation that there are things
happening here very interesting
movements and huge amounts of money
being involved the before we go to what
it is I told you part of my story is
about the unlearning yeah learning to
forget about how we currently model the
world the new world that case young
explained to you has at its heart
cryptography cryptography has been used
to design from the ground up a
fundamentally new way of modeling our
world and that leads to very unexpected
and new characteristics and you need to
open yourself up about it and
understanding that cryptography is at
the heart of this new thing and that
also makes it going back to the security
flaws that we have in the current way of
working
fundamentally much more sound and secure
than everything we have seen before like
the end of the case to tell us more in
detail about what disease Thank You
Bridget so we just saw added Bitcoin has
many predecessors none of them were
successful and bitcoin was and all the
old coins that were that came after
Bitcoin they are also becoming
more and more more popular that's
because there was something new about
Bitcoin it's decentralized it uses
blockchain technology which allows to
remove a trusted third party but to put
trust in a network where you have these
thousands of independent computers
validating the transactions and
therefore you can trust that what's part
of the network that is true so it's a
peer-to-peer network and there's no
central governing organization the data
is cryptographically protected instead
of storing a plaintext and then build
them all around it it's at the core it's
protected and the trust comes from the
decentralized Network so what does a
decentralized network look like this is
an example of a Bitcoin a network where
you see there's no main organization
controlling at all and there's everybody
who wants to can join or leave this
network at will and there are several
roles to play in this network you see
all these dots every color has a
different meaning the black one is the
mining it means you take part in felt
validating transactions and as you do
that you try to solve computationally
hard puzzle and if you win you get a
reward
in case of Bitcoin you get 12 and 1/2
bitcoins it's worth roughly 30,000 euro
and it's paid out every 10 minutes the
yellow ones
it's a the mind those miners are grouped
sometimes the miners join the efforts in
mining farms and then they have some
specialized protocol to to share the the
mining rewards the blue one it's the
blockchain everybody has a device the
blue dog has a full copy of all the data
you see for instance that the ones below
where there's only the blue one what is
the greenish one it has the wallet
functionalities are simple simplified
payment verification
and the orange one last but not least
that's the networking so whenever you
have a transaction you need to broadcast
it to your peers who then broadcast to
the others etc so you can have different
role fool modes of all the other roles
and it's important to remember there's
no central trusted third party
controlling the network but everybody
plays a role in it and can join or leave
this network so how does it work
distrust from the network to understand
that let's look at the workflow of a
transaction through for example the
Bitcoin network let's say I order a
pizza
i order it through a - resort they
accept bitcoins that means I pay for my
wallet
so I create a transaction and I
digitally sign it with my private key
the transaction is sent to all the nodes
in a network and all the nodes they
collect all the pending transactions so
transactions which are not yet part of a
blockchain
and then they create a block with all
the pending transactions the hash of a
previous block there to be specific the
last block they they trust that's an
eval date that all the transactions in
it are valid then they hash that and
they use that as part of the new block I
did the previous hash assist code
timestamp the hash of all the underlying
transactions they call the we call the
miracle route and the notes it's a
number you can choose at will then if
you hash that then in order for the
block to become valid the hash needs to
meet certain criteria for instance it
needs to start with ten zeros but
unlikely that the first time you hash it
it will so you need to change the nonce
Frenchy's you increment it with 1ru hash
again you do it over and over again
until you find the winning knowns that
work hashing over and over again
that's the
finding that mechanism is called
proof-of-work and if you're the first to
find the winning notes you broadcast the
net the block and you get a mining
reward in return but only if your block
only contains valid transactions so
everybody that validates your block so
that's here you broadcast your block and
if people trust it if you have included
only fail its transactions then all the
blocks which are created afterwards they
will contain the hash of your block the
block you just created so block is a
collection of transactions and the only
reason we have blocks in a blockchain is
because there's overhead on reaching
consensus so we group transactions and
then we get consensus on a on a
collection of transaction so on the
block transaction message with the
sender receiver and information and mind
you a transaction is not necessarily a
payment and bitcoin it is but in newer
generation platforms like for instance
ëthere IAM you can run any kind of
application that you want and send
transactions to it consensus the rules
on accepting a transaction so in case of
Bitcoin is your Bitcoin how you spent
once it doesn't have a valid digital
signature and that the block means the
difficulty requirements the requirements
for the hash puzzle yeah some important
concepts blockchain is distributed
immutable ledger we just saw it's
distributed because everybody has a copy
of all the transactions although all the
data it's a ledger because it's it's
immutable so the state can change but
only by appending offsetting
transactions it's like if you if you
look at the Bitcoin your balance only
gets adjusted by in or out going by
payments
but where does the immutability come
from what we look at here is three
blocks blocks 10 11 and 12 and block 11
has four transactions they see that the
transactions there hatched and every two
transactions are hashed and that's done
over and over again until you end up
with one transaction route the miracle
route the reason that that exists is for
more efficient validation if you want to
validate one transaction you only need
to have the transactions that are in
that branch of the of the route so what
if I would try to change the data that's
in the blockchain say I ordered my
pizzas with the transaction zero you
know what I can lower the amount and
then make it close to to zero and and I
ate the pizza for free
I own the private key so I can add that
part of the of the transaction would be
valid but if I want to do that then hash
0 changes s 0 or 1 and a transaction
route will change that means that the
hash of block 11 will no longer meet the
difficulty requirements it will no
longer start with the number of zeros so
what we'll have to do the hash puzzle
again the mining again and not only do I
have to do that for block 11 but also
for every other block that's added
afterwards because they contain a
previous hash and while I'm doing that
the rest of the network is adding blocks
and so the only way I can keep up or
overtake the main chain is if I own more
than 50% of the hash rate of the network
that's also why in practice we say that
as soon as assets are the more blocks
that are added after the block that
contains your transaction the more final
your transaction become and in practice
we say if six blocks are added then yeah
we say it's practically final it's
practically immutable so so far we
looked at Bitcoin
which we say is the first generation of
blockchain aetherium it's the second
generation
it adds smart contract logic on top well
what does it mean a smart contract it's
a piece of software that can
automatically execute the terms of a
legal contract this term is not new it's
actually from 1994 and and any you can
build any piece of software that can
execute terms of a legal contract but
what makes it so powerful it's the
combination of blockchain because
blockchain provides the trust the
immutability the transparency and if you
combine that with automatically
executing terms of a contract then it
becomes really powerful just think of it
if you have an automatic payments upon
delivery for instance for trade finance
goods are delivered to a ship but
upfront the seller wants to know that
when I deliver it I want to know upfront
that the payer that the buyer will pay
me automatically then you program that
in a smart contract in order to run
business logic on the blockchain ëthere
iam built a virtual machine is there
infield virtual machine because every
node on the network runs the smart
contract logic in order to determine if
your transactions are valid therefore
it's an fully deterministic virtual
machine and it's also properly sandbox
it contains the the concept of gas
because what does it mean for you as a
developer if you program a smart
contract
it means you come to very
computationally expensive tasks because
they're run by everyone in a network you
actually pay some of the built-in
cryptocurrency for execution of your
smart contract so you should make it
very efficient and there's also
limit so if you if you're computational
steps take too long that you hit the gas
limit and the nice thing is there's a
JSON RPC API so in order to talk to the
smart contracts running on etherium you
can basically use any modern language as
long as you can do HTTP calls then you
can send messages to a theory so
programming consists of two parts
there's the client part where there's
the signing and you send gas to e
theorem and there's the part that runs
on the network you see every note runs
the smart code the smart contract logic
you develop it runs it on their own
virtual machine if your transactions are
valid and the smart contracts ends up in
a valid state then your transaction is
added to a block and then the miner gets
to propose a block including the
transaction that you just that is
processed in a smart contract well when
we say Bitcoin is first generation
blockchain and etherium second
generation then there are also the third
generations or that the logos got lost
but there's Bitcoin and aetherium and
the third one is Sakura it's basically
not a blockchain in the sense that they
because they don't use blocks but it is
distributed ledger so you can share
truth and trust that there's hyper
ledger fabric an open source project
with open source governance and also
many contributions from from IBM which
and there's a quorum quorum is an
version of aetherium and basically what
you see with the latter three is that
we're the first use proof of works or
the hash partial to reach consensus the
last three support a hyper larger fabric
and quorum
they have pluggable consensus so it's
not strictly necessary to burn or to
have all the computational waste in
order to solve these puzzles in order to
get consensus but they have a voting
based you can plug you can configure
which mechanism you
for instance voting based consensus
algorithms that still protect you
against nodes that want to cheat and
also these last three block chains they
are suitable for private networks so
there's not necessarily trust between
participants but you do know who it's
who is on it and it's not open for
anyone and the first two there yeah open
for anyone to join Bitcoin any theory so
what does all of this mean for us for us
developers including myself I already
talked or mentioned briefly the energy
consumption if you run something it runs
everywhere on the network make sure you
yeah you program efficiently yeah
alright if you have an infinite loop if
you're in protects you from it but not
every platform protects you from that
you just do a now service through that
on other nodes let's let's look at a
smart contract to see what else it means
for us because these smart contracts
because they run everywhere on the
network it also means it's open source
by definition everybody needs to know
what they're running and it runs
automatically so I've created a very
small piece of logic it's it has some
functionality of a bank you can deposit
money you can do payments and you can
retrieve your balance and I like I said
one of the things that means for you
it's open source for you if you make a
bug if you make a mistake and you
introduce a bug then it's out there for
everybody to see and it's also very hard
to patch now if you have your own local
application and you have your CI CD and
it's a couple of times per day you can
go to production and with a small fix
this is immutably stored you can file
this you send the binaries to an to e
theorem you get you get an address and
it's stored there forever
so if you want to patch it yeah it's not
impossible but it's very difficult so
take these things into consideration at
one concrete example last year there was
a huge investment
and on etherion they made a mistake out
there for everybody to see somebody saw
the security vulnerability he blogged
about it somebody else read the blog and
Exploited it and he stole many ether at
the building cryptocurrency it was worth
fourteen million USD and mind you to
illustrate that how tricky it is I have
recreated the same vulnerability in this
smart contract I thought looks easy to
read it might not be super easy to see
the vulnerability can anybody shout the
line number if you see where the
vulnerability is
in the function execute payment first I
do a balance check do you have
sufficient balance then I do a to call
value which means send ether to this
address and aetherium address can be a
person but it can also be a contract
that means from this contract that I'm
calling here and if I don't specify a
function or a special function name or a
specify a wrong function name in E
theorem you end up in the fallback the
default function that means that from
this function I can enter here back
because my balance was not yet adjusted
that's how I can re-enter and go out
here again etc etc so I have a reentrant
bug which allows me to drain the balance
from the whole contract and only when
I'm done yeah I keep track of a counter
here to avoid hitting the stack limit
when I'm done here
then the balance gets adjusted and now
it gets really interesting because it's
I withdraw so much that I go below zero
but mind you the usual balance it's a
you int so I get a huge balance in
return so then the contracts is
permanently broken afterwards as there
are three things to remember at the gas
usage a program efficiently don't make
mistakes and because they're immutable
and it's also a it's it's nice that it's
JavaScript like this language the
solidity
but you must thoroughly understand what
happens underneath yeah this is a
JavaScript that invokes it sorry it's
it's a bad readable but basically you
have a adjacent object with the
signatures of the functions you are
invoking and you have an address of
where they contract resides and you
invoke it from there so how can we
guarantee this this quality one of the
things that's popular in the blockchain
community is formal verification yeah
well we're all used to using tests
basically simple tests where you prove
that for sure
an input your program is correct but you
never prove that it's for all let's
correct for all inputs and form of
verification does that
so you add formal specification in blue
here and then you have interpreters
that's statically analyze your code to
see if there's if the formal
verification applies for all known
inputs it does creates huge overhead
there's the halting problem
so sometimes it's undetermined if you
would specify that your program would
terminate yes you cannot statically
determine that for all pieces of code
and if you have external calls like what
I previously added to re-entrance where
you called another contract then yeah
you also run into limitations of the
often method so other languages what
they do is a theorem is Turing complete
but there are also other languages like
Bitcoin scripting which are very limited
and then you don't have this reentrant
so that's another way to prevent these
these bugs
we believe in Turing completeness but
with thorough verification aetherium
supports this with y3 to framework on
top of solidity all right but what does
blockchain mean for ing who of you
thinks that blockchain is a threat for
banks like us okay that's quite some
well let me let me start by explaining
that's thank you with every new
technology things change existing
business models change there's new
opportunities but there's also existing
business models that disappeared
for instance when mp3 was invented there
were the Napster's of this world that's
understood it and they built nice nice
application with it and there were also
the traditional record labels they just
spend money on lawyers trying to combat
that to fight that so it's the same for
us and
for blockchain it's crucial for us that
we need to understand it understand
technology build use cases with it
because the world is changing because of
blockchain and to illustrate how
business models change with new
technology
just imagine what YouTube would have
looked like without the internet now
that would have like these huge boxes of
videos sending them around cat in a box
Lady Gaga parodies some some music also
and mind you this is how Netflix started
more or less they were sending out VHS
videos to to customers and because of
internet they they started also changing
their business model adapting it because
they understood the technology and they
adjusted themselves and to see how
blockchain changes business models let's
look at some startups for instance you
port where you manage your identity and
you manage who gets to see what part of
your identity
follow my vote voting on a blockchain
guts that combats music concerts ticket
fraud there were normally illegal
traders just buy everything in the sell
it for a huge amount audio music
platform you pay directly to the artist
whenever you listen to to the music and
ever ledger that keeps track of the
origin of luxury goods the origin and
the ownership of luxury goods
so for us we aim to thoroughly
understand the technology and that's why
we do these things like the platform
comparison that you saw earlier on but
we also research the fundamental
technology the underlying cryptography
for instance how can you make a whole
network validates data without
disclosing the data as your knowledge
proofs homomorphic encryption are those
kind of things we look at different
consoles consensus algorithms every
consensus algorithm has its own pros and
cons proof of work as you
energy waste but it is very secure and
obviously we develop applications to see
where it's the most the best fit and one
application that is probably known is
the trade finance application where
there's an automatic payment once goods
are delivered where we now have a bank
guarantees which are paper a piece of
paper which are physically sent over the
world because that previous attempts to
automate this paper trail they all
failed because you cannot build a
centralized system that everybody in the
whole world trusts and it is a trade
finance use cases it's always about
trades across across the globe so you
need a decentralized system that
everybody can trust and then you can
automate that that process that's one of
the things we're doing but I think it's
not hard to imagine if you look at the
unique characteristics of blockchain so
providing trust immutability
decentralization and if you look at the
products and services that we as a bank
