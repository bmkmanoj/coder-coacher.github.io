first of all so Kate and I worked
together first a little digital agency a
few years ago Kate came in to primarily
to look at marketing and I immediately
grabbed her and so great I need I need
you I need you to help us kind of
promote the technology capability of the
company I need you to help us with
hiring people in and that sort of thing
I'm a great believer in the Drucker
quotes it's the two things of value in
an organization are our innovation and
marketing because if you have all the
innovation in the world if you can't
tell people about it then it's Tina it's
you're hiding you're hiding a light
under a bushel what was great about Kay
is that she came and sat with us
engineers she wanted to see honest if
you want me to talk about this company
if you want me to to be part of
marketing you I need to know how you
work I need to sit with you and work
with you and the real benefit to me and
to the company was that Kate's inside
Kate's practice started affecting the
way we actually worked so I started
learning an awful lot from Kate and
we've you know we've remained friends
and colleagues since even though we've
gone our separate ways and I'm working
different places and when I joined the
agency I had done so because I wanted to
get back involved with tech I had worked
with early-stage startups for a long
time and then I had stepped away for a
while and I loved watching Chris with
his team because he was always pushing
them to learn to experiment to try
different things and I thought it was
absolutely fantastic Chris is the person
that introduced me to agile so many
things about that reflect and match the
values that I have when I work in any
business of any size at any stage of
development but the other thing I really
noticed Chris was that he was trying to
convince his teammates to work
differently to try things to be brave to
be bold and it didn't always go very
well so so we began this habit of
meeting on Friday afternoons for a glass
of wine because we had this pledge to
each other that what we would not do was
take home our frustrations of the week
to our families and our loved ones only
and it was in one of these sessions
where I was I was my wit's end having
any failed to achieve something that I
thought was was achievable and clearly
was going about it the wrong way wasn't
bringing people people with me that I
learned about Kate's background in
electoral politics I knew I knew about
her marketing smarts but I didn't know
that behind this was this this rich
experience in electoral politics and she
just like gently introducing me to some
tools that I was then able to go and
directly apply and I still apply today I
still use them in situations today and
they were there was there were super
useful tools and that's there's four of
them that we're going to talk about
today I I had the pleasure and many many
years ago of working with two people who
actually were sort of the founders of
modern political campaign strategy and
we'll come on to the fact that what
they've done has been in many ways
tortured particularly in the last few
years but as a strategy they had sort of
ten key principles and as Chris said
today we're going to cover four of them
with you vision segmentation to find
deliver and claim and polling and you
might be asking yourself although you're
kind enough to come here with the title
that it had why am i listening to
anything that involves electoral
politics and it's because a political
campaign does something really quite
extraordinary for good or for bad
it does it brings millions of people
together for a moment in time it helps
them develop common ground and a reason
to be together that actually doesn't
happen at any other point in their lives
for the most part they do this by
finding ways to bring people together
things that relate to their values their
priorities it is done when it's done
well and when it's done honestly it is
really quite an exciting thing and
that's what I remember from when I
worked in campaigns again a couple of
decades ago but that's what you're
looking for
the thing that I'd like to remember to
sort of call to your attention today is
what not to do with the campaign so this
is David Sawyer he's one of the
granddad's of modern political campaign
strategy he's now dead but David always
really talked about the need to respect
the voters the need to have that
dialogue they need to listen to them it
is an amount just yelling at them and
telling them what to do a properly run
campaign is taking the time and in
applying these lessons to business that
becomes as important and consistent with
some of the things you've heard if
you've been in this track today or in
yesterday's track that was hosted by
Katherine you actually want to treat
people with respect and you want to find
ways to have that meaningful dialogue
with them and this is what we're this is
what we're not talking about so this is
when you kind of have the the tools and
techniques that Kate introduced me to
and that I use and and we use together
when we work together you can use them
they're effective you can use them for
you know for a purpose that is not it
for the benefit of humanity or is not
for that it's not for not necessarily
agreeable so there's a what we when
we're talking about politics and we're
talking about the kinds of tools from
from politics we're not talking about
this and we're not seeking to encourage
or endorse this in any way so we'll
start with vision so the thing about
vision is that you can say a lot of
things to people words really do matter
but if you want to develop common ground
if you want to pull people in with you
if you want them to say you match my
values you match my priorities I want to
stand alongside with you think about a
work situation if you want to do this
there's some certain things about a
political vision that you might choose
to apply I think that's a really
important point that Chris and I wish to
make now the things that we're sharing
with you today you don't have to do it's
not essential but we're sharing them
with you because I've applied them for a
very long time in business situations
Chris is going to tell you his story and
we just hope that they might be useful
for you so when you're talking about a
vision this is a book that you may want
to read you may not it's really thick
it's really dull I'm a product of the
American educational system Chris liked
it but for me it got a little dry but
the purpose of this book it was written
in 2008 which now seems decades ago he's
it made something very clear that we've
known for a really long time that if you
want to bring people with you if you
want to encourage them to change their
opinion or to think a little bit
differently you have to have a blend you
have to have the facts you have to have
the rationale you have to have if you
joined me yesterday some version of the
truth but you also do have to have that
emotion you have to give them a reason
for wanting to be part of it yeah and
indeed if you think Americans who cry at
stupid things and make every film have a
happy ending are the only ones that did
this well indeed we probably learned a
lot of it from the
it's the power of language is incredible
and it was in tough times that people
like Nelson Elizabeth the first others
people all over the world have said
things that made people rethink and want
to be part of that particular movement
they wanted to be part of that common
ground but it doesn't always work it
doesn't say we just had an election in
the UK which was a result of which was
it was a major upset it's really
disrupted politics it's made some really
some really interesting changes
throughout that election the incumbent
government had a vision they had a
vision which they repeated again and
again their vision was strong and stable
but there was no emotional connection
there was no respect
there was no you would have in
journalists asking a question and rather
than answering the question the person
being asked would say well what we're
doing is we're going to we're going to
produce a strong and stable government
that this country needs it was complete
there was no conversation it was purely
a a soundbite and it became mocked so
the emotional engagement that came about
was was one of derision and sort of
comedy because there was nothing there
was no there was no value to it so we we
do this is a little bit of a health
check because if you want a vision that
really brings people together you can't
be lazy you can't do the Harvard
Business School thing that probably
every single company that you work with
right now sticks up on the wall and
becomes white noise and you ignore if
you want to make a change you've got to
find a way to engage with people that
shows respect and shows interest and so
you have to have that lovely blend not
that manipulative blend but that blend
of emotion and reason fact like Guy
Kawasaki is very interesting on this in
if I was read the art of the star he
talked he talked about mantras and he
has when he's taking something off when
he's trying to focus attention on things
and get things moving he creates a
mantra around it and then also if
anyone's read creativity Inc ed catmull
spoke about the founding of Pixar
there's some there's some some little
sort of vision statements or a little
kind of mattres they had story is King
was one and trust the process was
another and very interestingly
Cantwell's talks about how the the
second one of those the the trust the
process actually kind of derailed them
it actually became
went from being something like yeah
we're all together it's all kind of work
it's all going good - actually it's not
going good it's not we're not working in
the way that we want to but people keep
saying trust the process so we keep
doing it so there was no kind of there
was no sort of thought going into it it
just became this kind of this abstract
thing so I'm gonna talk a bit about the
work context I was in when I first met
Kay and kind of show how this political
stuff kind of applied to to a specific
work context and then and then kind of
generalize a bit around that so I'd say
we were working for this digital agency
we were building a new website for a
chain of gyms in the UK it had a
drop-dead go-live date to coincide with
what the the healthcare and sort of
sports industry called the golden
quarter which is the first three months
of the year where everyone comes out of
their kind of Christmas overeating and
indulgence it says right I'm going to
join the gym I'm going to buy some new
train as it moved all this so we were
working to a fixed deadline that was
when kind of you know TV ads were gonna
run marketing spammers committed all
that sort of thing and we were doing
this not just for as a public facing
thing it also had to work with the
people in the gyms the front-of-house
stuff it was a kind of voucher system
that had to work and we also had a
number of other people that we were
working with we were working with it
with a creative team with a with a
technical team and and various other
people and then I overseeing all of this
was the board of the company who wanted
to know that they've made the right
choice in trusting this big launch to
our agency and that there was going to
be a success and to add to the context
it was a really short period of time
yeah it was long and Chris was trying to
introduce agile ways of working to a
team that had become very comfortable
with waterfall and to a client that had
never heard of such a thing but the time
pressure is the one to really sort of
focus on here yeah yeah so we were
having one of our kind of glass of wine
conversations or I was kind of like you
know I'm I'm not very not very good at
empathizing I don't have a very strong
theory of mind I tend to kind of just
sort of sort of bluntly say oh this was
really no mmm and I was saying this
decay and she said well what's your
vision for this piece of work
what's it what's the outcome you want to
achieve what are you trying to do I said
well it's obvious isn't it we've got to
get this website live I'm gonna put some
automation in place because there isn't
any of the moment
kind of looked at me and well you can
tell me what you told me I just said
there's nothing there's nothing worth
doing there so really you're talking to
yourself yeah you're talking to ten
people
exactly most people won't have any
understanding of why that matters or why
that's important because that's not what
they think they've paid you to do
exactly say so so back and forth some
things with Kate and in having this
conversation it made me realize that the
way I was talking about I was talking
about the wat I wasn't talking about the
Y and by only talking about the war I
was I was appealing to a very small
constituency of people lodging myself
and and it was there was nothing it
there was no emotional engagement there
was nothing there to say you know yeah
get behind it get behind me on this it's
really gonna be great yes the website
did have to be live on time and there
was a sort of some skepticism around why
why automation would be of any benefit
if it was a website that went up once
and then might need a couple of
revisions but there was a there's
nothing here to really really tractable
so after sitting down with Kate and
talking about where I was we came up
with a new vision which was that we
wanted there to be the gyms to have more
members than ever before and in doing
that we're no longer talking about
technology we're no longer talking about
about automated deployment or anything
like that we're talking about a purpose
that far more people can get behind far
more people can have can can say yeah
this is actually something that's worth
me doing and the most interesting thing
about it which was which will come onto
and then next thing we talk about well
it suddenly found I was having
conversations with people that it wasn't
before I was looking beyond my little
small circle of engineers and technical
people and so looking and talking with
people who who actually maybe didn't
even know the product existed before but
then became really important allies in
making the thing a success so if you
think about vision just kind of one last
closing point think about the
conversations you're having if you find
yourself in a situation where it's at an
impasse things aren't moving forward
people are really holding their ground
they simply don't want to bend their
ways ask yourself why am I telling them
they should and challenge yourself is it
something that they can actually relate
to does it fit their values their
purpose why they come to work it's worth
playing around with it a little bit
worth pointing out it's not like Chris
took out banners that said we'll bring
more people in the gym they didn't have
buttons
that they walked around it was just the
way that he began to speak to people
suddenly was more inclusive it let more
people get involved in that conversation
but it's my you said before language
matters and it's a very this is
something that I've only had have
recently really got my head around for
ya actually just by my very choice of
words in kind of the way that I got a
pitch things he suddenly you can go the
conversation can completely change and
you can start talking about things which
are far more sort of tractable and
engaging than they would be otherwise so
the next tool we're going to tell you
about is segmentation political
segmentation and we don't want to force
anything on you but hopefully this one
will be helpful because I use this one
over and over again because there are a
couple of rules in a political campaign
which are actually sort of applicable to
rules in life there's only so much time
you know in the election is you run out
of time there's only so much energy
there are only so many people who be
involved so you can't just go do
everything all the time because you're
gonna run outta time you're gonna run
out of people and you're gonna be so
tired you don't want to say so one of
the first things you do in the campaign
is you just kind of sit down and say
okay let's look at the segmentation
let's look at in the case of most
democracies whatever majority we need to
win because that's the other important
thing about a political campaign you
don't need a hundred percent because
you're never going to get a hundred
percent but you often find if you can
get that majority you can begin to move
forward and you can find ways to do what
you need to do so you start first on the
far left you start with your hard
opposition the thing about the hard
opposition is they're never going to
listen to you they're never going to be
interested in what you have to say for a
whole bunch of reasons that you actually
don't always need to understand they're
just not going to listen so you have to
say in a political campaign how much
effort am I going to put into changing
the mind and getting the support of the
hard opposition it may not be the best
thing to do when you have limited
resources doesn't mean that you
trash-talk them I'm afraid that is
unfortunately an output from modern
campaigns where they just kind of yell
at each other but in when my guys set
this up and I worked with them what we
just said was don't try to change the
minds of people who fall into that hard
opposition risk
them it's okay they can do that don't
use your energy there next to your heart
opposition is your soft opposition they
might listen to you but you're sort of
in that same position they're probably
not going to agree with you on the
majority of things again only so much
time so much resource do you want to
spend all your time trying to debate
sometimes ugly hideous conversations to
get people to change their mind when
they're really comfortable with the way
they feel so in a political campaign you
go to the other side you start thinking
about your heart support your heart
support in a political concept they'll
come out in the rain and the snow and
the ice whatever it takes
they will always be there but here's the
thing they're kind of zealots so they
actually don't bring a lot of people
with them because hard support are so
set in their ways that they're almost as
closed off as your heart opposition it's
really hard for them to think of
anything other than the reason that made
them the hard support so you spend all
your time on the soft support the soft
support are people who have so many
lovely qualities they make you do the
work they make you prove by the things
that you say and the things that you
pledge that they should choose you
because you want to have to do the work
you don't want to be lazy that's what
killed Hillary Clinton she was arrogant
and lazy you don't want to do that you
want to have that dialogue with people
you want to have them listen and you
want to listen back and the other thing
about your soft support is unknowingly
they have a lot of influence on other
people because if you give them the
reasons to choose you they're gonna
start sharing those reasons they're
going to start telling other people and
when they say it it's because they've
chosen it it's their conviction and by
doing this they also influence that
wonderful central category that always
decides in sort of the last 24 hours
the swing they bring people with them
they say in their own words why they've
chosen that candidate or why they
support that issue and that's the most
powerful thing of all people make your
words their words yeah yeah that's
really a mess science being um really
important to me recently is having other
people tell my story form
so the moment I'm CTO for a start-up and
our whole marketing strategy is based
around finding our our allies finding
our soft support and and asking them to
tell our story because they tell it in
their language and it's the and suddenly
it becomes it's not like oh yeah we you
would say it's great because you know
it's your company it's something it's
like it's much it's a much more
effective and and you've earned it
they have doubted you they have asked
questions and your answers have been
suitable for them it's allowed them to
commit to you that makes it real yeah so
this is how I applied it to the context
and I was in this project of getting
this this this this website are pleased
with this new vision of more members
than ever before I could immediately see
what my segmentation looked like I was
absolutely daggers drawn with corporate
IT this company and was a really you
know it was head south going you know
fist to fist on this it was a really
unhealthy set up the hosting partner I
could see was very much the soft
opposition they kind kind of like we
wanted to introduce a sort of a
deployment pipeline based on ansible
that was there was they couldn't see
they couldn't see the point of us doing
this why do you want to do this but we
have a mechanism for for deploying stuff
it's Bob who does it and he does it on
the Tuesday morning and it's like we
were though we were not really making
much kind of much kind of ground kind of
influence them over on the other side we
had an absolutely fantastic sponsor
customer head of content it was her her
idea to do the piece of work she'd then
convinced her company that we were the
people to do it for her so she was our
champion she really kind of Realtors she
had a great team as well the content
team that worked with her and the really
interesting thing about doing the
segmentation exercise was it made me
think about people who I knew existed
but I need them I just needed existed
kind of abstractly oh yeah there are
some people in the chairmen they they're
gonna use the software
Sony was like now these people we need
to be talking to these people that we
need to be actively actively engaging
with and in the run-up to launching this
thing we um there were some issues
around security there were some issues
around usability that really would have
made the thing
tank if we hadn't addressed them and the
way we addressed them was every member
of the software development team week to
the list of all the gyms divided it by
the number of people in the team and we
each phoned up we've made sure that
every gene was phoned up when we spoke
to the person on the front which house
team and said have you heard that
there's this new bit of software being
launched and we just want to have a chat
with you about how you how you can te
digo job on how this might affect your
job and we had a really interesting
range of responses from oh yeah I've
heard about this it sounds really good
- oh god no another thing we've got to
do or why we always having new IT who
hoisted on us and this sort of thing but
it was suddenly it was a it was a
dialogue that was there wouldn't been
there how I not fought like what is my
constituency look like a point I really
must stress here and it's very easy to
kind of when I one of my kind of
misgivings about this when I first saw
it was so like is it really healthy to
kind of to kind of cast people in the
role of your opposition are you really
is you just kind of looking to kind of
accentuate kind of existing
disagreements or what have you and it's
it's not trying to do that at all it's
really trying to make you think about
how what role are you casting people in
how are you setting people up and my
relationship would call for are a tea
after I've done this exercise went from
being something where I fought almost
whether it was my kind of job to kind of
go and have arguments with them to you
know respect their position they've got
a whole load of reasons why they've made
the decisions they have why their
engagement with us is the way it is
carry on working with the people who are
supportive of what you're doing don't
ignore the whole opposition but don't
don't actively put energy into fighting
with them and then see see how you're on
your sort more positive engagement with
the soft support and the swing then
makes things change and change it did
before I move on I just want to say one
thing and I apologize some of you may
have heard yesterday I have this
residual COFF and it could be hideous
like right now
sorry should make a hand signal please
mute I'm gonna coffee so I'm up here
today and in the conversations I had
with Chris a few years ago because of my
political background I left a long time
ago we're sharing this with you today
because in business you wouldn't use
this in the same way you wouldn't a
campaign I I really hope you caught what
Chris just said you wouldn't put this on
the wall
you wouldn't label someone hard
opposition and suddenly enjoy being
enemies but what you're doing is you're
stopping you're just taking a pause and
you're thinking how is this situation
playing out have I really looked at all
the potential conversations I could have
a my casting people in a role that maybe
I could do something about if I decided
to have a different way of having a
conversation with them so that's why we
wanted to share segmentation that's
where it becomes useful not as a way of
creating us them and just embracing
yourself or saying I was right they are
them they are not like me
no and a very very practical way of
applying that is through him who's who's
heard of all used impact mapping codes
in impact mapping it's it's fantastic I
would urge you to go go look at it if
you've not it's what it did for me is it
reintroduce the who into into
understanding requirements and outcomes
are very often would be when you're when
you're specking software developing
software you just think oh well there's
a user or there's somebody who does that
impact mapping makes you stop and think
who is either going to help me succeed
in my goal or might counter me from from
achieving that goal and it was some it
immediately saw how the segmentation
fitted within Pat mapping and engagement
it gave me an incredibly powerful tools
getting far more rich or understanding
of the problem space define delivering
claim is an interesting one because we
live in a world where everyone kind of
assumes that you should get credit for
everything and you should scream about
it and you should make sure that
everyone notices it in the original
political strategy it was there to help
the people who were starting to take an
interest in you and starting to join you
in your common ground be reassured that
they had made a good choice so you
didn't use it to scream you didn't use
it to make big heavily decorated public
events that showed you were powerful or
you were a leader no you used
to reassure them that the values and the
principles that were leading them to
back you were real it was happening over
and over again and so what I found
interesting about the recent French
election was the winner was actually a
candidate who started just as an option
and alternative everybody else had sort
of fallen aside for all sorts of
embarrassing and in some cases shameful
reasons and there were people who just
didn't want to vote for the other
candidate but think about what it became
using this tool of defined delivering
claim just gently reminding people our
party's come from nowhere but our
party's real you're not just voting
against someone you're voting for
something gentle consistent messaging
and when there's a little bit of good
news rather than make a scene with my
American accent it's just totally
logical for you to think she's talking
about hype she's talking about something
I swear I'm not it's the quiet gentle
sort of elegant reminders that things
are going well and the other important
thing would define delivering claim
because I also have a really strong
entrepreneurial background is it calls
on your resilience it's exhausting to
deal with people let's just admit it
be comfortable with it it is we are not
predictable we are not easy we'd like to
hear our voices thank you for listening
to mine and these things take resilience
so in the same way that you would
approach long-distance running cycling
training learning anything do you
remember that define delivering claim is
about the long haul it's about being
willing to show people it is right for
them to want to be part of what you're
part of and just don't be fatigued so
how that kind of applied to the work
that I was doing was a very practical
and tangible thing we did we went from
having a sort of project management and
reporting system where it's like well
how many how many features have we got
left to build what's the rags latest on
them all that sort of stuff to how can
we get visibility of a software to the
right people as early as possible so we
made demos the absolute you know the
central way that we communicate
so we would do demos - first of all we
did demos to the the head of content and
her team and then we we brought in the
the front of house we would we have a
designer and a developer go down to the
gym go and sit with sit with them and
say ok we just want to show you this
this thing here we want to show you
where it's not finished we want to show
you where it where it is so we were
having an active engagement based around
the work and in doing that we got you
know we got we got people to sort of
Ashley believed this was worth doing and
this would actually this was something
tangible and something real that it was
worth them getting behind and worth them
helping us make a success and the most
interesting thing for me as a result of
this far more kind of visible and kind
of active way of talking about the work
is it really got the attention of the
board so the board had had green lighted
the project they said yeah it's fine you
can spend the money on doing this we
think it's a really good idea but other
than that they were pretty hands-off it
was just our report comes out once a
week and they read it and say yeah this
looks like it's on track we turn this
around we made this about seeing where
the work was seeing what had been built
so far what was plan to be built and
accumulated with the board coming and
holding one of their board meetings in
our office and we had a big screen we
showed everything we talked about that
we won't repeat business from his
company and I'm no longer with the
agency but they're now they're now a
pillar client of that agency because the
engagement because we've got the
engagement right on this project and we
got the engagement it's something that
the people were actively interested in
and actively wanted to be to be part of
I think the thing because I just have to
throw this in is when I first started
having this conversation with Chris he
was going insane he has a temper okay he
does and he was really really frustrated
and angry and it was actually quite nice
to sit on the sidelines and I take no
credit for anything he did all the work
I just threw out a couple of tools that
I had learned a long time ago but it was
really nice to see that suddenly the
board of directors of this very very
large UK company started having their
board meetings in the agency's office so
they not only had the demos but they
completely acknowledged the usefulness
of the way of working and the work that
was being done and that was just nice to
see because that won't always happen but
it was big
Chris decided to have different types of
conversations and talk about different
things so the last one is polling and if
you've looked in recent newspaper
articles this just needs to be said any
poll that you see in a newspaper is
usually not accurate and usually not
very well done they're doing it to sell
newspapers it's okay I'm a total fan of
capitalism there's not too many
alternatives but please don't think that
you're getting the best information of
what's going on which is why candidates
go into the field and have their own
polls but then sometimes they just get
arrogant so if you were at all familiar
with the UK elections you might know
that if you were to try to sort out who
these people were the most interesting
thing is that one of them is not the
prime minister of the UK she chose not
to participate in debates that's just a
level of arrogance and indifference that
is unforgivable for people who cast
their vote it really is that is not good
polling so Teresa mace it's where she is
today deeply compromised but I've also
spent the last year being part of an
agile transformation and I have to say
this as an outsider I've watched some of
these agile events be done with such
little commitment and so poorly that you
then have to say if it's an opportunity
can you do it well and this is what I
learned from Chris so one of things I
love about agile methods and knife I
tend now when I'm working with people
working tilicho tend not to use the word
Argyl at all I tend to unpack it and say
these are some of the things we're going
to use we're going to do a retrospective
or we're going to do regular demos or
we're going to work with small batch
sizes and the the feat of what you're
essentially doing is putting feedback
mechanisms in place so throughout this
project and if we went throughout the
work I do now and make sure there are
there are there's a regular cadence with
which you you connect with the people
who are either doing the work or have an
interesting interest in the outcomes of
the work and you put in place mechanisms
that mean you're getting you're having a
meaningful dialogue with them you're
having a you're finding out what's
what's really happening you're finding
out what's not working you're finding
out what is and they on this on this
particular the
project on the Jemez project after we
went live we actually had a really bad
production defect it was a really
embarrassing one because it was it
should never have gone live it was a it
was something to do with location
checking on mobile phones that simply
didn't work and it was a member of the
board that noticed it he said look I'm
up here in the north of England and it's
telling me I'm down in the south we were
able to find and fix that problem really
really quickly and as a result of that
we were then subsequently told by by the
fee that the board member we said you're
being talked about in our company not
because of what went wrong but about how
quickly you fixed it and you fix it so
quickly that very few people actually
knew that it happened so we had this we
had a fit we had feedback mechanism in
place we've created an environment where
conversation and discussion would happen
and you could discuss awkward things you
could discuss difficult things and you
could you could just discuss kind of
responsibility and and you know your you
know what's expected of you as a vendor
to unity to make sure things work and as
a result these conversations as a result
of this piece of work we were asked by
the the chain of gyms to to help them
come up with a kind of flavour for kind
of set of of goals a kind of vision
really for how they would do IT projects
going forward and this was this was kind
of distilled it down to this kind of
addressed issues that were there with
their existing system and this is for me
this is all kind of tables sake stuff if
you're doing anything involving software
these is just this has become kind of
like yeah you've just got to have this
but we introduced this and it became a
it became the hallmark not only of the
subsequent projects we did with this
company but also just became as they
became their playbook for what they did
subsequently so that was that was
gratifying we didn't we didn't I'd gone
from kind of getting really angry with
with the the corporate IT for having
inconsistent environments or having
manual deployment or working in a kind
of in a sort of sort of consumer
supplier relationship with with very
sort of high transaction costs around
conversations to all of this
and it wasn't because it happened
because far more people became
interested in involved in the project
and and then and then wanted some
positive outcomes to happen chris is
being rather humble that request came
from group IT and you may have
remembered in the early segmentation
they were the hard opposition so it is
just the ability to have slightly
different conversations that enable that
so what are the four tools that we
introduced for you today
first one vision you got to establish a
common ground there are a lot of times
in business where people just disagree
because they want to or people disagree
because they don't have all the facts
but if you want to start to have better
conversations be respectful of the fact
that it's a combination of emotional
things things that tap into their values
not talking about tearful tearful or
make them laugh but it's got to tap into
their values the reasons they come to
work benjamin spoke earlier about
purpose these things matter and they
matter more and more and more because of
the type of people we are and the type
of work we do so be respectful of that
if you find someone who's not so
interested in listening to what you have
to say join do segmentation
yeah segmentation I think this is the
this was the most useful one for me and
I use it all the time and I use it even
if I just do a quick sort of mental hang
a minute where am I putting my energy
thing and it comes back to the the kind
of point Kate made at the beginning of
the talk the why an election is a really
interesting model for for business is
it's it's to succeed you need a majority
of people to come together and work
towards a goal for if to it within a
finite amount of time time as Peter
Drucker says time is the executives most
scarce commodity it's very little time
there's an awful lot of options to what
we could be doing we need to we need to
we need to say okay what's the most
important thing for us to be doing and
who's going to help us do that
where should we where can we be having
the fruitful conversations where are we
wasting our time the define delivering
claim is just really important to my
heart I do think segmentation is the
most practical one and the most
beneficial one but this one's really
important to me because this isn't about
letting someone else tell your story
this isn't about screaming because
you're frustrated because no one's
noticing this is about finding quiet
gentle consistent ways to share relevant
information that helps the people who
are starting to join you in this common
ground no
that they've made the right choice
you're rewarding them but it takes
resilience you have to be patient and
you have to keep doing it because if you
get frustrated and say don't they know
what I'm doing it may be because they
haven't heard for awhile and they've you
know they might have been listening to
something from your heart opposition
that might have changed their mind
it is about consistency just being
gentle not screaming and just reminding
people rewarding them for wanting to
listen to you and be part of what you're
doing yeah exactly and then partly
polling provides you the tools to do as
I say I think in agile methods there's a
whole lot of great tools that are
already there so retrospectives demos
the daily stand-up meeting all that sort
of thing
just recently I've been back on the
tools again which I love I love
programming I always I always love to
have an opportunity to do it but as part
of it I know I go through the
peer-review process I got my code ripped
to shreds and then I had to put it back
together but I've got to put it back
together with like learning from these
kids that half my age you really really
know how to do things but it means it so
for me that's the meaningful dialogue
that's saying I'm not just going to say
oh well you know get on and do this and
I'll you know see you at the end of the
project it's I will come in and I will
be part of the work and I will engage
with you on the work and you know and
and understand it better as a result so
we've we've presented these full four
tools
I found them useful Kate's family useful
we hope that there's some stuff that
you'll find useful too and you know
you've you've brought your brain to this
project this this conference if you've
you've made intelligent decisions about
coming here in the first place you're
you're picking up things and you're what
you're seeing do these fit my context or
not we are we're aware of the multitude
of useful tools and techniques that
exist that can be brought to bear in
various contexts and to various problems
and we just want to throw another four
in to add to the kind of the useful
amount of sort of tooling there is for
the these sort of difficult tractable
problems that we all enjoy working with
so I just want to say thank you very
much and I think if it's the time
questions are we</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
