company called innova which is based
here in chicago downtown and you know we
work in the FinTech industry we pretty
much work on you know loan kind of
offering loan products and we have to
work pretty fast in terms of changing
our products so that we comply with
different states during the US or in you
know other countries like UK Canada so
you know being able to develop and move
fast with software being agile is very
important to us like we do like at least
ten releases a week so we're very agile
so multiple multiple it's not because
there are a lot of bugs or anything we
just is continuously where K keep on
improving it you know release often and
darker is something that were actively
investigating in the company to kind of
be more agile being able to move fast so
I'm gonna try to so my role is not to
convince you to use darker but my role
is to kind of inform you as a developer
what benefits it is in using darker and
I hope that you will you know start
playing with it more but before I begin
I want to kind of see what my audience
is like so how many of you have used
docker okay pretty good almost half more
than the quarter at least how many of
you are using docker in production okay
whew yeah so I think most companies are
now at a stage where they're really
playing with it I were trying to get to
play with it and I think in the next
coming year or so we will see more
production level adoption
so it's really great to be able to you
know get in early you know it's still
not too late you know doc has only three
years old we recently you know had a
celebration for the third three-year
darker can we had an event in like
across the US in Chicago as well so it's
it's pretty new you know to get into it
so it's good getting into technology
early on is good because over time
technology is becoming a big complex so
right now it's very easy so that's good
so before i get into dark i just want to
talk about the typical very simple web
service okay so in this case this is
wordpress guys know what wordpress is
one of the most popular blogging
platforms written in PHP so if you're
thinking of running like wordpress you
would generally you know run the
WordPress software which is running on
top of a PHP platform and when you say
PHP you know it's PHP itself is poly
written in C which also links to other
libraries in your environment and
eventually all that is running on top of
an operating system you need a back-end
to kind of store the data so in this
case you know most people run wordpress
on my sequel and again my sequel itself
has libraries and OSS now the devil is
really in the details of you know what
are these libraries what's the version
so what you notice is most people with
what developing wants to be on the
latest software they're probably working
on a OS X versus in prod you're probably
deploying it on a server great operating
system like reddit in a price right and
maybe the day of now doesn't want to use
my Zico you know they're using Maria
which is a fork of my sequel so when you
take this heterogeneous environment what
you'll notice is things sometimes may
not work as you intend and this is when
things start going wrong and then the
dev says well it worked on my machine
and I'm sure this is a very common
popular sentence a famous last word I
mean nowadays
I don't think we have the luxury of as
devs as saying it's ops problem
especially with pagerduty right we can
still get paged at night and they're
going to wake us up so it's in our
interest to kind of deal with this kind
of situation as well so this is one
motivation that we want to go with
darker because it's awesome okay so
coming back to a previous example of the
WordPress what we do is we take that
basic web service and we'd authorize it
you know it's an it's now a worm and
what it is it's pretty much taking the
whole environment that you're you depend
on the WordPress the PHP version is the
libraries and the OS and you package it
up so that they're all intact they're
not decoupled you package it up you put
it in a box a container right you can do
the same thing with my sequel and you
know there is debate about who does this
the common the popular notion is the dev
would do it but in some companies might
say well no it's not the day of they
should do it the DevOps you should do it
who should figure out which versions
this debate about and there's a
different deployment strategies around
that but eventually people agree and
they've stick to one version and that's
the key takeaways they stick to one
thing and then it's all about moving
that image around or moving the recipe
to build the image around from the dev
to QA to prod this is way different from
moving the code around you know where
you push the code to github and then you
pull it down and you build it with a
different environment running underneath
so one thing you'll hear is you know dr.
is like a virtualization technology to
some practical extent it is like a
virtual machine but that would be really
not totally correct it's darker as we
will see as we go along this
presentation is that
the darker way doesn't always blend in
with virtual machines but one of the
similarities virtual machine is that the
whole isolation the bundling you know
the sandbox is a virtual machine thing
for sure but how many things do you
bundle together what's the performance
those things are different from virtual
machines so what is darker if it's not a
virtual machine per se well it's open
source it's a very portable just like
virtual machines portal bring the sense
you can give it to other people
something that's already been built you
can give it to other people but
something that's very different from
virtual machines is it is lightweight
when I say lightweight it means it takes
less resources to run and mini say
resources you're talking about memory
and CPU and this right so all those all
those things a lot lightweight than say
a virtual machine is and but at the
heart of it docker is really not so much
about a virtual machine or virtual
environment but it's really more about
how do you distribute your application
how do you bundle the application so in
a way darker is kind of like you know an
hour p.m. in the redhead world or the
Deb in the Debian world or a dmg in the
macworld it's really up or msi I think
on the Microsoft world it's kind of a
packaging standard format oh so if I
move on it so how is dr. implemented
well right now dr. relies on the Linux
infrastructure to run right so the whole
containerization comes from features
that were added to the Linux kernel i
believe by google the google did some
stuff to the colonel in secret for a
while when they were doing the android
and eventually you know they started
releasing it and one of the things that
it was kind of implementing a security
model where you're you
can you know create a namespace where
all the processes that are tagged with
that namespace cannot be seen by another
process processes that are running in a
different name space so kind of offering
that kind of a sandbox isolation and the
and that stuff is what then the darker
company eventually took and kind of
build this on so you know there's
there's this project that I've been
meaning to try out is called Bakr with a
B which is pretty much trying to
implement dark are using bash a hundred
lines of bash code if you google for
that project you qualifying that it's
not it's a fun project it doesn't mean
it's not trying to take over darker but
just to show that most of the stuff that
doctor is doing is already you know
natively inside inside Linux the other
thing you will hear darker when you hear
about docker is this containers and you
know ships dock yards and things like
that so they tend to they tend to use
the container metaphor as a way of
shipping you know how how packages are
shipped right to put into the
standardized sized unit call a container
and the the people who ship the stuff
don't know what's inside it's kind of
like how they were you know the ops
people deal with it so the devs would
put what goes inside the container and
they're responsible for it but once you
put it in the ops operations would move
it around make sure it's it's it's it
gets to the right place right so that's
kind of the separation that you have
with darker but I think it also enables
more collaboration between the cysts
admins and the devs and the keyway
because one of the things you see in
companies is that you know it's us
versus them when it comes to the dev and
the sysadmin zindagi way but with darker
everybody seems to calabria because just
they are working on the same page
they're working on the same image the
same container for devs
you know why darker well one of the key
things is darker today is growing at a
massive rate and that means today you
can find a lot of applications already
doc arised there's a site called hub the
docker hub which is I have a screenshot
on the next slide and today is like
hundred thousand applications in docker
hub right now you might think hundred
thousand Oh small number compared to the
App Store which has millions right sure
but if you consider the type of
applications that the docker hub has is
more things that divs are interested in
like new languages like today we were
hearing about you know rust in this
today's keynote you know say you want to
try out Ross it's very easy just go to
hub the docker hub and search for us and
you'll find a bunch of containers that
Oh darker darker eyes containers that
include rust pick the one that you want
download it get it up and running within
you know minutes seconds so that's how
fast it is to kind of consume all these
applications so that's cool and if you
can't compare this for likes a boon to
which is like one of the most popular
distribution for linux they have like
40,000 apps and most of them let's say
some of them are having GUI apps and dr.
doesn't really address a lot of the GUI
apps there are a few GUI apps like GUI
apps right but Dhaka is really meant for
like command-line apps it's really fast
and cheap what that means is you can
spin up docker containers really really
fast and you can kill them really really
fast once I heard somebody tell me that
the Google was doing a presentation and
they said when you go to google and you
start typing have you seen it suggests
things for you that at that point soon
as you start typing Google will spin up
a container for you and show you results
and once you're done it will destroy the
container that's how fast they could
spin up the the time it takes a spin up
containers is milliseconds if not even
less right why would I even do that
though
more secure like you're in a sandbox you
know you don't have to worry about
sequel injections well well depends on
the data model but you know how to worry
about like different kind of injections
leaking out to the rest of the users at
least in the system the other one is you
can have your own prod one of the things
you hear most people say is we can't
replicate prod you know we so how are we
supposed to build software that's going
to work that we can guarantee to working
product okay you can't guarantee
anything to work in prod anyway very
because you don't have the data exactly
but you can get as close to it as
possible if you can have all the pieces
laid out in the same way so it darker
you're pretty much running the same
container in prod hence you can simulate
that native experience and that's a good
thing so this is the doctor hope that I
talk to you about and I think I clicked
on the it's not showing the whole
thing's bit cut off but I think I
clicked on the popular apps in da hub so
engine X is at the top and you can see
you bhuntu is like third but you can
also search and find the app that you
want so let's get ready to do some more
dive into darker darker 101 so what I'm
what my purpose here is not to kind of
spend too much time like teaching you
darker right now because you can do that
on the internet and like I'm not going
to show you how to install it and all
that go to the site find out what I'm
trying to do is get you the basics of
some of the ways that darker eyes design
said you you grab some of the concepts
right that's my goal oops Polly should
never hit that so the first thing is
darker is implemented as a client-server
architecture so there is a darker client
which is a command line tool called
darker conveniently and then there's a
darker demon which one
on the darker host right so the client
will talk to the demon using you know
rest calls HTTPS so in this instance
that I'm showing you but mostly most
dibs would run if you're on Linux
obviously is through hitting your own
doctor demon on localhost and then dr.
demon will instantiate and create
containers so as I said docker
containers requires Linux to run for now
dr. is working with Microsoft in
bringing darker two windows right and
the way that they're doing it is when
Microsoft is implementing some of those
things that I said the Linux kernel has
like namespaces and things like that so
that doctor will eventually run but
again so i was actually recently at a
dr. Rocha when i asked the CEO of darker
like doesn't mean that we can run
containers that was built for linux on
windows and he said well yes and no yes
in the sense you can do it through
virtualization the Microsoft hands like
they're the whole zoo your platform but
it's not really that those binaries are
not going to run on Windows but you
could create Windows binaries that are
doc arised right so that's so you know
it's it's not an emulation layer that's
going to happen at all although Mike so
did do something interesting which is
they made ubuntu bash run on their thing
which is some kind of enemy late not
emulation but translation but I digress
on max you use some oh and windows you
use something called dr. machine at the
moment right and dr. machine is pretty
much a it's a virtual machine right so
you're running something called virtual
box which is the one of the most popular
open-source virtual machines and your
darker client would be running on your
mac natively and you'll be talking
through rest to the darker host in this
case so it's not local host anymore it
is the actual virtual machines IP
address it will be talking to but
everything else is inside the virtual
machine so this is one way you could run
it this is the post popular with ad that
you run it you could also just run
ubuntu you can you could also just
Ubuntu or some other Linux version on
VirtualBox and just do everything inside
that but then you won't have that kind
of integration between you know having
the command line run on your Mac so this
is pretty good for the most part but
people get confused because of the
darker host is no longer localhost when
you start reading literature about
darker you will see that it'll say okay
spin up this container and then you know
go to the side HTTP localhost colon in
some port and you can see a website and
then you do that on a mac and doesn't
work right because right because local
host is the mac for the mac right and
instead you should be finding the IP
address of your darker virtual machine
and hitting that instead right so what
docker is currently working on is and is
currently in beta is something called
darker for Mac so that will eventually
replace this darker machine thing that
I'm just talking to you about so this is
going to go away I mean next you're
going to call it dr. machine as a as the
name of the tool but the implementation
of dr. machine is going to be more
native and you're not going to have to
deal with virtualbox anymore it is still
a virgin machine though but it's going
to be transparent because they're
working closely with like Apple and
windows to make it more seamless so you
will then be able to hit HTTP localhost
from your Mac and be able to get to your
docket okay so spinning up a docker
container so the first thing you would
so as I'm going to skip the installation
part ok just go to the doctor and doctor
comment check out the installation is
for you to find out what is the darker
host once you set it up we need to
figure out what is dr. forced so the way
you can do that is there's this tool
that you get you install bit darker call
dr. machine which is kind of a
command-line tool to control spinning
like control your virtual machine ok
think of it as the vagrant command line
tool that you have so if you type ian me
to show you the information about the IP
address and the key thing you're looking
for is is darker host right so if you
add the line below evil doctor machine
en me into your bash profile
you know you can have it if darker
starts up automatically you can have
this environment automatically set in
your shell and then you can interact
with darker very easily using the doctor
command so that's step one again don't
think too much about this stuff yeah
just I'm just showing you some examples
from the real world but more about the
theory what it is so here I'm starting
I'm running an ubuntu container using
docker run- IT is kind of two options to
say run interactively with the terminal
so that I can actually log in to the
Ubuntu that I just spun up now we need
to run this for the first time it's
going to try to find the Ubuntu image
which is the name of the darker image
and I haven't still introduced what dr.
images but take my word up i'm going to
introduce it to you later and it's not
going to find it so it's going to start
downloading it from the internet from
the docker hub right so it automatically
knows docker hub as a repository and
it'll start downloading it and you know
this is showing like hashes of the image
and so on and then you can see I'm
inside yeah these slides are being cut
off for some reason but basically you
can see root at the there's an R in
there and then I'm just cat ET SI issue
and you can see it shows a boon to 1604
LTS so it's that easy to kind of spin up
a container so this is the next thing
that you need to know about darker it
uses a layered file system this is what
makes darker a very efficient and fast
one part of the puzzle so the thing is
darker is a darker image consist of
multiple layer layers of file systems so
what this means is say you have a couple
of directories right and you put you
bundle that into
a file you put that the whole directory
structure into a file and call that an
image file you can make some changes to
those directories maybe you can install
some software you know like Ruby in this
case and the installation actually
happens not on the the base layer but on
an overlaid layer and when you look at
it you see the union of the two right so
this is called a union file system you
can think of it as maybe some like a
tank a fish tank on top of another fish
tank and you look from the bar from the
top and you see all these fishes but
some of the features are from the first
fish tank and the other ones from the
bottom fish tank and if two fishes
aligned at the same time you will stop
seeing the one at the bottom because
this will seem like gorgeous yes this is
one fish and you can pretty much oh
that's how you would overwrite or write
some of the the files that are already
in the base and if you modify those
files they will get copied over to the
layer above so that you will no longer
see the original file and you'll see the
modified file above it and this is known
as copy-on-write it's a it's a concept
that a lot of databases were using
forever it's a fast rate of you know
modifying something so in this case this
is base image which is in this case
Ubuntu and then on top of it means a
rupee and then on top of it we install
rails so every time we do these steps it
creates a new layer and then you have
your app running and then it's a
container right this is not exactly
correct because your app will also be
another layer and then your container
will be a layer on top note to self
modify this side so this is another
layer I need to put it so here's the
thing all these layers below the top
layer are meant to be read only so you
can really change them it's the
container is just a read/write layer
that's overlaid on top of this whole
thing and that's the instantiation of
your
docker container is so the container is
pretty much an instantiation think of it
as the docker image that we talked about
is like a blueprint for the bundling of
the software and the docker container is
an instantiation of it like making it
kind of like executing a process Exe and
now you're running it right and you can
run multiple of them using the same
blueprint you can create a bunch of
containers so the word container
actually means a running darker image
and the image is original right so one
of the reasons darker has become so
popular is that it has really low
friction for developers to adapt usually
this sort of thing is meant for you know
DevOps people people who are like see
said means if you take popper chef all
these you know configuration management
you know ansible all of those tools
there's a big learning curve for one
thing and darker doesn't have that much
of a learning curve is easy to learn
this is because it has it relies on
muscle memory what's muscle memory
muscle memory stuff that you know how to
do already dr. PS minus a what do you
think that does process right if you
take out the word doctor and you a PS
minus a you're going to see all the
processes if you do dr. PS minus a you
will see all the container processes
whether they're running now or they're
not running right should show me all the
processes right doc our top my container
or using that does is anyone use the top
command again it's a process thing right
so this actually shows you all the
processes running inside my container
ideally for daca it should be ideally in
if you build a proper container it'll be
one process ideally but maybe not
commit what does this look like what
does this bring a bell like get right so
here what I'm doing is and this is not a
good way to create a docker image is
that you could live edit inside a
container like you can hop onto a
container and like install software and
then you can commit those changes into a
darker image because remember whatever
you change in a container it's a running
thing it doesn't persist it'll go away
soon as you remove the container and you
try to create another one with the same
image it's not in the image so you to
create another image dhaka RM remove RM
CP copy a lot of other commands like
this which you know it's very easy to
remember and use and the other thing is
is very easy to daughter I something
right so um whose work with make files
before okay hardcore not really a lot of
people are using it but that means
you're compiling something right so make
file is a very easy way to compile
software it says build this then this
and kind of you know link them together
so docker file is kind of like a make
file except is even easier syntax
because it uses pretty much almost batch
like syntax in this case you can see so
the cat docker file is the content of it
i'm showing you is that you saying this
image is going to be based from ubuntu
that means it's derived from ubuntu as a
base image right now you might be
wondering how did the base image come
how did the chicken come was it the egg
or is it the chicken first so another
chicken and egg things right there is a
way there's a d whole different process
to create a base image and most people
don't need to do that like there's
always some base image for you to start
out with and then there's an environment
variable okay which i like to add saying
refreshed at because darker when you
build something it also caches just like
in make fire
like if you change a file it only will
build that fire right so this way I can
kind of control that by changing this
flag everything below it will start you
know rebuilding and then you can see i'm
running a command called apt-get update
I've get installed you know and I'm
installing busybox here and then I'm
removing all the files at the end that
came from AB get update right so this
command run king will execute this
command so what are you to do is it will
take the base image Ubuntu spin up a
container temporarily run this command
up get update on that come container
which is on the Ubuntu and install
busybox which is you know like a Swiss
Army knife of it's a one command that
can mutate to be multiple unix command
side and then i'll delete all the files
that came from nap get update and then
it will commit that into a new image and
when you run this you will see the steps
that is committing these and creating
these intermediate images if something
goes wrong in one of the steps you will
have the image left over right so I mean
you can actually see it the reason I did
them in one step is because if I run
them as separate run commands for
instance every time I have a run command
it's going to create a new image so
maybe I don't want all those
intermediate steps I want just the fact
that I want busybox installed as one
step so that's why i bundled them all
into one and and end and ran it in one
step and then the second step tree is a
symlink right so in this case I wanted
to get the command if config which is
not there in the Ubuntu the latest
ubuntu image and then so this is the
content of the file the way you build
images you see darker build minus T and
you give the name of the name you want
to name your new image and then there's
a dot at the end to say build everything
in this current location so very easy to
consume and write your own bill so your
application you can easily docker eyes
using what's called a docker file and
sometimes when you were like you take a
wordpress example right we have we need
multiple
VA we want one container for the
database one container for the app so
one ways you would do is you will well
you would build the two separately or
you will maybe the database you'd want
to build it you just want to import it
from the docker hub because these or
somebody already has it right but your
application the PHP you might want to
you know build it so this docker has a
think or darker compose which allows you
to build the application by taking all
these different pieces from the docker
hub and what you build and put them
together and have them relate to each
other so that they are all started up at
the same time so if you just go through
this llamo file you can see you can't
really see because it's cut off but let
me read it to you so there's a w/e
through this web cool them okay and it's
saying so there's going to be a
container called web and the way that
container gets created is through a
build so what that means is there should
be a docker file to build the web
container so that will run the darker
build command automatically darker
compost will do it for you and it also
says to expose the ports this four five
six seven to the outside world and
that's how you communicate tweet the
container is through ports right if you
want to talk from the outside to the
inside so this is saying to open up the
port's four five six seven into the
containers internal port four five six
seven you should will be something like
a DAT into a do 18 to 80 because you're
running a whips around port 80 right and
then it's saying there's going to be
another container call Redis so link to
that container and this linking is
pretty much a DNS kind of a linking
anyway by default all containers are in
their own subnet so they can talk to
each other but by linking it the the the
first container in this case a web
container can ping the radius container
so this it dr. composed sets of all the
linking and then the and then you have
the second image you says okay radius is
an
based on the radius image which is from
the docker hub right so then you just
said darker compose with okay this is
yeah I think okay that's a mistake you
would say dr. Campos up I made these
slides last minute so you can see that
Javier be steak there okay so it will be
darker campos up and then you'll bring
up both services and have them to like
work magically so that that again is a
really easy syntax to orchestrate we
call this orchestrating containers
having them you know spin up in some
sequence and having them all all set up
very easily and you can distribute these
darker compost files to other people so
that they can you know also spin up
their own full-fledged prod you can have
a darker compost that describes a whole
Prada environment which is the cool
thing and you say darker compose up like
let there be light and all your whole
system comes up and it'll download stuff
from the internet and just come up
pretty cool okay I'm coming to almost
the end and i will then i can talk about
questions that you guys might have and
we can oh I can also maybe show you some
stuff but so the last thing that I
wanted to tell you about is some of the
the wisdoms of darker using da crib
versus the virtual machine so containers
unlike virtual machines you usually
pressure machines tend to persist you
would you know shut them down bring them
back up you know keep using them and all
the data will live inside that virtual
machine in darker in the dark reviled
containers you should not persist them
you could and you can mount a volume and
and by default actually these days the
container itself will have the data you
bring it up I think it didn't use to be
the case few years back but don't treat
them that way containers are meant to be
used and thrown right so whatever
changes you want to make permanent
you should change it as an image you
should create a darker image out of it
and in the same spirit you should not
try to do a nap get this upgrade or you
know AB get you know try to update the
packages inside the container because
usually if you're running some kind of
machine you want to run security updates
right so it's an anti-pattern to go and
do that inside a container but you would
do is instead you would update the whole
docker image so if you get down the
latest ubuntu if you say doc or pool
ubuntu it will get the latest ubuntu
image and replace the current one and
then you can start spinning up a
container if you if your image depends
on the 12 then you say doctor build it
will rebuild and pull up from the latest
stuff so there's a lot of rebuilding and
things that you did so your your
continuous integration stuff you need to
eventually if you are looking at going
into production you will integrate like
Jenkins and things like that so that you
know you're continuously as part of you
have any way you make a code commit and
you push it to your repo maybe Jenkins
builds a docker image for you you know
you can do that kind of automation and
containers work best with single
processes so what you will see is if you
try to do install a lot of services in a
container and then try to spin them up
so one thing is when you start a process
in darker it should be run it should run
in foreground because what you see is
inside a container there is no in it
like if you take any unique system there
is the process ID 1 which is in it which
kind of orchestra is bringing up all the
other processes right but in darker
there is no in it there is no unwanted
services running soon as the service
that you start up exits you're out of
the container the container stops right
so what would happen is if you say start
up Apache right and you do it in ubuntu
you say et Cie neither do you say
service Apache start that command is
Bill
to run apache in the background right so
what will happen is it will start and it
will start apache in the background and
then soon as it exits that the service
command exits the container stops right
so there are some things that are not
like a virtual machine which kind of is
a pain right so you have to actually
specifically run an Apache CTL you know-
d foreground you know and all that like
run the full Apache starting command to
do it or you have to use the third like
some other support service manager to do
it for you but imagine trying to start
multiple services you want to run apache
and my sequel and you know something
else it's it's a bit tough it's kind of
it's not simply it's not simple as using
the service manager in your OS right you
could do it through you know some kind
of service manage but it's it's not
meant to do that but that doesn't mean
you shouldn't try to you know docker
eyes your monolithic like app you could
still do it but darker lends itself to
running one process this is why Daka is
very popular with the micro service
Microsoft is because you're running is
one process in a micro service and
that's the only thing that the container
will be running the other thing is a
docker hub anyone can create a docker
hub account and anyone can upload
software into docker hub so you know you
shouldn't trust everything that's on
Tucker how they could beat origins they
could be security issues with the images
in decorum this is why sometimes doctor
has a bit of a bad rep with security you
might hear people saying is darker
secure part of this part of the thing is
that so you should not trust all the
images so in da club when you go you see
that there are official images which are
from the actual vendors so you should
download that image or any other image
but sometimes if you just want to play
with something you should really worry
right don't care you shouldn't really
worry about it
because again a container cannot break
out and kind of do something on your
machine even if the container is
malicious if you're running it in an
unprivileged mode which is the default
it doesn't have access to your hardware
and it can do anything apart from
breaking out of the container but the
thing is you don't want to run a bot
write something that does some Bitcoin
mining behind the back or you know so
there's so that's all you are you want
to be you know a bit safe with this
stuff so that's all I got there's this
app thing that I had to tell you about
to rate the session which I would
appreciate and I think people here would
appreciate so I am open to questions are
there any questions from the app
a darker top requires you to specify d
container so yeah you can do it all so
one of the some of the vendors what they
do is they have docker container monitor
monitor I monitoring apps systems like
for example New Relic has ways of
monitoring containers and what's inside
it usually it involves them you know
injecting some kind of an agent inside
the container so you kind of building
something but you know the darker they
don't want to make things complicated
which I kind of find a good thing
because at the heart of it darker has a
very rich API so you could build tools
you don't have to rely on their tools
you could build other tools to kind of
manage it so they want third parties and
themselves through their commercial
offering to kind of take care of the
complexities involved with that type of
things right but they want to make it
very approachable for getting started so
they keep there's the command line tools
like darker and darker Campos simple as
possible I've seen so many people when
you read through threads asking can you
have this feature that feature and most
of the time they say no we don't want to
give you remain ah we're not going to
work on that feature so they're keeping
that very lean until I guess people
enough people start complaining that we
need this they might then do it yes
okay so the question is how can we make
dr. images that can be changed well that
all depends on that that depends on how
you want to it's really about how you
deploy the image more than how you
cannot make it changeable so you can do
things like signing of the image so that
you don't trust things that are not
signed and things like that I'm not
aware of a thing where you can say it's
immutable like you can extend from it
but I could be wrong right this is a
good question so the question is can you
freeze the configuration so the way when
you create an image it creates a tag
right so you can create a concept of
versioning through these tags so when
you saw i would say we're going to colon
1404 if I didn't mention the colon 1404
it will say there is a default tag
called boon to call an latest and that
is always changing right so the latest
one is a built-in tag and you can put
him create any other version based on
the tag that you create ok any okay
no other questions okay I guess we'll
break early and thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
