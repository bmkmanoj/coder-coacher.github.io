already doing continuous delivery put a
hand up so that's about a fourth how
many are releasing at least once a week
the people doing continuous don't put
your hands up whom how many are
releasing once a week once keep your
hand up now once every two weeks once
every month now we have to have so
anybody releasing less than every three
months a few people okay so a continuous
delivery is awesome right I'm going to
get into some details about why it's so
awesome but first I'm going to start up
with a story about a friend I have so my
friend was working as an enterprise
architect that a big IT company had
mainframe heavy machinery moving
released once every quarter for some
things and he was having a he was having
trouble getting up in the morning so he
had to get up at 6:30 and it was not a
good situation for him that his
girlfriend was kicking him to get out of
bed I come on get up I'm not your mother
I don't know if anybody has ever heard
that but that's not a good thing and he
was saying not happy about it
he thought that generally it was because
he was a B person and just had trouble
getting up in the morning and this
enterprise
he was an enterprise architect at the
company where he was he they were they
were putting a lot of pressure on the
the development department to actually
start delivering things at a much higher
pace and it was hard for him to navigate
in in the heavy machinery slow
development process they had there and
he ended up having symptoms of stress
sweating himself in sick and got a new
job and almost from day one at the new
job where they were doing a 14-day
sprints and had
much smoother moving development process
he jumped out of bed at 6:30 in the
morning it turned out it wasn't him
being a bee person it was
the development process at the place he
was working that was turning him sick so
why am I telling you this story it's
because this is what I generally believe
is the important part of the continuous
delivery it can make people happy if you
don't have a good development process
with all the grinding gears and people
being frustrated in it it can actually
make people sick so this is the
important thing to me about continuous
delivery personally of course there are
other benefits that management likes
like costs and things things like that
but to me personally this is the
important thing and maybe you're
thinking I'm just making the story about
this Enterprise Architect up I'm not
making that story up it was actually me
okay so let's look at some of the
reasons why I want to do continuous
delivery this is just if you google it
and listen to people blogging about it
right so great I'm gonna throw really
quickly through some of the benefits
speed it makes total sense that if
you're deploying to production ten times
a day that's faster than doing it once
every three months or once every two
weeks so it's faster quality should be
better because if you have a
production which we all do at some point
finding the fix for that is just looking
through this small piece of code done in
maybe a day by one developer instead of
looking through all the code done for 14
days by 10 developers you get the
picture you can react faster you have a
way to fix it faster and finding out
what the bug actually is is much faster
and that ultimately leads to a lower
impact of the buck in production scale
so with continuous delivery where you're
working in much more in parallel that's
part of doing continuous delivery you
can't depend on other people all the
time you're actually able to scale the
development team to be much a lot more
developers so if you have problem
scaling your IT department on the
product you are today continues delivery
promises to be
solution to that to make you scale your
team and still have them perform focus
is something it which is important to
the developer you take you take your
feature and work on it until it's in
production you don't have to wait for
release and coordinate things quality
assurance all these steps that you have
in a normal sprint based development
that's taken away and you can focus on
one thing and that leads to less stress
price as it always boils down to so at
the cost of drilling have coming up with
an idea and developing it all the way to
and putting it to production is less
because it's less coordination and all
the meetings you you don't have to do
recruiting so when we hire new people we
tell them on your first day you're gonna
deploy to production and we've done that
with people everyone who started us at
our place if you come back compare that
to being told that yeah we release once
every quarter you attract a certain kind
of person that you really want to hire
who finds that as a good thing so if we
sum all of that up continuous delivery
delivers solutions cheaper faster with
higher quality with better bigger and
better teams while developers are more
focused and it's less stressed sounds
good right we want that I'll get back to
whether or not that's true so these
people have been told to drive at an
even pace around this circle keeping an
even distance even velocity and you can
see this build up some kind of queue
happening here and these people are
rushing to get around even though
they've been told exactly what speed to
drive at and how to do it and you see
this thing moving where they're actually
stopping that that's your release every
everybody who has a release every two
weeks or whatever has this problem in
their development process it just
happens automatically so we want to get
rid of that we want to get to a
situation where ever
body is driving on their own Road and
not having to wait for other people
generally being aware of queues in your
system so this track is supposed to be
about like the technicalities of
continuous delivery and I'm somewhere in
between because to me the technicalities
of continuous delivery are not that
interesting compared to how much the
people involved in moving to continuous
delivery are interesting the
technicalities are kind of easy I mean
it's hard work and you have to really
like really clever about it but it's
it's easy to do
compared to having to change people's
ways of working maybe even getting rid
of departments stuff like that you have
to do to be ready to to change a lot of
things so so there will be a little bit
of technical things in how we do
continuous delivery at Demeter
but it will also be a lot about how we
how we change the process around the
people involved in the process so one
thing you always get a question about is
quality how can you have quality in a
product when you push to production ten
times a day so if we have getting burnt
by fire as a metaphor of bad quality so
I push to production and there's a bug a
regression ow that hurt you can react in
several ways to getting hurt by this
fire and one way is to react to it is
when a child get burned by a fire it
just stays away from fire so the child
has actually discovered the best way to
ensure complete quality in what you do
never develop any features only do bug
fixes right that's the ultimate quality
that's sip there's no changes to it and
doesn't have any bugs yeah sickness you
can reach the state where there are no
bugs anymore it's possible and you get
closer to it every time you fix it back
hopefully if you can't do that then
maybe you should do something else than
deliver software so one way that we
tackle this thing about quality
instead is looking at also the way that
a horse in the wild reacts to a bushfire
so if you have the wind blowing and the
bushfire approaching the horse that that
fires gonna catch the horse and burn it
as it runs and it's gonna die so what
the horse has learned to do if the wind
is blowing and the bushfire is blowing
towards it it runs through the fire
through the pain it gets out on the
other side alive so this is kind of a
metaphor for how we actually think about
quality so just building better
qualities like the kid getting burned
and you get slower with all the things
you do to ensure quality we set the goal
of building better quality but at the
same time doing it faster so that's the
challenge right that's really hard to do
that's why it's so fun to try to do so
in the name of quality there are really
a lot of things to slow you down I'm
going to go through some of these and
these are the things we learned while
moving to continuous delivery and having
the process of continuous delivery for a
while so you're getting all the good
parts now I get through the specifics
about how we found that out later but
you're getting the good parts now so any
kind of manual process manual tests code
reviews it's gonna slow you down code
reviews are really great but maybe find
a way to do less of them and still
maintain the quality you want manual
tests you need to automate right the
meetings just don't I mean we have one
life let's not spend them in meaningless
meetings cut them down make sure you
have only in the meetings you want
invite less people to meetings write
only the people necessary for those
meetings we don't broom a task with the
whole team the only people who groom a
task are the people actually gonna
implement it that's less best meetings
all overall any kind of waiting so I
need to ask permission for something or
I need this this person is the only one
who knows about this system and I'm
working on I need to wait until he's
back he's on vacation
anytime you're in a queue or waiting I
mean that's just a waste of life so be
aware of places where you're waiting for
others and just kill it if you can't
handle was so every time you take your
task and give somebody else
responsibility for that task and now
it's your problem
every time you you do that you're
slowing things down so if you can devise
a way of having less handovers that's
gonna help you to live a better quality
faster gates so asking permission I need
to get a review from the information
architects or I need to get approval
from somebody for something this is a
this is fundamental that you need to
look at the way you are developing
software and and really ask yourself why
do we have these gates or could we do it
in some other way where these gates were
not necessary is there something wrong
with the way we develop software if you
can kill those gates you're gonna have
increased speed tremendously it's really
hard to change these things when you
have a QA date department that needs to
approve things and you're gonna take
that power away from them these this is
like fundamental one one answer to this
and I think a reason why it's it's
really hyped is micro services so micro
services in a compared to a big monolith
having small things that you can deploy
independently reduces need for gates but
if you have gates ask yourself how can
we remove them and still maintain
quality complexity just keep things
simple or maybe don't build them the
best the best way to reduce complexity
and something you're building is not to
build it at all and maybe use some kind
of software as a service system that
delivers it for you big scope this has
really heard us and this one is really
hard to get right and we still it
up big scope when you have big tasks
it's just a vein they slow you down so
much and really frustrating to work with
cut that thing down to something that
you are embarrassed to deliver to your
customer and then see if they actually
use it and then build upon it because
you get feedback it sucks
Oh somebody's using it they're telling
us it sucks they want it to be better if
you don't get any feedback then just
delete it again because nobody wanted it
so reduce scope and this is one we as a
set we're still struggling a lot with
sometimes we have big scope and things
we do but it's it's a complete team
exercise to actually cut these down so
the PIO cuts down the task before it
comes to the developers and then
developers actually everybody chips in
on cutting it down even further and the
PIO is crying and the signers crying no
what did you do to my design but we'll
say you'd get that next release first
you get this small thing which is really
ugly I know but at least we'll get it
out the door hard to do something you
need to practice that so better quality
and faster don't say better quality
alone want to do it faster also be the
horse that works with a fire if it hurts
do it more that's a general thing if you
have a smoke test that takes three days
to run do it 10 times or as often right
you've got an 8 you're gonna need to do
something about that pain if you want to
do it 10 times as often that's the only
way to get rid of the pain in your
development process is by having an the
ambition of doing the things you do for
quality more often ok so we were at a
point where we were doing 14 days prints
we had been doing them for two years I
became team lead with another guy
instead of the call Alex instead of the
person who was it before and we decided
me and Alex that we want to do
continuous delivery it has been a waste
by the CTO for two years and we hadn't
done anything about it so we made that
decision did some changes to the way we
use gate I'll get to that and
14 days later we were doing continuous
delivery you actually doing it in two
days but it took us 14 days to iron out
like some small details so we could say
we're actually moving at normal delivery
speed that's how long it took for us so
this is this is kind of part part of
part of my point about why this is not a
technical thing it's more we we could
have done this two years ago we just
never made the decision to do it because
it affects a lot of people's daily lives
and how they work when you do the change
to continuous delivery nobody had the
courage to do that so how exactly did we
do it in 14 days we assigned Alex the
other team lead as coordinator so
anybody has any problem with the way
we're doing things anything that doesn't
work for you in this new way of
deploying ten times a day go to Alex and
he'll figure it out or ask somebody who
knows and then communication like we had
fun in the beginning we had like every
every day we had like 30 minutes where
we discussed much working what's not
working the whole team together I know I
said less meetings but in this case it
was in a good cause and we just
discussed out all the pains and we did
also made a few things when there was
when there was a pain but generally we
try to keep things really simple and we
did it in a reactive way so we didn't
try to fix all the problems and then
move to continuous delivery we did what
the absolute minimum we needed to change
in order to do continuous delivery and
then we saw the pains try to work around
and without automating and ending up
automating a few things really simply so
reactive to the pain instead of figuring
it out before we actually did it and we
just kept it really really simple so at
the heart of it and you'll recognize
these dots from the last talk days these
are git commits so time is going forward
down here this is how we use git now we
used to have just one master branch
where we all committed to this is how we
use it now and it's
super simple somebody branches from
master and starts working on feature one
here
somebody branches from master and starts
working on feature two here and somebody
branches from master and just as a quick
fix like some kind of bug fix and merges
its to Martha and it's deployed a merge
to master is a deploy to production in
our system master is the only long live
branch all of these feature branches die
once they're merged of course when you
something gets merged to master these
people over here have to take that
change into their branches but it's not
a requirement it's actually not that big
a problem you have if you keep an eye
out for is this guy or girl working on
this exact same thing I that I am then
maybe I should merge it but often these
branches are only living for a day to
some times a week and then we then they
get deploy to production so we the
general rule for our tasks is they
should probably take around a week to
implement at most if they take longer
that happens sometimes as I said it's
hard to have to reduce the scope what
you do is you hide your feature behind
the feature flag hide it in some way and
then you merge the master anyway to keep
things up to date it's really not that
hard once you in our system so in
general let me just add a disclaimer
everything anything I say is just my
experience it isn't Universal you will
have to apply it to how you work but in
our experience this is not a problem we
don't have any maintainence branches
like old versions we have to maintain
house is a web application but I
recommend proc mass take on git flow the
hosts of this track they have that's
that's actually what we're using just a
part of it without the maintain as
branches so I've discovered if you go to
a job interview at a development
department a really good question is to
ask them how do you use version control
because that will take the temperature
of what it is like to work there and if
they can't answer that find another job
they need to have a clear strategy on
how to use it so tasks who here knows
scrum and forth like Sprint's okay great
so I won't explain that out here we have
a backlog so there's a column this is
how we used to work before we didn't
continuous delivery so here here's a
backlog in JIRA we take some part of
that and commit to doing that in this
sprint so everything that's from the
backlog put into this to do column when
a development starts working on a task
it's put put into in progress whatever
it's done is put to review we did review
of every single change if the reviewer
rejects it it goes back here and then it
goes back maybe a couple of times at the
end when the review is done it goes to
QA and gets tested it can we get
rejected does it then go again through
review maybe not I don't know I don't
think I know what the rule was some did
some didn't it ends up in QA and then it
ends up in done after QH has approved
where your change and when all of these
have moved all the way to done then you
can release and then there's a column
hidden out here which is production so
that's like seven states and you that a
task used to go through in our system
this didn't work for this didn't work
for continuous delivery these are the
time the states our task goes through
now in in our development process so
this is the backlog at the top the PTO
has made sure that it's ready to pick if
the task is ready to pick for a
developer has a sufficient description
when a developer pulls it in it goes to
in progress and it stays on that
developer until it is in production you
can't hand it over to anybody it's your
responsibility until it's in production
so we went from rent from seven to three
columns
we also that this is what a this is why
this is a difficult change this has
changed changing changing people's way
of working so instead of having code
review every single time it's up to you
as a developer to decide does this need
code review if you're just changing the
color of a button why have a code review
right you decide if this thing is in the
quality needed to go to production use
your judgment
so you don't have it all the time and
you can even say I need to code reviews
on this or I need a security firm from
outside to come review this I don't have
the expertise for this do whatever takes
but it's up to you to be responsible for
the quality because you're the one
building it you're the only one who
really knows if this is good quality so
you also get to get take the decision
we're actually pushing the deploy button
you just do that whenever you feel it's
you're ready you just do it so it turns
out we didn't need QA we've removed QA s
we have to QA s instead what we did was
help help the people who have a little
bit of issues with pushing stuff that
are that might be not the best quality
to production so we coached those
developers into being aware of quality
issues and delivering it themselves so
QA I have some numbers but you see it
was not a problem getting QA rid of QA
in our situation operations so we had a
it was called a platform team who built
infrastructure for us we took all the
stuff they built through two or three
years of two years and replaced with
off-the-shelf SAS solutions and I asked
the team after we done that is can you
I've been asking around thinking of
anything that must have gotten worse
since we did that
and they couldn't think of a single
thing even though I pressured them so
there must be something that's worse
with on this software as a service tech
out-of-the-box software like a Roku and
things like that and they couldn't think
of a single thing except one guy who
said now I can't SSH into the machine
and that's true you're kind of dependent
on the person under the the supplier
who's delivering what you're running on
but that hasn't been a real problem it's
more of a thought scenario if there was
some issue so we don't have any
operations developers actually have two
operations on the side that's the
there's some alarms and stuff and we
just do it maybe an hour a week combined
yeah this was a difficult change you
have to be really aware that you're
giving people a lot of responsibility
here the developer is getting a ton of
responsibility and some people will
fight that and that that's a good thing
because that's because they don't feel
ready to take that responsibility so you
need to make sure that you give them the
tools they need to actually do the job
and feel comfortable in it some people
will also say I want more responsibility
and just be running in front and going
really really fast with the changes and
you need to move at a pace where some
people are saying I don't want this and
some people are saying give me more and
find somewhere in between and move so
yeah
technical thing environments when you
have one staging environment and you're
doing these features in parallel and you
want to test on a production like
environment if you have a staging
environment one then you can't test at
the same time all these features you can
test one that builds up a queue on the
staging environment so we Rocco has this
thing where each pull request pull
requests is just a branch so we use
github pull requests and those are just
the branches with the tasks you're
working on these pull requests
automatically against deploy to your own
environment it's completely built in
out-of-the-box
and you just run your branch on
production and you can own a production
lag environment and you can be one guy
with two branches open helping somebody
review something maybe asking the PIO
then I actually built this correctly and
you can be to two guys or girls working
together on one thing so you can it's
completely parallel that's the point
about it this can be hard for some
people to do if you're working mainframe
most things things like that it was very
very easy for us on the github hiroko
setup so I mentioned queues before I
have this little thing everyone feels
blue when waiting in a queue at first
when we wanted to deploy it to
production we had this like we have 10
developers they want to deploy it to
production all at the same time we have
to coordinate it so we have pointed Alex
the coordinator and that of course
didn't work so we ended up in the end
having a queue still but having it fully
automated so you don't have to wait and
I'll just go through how exactly we did
that and this is where the get stuff
comes in so branches on git can be
viewed a little bit like a file system
path the kid expert guy will probably
kill me if I say this but it can it can
look like a file system path where you
have this ready part and then you put
something here so this is like putting
pushing a gift branch into the ready
folder of kid branches so what the
developers does sitting here working on
my branch he pushes to origin which is
get up my branch and then you use this :
ready slash my feature this means this
branch will get this name on on github
so it will be named ready slash my
feature this is when you want to deploy
to production then you push it to a
ready branch this is a signal that I'm
ready to deploy this to production
what teamcity does our continuous
integration server is that it listens
for these ready branches what it then
take master and merge the ready branch
into master if there's a merge conflict
if this merge can't be done
automatically it rejects the build and
deletes the ready branch and signals the
developer you have a merge conflict the
developer then goes to his branch which
is still there the one called my branch
fix Fink merchants master gets the merge
conflict fixes it commits and pushes to
a new raiding branch so the ready branch
is always deleted after one try then
you've just pushed to a new one when you
when you want to try again
so now we fix them the merge conflict
then we run a complete test suite on
this branch if there's a red test that
ready branch is deleted and the
developers notified you have a red test
fixes we fix the test push again to a
ready branch and now it merges
automatically all the tests are green
and what team CD does then is push
merged code to get up and deploy it to
production so you have like this kind of
gatekeeper this robot team CD it's the
only one allowed to commit to master and
the only way you can get something into
master is if it is completely green on
all tests so you never have a red master
branch never blocking anybody with a red
master branch this is this script is
really simple as just a bash script you
can find it there
it's open source only one of these team
CD builds can run at a time so if two
people are pushing a ready branch and
almost exact the same time one will get
run first and then the other one will
get run afterwards so you can have the
two of these running in parallel so
that's a queue a fully automated queue
so what it means is we had had a
situation where developers for spending
sometimes up to 1/2 hours trying to
coordinate when they wanted they wanted
to deploy to production now we had this
fully automated thing and this is an
example of a developer who starts work
at 1336 and his changes in production at
1345 took in 9 minutes from
a bug report so having it fixed and
pushed to production six minutes of work
three minutes of fully automated tests
plus the quark deployer and this is
everyday for us now I mean this is not
natural normal for us yes we can talk
about that also if we have time
afterwards let me just go through the
slides and we can take the questions so
ready branches there's no coordination -
at the same time it's not a problem
there's nothing to sit and watch and
wait for you can just start work on your
nest next task while this thing is
deploying some people actually did thing
where they did they pushed already
branch and then when went on weekend so
they they were actually waiting it for
go to going to production while they
left the building first we had a rule
don't do that and then people are just
doing it then we remove the rule you can
do that if you want to maybe maybe I'll
have to buy some beers if you
something up but it's okay if you feel
confident enough to do that that's fine
we have one path to production through
the test suite so in the Phoenix project
there's this story about this production
being down and some guys like it can't
get any worse I'll just fix it in
production and he pushes a fix which
turns out to corrupt the database it
could get worse right so we to avoid
that our test suite guards against data
corruption and every every single deploy
to production has to go through the full
test suite so our process changed in a
lot of ways this is just a summary of
all the things that we changed when
going - from 14 days Sprint's to
continuous delivery so we deployed 10
times a day sometimes more we have a
daily stand-up it's a bit shorter and
different we also had the team actually
experiment themselves with how to run
stand-up two at a time and chose a
different format which format which is
faster and more fun grooming is not done
the whole team it's done only the people
actually working on a task still do MVP
Minimum Viable Product deliveries cut
that scope it's super important we don't
do any plan
it's at the top of the task list
whatever you want to pick up next we
don't do any estimation we don't do
planning poker
we don't do burn down charts still the
retrospective every two weeks I highly
recommend retrospectives we have a demo
where we demo what we're doing and what
we just did sometimes people like oh
lesson production that's a new thing
that people are not aware of what's in
production so we tell them
a week after it's gone up sometimes code
review so instead of having obligatory
code review on everything you ask for it
when you think it's needed we still love
code reviews they are super super
important ways of sharing knowledge and
discussing code just do it when it's
needed and we took some that stuff all
that stuff freed up a lot of time so we
took some of that time to make a weekly
knowledge sharing session we have a
strategy session so everybody every not
everybody's grooming all the tasks so we
have a strategy session where the PIO
talks about what we're doing at a more
high level and numbers and stuff like
that and then we also introduced every
Friday you decide what you want to work
on it has to be something that benefits
our customers directly or indirectly so
something technical is okay but every
Friday how developers actually get to
decide what they want to do that's how
we changed our process so a special
shout out to deadlines so deadlines are
really evil they lead to really bad
choices because you need to meet the
deadline so I know this is completely
wrong to do this but I'll do it anyway
because otherwise I won't make the
deadline you make really bad choices on
deadlines so what are deadlines
deadlines are bad planning so if you
plan your work correctly you can be
ready a month before it should be
shipped so maybe if you have deadlines
it's because you're trying to do more
than you can actually do in a good
quality so maybe you should do less
so bad planning we have deadlines
sometimes most of them most of them we
we don't communicate through the team we
just plan so it's done a month before
the other the other reason for having
deadlines is distrust so if some people
actually think that if I don't give my
developers deadlines they will spend too
much time on their tasks yep we are
stretching and pressuring people without
actually actually having verified that
you have a need for it
we don't use deadlines instead what
we've done with the developers who have
a hard time keeping on on task and I
always have to fix extra stuff is coach
them and teach them to themselves notice
when they're doing that and keep on
track instead so you don't need
deadlines to push them maybe you need to
coach some people and they also do a lot
of great good things when they actually
fix stuff that should have been fixed
refactor code it's a benefit to have
people so passionate about code that
they'll just fix stuff because they feel
so passionate about it there are
deadlines so results we had this in the
beginning continually continuous
delivery delivers solutions cheaper
faster with higher quality with bigger
and better teams while developers are
more focused and less stressed this is
true yes all of it all of it is true I'm
sorry it is some of it more than others
but it's all true and just some so we
didn't measure things while we were
changing this if it wasn't motivated by
wanting to perform with some numbers
we're just trying to do what's right but
one thing I can share some numbers I can
share which I measured afterwards was
that
now our developers actually 91 percent
of the time is not occupied by meetings
so they have that time to actually work
I don't know what the number was before
because I looked in Outlook for the
meetings that were there and those got
deleted so I didn't have the history but
it was much less than this
our development speed is 140 percent
I have numbers saying 150 130 but around
140 percent so our 10 developers are
delivering as though they were 14 that's
huge
our box defects have reduced by 44
percent compared to what they were for
before and this is delivering 140
percent of what they were before so this
is actually even more impressive this
number and the cost the total cost of
the development department has been
reduced to at least half of what it was
before
so this is partly getting rid of or not
having QAS and not having aberrations
but it's also when you take
responsibility to your operations
yourself on the team and they have look
at the budget a lot of the stuff that
this platform team we're building from
us we just didn't need so we stopped
paying for it and the things we were
paying for we reduced so taking
responsibility of the budget helps us
also reduce the cost so we're building
better quality faster and actually
cheaper also so I promised some get hub
centric stuff github pull requests is
where we do code reviews we have no
active directory no VPN all our auth is
done with github off so we have services
that our supporters use to do support
they actually use github off on those
services which means there's two-factor
authentication on that we use Keita
as a chat so it's just a layer on top of
github whenever somebody's in your
organization on get up either they get
access to that chat Hiroko as you saw we
had pull request deploys integrated with
github so your branch gets pulled were
pushed to to a staging environment and
waffle i/o which was the task system
with the three columns it's just a layer
of get github it doesn't have any
database at all it's it just uses kiddo
so it's very good enough centric
basically we're just running the whole
development department on things you can
get off the Box closely out of the box
closely integrated with github we don't
have a single server in anywhere we only
have cloud solutions and most of them
assess I have a few pass things and we
try to get rid of those okay so everyone
enjoys when they develop a deploys
that's what I'm gonna leave you with
that was that was the talk
thank us some questions yes we do we
have 10 minutes but there are quite a
few questions so let's see how many we
can reach um first of would you do
continuous delivery with mobile apps so
there's a talk later about that I think
it's not my area of expertise I haven't
done it but I know you can take some of
the benefits of delivering this kind of
way and just not put it putting it all
the way to actually deploying you can
also do that with hardware this whole
thing of doing things in parallel and
getting rid of queues giving
responsibilities to people you can still
do all of that even though you're doing
hardware are you doing mobile apps
alright this is a good one how would you
convince management to support this so
funny story ah my boss didn't know we
were doing this he found he found out he
found after our doubt after we had
started doing it I completely forgot to
tell him because we are so empowered at
our workplace that we can just do that
but we also had a CTO who really wanted
to do it but just show them the last
slides with the percentages and the
performance right that's what they like
but it can be it can be tough and that's
what I mean by this being about people
more than technology it's it's gonna be
tough they'll be crying and arguments
and things like that when you're
changing changing these things and I
mean you might get rid of departments
you might have people leave and others
come in
it's a tough change but ultimately what
it ends up with is a much better working
environment yep could you try to explain
again how this work without any planning
or estimations whatsoever so when you
look at a task you you groom it with the
people trying to we're going to
implement it and it's already been cut
down by the PIO to a level where he
thinks it can be delivered in at most a
week then it's up to the developers to
like raise flags and say this is hard
this is hard and cut it down even more
and ship it in in parts
that's basically it cutting it down to
the smallest thing you can deliver doing
it in parts and as I said sometimes it
is we have tasks that sometimes end up
taking three weeks instead of one week
it can happen it's really hard to do a
whole team effort did you intentionally
try to get rid of branches or Fiji
chuckles if yes how did this go so get
rid of branches we introduced branches
we used to not have branches so be using
the pragma get flow you can find on
pragmas homepage this is just a version
of that so we reuse branches for every
feature and what was the other part or
Fiji chuckles so feature turtles are
really great if you need them but they
also code right so if you can just
finish what you're doing and push it to
production that's much easier not having
to have a feature toggle and we
generally try to do that but of course
if things are taking a bit longer than
expected and you want wanted to go and
master that just use a feature toggle
all right how do you guys handle flaky
texts fix them that's pretty easy I mean
I know that or delete them if they if
you can if you have flaky text their
tests they're worthless I mean they're
more than worthless they are hurting you
because you can't trust them
that maybe goes to the question you had
about our test suite running for three
minutes
we don't have any selenium or acceptance
tests at all they are too slow they're
buggy we tried several times it doesn't
work what we do instead is we monitor
production from a new Renick with an
erratic product that actually goes in
and does kind of accept insist on
production and gives and it does it from
all over the world so we've had several
issues with CloudFront CDN from Amazon
several times so actually doing this
kind of test that things are alright in
production from all over the world is a
much better solution it doesn't slow you
down when you want to deploy and you can
react really really fast if there's a
problem usually we react faster than out
use us have time to to mention to us
that there is a problem in production
alright
in case of no show or sickness how do
you reach your deadlines if you cannot
transfer a task so we don't have
deadlines but but if we do have a
deadline on a task at this no show or
sickness that hasn't happened
can't answer that if you have a month of
a time to actually deliver before you
can put another person on the task if
you're doing that small tasks you can
assign a different person and they can
do it within that month looking back
would you apply continuous delivery to
mainframe systems um if it depended on
lives yes definitely
I believe that continuous delivery
delivers higher quality you can you can
of course have your QA s and stuff like
that and do even more things that will
slow you down but you can still benefit
from continuous delivery and I believe I
truly believe that continuous delivery
is the best way to get higher quality
the quality is superior with continuous
and no people are doing it with
mainframe they're delivering to
production on I think bank systems once
a day so I haven't they haven't been
able to do it ten times a day but they
were able to do it once a day I think
that's in thank you
