apparently young and both of us we are
experts and learning and innovation so
we health if we help tech companies to
improve their learning procedures to
become more innovative so that's what we
do and what we have prepared for you for
today is a session about brain patterns
about neuroscience and what your brain
does while you are working on software
software problems and you have I hope
I'm sorry we have a quick first task for
you and I look around and I see you
manage that first task very well so you
seem to sit in groups in Paris you have
a neighbor you could talk to and during
our session because what we especially
like is interaction in sessions so be
prepared to interact with the person
next to you you might start making
contact make a little smile hi I'm there
and then you will see how it's going on
and of course and of course we have this
and click engage to write session and
ask question diana has a nice device
there and at the end we will answer your
questions that that are open after after
we have prepared a little torque about
brain patterns for software development
if you like to tweet about it please use
these hashtags so that we can find them
again and join these ok so the brain we
are talking about the brain because we
are mind workers all of our work
software development the problems we
solve software architecture the
decisions we make all depend on what we
think what we see our visual perceptions
how we talk about it how we connect to
the ideas of other people how we
interact socially and this is all in our
head this is all what our brain does for
us so most of our work is mind working
all the logical reasoning also all the
abstractions we use all the patterns we
use in our work it's all about mind
workers and we try to give you a brief
idea of what's going on here right here
and we have looked into science because
yin and I we are scientists and we like
scientific background for our work so
that's what we what we try to share with
you but I have a cautionary note at the
beginning all this what we are
presenting to you as science so it's
only that it's very it's a very complex
system you have in your head and all the
science we cite here gives you some
evidence some hints of what is going on
in your mind it's not like this is how
the world goes it's just and a first
idea of what could happen in your brain
okay just a bit of caution here when we
talk about science and scientific
evidence so I would like you to i would
like to introduce the world's most
powerful ide it's really most profit ID
and this is um inside your head your
brain the neurons that are inside your
head and i give you some of the
technical parameters here have an idea
of the working memory how many bits you
have per seconds about 40 this is well
compared to all the association that is
unconsciously available to you elf 11
million bits per second so it's really
like the little rubber ball compared to
the whole building and these are the
technical parameters you have and also
your brain is really consuming energy
it's about it's taking about 25 person
of your glucose consumption and about
thirty percent of your oxygen
consumption and this is really a big
amount of what you need to intake to
have your to keep your energy levels up
and i also want to briefly introduce you
to em the surface of the ide and how it
works and it's practical because all of
you have a mobile device in your hands
and i would like you to show to use it
for me so please um raise your hands
like this no no your real hands not the
devices this is your device
and your thumbs inside and do this and
are you close this and this is a model
by dan siegel who uses it you can
cross-check it on youtube and it's
pretty much of what your brain looks
like it's also a bit disappointing that
this is the size roughly of your actual
brain but size doesn't matter here so
and I'm going to talk you through the
different areas you can see this is your
cortex and the pinky fingers this is
your prefrontal cortex with all the
thinking all the work we do this
happening and you open it up and you can
see here like the spinal cord you see
the brain stem and you see here an area
which is the hippocampus which is
responsible for all the learning and
memory intake you have so this is very
important to take care of your
hippocampus when you're learning new
stuff like in this conference and here
at the top of my thumbs and also your
assembles you have and the amygdala do
you know what the amygdala does anyone
knows it it's about feelings and it's
about fear and reacting immediately to
threats so this is your system that
shuts down all of this it's the twelve
or two from Russells tour from a stroke
yesterday it shuts all of the systems
and it makes you go away like faint if
your fainting fleeing or fighting this
is the classic reaction and it's
important to know that this year and
especially the prefrontal cortex is
modulating what's happening right here
in your emotional system and when you
get under stress and this is important
because in our jobs we often get on this
dress these here shut down and these
come into action so this is like the
basic mechanism we have in our brains
okay and you have you can always have it
in your pocket put it back into your
pocket and as I said this is the world's
most powerful IDE and the most important
thing is what you do with it when you
develop software and we have a first
short question for you and we would like
you to discuss this with the person on
your left and maybe Diana and young you
can redistribute the smaller cards talk
to each other
and maybe you remember a situation from
your work where you thought what is
going on in their mind when do they do
that in that where do you wonder in your
work what is going on in other people's
mind and we'd like to talk to a little
bit about it and shut down a few words
about this little story on the cart okay
share a micro story with your neighbors
when do you wonder what is going on in
some other person's mind okay no we are
overwhelmed by the response let's talk
and yeah yeah as a pair so that's a
challenge for the front rows just get
great yeah thanks
now you can talk a lot keep yourself a
fighter
if you're one of the unlucky Paris
couples triplets who didn't get a get a
sheet now just if you have a bit of
paper you can jot something down or
otherwise you just have to keep it in
your memory but just try to come up with
a story
and I have a question here what you
should do is about talking to each other
about its situations where you wonder
about somebody else oh my god what is
going on in their mind a situation in
your work life where you wonder what is
going on in the life of on in the mind
of my product owner in the in the mind
of my customer in the mind of my
colleague
okay I hope you all found some little
stories and what I want you to do is to
put them in the back of your mind forget
about them for a moment and we will
introduce you to a number of we call it
patterns brain patterns things that
happen in your mind while you're doing
your work and you will come back to your
stories in some minutes okay just we are
starting our introduction on we are
going to talk you two through six
different patterns you also find them on
the reverse of your card and we are
going to talk you through them the first
pattern and we try to find nice names
for them we call it the meaning mature a
meaning mature your brain is a big big
meaning mature it loves patterns it
loves shortcuts and it laughs to give
meaning to anything it sees it hears it
perceives whenever you seek and counter
situation your brain is quick at
providing meaning to it it easily
assesses all of the information are
distraught in your cortex and provides
you with all the things you have learned
and creates a meaning of this situation
you see and you look for meaning and
everything and I have a small test for
you maybe you can see it i hope you can
see it what do you see can you see the
guy he's a bit suspicious he's a little
bit suspicious and we ask why is he so
suspicious because he just met this
guy's
and this guy is a little bit
disappointed and also sad because he
heard a terrifying story from these guys
who are like in really amygdala reaction
they're like whoa what is going on here
and I can tell you this is going on so
you see it's some rain jobs a car some
cups and pepper and we quickly eject we
just have a story in mind and we can put
things together and we provide meaning
to these objects and this is exactly
what our brain really love this is why
we're here this is what we like
providing meaning to our environment to
the world we live in and yan I'm is
trying to relate what I tell about the
brain to the disciplines of software
development so for architecture an agile
and I hello it to you young yeah and you
probably if you're looking at what's
going on here that is the core of our
profession it's pattern matching finding
abstractions finding solutions being
quick about finding solutions these what
a half day so far I always heard about
we need to be quick we need to be fast
we need to find solutions and this
system just helps us to be quick and it
also helps us to be too quick because
one of the core problems we we often we
often face and we got concepts for that
is that of abstractions coming too early
of thinking we understood something
you're listening to a client explaining
what he wants to us and then we were
just constantly working and say okay I
start off understood what he said and I
have a solution in my mind quick jump at
it is that what you mean and we're
pushing them into a direction and I see
someone modding and probably you
experience something like this so we've
come up with these great principles we
call them you ain't gonna need it keep
it simple and stupid don't jump onto
solutions too early we have test driven
development and we say okay just get
that small slice that you understood get
that going don't do the whole thing
and anyone has ever tried these
principles and solutions methods was it
easy no it's incredibly hard and that's
part of the reason because we know we
understand it's probably not a good idea
but it's really incredibly hard to hold
yourself back because a brain loves it
our brain has these solutions that's why
we need these strong processes okay so
the second pattern we bring to you we
call it the stiffs which it's again
about meaning it's about another kind
another type of meaning is the meaning
that you need in order to be motivated
to do something so your brain starts
doing things when it feels like there is
something meaningful for me in it and I
want to do it I want to achieve it
meaning is a motivator for you okay and
the problem is that once you are engaged
in thinking about what things mean what
the meaning of things is for you and
what's your motivation behind it there's
a switch and this switch switches off
the mechanics on how you do it so you
can there are hints in the science that
you can either think about motivation
why am i doing things or mechanics how
am i doing things there is like like
they are separated there's a separation
between them this is some work of
Elliott Berkman and David rock and they
say that when you want to UM when you
want to achieve a goal you need both you
need to have a good motivation for the
wall and you need to have good mechanics
to get there so you need a why and you
need a how but the problem is that why
and how are separated things in your
brain they are concurrent you can do
either think about the hell or think
about the why you're doing things and
this is kind of difficult because some
of us specialize in the why are we doing
things and the more you specialize in to
something the better you get at it and
the weaker you get at the other thing
and the others of us specialize in doing
the how and the better we get here the
weaker we get at doing the wire stuff
and if it's difficult for our brain to
switch between them we run into some
trouble in or
business so there are probably some of
you working in an so-called agile
organization or maybe this evening job
when we got real names for this division
of someone specializing on why and so on
someone specializing on how who is
responsible for the why Protagoras
sometimes product managers who
specialize on the under how yeah the
poor bastards doing the work it's the
team so we so we manifest that within
this role model and looking at that this
seems to be a good idea because then
everyone can specialize and stay in the
mode of thinking but most of you
probably have been at the keynote this
morning and that was a classic large
scale of example what can go wrong if
these two worlds separate for any long
time there's a real danger that if you
lose contract but then again we found
some solutions and I'm I'm working as a
coach I'm trying to assist teams and one
of the the core problems that I find is
that these these worlds separate and we
have killed procedures in place we have
something like a daily scrum daily
standup I think nowadays in most
companies something like this is
happening but what is also happening
that I often find or the product owner
doesn't really like to go there because
with all the technical crap stuff and
people just talk about the techno stuff
and the the team just they mostly they
feel a bit unmotivated at times as well
but they talk technical problems and
stuff but the real idea of that meeting
is to realign the goal do we achieve the
sprinkle do we move forward obviously
all heading in the right direction I'll
miss all the technical problems that we
have and bring these worlds back
together and just think about what
you're doing at your daily stand-up and
scum does it really match bring things
back together
so the third pattern is called a
piggyback system and what we mean by
this is that yawn already started
talking about social situations like
daily scrum and there are some
scientists that say we have a brain
because we are social beings so our
brain is our social organ so to say and
it's all the management of our social
connections with other people and in our
environment and apparently the brain has
in order to save I don't know
evolutionary steps energy and so on it
has chosen to piggyback the social
system where you where you receive
social information and where you think
is there's a good social situation for
me or not it piggyback that on the
physical pain system so there is
evidence that social pain is sitting on
the back of physical pain and they are
strongly connected and that means if
somebody gives feedback to you for
example and you don't like that feedback
it could feel like it hurts physically
you probably know this when you have
been in love and the person you love
left you it feels like a physical pain
and this is exactly what they mean that
the physical your brain doesn't make it
different it's highly efficient it
doesn't make a difference if the pen you
encounter if your hurt is physical or
social and this is very important to
know because socialists are important
you don't you wouldn't hurt other people
at your work you wouldn't slap them or
hurt them but are you sure that you're
not doing it with your words or your
interaction because isn't it great agile
is all about transparency in feedback so
every day every good meeting is a great
opportunity to hurt someone just be
straight open tell them right in the
face no this isn't working that's not
the direction I wanted and that's not a
really comfortable situation isn't it
and in fact that is something that I
observe quite regularly that people feel
uncomfortable they don't open up and
they just they tell straight out I mean
I don't like this process it's still
transparent it inflicts on me people get
at me
and just my one chip once again if
you're really looking into the concepts
and theories of stuff exam for example
like strim if you look at what the
review meeting is about many companies
I've been the rebbe meeting has been
lived like something okay this is
meeting there the stakeholder come and
they tell us whether we are heading into
the right direction and what they want
and then give us feedback and they push
us back but it's all from the outside
and for you to feel comfortable and not
hurt so much that's still difficult
thing to do we really need to get into
your mindset that you're inviting the
feedback that you are prepared for the
situation that you're prepared to deal
with the emotions that inevitably will
come up with in these situations so
really asus grandmas are someone
responsible for setting up these
meetings inviting people you have to
work with both parties to create a setup
where there's really the the place where
people are able to listen to each other
and not just getting slapped in the face
or what they hear so we have a small
interaction for you and I said we were
going to come back to your stories and
this is exactly where we are right now
please look at your story again look at
the three patterns we presented the
meaning match of the stiff switch and
the piggy bank system and try to locate
your story with a dot or a single a
little star try to locate it in this
triangle where is it within this
triangle so what are the percentages the
mixes of these three patterns that could
be responsible for what is going on in
their mind just a short talk to each
other a little bit and try to make a dot
in this triangle
okay did you find a good position
there's something you would like to
share from finding the right position in
your triangle some insights from the
first patterns maybe yes you feel that
they are kind of exclusive why this why
this choice of parameters okay you don't
need to choose a color and and you
probably find that in real life
situations if you're looking like
something like preparing the product
backlog are you looking at the review
meeting or the base crumb or whatever
you do you probably find that many of
these aspects influence its situation
and maybe some are very strong and say
okay this is clear stiffs which
situation that's possible and you put
your daughter right in the corner over
there if you think about it but then
maybe you spend some time thinking about
it okay a part of the problem with
switching is ok we love pattern matching
and so that's part of my brain got going
and I don't just want to leave that and
so you see that there could be mixtures
of all these these aspects they'll
probably are in real life situations
what is the advantage for the brain that
is right it's a good question and I'll
see I don't know I can bike I can build
hypothesis on it but excuse me yeah they
did some they did studies here and I
found that they apparently in different
circuits and that its circuit switch on
and off each other so either this area
is active all the other but it's really
rather both of them are active and I can
only assume that probably it has to do
something with energy consumption but
I'm i really don't know I need to check
this it's a good question thank you and
we have a the next question is about a
very similar thing and it's called the
social seesaw and you know what i see so
as yeah like Cecil it looks like that
and and this is very comparable to this
it's about social situations and there
are some research by Matthew Lieberman
and he's from UCLA and he did some
research on and he found out that people
who are in social situations so when you
are so thinking socially and connecting
socially to other people the the system
that is doing the non social thinking
like abstract thinking is going down so
when you think socially abstract
thinking goes down and when you start
abstract thinking social thinking goes
down so again there is like a seesaw
like before well you you seem not to be
able to do both of these things at the
same time it's difficult Oh biologically
difficult to do both of these things at
the same time I call it a social on
neurological seesaw and once again if
you look in what you're doing for most
of the day it's deep thinking yeah right
so you're gone gone away you do abstract
thinking if you look at the typical
programmers environmental they probably
have the headphones on staring into the
monotone computer and trying to lock
everything else because they're doing
they're thinking stuff but
that's not what we can do all of the
time in all of the day that might be
support calls getting yelled and you
should be empathetic with the person
calling you because they're asking for
help but you were just thinking about
something else it's kind of a difficult
situation and even more so we've got
regular meetings I've just been talking
about a daily they stand up meeting that
just happens what you were thinking hard
just a moment ago and then you're
standing in a circle trying to relate to
other people finding out what their
problem is how to move forward not to
dive down deep down again into the
solution findings once again you have a
situation where you need to be very
aware of that you're switching context
and you need to do something to make
that easier for you there are a couple
of things you can do first of all have
meetings right after lunch counter
intuitive to everything else we usually
say because okay after lunch you can't
think properly but the advantage is that
you have just a social situation you
just spend some time outside your mind
hopefully relating to other people so
that might be an easy solution then
again you can't think properly after
lunch so there's another thing you can
do you just can come up with check in
rituals you know all these little things
we always talk about if you do a review
do the proper check-in yeah but that
just st. Simons just the social thing
just let's get over with it it's
important it's important step just to
get you out of your thinking mode switch
the modes change the position of the
seesaw so the next one is called the
self lover and I think it's easy to
understand what it is your brain really
likes if you want to get if you want you
can do this poll your brain really likes
you most it's important for your
survival let your brain things that in
this case I and the most important
person so am I like myself most I'm the
best among us the social groups I'm in
are better than the social groups others
are in so this is all the mall the
mechanisms our brand users to make sure
that we feel good and there is I did
this I did it on twitter if you want you
can try it
we can test it there are a number of
studies where they ask expert groups
what do you think is a professional are
you better are you performing better
than your peers and you would like like
expect a normal distribution of that but
up to eighty percent of the people say
yes I am and this is well difficult and
I said Mary we could make a poll during
the conference so if you like I don't
know if we are enough people but we
could try it so what do you think um are
you better software developer than other
people and this is exactly what is yep I
don't know I don't know but it's a good
question again I love it I love learning
yeah maybe for strong rehmannia we go
check the data and find out it's good
and there's a little picture showing
what self love means and self-love is
also for yourself but in your business
in your profession is also important it
also it's also around the people you
belong to so sometimes you ask why are
we why do we fight between departments
or between development groups and this
is exactly this our group is better than
the other group of course always there
is no discussion about it like from
unconsciously and also when something
happens that is bad it's clear that
that's that where the others and the
circumstances but not me but it's
something happening that is very very
good of course it was because of my
skills of what I know what I can do for
other people so it's always like you're
giving the bad things to the others in
the environment and the good things to
yourself and how you perform and how how
well you are doing your job
hmm it's a natural thing yeah of course
everything bad come from the outside
everything that works that's my doing
and once again it's it's really fun for
me if I enter a project if I get to know
some teams and you're looking at the
picking strategies which team member
pics which stories are which cast from
the board and you just think about your
own your own context your own company
how people do there I think that they're
two major patterns that I often observe
one is I just pick as many as I can from
the easy ones because that basically
means i can get a lot of things done and
i have a high number and that just
basically proves on the best isn't it
great gives me a good feeling the other
strategy is I pick the biggest and most
difficult task that's great if I managed
to succeed I'm the best now obviously I
just managed to solve the biggest
problem if I fail it's obviously because
the task was to begin complex and I
can't be blamed I mean I did my very
best and this is just typical I see it
ever so often and it's quite natural and
all and that obviously there are also
impacts team performance because we
don't we want to be be held high biotene
colleagues and the only thing you can do
just to work out that you can't outsmart
your brain I mean a couple of the
question see if I just know it can I do
differ it's not easy it's a natural
thing as you said so all you can do as a
team is a group reflect the polit within
a retrospective and try to come up with
some clear rules with a bit of distance
in between how do you distribute tasks
for example and stories we've got some
rules if you're interested for our
working together if you're interested we
can talk about it afterwards so we're
coming to the last pattern we called the
now magnet your brain is a now magnet
and it looks like that it's really about
you ask the question what's the use of
it it's really about getting control
over your direct environment so for your
brain the most important thing is what
is happening right now what is happening
right here and what is belonging to me
so all the things that are here and not
far away but are now and not far into
the future and that I your things your
ideas your thoughts your input your bit
of code that is important more important
than everything that belongs to other
people that is more far away that is
somewhere in the future so this is maybe
if you work in virtual teams some part
of the problem you encounter here maybe
if you are working on different like
paths that are conquering ideas maybe
this is M what's behind and once again
software development is all about
decision making as well you've got
architectural decisions to make we're
special e if you looking at
architectural decisions there's a hard
to make decisions where we suspect they
have a long-term impact that should give
you warning now we are very bad at doing
these things or if you looking at how do
we order the product backlog I don't
know any one of you probably has been in
the situation you just want that why
that order that's totally not important
or there's something else that I feel is
very important because it's close to me
it's close to my goals and it's close to
what I feel should be done now but it's
not in the right order according to my
opinion and there we have a very
difficult time just to bring different
aspects different points of view at what
could be important how could be
important together integrate it into
good decision-making and once again we
are strongly influenced by our brain the
best thing we can do and can come up
with is again in an acquired situation
in a quiet moment try and make a simple
checklist for example just in what
factors really we should at least be
considering and looking at it once again
even if you do it Iger if mately and
come up with a good number of importance
at the end of the day probably they're
still you're going to be looking at and
say okay yeah but I think that's more
most important because it's closer to
you now once again it's the best we can
do just to somehow deal with that
situation
so leave presenter view 6 patterns and
you have another triangle and we would
like you to play with them again and see
in again at the situation the story you
shared what could be the mix of these
aspects social cease or the self lover
and the now magnet if you look at your
situation again talk for two or three
minutes and try to find out the mix here
okay so to make it easier for you to
remember what we present it except for
the short discussions we have prepared a
little cheat sheet for you so
summarizing again the different patterns
and I'm summarizing what we said so
again the meaning mature and the tools
or the process that Yun mentioned the
stiffs which the piggyback system the
social seesaw the self lover and the now
magnet so just try to use your language
activate your parents so that you could
and relate back to it and what you find
here and this is also the message we
want to bring to you is we use these
triangles to show you that this is a
really complex situation there is no
single reason for it and sometimes
reasons are not even interrelated but
they are there and they are influencing
the situation you are in and also you
are a human being and you cannot escape
your brain and so on your colleagues
can't escape their brain so this is how
we are and even if we are aware of this
this already helps but sometimes you
really need processes to outsmart this
because you cannot unlearn your behavior
you cannot unlearn to be a human being
your brain is just acting like this and
this also relates to the questions we
have where you ask them about practical
tips and I would just start going into
the questions and I'm I need to reload
it right Diana so we have two questions
the first one is is there a good method
of switching between the why and the how
and can it be trained and the answer is
yes there is a good method the method is
to understand when you get stuck on a
problem when you feel like it's not
going anywhere we are stuck here and
then you need to decide
are we in our house situation do we not
know how to do it or are we in a wise
situation do we not know why we do it
and then decide when you when you say
okay we are now how situation just stick
to the how talk about how can we break
down at how can we achieve it how can we
get the how how repeatedly asked how and
if you are in a wise situation use the
wise to get to the problem try to ask
why and why again to get to the meaning
and the the experience shows that then
you get unstuck and you can continue
it's difficult but you have to stuck to
one of the modes and try to get out of
the situation that's a good tip and the
second question is for young I guess
scram in practice brings up hidden
problems in teams very fast do you have
an explanation for it and it's a looking
at the question i would probably
answered on two levels there's the the
easy one the practical one I mean scram
house bill build and constructed by
people just looking at what worked and
what didn't work within projects they
just picked out on the the things that
they always found problematic and they
said okay we need to have to have some
process to deal with it and obviously
that part of the processes touches the
pain points of any organizations or the
typical problem so that's sort of a it
is that way because it's meant to be
that way explanation if you're looking
at the what we talked about and we just
scratched the surface with our examples
but there are many of the things if you
look at them I've talked about ordering
the product I talked about daily scrums
getting people back together these are
things within the process that don't
come natural to your brain and if things
don't come natural they feel
uncomfortable and you start arguing
about it you start to get back and try
to get back into your comfort zone and
so that's why conflicts come up you see
okay there are things that aren't
working all that well and you start
talking about it so it's your brain
feels that there's something that they
are not comfortable right now and the
way it's set up
and so that's why they why it feels
uncomfortable conflicts come out so
that's the best i think i could give and
we have two more questions and I a
tricky okay the first one is anybody
tested with randomized task assignment
so I didn't test it but what I do is I
use random a lot of a lot of time so
when you want to escape the pattern
matching thing in your brain random is a
good idea so why not trying randomized
test assignments it's always good to
break through your existing structures
and from new categories in your brain
but i don't know maybe someone in the
audience has randomized task assignment
does anyone love to play games yeah
probably and within lots of games
randomizing things just throwing dice is
is it's an important part and that's
part of fun our brain I actually love it
because it's instant challenges and
you're suddenly allowed to fail and that
gives you allows you to test out new
things as well and considering the
social seesaw is pair programming even
possible I love that question again you
ever ask a person just think about what
you observe I think it works great one
thing is you got an extended working
memory you've got two people looking at
a problem that's great so for your brain
that's great because someone can
concentrate in one aspect someone else
can concentrate on the on the bigger
picture for example all easy or fine you
also work in kind of the same mode
you're both programming you're both
concentrating so that's okay the
difficult part is of course can you
connect and what happens if you disagree
if you are well aware that someone else
is we are preparing this talk and we're
deep deep thinking someone was not going
smooth and someone is just trying to
work things out is a bit rough
and if you aware of that if you're
forgiving and you realize you're just
the same probably just the the minute
before then it works out but you need to
be aware of that that is a difficult
situation for you and that is not the
time to be social but take a break take
a cup of coffee bond again socially and
I hope you still will be talking to each
other the next week so a lot of
advantages for your brain as well but
it's a difficult situation sort of good
answer for whoever set the question so
that was our last slide but we also have
for the documentation of it wow it's how
i miss so you can read more about it on
our blog we write a lot of things about
neuroscience about android and of course
about learning because this is our
profession and for you and in the
documentation when you receive the
slides we have also prepared all the
material so that you can read it that
you can have the sources and read
through it again and get our inspiration
and for you ok so maybe a last question
take this to the break yin and i we are
here for the whole day if you like to
chat and talk about things here or on
twitter do not hesitate to come to us
thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
