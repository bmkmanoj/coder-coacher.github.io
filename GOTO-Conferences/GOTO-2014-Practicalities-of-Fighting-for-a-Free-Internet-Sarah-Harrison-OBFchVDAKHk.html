working as a journalist at WikiLeaks
since 2010 and so I just wanted to speak
to you about the problems that we have
had as an organization of people trying
to censor us and take us offline and
just generally working in such a secure
environment as we need to to do
publications online and it also courage
foundation is a whistleblower support
organization for those that that don't
know that I also work but I WikiLeaks I
suppose really for the purposes of this
and so I just wanted to start with first
thinking about what do we actually mean
by a free internet I think it's
important when you're looking at finding
solutions to issues to really look at
what the problem is and what we need to
solve so with a free internet it's sort
of the eternal question at the moment
what is that often I think it's easier
to approach this by thinking about what
we don't want by a free internet what it
doesn't mean so but not by any means is
this list exhaustive but an Internet
where large corporations can shuts down
websites will take down content using
copyright law or national security
security rhetoric this is something we
definitely do not want internet where
people cannot share information without
interference by governments and large
companies internet where people of one
country cannot talk to those of another
internet that could be shut down by an
emergency switch internet that doesn't
allow anonymity and internet that
doesn't allow equal access and then if
big one for me is the chilling effect
which we're getting more and more of at
the moment sadly and internet where
people are afraid to use it because of
the repercussions so for example if you
are interested
in researching around something to maybe
tackle an issue for example Isis or
terrorism is the fact that your search
is going to be monitored and recorded
and then linked to you is that going to
put you on some watch lists when you
don't really belong on those at all it's
just that you were researching around
the topic and this chilling effect where
people therefore reduce their access
will reduce their use of the Internet is
a very important problem at the start of
the internet a lot of these things that
have seemed impossible and as though
they would never never occur and a good
quote for this one is from john gilmore
and he said this to Time magazine in
1993 the net interpret censorship is
damaged and routes around it to me this
is a very good quote was really showing
sort of assets core what the internet
wants to be and how it has been set up
and how it has been designed is so that
in and of itself it shouldn't be
censored it doesn't want to be it moves
it is a decent decentralized structure
that is actually built to resist
censorship so how is it that we have
gone from comments like that too from
Julian Assange Assange's books
cypherpunks that he wrote with jacob
appelbaum andy who will be speaking
later and Jeremy Zimmerman from la
quadrature du net in France the internet
our greatest Hall of emancipation has
been transformed into the most dangerous
facilitator of totalitarianism we have
ever seen and the reason I think that we
have gone from the first statements to
the second in how the internet is really
seen and the problems around it at the
moment is the governments and
corporations and they're really our
adversaries and this this fight for a
free internet so free internet I would
therefore although I'm not by any means
saying it is the definition and there
are many but I would hesitate to say
something like a medium to freely and
equally be able to share
access information worldwide and I think
that this encapsulate smelly of the
things that that are issues of today so
be able being able to share information
freely means anonymously without
surveillance without being monitored
worldwide so across borders across
language across class and without
censorship and reasons why it's
important we all need access to
information it's through this that we
can actually really grow as people and
as societies get autonomy understand the
world around us and we have seen this a
lot in in our work when we've been
publishing information and people have
been able to access this as an example
actually from a German citizen Khaled
el-masri who when we had the full
archives of Cablegate when they were
published and put online he was able to
find his name in that and start and get
standing for a legal case what had
happens to him was that he happens to
have the same name as a suspected
terrorist he was on holiday with his
family and Moldova and he was secret he
was captured by the CIA he was secretly
renditioned he was taken to Syria and he
was tortured they're even there was
absolutely nothing to do with the person
they were really after and they found
this out and they still took months to
actually release him and he spent a long
time trying to get justice for this but
he couldn't get the documentation or any
proof that he needed to actually start a
legal case and it was only with his
ability to access information online
from around the world across borders
across cultures that he was actually
able to start to try to get justice for
himself and so I think we can really see
that these fundamental principles to the
internet aren't just nice because we can
look a little cats jumping around and
jumping in boxes but they really are
fundamental to how we can grow as a just
society so it's really imperative that
we protect these rights and I think also
another interesting thing is
and a lot of people i'm sure in this
room were there when the internet began
and understand the sense of freedom and
possibility that this had and and it's
I'm sure you will feel a very different
feeling to how we have today that we
feel we're being monitored online we
understand that our companies are taking
out data and sharing it with governments
and so I would ask you what legacy do
you want to leave your children and your
grandchildren what internet do you want
them to have because now is the moment
where we have to ensure that it's
preserved and with that i think that
there's some interesting examples of
people that had understood what a free
internet was and what it meant and was
so shocked when they understood what it
was becoming that they went to
extraordinary lengths to try and write
that and of course i'm speaking of
people like chelsea manning jeremy
hammond and of course edward snowden and
I don't know you should all go and watch
Laura Poitras film but if anyone's seen
it and I'm sorry for the spoil but he
actually says in that that exactly this
I remember what it was like and we
really need to get back to that and I
think that any anyone that can remember
it and and wants to get back to that
really should be trying to find
practical solutions to do that because
it's not going to happen by itself and
we can see that I think when we look at
the threats to the internet so they are
of course mass surveillance we can see
that we now know that the NSA is
surveilling all its own citizens and
citizens across the world it's breaking
its own laws international laws it's
breaking our fundamental rights to
privacy and not only is the NSA doing
this but then our governments and not
standing up for our rights we can look
at this that it's because I think that
the problem with with the threats to a
free internet at the moment is that we
really have a concentration of power in
what is
a decentralized structure so something
that was a great opportunity for all is
now becoming because of this
concentration of power of who owns key
key parts of the infrastructure or who
has so much money and so much power to
then severe all wick it's turning it's
becoming into a weapon that's abusing
our rights and that's again when we look
at concepts like equal access and so net
neutrality so that's not just about
speed of the internet and that being
equal to everyone there's an interesting
phenomenon in many developing countries
that's starting so where they access
their internet people can't pay for
computers they're just don't have the
money but they do have a phone so
they're accessing the internet through
their phone connection and there are
plans that are being set up for this
we're a bit like with for example your
sky subscription you're getting
different packages of how much of the
internet you can access depending upon
how much you pay and then people that
can't afford any access at all what
places organizations like Facebook are
doing is they're actually creating
something called facebook 0 which is
allowing even if you don't have any
money at all it's allowing you access to
the internet but only to Facebook so
it's just creating an even larger
monopoly of Facebook because they have
such a concentration of power and
they're able to to to go and and give
this free service there's countless
examples of censorship on the internet
so Twitter being censored in Turkey tour
in China and then we have had a lot of
examples of censorship against us so
just to give you a few of those Joe
Lieberman when he was chairman of the
Senate Committee on Homeland Security
and called for any organization involved
with WikiLeaks to immediately terminate
its relationship with us so this was
followed by amazon
our servers an extra legal banking
blockade which you can see here as soon
as Visa and MasterCard cast off our
ability to get donations went 2-0 every
DNS actually pulled us that same week
and this is an example of where the
ideals we really feel about in a in a
free internet came into play because the
way we were able to combat this was
people around the world set up mirrors
and so we were still able to stay online
and that's an example of the type of
solution that the true values of a free
internet can create sorry so just
quickly looking at all of those I hear a
lot of talk those examples I hear a lot
of talk about how the internet is broken
and we need to rewrite all of our laws
and we need to fix it entirely and with
regards to the actual laws we have laws
that should be protecting this I'll give
you a few examples if we look at the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
article number one all human beings are
born free and equal in dignity and
rights so everybody should have a
quality so net neutrality shouldn't be
something we're needing to fight for it
those rights exist it is that our
governments are not protecting it
protecting them there's a couple of even
more apt ones article 19 everyone has
the right to freedom of opinion and
expression this includes the freedom to
hold opinions without interference and
to seek receive and impart information
and ideas through any media and
regardless of frontiers so we don't need
to write in there and online its
inherent in the way this is written
through any media we should be able to
receive and impart information
regardless of frontiers so I it's there
the laws are there and similarly when we
look at surveillance article 12 no one
shall be subjected to arbitrary
interference with his privacy
family home or correspondence nor any
attacks upon his honor and reputation
everyone has the right to protection of
the law against such interference or
attacks so when this is part of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
how the NSA has been able to get away
with reading all of our emails is beyond
me and they're not being brought to
justice and for me this is an important
point when everybody there's a lot of
buzz words at the moments and many many
conferences around the world on internet
governance and we're going to talk to
politicians and we're going to change
the law and we get governance governance
governance and I think it's a little bit
of a red herring I'm not saying that we
shouldn't be fighting for the protection
of our rights but there is so much money
and time being spent on trying to
discussions to create laws that we have
and I think that it's very important and
this is where I get to the
responsibility of people such as
yourselves in this room where it's quite
clear to me that the government doesn't
stand up for our rights I've seen it in
publications that we've had in many ways
their secret renditions torture and then
when it comes to online we have those
rights they're being abused and no one
is being held accountable so I don't
think that the solutions are necessarily
going to come from just changing those
laws because when you have a large
organization like the NSA that whose
mentality as an organization is to go
and collect everything then how just
because we change laws that we know
they've been breaking already are they
just going to suddenly change there was
a very one of the most interesting
documents to me from the Snowden
revelations was one actually from their
intranet and to me it was interesting
because you can really you're really
inside the Beast ven as it were you're
really seeing their personality and they
they talk about yes let's collect at all
let's collect at all and they even admit
they don't even know why or that it will
really be of any help to them but so
when you have a large organization with
so much money so much power and all of
the individuals meant
he within it is just to collect
everything they're not caring about the
laws and I just don't see that they're
about to care about them suddenly if
they change I also think that there's a
problem in that these legal methods can
take so long so one example where there
was the right outcome is the EU data
retention law it started in September
2005 sadly during the presidency of my
dear country the United Kingdom was
adopted in March 2006 it was all about
storing citizens telecommunications data
it got a lot of criticism but it took a
long time for any any legal change to
actually occur it wasn't until in 2012
when digital rights island were able to
bring a case to the court of justice at
the European Union that they actually
won and that took until 2014 so it took
eight years for a law that was already
for a law that was found to be
unconstitutional to be gotten rid of
through legal avenues so I just as much
as I agree with fighter speaking to
governments and policymakers and
fighting for the protection of our
rights not a change in the laws but a
protection of our rights that already
exist I think that the main the real
answer to this is going to come from the
technical community and developers like
yourselves and so we need to understand
what solutions and we need there of
course there's organizations like tor so
for example who here runs at or relay 1
I think if everyone in this room started
at all really it would take you 10
minutes it's a very easy solution um
it's it's easy to do and that's just one
clear way in which people can actually
start to to grow these tools that
already exist as well as developing new
ones I'll get to you once in a minute
there's organizations as well I think
that we should be supporting and using
that are really
living by the values of a free internet
and so for example CCC i'm sure many of
you know that their principles and
ethics of those over free internet one
thing that they do which is very
important is have Congress each year
where a lot of people come together and
do talk about solutions as well and I
think collaboration in this is very
important bitcoin of course anonymity
equal access free exchange across
borders and then publishing
organizations that are publishing online
resisting censorship like like WikiLeaks
we have a few ways in which i think that
we are living by the ideals of a free
internet and really playing those out so
not only are we actually publishing
online and we're also creating archives
and we made the public library of loot
us diplomacy that says search engine not
just for cable gates but also for all
other united states cables that that
have been released by the by the
government they get they declassify them
after 25 years and what's interesting
about this is then you can start when
you have full archives online you can
start to see say a trajectory of someone
that is maybe now politician in 2010
what were they doing 30 years ago our
search engine not google's and and then
very specifically in some cases where
this this was an australian gag order
and we resisted the censorship it was
actually the this gag order was actually
a wet saying that they couldn't even
talk about a case that was closed to the
public just the facts that has existed
it was a corruption case in australia by
the with the australian reserve bank
which we published so aside from helping
organizations that actually already
exist and what what are the new things
we need so just coming from my
perspective
as a journalist at WikiLeaks I think
that we need we need scale so ten
solutions that serve one person is a lot
better than is a lot worse than one
solution that serves a hundred and we
need diversity so for example tall we
need to really get as many tall relays
as possible so we becomes less easy to
target and jabber for example more
jabber service so that you're not just
relying on on a few and then the main
thing and I know you hear it time and
time again but usability is a hugely
important thing I'm forever helping
journalists setup secure communications
and PGP for example they just find it
impossible to use for so long it takes
so much training so anything I know it's
really boring to developers but anything
that can be done on helping usability
would help us a lot for example just in
one example and this topical at the
moment Glenn Greenwald in his book
explains that just before publication
when he had to speak to head office
tried to do that insecure means the only
one he could actually get the head
office even slightly using was cryptic
at which was at that very moment a
number of vulnerabilities in it were
actually being exposed and put online
but he basically had no choice because
they just couldn't use anything else so
anything that would take down my
training the training time in it would
be hugely important so very specific
things that would be very helpful to us
that we would have you can use time and
time again a server lyst chat clients
the server's become such a target and
the information that would be given out
if they're breached means that anything
that's not a encrypted chat that was not
relying on servers would be very helpful
to us multi-person
to chat when we're working on
publications we do a lot of
investigative work and a lot of
collaborations so an easy way in real
time for people to be able to
collaborate together in a secure fashion
would help and this is where I think
collaboration does come in from the tech
community as well for example there are
some solutions to elements of this so
for example textsecure is great and it
could solve some of these issues but it
needs a desktop client it uses telephone
numbers as identify as it's not
integrated into into many other ways so
if if there was more collaboration and
someone could take textsecure and and
make it so the journalists could use it
in the newsroom on their computers that
would be very useful and we basically
need an alternative to email so an
asynchronous long-form text
communication as opposed to synchronous
chat ideally that wouldn't be using
servers again in the way email does
end-to-end encrypted by default and it
does not have the encryption protocol as
a separate plug-in so again this is
where collaboration would come in so
pond would be potentially a solution
here it needs a full security audit
though even if when you go the front
page they even say I haven't like don't
use this if you need to be secure and it
needs more user interfaces across
platforms and then the last one on my
wish list is serverless files sync bits
Inc would be a solution to this but it's
closed source so another solution where
files could be passed without them being
uploaded to another server I in the case
of Dropbox so that your then relying on
that company to keep something secure
and and of course for all of these they
should work over tall by default so
that's just from my point of view as
sort of small wish list if anyone is
feeling that they actually want to go
and try and solve these problems of
freedom online and helping organizations
to to work securely and as I said I
think one of the biggest things in its
where conferences like this are
important is collaboration because there
are is the start of some solutions out
there or some just need to be made
larger or some need to be improved so if
your next coffee break you can all have
a chat and collaborate and see what you
can could all do working together I
think that would be very important and
if anyone wants to ask questions now I'm
happy to take questions no questions at
all yes oh the question is about how do
you correct me if I'm wrong but the
question is about how do you balance the
the fact that there is a legitimate need
to surveil in some instances for example
the monitoring of a terrorist
organization so when I'm saying that we
shouldn't have surveillance online how'd
it was where's the line between that is
that what you're saying I think that the
the interesting thing that's come out of
the Snowden revelations and the way in
which he did it was and his thinking
behind it was that there is no oversight
and there are laws being broken because
the surveillance the surveillance the
NSA was doing was mass surveillance to
such a huge penetrative level that it
was breaking the laws and the public had
no idea about what was going on so the
problem is is that these are revelations
and I think that if a society agrees
that the police should be able to do
targeted surveillance on a terrorist
organization then at least they've made
that decision the problem we have at the
moment is there was no oversight there
was no understanding of what was going
on and it was break violating all our
rights so I'm not saying that the police
should not be able to do their work but
the police should be there should be
oversight by the public to understand
what the police are doing and they
should then be living by
I the laws that are in place does that
sort of answer the question or not yeah
yes so i would like to run a tour relay
and it's a real struggle finding service
providers that will actually allow you
to run at or rely on their
infrastructure so what can we do about
that and also do we end up with a
concentration of risk that there's the
handful of service providers that do
allow you to run Tory lays but then we
end up with all of the Tory laser on
their infrastructure we can't spread it
enough across the Internet yeah I mean I
think that it's a good point that would
that would be a risk and that would be
something that's that would then that we
do need to find a solution to I think
that if the if as the understanding of
the problems of mass surveillance go up
my hope is that organizations and you
can see start to see a change in the way
some corporations are acting and they're
becoming more ethical and understanding
that interestingly i think it was
actually a lot through the issue of
rather than suddenly becoming ethical it
was when they started to lose customers
that they they they actually started to
change I've not heard anyone before
finding it that's difficult to assess to
find a service provider to set up at all
really I do appreciate that not everyone
will maybe that's something we could ask
the the Tor project to do is to start to
to find out more more service providers
thought that would allow us into two to
maybe put that list or you could contact
them for for provider for it um yeah
I've never heard that anyone has not
found anyone before to the point where
it stopped them so um I'm sorry that
you've had that experience Oh see what
talk can do about that maybe again just
the add on that yeah because you read
one it's as easy as having a fairly fast
internet connection at home in a
Raspberry Pi if you want yeah right I
mean you can
you don't need to have a gigabit server
running on some backbone so you have no
wrong isp done ah in Britain yes yeah
all makes sense now yes well I think the
first step on that is fighting because I
we've had this a lot in our work as well
this national security rhetoric that
everyone goes oh my god I don't want to
be blown up tomorrow by a terrorist so
let's do whatever the government says
and we had this for example when we this
sort of stuff when we published the
Afghan war logs the US government
started saying all you have blood on
their hands which to me it did blood on
your hands which to me is just
extraordinary when you're exposing the
deaths at their hands of thousands of
people have met us just for putting the
fact that they did this online for the
world to read suddenly they managed to
turn this rhetoric so I think though
that is a huge problem but I think that
it's it's possible now we're building up
him a number of examples through our
publications and then also the NSA
publications that show that this just
isn't the case so for example I don't
know if anybody knows there was a
situation where the country X was put
was the insect redacted the name of a
country whose entire content and
metadata was being collected and the the
US government's sort of spun some
rhetoric and put some pressure on them
so they actually had to redact the
entire country name we actually then
published the name of that country to
great hoo-ha by everyone overall no but
the you know this they're going to die
people will be awful be awful and the
only thing that happened was the Afghan
government was so obsessed about the it
was Afghanistan was upset about the mass
surveillance that they
and started to look at actually closing
down the NSA's basis within their
country so the only thing that it hurt
there was the interests of the United
States government in that country so I
think they're always going to do it I
don't think the government's about to
stop doing it so I think that all the
the best solution to that is to get a
couple of those sorts of examples where
will it hasn't actually harmed anyone
and then you have those in your
arguments when you're speaking to people
about mass surveillance because there is
not one claim that these things have
heard anything other than the interests
of the United States government abroad
it hasn't killed anyone it was the same
in the trial of chelsea manning they
were absolutely desperate to find
someone that had been hurt by her
alleged doc leaking of documents and
even the US government with all of their
time and all of their money and their
desperate wish to find it couldn't find
one person so I agree it's a very
difficult issue but I so I guess my only
answer is that there are now examples
concrete examples you can use as as
arguments back to those people yes so
just a not so quick question no so one
of the things getting back to like the
tour relays I think there's a being
around but when the internet started and
having that sense of freedom as a
technical person I think we've still got
a lot of the abilities to do that but i
think in recent times become much more
polarized in that whilst you could say
run at or relay now you attract so much
more consequence because of that I mean
there's people who are scared because
the rice p might shut them down or you
might get a knock on the door one day
demanding to confiscate your hardware or
i could write an encryption scheme that
does the things like you've suggested on
your wish list but there's consequence
to doing that and it seems like we've
polarized things where you can either
just conform and not you know try and
change too much or not run at evil
toreally or you're an Edward Snowden or
you know Chelsea Manning I mean there's
we seem to have lost that middle ground
where
and be just a little bit of an activist
and what's your what's your feeling
towards that how do we get that back
yeah I mean it's what I was sort of
talking about at the beginning that I
think it's almost one of the largest
threats and in this is this chilling
effect where people then become too
scared to say or to it as you're saying
to do the things that they would
otherwise do I it is a difficult problem
I'm not saying I have all the answers
for it by any means but I think that
certainly the more and more people do it
the harder it becomes to stop them the
US government I found in our work is
very intent on making examples of people
to try and stop but they're they're
beginning to fail at it I mean they made
a huge example of Manning but Snowden's
still happened and there are more and
more whistleblowers coming forward so i
think that the only solution to that and
it's not an easy one but is to is to get
enough people that are courageous enough
and and and willing to do these things
because as soon as there's a critical
mass of them it becomes far more
difficult if not hopefully impossible
for the government to stop it but i
agree it is it is a large issue with
with things like if you're writing
programs it is possible to and bitcoins
obviously a good example of this if you
were to try and do it anonymously then
that's potentially one way you could
attempts to protect yourself although as
we've just been saying that isn't more
and more difficult to do online so yeah
I suppose the only real answer i have is
to resist the chilling effect
unfortunately sorry
so just quickly wanted to say that we
promised you there is an app to ask
questions unfortunately I can't get
internet connection in this room so if
you have posted questions on the app for
me to ask and you feel ok with it ask
them again now because I can't access
them unfortunately do you get much
support from other organizations in
doing this because we've talked a lot
about individuals but i'm curious about
organizations who may have other
businesses but also are activists in
their own right I know for example
thought works one response yeah it's
very it has a big you know idea of being
active in these areas but like do they
run Tory lays do you know other
companies that do these kind of things
or who support you in this kind of work
I think there are more and more the I
would say a lot of companies that are
very supportive are ones that actually
have those sorts of ideal so they tend
to be tech companies so for example
there's bahnhof in Sweden is a has a
massive data center that they have in
like some old bunker and they were when
in 2010 when we were publishing and we
were starting to be attacked they were
one of our providers and they they stuck
with us as much as as much as they could
they couldn't obviously stop the banking
blockade or things like this but so
within that within the tech industry and
there are there are more that i would
say then then in other industries
because they I suppose they they
understand what we're doing a lot more
as well as also from a technical side
other companies that support us I think
a lot of the time it tends to be outside
of the tech industry it tends to be a
lot of individuals and I think that
that's probably due to just the way in
which we work because we publish online
it's individuals accessing in a kind of
one-on-one basis
so there's a lot of companies that
really don't like us because we've
published their documents so if yeah
yeah so within the tech industry a lot
of support and hopefully that just grows
and grows all right so yeah if there are
no more questions thank you very much
again for coming and if you can stick
around there's two more talks in this
track thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
