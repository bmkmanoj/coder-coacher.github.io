engineer I'm actually a hard worker and
the talk is quite focused on the
embedded systems of me and specifically
with examples from the Raspberry Pi that
we have been playing with because it's
very nice and today I'm just going to
give you a brief idea of what we're
dealing with embedded systems today and
we're just going to look at how the
actor model works it's been around for
quite some time now so I'm sure you must
have come across it at some point so I'm
not going to go into too much detail
there it's actually quite a simple model
so it shouldn't have problem there and
we are engaging the project at the
moment called Erlang embedded I will
talk a bit about that and tell me bit
about our objectives and we're trying to
achieve that and then we'll look at some
practical examples on how we can apply
the actor model and user line to model
our system multiple program our systems
and we'll look at a simple demo I've
done with the Raspberry Pi and finally
well I'll show you a bit about what I'm
currently working on if you have time we
can have some questions and answers I'll
be here for the rest of the conference
so feel free to talk to me if you want
to talk more about this okay so what is
an embedded system this has been covered
in the previous two talks so I'm not
going to your turn it into this the
traditionally it's a system that has a
specific purpose which may be part of a
larger system sometimes it has real time
constraints and so on but generally it's
a small device physically it's more
quite some often as well that is meant
to do one thing only and do it very well
um currently the language of choice for
lingua franca of the embedded world to
see it has been seen in the past as well
and it's quite strange to see it
increasing as well but there's no
denying that you know you can see is
here to stay
going to get rid of see so but the
problem is there are certain things that
you can't do really well in C and these
things seem to be the problems we're
dealing with today's systems so we're
dealing with increasingly complex system
on chip platforms on devices that were
working on or your develop and manage
the complexities of these systems just
because of their sheer size is becoming
a problem i may have this beautiful
phrase called the Internet of Things
which means that our devices are
connected and distributed and they have
needs like networking support of
communication support as well and unless
you employ a framework sockets
programming in C isn't fun um and again
dealing with multi-core and
heterogeneous devices in C is not fun as
well um and this is like decide to put
it there time to market this ever and
ever increasing problem of course you
have to be able to rapidly prototype
your ideas and with the tools that we
have today like 3d printers becoming so
cheap it's it's quite possible to crank
out prototypes in a matter of weeks
instead of months um so embedded systems
means a lot of things so and that
translates to different methodologies
being involved in designing and let it
isn't so personally a bare-metal
approach would be followed direct
register manipulation setting your
peripherals etc why are some direct
register and if relations you don't have
a high-level operating system no
scheduler as you can use console so this
is really for small devices 8 and 16-bit
class devices and you can also employ a
real-time operating system now this is
quite common um especially for military
and space applications where you need
guarantees timing guarantees
you do the employer on TLS and also we
have embedded Linux which is precisely
just mimic slim down and harder
interfaces that lets you communicate
with the outside world in the form of
kernel modules have talked to the
peripherals on the system on chip
devices so today I'm going to focus on
these two categories we're not really
interested in looking at bare metal and
the platforms you have available today
makes it very easy for us to just get
one off the shelf instead of exploring
these two concepts um so have you ever
used an arterial before everywhere have
you working an embedded platform before
so you'll probably be familiar with
these concepts then so in order to is
you have a notion of a task and then you
splits your program or application into
small chunks and then you have an
operating system scheduler which may
have preemptive or round robin
scheduling that takes care of scheduling
things in an hour in out of actual
execution and communication happens via
shared memory and operating system does
provide you with functionalities to do
that and because it's hardware anyhow to
make sure that you provide some control
over access to peripherals or hardware
access in general you have notion of new
Texas semaphores and looks now if you
look at the medics it's a different
story it's not a new concept it's been
around for a while as well but now that
we have $35 30 pounds ford stopped
beating the spy of the self it's
becoming more and more popular this is
good for the software world but actually
hardware guys embed of designs find
themselves at the loss because the
concepts that they're used to I say
tasks do not exist natively within the
operating system what I mean by that is
of course you can use a trailing library
in C etc but they didn't have to do that
directly on the rtos they could just
wrap it around and very minimal
sort of wrapper so they can't really get
there and wrap their heads around this
and that poses a problem and dealing the
threads and see again it's not fun um
and also the device driver frameworks
are the documentation is pretty terrible
and quite often you find yourself
scratching your head that's not mine so
let's look at the action model this is
not depressing this is fun this is again
a very old concept and the idea is very
simple you have these very primitive
building blocks that lets you compose
distributed systems and the reach of it
is that they are self-contained so
they'd not share memory which means this
reading them across different nodes or
different networks are different
platforms is very easy to do and don't
have to use early it's been implemented
in a variety of programming languages
and yeah I mean one interesting feature
work i should say the most interesting
feature is the communication aspect
though it uses synchronous message
passing and it has a notion of a mailbox
so you can send the message from one
process to the other and it will be put
into its mailbox to be processed when
the time comes and that time is when
there are no more messages in front of
that particular message of sense and
upon receiving a message there are three
operations you can do one of them is to
spawn a new actor or you can change your
internal state depending on the message
is received or you can choose to pass on
the message to the next actor in the
line um that's a graphical
representation of this let's say we have
this data-acquisition actor that has
acquired some numbers from a bunch of
sensors that it has connected let's say
we have to do some operations on these
what we can do is we can spawn a new
actor and number cruncher and then send
the values that we
acquired from the acquisition actor to
the contractor this actor can then
process these and then send it back for
it can spawn new actors or workers um
send subsets of these readings to them
get them to calculate and receive the
results back this may not happen in
sequence this may happen currently
because these are all process different
processes running once it collate all
the information back or the results back
it can then send it to the acquisition
unit which is now waiting for a reply um
so it's a very simple model as you can
see there's not much to it if you don't
go down to the proof or but it has some
limitations so the general model does
not have emotional inheritance and the
general hierarchy is not defined in
concrete terms so each language or
library implementation has certain
variations on this idea of architecting
complex system also a synchronous
message passing can be problematic for
certain applications although for the
applications I'm use talked about today
does not pose an issue surely you will
not face this problem um this last point
sort of proves the initial point I made
because it's an abstract they're
finishing especially rendering you're
working in the team or many people are
working on one project it becomes an
issue because how low you go in terms of
granularity can be a blessing and a
curse I'll talk more about this in the
next few actually in a few website um
now all I mention that I've been
involved in this project called Erlang
embedded it's a partnership between
Erlang solutions and the University of
Kent and we're looking at ways we can
employ her line as a tool to manage
these complexities and use it as an
Orchestrator or moisture of the system
as it were to bring these
to solve these challenges that we have
I'd seen in the first life if you want
more information because they're lying
in bed calm we have some videos of
blinking lights and we did some fun
explorations like spooning 136,000
processes on the Raspberry Pi and I'm
communicating with them these are our
line processes were doing a operating
system fresh tarragon what happy um so
why are like why are we involved in this
project in why did you know yourself
can't agree to collaborate with online
solutions and what's a person um Erlang
of course in tonight's the eczema for
the argument that talk about the XML and
it's been battle tested in ericsson
which we're oryza nated from and many
other companies as well so a line is not
a new language it's been around for
quite some time and it's been used in
production quite some time as well it
was originally designed for embedded
applications so the telephony
applications or telephony switches
ericsson developed which was the main
platform just language was designed on
or refined on it was an embedded
application I mean it didn't run say on
an embedded ARM processor but it the
concept was a good by definition an
embedded system so it has support for
concurrency and distributed pneus out of
the box and it has some very interesting
supervision and error handling
hierarchies which i'll be talking about
in a minute and of course there's some
other shiny bits as well so we have a
very simple and consistent error
recovery and tourism hierarchy of mini
supposing I varieties with um I'll get
to the limit it has built-in fault
tolerance this is partly due to the fact
that actors are isolated and a part of
your system going wrong will not bring
down the entire
em unless there's something
catastrophically wrong with your system
so you can create structured
architectures that our tail safe and if
they fail they can be restarted or taken
care of another means depending on the
supervision hierarchy you have chosen it
also has an interesting feature where it
supports hot code loading so you can
update the functionality of your system
without having to bringing it down what
that means is you can do a bug fix on
your system and deploy it to your vm and
once the actor that's running that old
code has finished it so the next time
it's spawned it will load the new
version of the code but the change is
seamless so it's that's why it's called
hot cold loading and supports dynamic
reconfiguration and spoiling an actor is
quite simple in our life it's just a
call to this phone function and I'm
going to use the term actor and a line
process interchangeably because parallel
processes or acted Wow and once you
spoon a process then you have a new PID
process idea to communicate with and
send messages to and communication
happens while at the bank operator and
using this construct they can send
messages from the first process to the
second one now message passing happens
are synchronously and there is no
handshake unless you explicitly
implemented yourself so what you what
you do generally if you want to response
back is you pass your own process ID to
the second process of your messaging so
that when it it has a reply for you it
knows where to send it so by using self
he gets your own process ID and then
send it as the first element of your
topic um when we get to the error error
making
or error recovery mechanisms we have
this notion of planes so you can link
multiple processes together and when you
link things together if one of them goes
down the others know about it now you
can do to two main things with this we
can just choose to ignore this and have
your entire system fail or you can
implement supervisors to take care of
this and then restart them or do some
other extra bits and restart them and
unification um the general philosophy in
writing your line processes or online
modules or actors is to let it fail and
then employ supervision hierarchy to
take care of errors this leads to a
cleaner or and linear modules because
you don't have to worry about
implementing all the error checking etc
within the module and it also increases
pulp reuse potentially because specific
conditions that you have to deal with
specific error conditions that you have
to deal with and can be then implemented
as part of a supervisor is supposed to
being part of the axial actor or the
processor to your program um so what I
mean by linking in exit signals is
clearly demonstrated by this snow I'm
diagram here let's say we have three
processes and they're all linked
together if one of them has a fault if
it fails then the other one will receive
a negative message and if you have a
reason it will be passed on as well and
once it receives a message it will
terminate as well letting the links
process know that some
has gone wrong and that exists message
will propagate through all the link
processes unless you explicitly tell it
to trap exits trapping exits means that
if it receives an error message if won't
propagate through and it will try to
deal with this without having to I kill
or send messages to the other processes
to be king so let's say we again have
three main processes and now Pippi or
our second processes trapping exits um
so we have a vault in first one you
receive an exit message not normally if
this wasn't trapping if it be wasn't
trapping exits then we would have a
problem in our hands but now we choose
to ignore propagating that error message
through and then we can maybe restart a
again or again take precautions to bring
up the system to an on state in a minute
systems it's crucial that you know the
state of your system at all times
because let's say you're developing a
robot which has some very sharp it's
flying about like souls etc you can't
afford to have your system in an online
state it can be quite lethal um so
dealing with errors and having these
supervision hierarchies is quite useful
to create safe and a logical system um
never feature of Erlang is this is going
back to our little C theta in order to
interface with hardware you will at some
point have to write some sea and
third-line does provide you facilities
to link to these see programs and it
will see drivers that to you right and
use them as part of your overall system
so let's say you have an I squared C
device and you don't
another line binding for it but you have
a seat binding for it just wrap it
around sayin it and then yeah
representative of the functions of the C
Drive rates poses with another line that
you can call into software so with all
things considered other line I think is
a great tool for orchestrating at the
overall operation of your system it
almost reminds me of black box design
methodologies and say VHDL are very
welcome hardly description is making
great modules and then creates top level
description of your system and link
things together using different take the
poses etc obviously it's not the same
concept um but the overall hierarchy and
the way you model in architecture
systems I think is there are some
equipment path interesting powers in
these two major buildings oh okay let's
talk about raspberry pi we have seen
this in the first presentation today so
it's been so much time there I think
it's an extremely exciting platform some
people say it's just a fad it's just all
weird that everyone uses these days I
don't believe in that I think if people
keep blinking LEDs with it then get big
lots of cute piping games if cannot
actually change the whole ICT issue that
we have and you might finally have some
interesting projects coming out of
universities as well so obviously the
raspberry pi foundation is a charity and
their mission statement is to promote
computer science and stone concurrency
and parallelism are issues that we have
to deal with today and it's only going
to get worse because we have these
multicolored devices and what one really
wants to program these straight out of
university because well anyway um so
these are the kids who will be using my
ipod today will be our future engineers
future hackers and future programmers so
um if we can somehow create material
that's interesting for them that teaches
them the basics of concurrency and
parallelism I think that will go
very well and they university they don't
have to learn these concepts in the
second year of their course so we have
lots of peripherals on the pie general
purpose I owe you our Thai squid CIOs
spi posted modulation tsri CSI so it is
a what it's it's quite a nice platform
that you can afford to kill what I mean
by that is you won't feel sorry if
somehow you're hacking it and you know
you shorted it's not the end of the
world it's only thirty-five dollars at
the end of it so i hope to month of
delivery time it's getting a lot of
better x there will be a point where we
will be able to and order it and it will
around they say that's a good point um
so did I think if we provide people
enough fun projects and that's what
people like quick to why are doing which
is quite exciting we will see a lot of
fun projects um like small robots now
this doesn't I can't compete with the
previous demo of course that was way too
much fun oh but you can put together a
small robbing buggy in some senses etc
for you know it's quite a little amount
of money and it's not i see that
difficult if you use some harder and
interfacing libraries and so on so this
is way more exciting than just some
console applications that you get to
right along as part of your education in
the first years so i don't have it with
me because traveling with robots is
actually quite difficult um but here's a
simple demo of it why we're going around
in our Swedish office it has a few
senses and they feedback information to
this brain process and then we use a few
other actors or processes to control the
GPIO pins to tell it where to go so we
have more
a driver and a chip that takes a few
inputs and then just goes around um this
is an early demo doesn't do much but the
simple idea is that you're just giving
Raspberry Pi and a motor driver in the
battery and you have wrong it's quite
fun um okay let's talk about how we
actually employ these concepts on the
pie um I mention that we control the
motor direction etc using simple DPI
organs um and I'm not going to go into
the detail of Xavier see talk to them
but it's just right into files basically
gpio kernel module exposes certain files
Sisyphus representations of files that
you can just talk to to set the
direction of the pin and then you can
just write down value suit and so um
which is fine so we can have one process
talking to another process that talks
directly to the pin setting its value
but what happens if we have multiple
processes sending values at the same
time now because you're employing the
actor model what happens is you have you
end up with lots of messages in pin
Seventeen's mailbox but the sequence of
messages that you receive might actually
kill your assistant so if you try to
change the direction of a motor
physically you can damage it it gives it
some technical things and inductive
loads and song so directly vetting
processes change the state of a pin is
not a very good design decision because
you might end up with you know quite a
kettle catastrophic results so by
employed this is where deciding on the
granularity comes into play so if you
decide to abstract this one level up or
down depending on how you look at it you
can employ this proxy process that takes
all these messages for state values for
pins in and then sends them to the
relevant things directly now you can
argue that this is just a way of locking
things down and this again it's just a
lock in the traditional sense of things
but you can do a lot more than just
having sort of a lock mechanism or a
mutual exclusion mechanism you can then
implements interesting things like you
type the toggling way to the pin and if
it's too high um I just slow it down or
generate an error message or take care
of it there are interesting fact is that
you have to take into account when
you're dealing with real world in
software if you spawn processes too
quickly the chances over worst thing
that can happen rather is your confusion
will look up and you'll have to free the
RAM or just restart the machine or
something but if you're interfacing with
a real piece of hardware the real piece
of a gadget you can cause quite a bit of
damage as I've mentioned before and kill
your system so safety is quite important
in general embedded design methodologies
so by implementing these different
criterias you can de-stress creates of
guarantees almost to make sure that your
system won't kill something which is
always good what love killing someone's
good again the abstraction or the
granularity can be choice and a blessing
at the same time so fine grain
abstraction does provide linear modules
that can be tested and potentially
reused easier but the better is coming
up with the notion or deciding on how
low you want to go is a problem
especially you're working with different
teams um one sort of model that we're
talking with at the moment is this idea
of components and
modules so and these are a platform some
of parts of it are platform agnostic so
we have the component API on the top of
everything this is the actual bit of
code that you interact within your
program and then we have a peripheral
API on the lower level that you
generally don't deal with as part of a
higher level program because it exposes
row of interfaces to the system then on
the bottom of the stack we have this
peripheral implementation which actually
lets the Erlang vm talk to real
peripherals so let's give it a sort of
example we have a temperature sensor
that has a nice crisp light pi squared C
interface the sensor API doesn't change
between different platforms the
functions or the calls that you might
have could be get temperature and the
message that you're going to send to the
ice courtesy bus driver are going to be
the same as well because I don't they
have defined by the manufacturers of
this part but underneath that level you
are free to run this on a Linux system
or PSD system or a system image doesn't
have Sisyphus facilities say a Mitch
platform using a memory mapped budu it's
quite fun to just mark the reason of
memory and then many plates bits
directly embedded Linux for each for
existence um it's can potentially very
very dangerous so okay this was a very
simple example this is just
just answer it six legs and doesn't do
much and you may argue that this is
complicating the matter too much and you
can just have a simple module to take
care of this communication there okay
well if you if you look at a modern
common architecture system on chip
architecture we can see that we have a
lot of things to deal with so providing
common abstractions say for instance we
have multiple eyes I squared C
interfaces if it can create an
abstraction for these and then create
higher level simpler component modules
on top of these I think we will have a
better world really because doing these
humongous see blocks and then have them
interfacing with each other is quite
difficult and we can now afford to lose
a few CPU cycles in the name of
abstracting things and making things
easier for us the Raspberry Pi is
running out 700 megahertz but now you
can overclock it if the foundation has
given its blessing so you can overclock
your Raspberry probably without losing
your warranty and I think it can run up
to the one gig errands when I won't give
your head system you can't afford to
underline or any other vm for instance
and have these higher level
functionalities in terms of networks or
threading and general niceties of the
modern world because again doing these
communicating or threading etc and
claims in C is not fun since we are
talking about on stuff good point I
thought that I'd show you a few of the
stuff that we have been working on um
the first one is called fontaine and
it's I want you to see I mean I don't
know how willing to see it but it's
essentially a simple board that acts as
a bridge between the Raspberry Pi and
the art
platform the reason I think this is
theirs well quite literally quite a few
hundreds of these arduino shields that
provide you with extra functionality and
in order instead of just design
redesigning them we can use them with
the Raspberry Pi if they create a little
translator between the Arduino format or
they are doing a specification in the
Raspberry Pi the first one of these in
they are unfortunately not directly
compatible each other first one meaning
that they work at different voltage
levels um so I have some level
translators on the pins and the
Raspberry Pi does not have an outlook as
digital converter with some of the
shield's use so i also had a per ml
squared C analog to digital converter
day this this was the first division and
if he actually going back to Matt's
point about prototyping I didn't print
this out on a piece of paper and then
just assume that it would work in
sensitive solar to fall together and
realize that the axial connector
placement makes it impossible to use it
because we can't use this as it is
because as you can see there's not
enough clearance between the header over
here and the shield so this meant that i
have to design new verses that's why you
see two different ones here I extended
the size of the board which gave us so
much space as I have more functionality
hardware's fun so yeah this this is me
just trying to figure out what's going
on and you can actually see an Arduino
underneath the shield so instead of just
plugging your shield in to this lab to
board and use it you can also do it the
other way and link in our do we know to
the Raspberry Pi directly so you can use
it for both purposes it's that available
this i I'm I'm just I'm about 80% finish
with prototyping this as you can see
this is the young
i sold it up actually it will be
released as an open source project this
is our way of contributing back to the
society which makes us feel all fuzzy
and warm so yeah I mean you can find
more information about this actually you
will be able to find more information
about this at Pearl i'm in bed hopefully
soon very soon famous last words um so
another thing we've been working on is
little hardware simulator I'm going to
do a live demo here and it will be all
wrong but let's give it a go near so we
are developing this small demo board to
use in our little experiments which has
a bunch of LEDs some switches and push
buttons some analog components and I
wanted a way of simulating this without
actually having the real hardware on
hand you have the two months delivery
time yeah due to the tree again yeah
I've just about finished this on the
plane journey up here so it's not fully
functional yet but the idea is very
simple we replicate the exact look well
not exactly perhaps but that we
replicate the same functionality of a
hardware board in a browser and then use
web sockets to communicate with Frank
and written in Erlang and then right
simulated hardware modules to basically
interact with these devices um I mean
doesn't do much at the moment but if I
re-establish a connection if I press a
button you will see that one of these
LEDs will write up what happens here is
if I press the button and then my
backhand receives a message that tells
well the back end or the simulated gpio
bottom module that it has received one
and then it writes it back to the
browser using web sockets and turns I've
led on and for our work stuff we can
actually change the value of the
um well components and then we'll see
that we receive the changes us little
messages in the back end this is very
much a work in progress but since this
is a makers track after that demonstrate
this again this will be available on our
website and more information will be off
there soon finally we're also working on
a training stack for creating the new
generation of embedded devices we've
discussed the sort of requirements of
all distributed nurse connected and
complex nature of these systems and we
thought it would be a nice idea if there
is a complete package everything from
I'm sorry embedded Linux 101 to a secure
line principles and actually talking to
hardware within our line including the
hardware platform that you can use to
prototype your ideas maybe later take
into production using a second platform
so if you're interested come and talk to
me please and what looking forward to
having some Danish beers so find me and
I'll tell me more about this and i'ma do
a little more I'm sure I'm also with
them by show of hands how many of you
interested in taking a class that make
me think it over skype I will send you
the board before um I think there's a
distinct life of complete sort of
packages that lets you go from the
software rolled into the hardware all
directly and that's why we have
interesting projects say what not is
there waiting pythonic bindings or
hardware this is quite nice and we're
approaching it from a different
perspective following a different called
concurrency model but overall if you
include the hardware no illusion linux
device drivers etc we think this is this
will be a fun course let's put it that
way so not note I would like to thank
you
we're listening and buy more information
at these things and come talk to me I
thank you Bridge board thing um I'm
interested in that too in terms of
hooking it up to do you know what
everyone's been doing about that I'll
have a friend who is really into 3d
printers well I sent one oh I don't turn
it back from them but the problem with
no prep is the real time means that you
have with controlling peripherals and so
on so I mean you can yes I saw that's
handled by the reprap already so to
certain sound thank you to sit there
okay just listen to something better
than arduino I was thinking in terms of
replacing the axial controller aircraft
with a raspberry pi but if you have a
controller then it can use this to you
can get a ramp see for instance yeah we
can then put this or put it on top of
this and then hook it up to your part
it's all good that's gonna be a problem
because I I maps the peripherals say i
squared C to isolate the ESPN espy a
director the only problem is raspberry
pi that one doesn't have enough lots of
modulation chance so I'd only has one
pwm towel I don't think ramps or any of
the three perhaps heels use pw i think
they use less crazy to communicate with
them so that's wonderful there are some
hardware limitations because the
specifications are not matched one to
one but for digital stuff especially
