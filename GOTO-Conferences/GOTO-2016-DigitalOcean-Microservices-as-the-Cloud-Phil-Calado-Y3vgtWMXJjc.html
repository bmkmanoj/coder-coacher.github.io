work currently New York for a company
called ish the ocean if you haven't
realized but my uniform did you make me
worry you've ever meet anybody from
distortion say yeah it was ready thank
you guys important trust me my bonus
depends on this um say it so this notion
who da knows do solji couple hands up
alright so i will try to give you the
shapiro this notion is a cloud provider
how we're not one of the top through
your thinking of nowhere not one of them
I haven't bought as I left New York
ahead and be bought by having refreshed
when they recently so cannot totally
currency and we are we actually we have
this kind of approach which I really
appreciate it's like for developers
right so we focus on user experience
from the developer side let's be honest
i'm not here to sell anything so if you
want to talk about this version i'll be
around or i can i can hook you up with
some sales representative if you don't
use it I yeah sure it's just it's a
shame but you should use it is how are
you 24 so what I'm what am I via for
this thing about me joining research I
hackney been working there for just
about oh for months now I address
join them when i was living in Berlin
you're probably very confused about
maxing right now and i must clarify that
i am proceeding I know that makes no
sense but I've lived around the way to
spend way too much time in the common
welfare to hope and I was even in
filling and working for distortion kind
of interesting times on challenges and
other stuff we can talk about that later
but I've been working there for about
how a lot say three months let's go
through mother
and what we'll be doing a live version
for the past three months is really
trying to make this company that how can
I say infrastructure Yenta if the
company that was built from the ground
up we moved from people who have had
hosting company coats and companies in
the 90s you may remember the night those
people likely a Buick lordy happens
fairly successful cloud computing
offering and that means our software and
you cannot talk about soph 2016 without
talking about mattresses so you know
that's best what we do now we are
working a lot of shake up the what's a
fairly infrastructure company to a
software company we're going to be
talking a little bit about how it going
around our migration be because
obviously if you talk or micro services
which all like completely forward of
listening to you know every single
conference and go on pretty sure go to
is going to have it at least two tracks
about Microsoft's that was my princess
happy great conference to get it wrong
love it but there's at least two
tractable micro system so yes I'm here
talking over to the micro services I'm
really sorry about this but let me let
me try to describe what our usual like
my expense mean how Microsoft talks
about microservices go like bigger like
this um somebody had a monolith it was
definitely Reyes most likely database my
sequel ninety-nine percent maybe there
was some reggies stuff in him but I
never heard image to the register
there's some ready stuff and it does
things but it was here it considered the
arrow to be ready
I I don't know how it goes um and then
magic happens I totally wanted to have
the guy like a furnace Canadian I just
want this recently the guy look like
this the magic guy but he nope doesn't
like it magic happens and we have
microservices we chaplain I spent way
too much time fo x and micro services
are excellent that's it so yes micro
services and to be honest just before
joining distortion I was hoping for a
company in building two sampler which
you may have heard of if you really like
I trying to use of initiative mashups oh
yes a tank so some club we you spent
four years migrating from days to that
and I'm very used to give this talk on
the front of sample perspective well you
know yeah for years we you know a lot of
people have resigned we have been a lot
of money but we've made it and Here I am
going to be talking to you about
something that's much earlier stages so
I do have my bias and you have my
opinion to have my experience but to be
honest the way things are greatest ocean
right now is much it's like some called
three years ago which is great for me
not sure about you because it is he an
opportunity to go and have a second
iteration something I had done before
all the different domain different
people different everything good to be
honest we don't technology right like I
told my boss just recently i haven't
sold one technology from this company
I've only be solving like culture and
you know people and relationship
problems that's this how it works
technology is very much the same
technology very much solid and kind of
easy because you can keep your computer
and Jupiter's wherever it wanted but
people often the interesting part of the
equation so bear with me for bed this is
a lot of this is what you promised but
the reason I decided to give you stop
right now is that I do think a lot of
people
I have and the opportunities dr.
throughout many conferences and paint uh
an exact same stage this notion is that
right now again somehow was a bit
further we will lucky enough to start it
earlier so this might be helpful let's
see you know if you tell me you tell me
later um we still working on their own
the whole magic bit over here like
working progress they are with us well
let's talk about let anything to use for
this company with beards and I'm not an
infrastructure person I'm used to be
beautiful citrine infrastructure for
product companies that makes any sense
so go to protocol for example some of
the colors work for other media company
can be the infrastructure developers we
use to develop the problems but it's my
first time working in a compelling way
you can search your Easter problem so go
we it's like breaking the fourth wall
but yeah whatever it is that's good so
back in the day for the first iteration
this notion or super old-school service
tax service that rings a bell no you're
not what's cool enough seriously service
tech was the first iteration of these
notions like late scientists pretty much
and what these people like my boss was
one of them 0 they really like UNIX kind
of types and they do the servers and a
wireless server today they want to do
jersey and do this data center now it's
kind of stuff and there's some software
required where even if you're not like
Ethan up actually I'm going to talk
about a lot of iterations but it's only
in the last four years really it's just
you know internet es is like 25 minutes
but anyway um so this these people they
were building these data center this
amazing for structure and you're giving
the unix way now if you have reason
software in the late 90s or early 2000s
or if you happen to work for oracle you
may remember what's the unix way there's
a lot of books here that curve you
but you pretty much had to memorize
these my favorite one on how to use help
did the one on the right corner or how
to use software for for the scarf
environment and what the unit's rate
comment was that you have some processes
in 17 and it will be talking to shorter
to something called IPC 20 nobody knows
what the hell i see which is you know
one process of another person talk about
processes I'm not talking about services
or machines or datacenter be on the same
machine but it was a big deal to make
them talk to each other and a lot of our
researchers attribute that way and
worked very well for the very first
iterations of our products our many
competitive advantage back then with an
SSD drives which respects not much at it
which allowed us just being a droplet
our computer aided for you in like 55
seconds nobody can beat that was amazing
this great competitive advantage of the
funding will happy we've got the nice
office in New York the hype it over with
not me everything but inner the oldest
stuff happening but s so it kind of
looks like this if you think of each of
the green boxes as a computer so the
unit that's running somebody else's code
I know that will become gay but it's
easier this is a host it's running our
clients have called this end to us and
there's a virtual machine or whatever it
is and we run them on the gray boxes
over here but abstract there is it's not
super relevant we do need to run
software on those boxes and those this
software was running processes the
university lots and lots of us
linux unix processing and it will
talking to each other through pipes and
how is nice stuff and you're mostly
written in pro because interest so you
know there was this is all good and we
it wasn't it's kind of a different age
where if you need to change something
could email your customers they hate
machines going down you please not use
it and won't use it and then you could
do stuff in a machine um it was
definitely kind of a peer-to-peer
architecture where there is no
centralized application taking care of
the whole fleet of machines we had each
machine had your own kind of
intelligence if you are leave her be
Indians industry from the long game
maybe think of this as a planet serve
architecture that's exactly what it was
really I which is a database in the
middle the big back bad database
everybody had and a lot of emphasis
talking to it so the main problem is
that after a cup of bubbles you may have
heard of those we have had a problem
where people could not likely people
coming back to the market and open with
their own startups anything more
capacity than more machines and in more
data centers and to make your life so
much harder amazon stock of this whole
region thing which means we needed to
have more data centers to offer to
people so our problems that we live in
more machines and we need more regions
which means data centers like seriously
you can obstruct it out when you when
you talk about regions as an obstruction
we giving you but i'm sure that means
more than four senses um and that's kind
of complicated for this kind of of
texture we had because the only kind of
way the unix way was meant to scale was
by um what moves vertically but that
means that we get we used to run in a
smaller box and you run in a bigger box
so if you look at the left leg small box
right big box
super-stretch 40s and that's one of the
means is that so actually I spend a lot
of time in back in two thousand and what
was a softening for maybe I working on
telco villain so I've done Jes M Billy
in C++ on unix great lifetime I didn't
think about this kind of scenario is
that you would give your system you'll
be the villain system and then by the
time that was when before getting more
and more cell phones when you had to
choose scale this year capacity you know
you're not able to fulfill your s
settings or whatever first what you do
is that you would bring up your vendor
and you say hey can get a bigger version
of coughs XYZ that I have right now in
the window which you offer be so metro
systems or HP able because if they had
bought that would gladly say of course
you can just pay me thirty percent
markup and whatever you already have pay
for this other one and I'll gladly give
it to you and to make it worse this out
machine will be run a different version
of Unix so when I say I spend a lot of
time he doing systems I just kind of all
time 14 building systems because was the
same freaking systems for 20 years it's
just like oh now we have to put HP now
to that now two salaries and then
eventually fun somebody finds out about
linux and you know you just before see
the same system over and over and over
as much actually learn java because i
was sick of it like you know I'll i
bought into the whole write once run
anywhere her thing i think it was one of
the few back then um but anyway there
was there was kind of hobart or scaling
words probes that our customers came up
to that our customers into thousands
starting five to six thousand seven they
cannot do that at all they don't have
the money to binding machines they do
not have too much by video instances
what they want to do is to have a more
flexible work alone where they can tell
me exactly how many
city today and how many missions in each
more iteration to was kind of okay so we
need to manage complexity better and you
being a proper few PS so if you haven't
done PHP or asp three or maybe pearl you
oh we saw the wordpress blog for your
parents do this all the time somehow you
may not know via PBS is a VPS is a
virtual private server it's a servitor
through some kind of virtualization or
english whatever pretends that damaged
operating systems running on one machine
worth exactly one there's a lot of ways
to go about this and we kind of need to
do something that was about it the
problem is is that that includes the
complexity and adding complexity on what
we already had which was this kind of
crazy architecture over here was going
to be super easy because every node you
add days like all these multiple
different pieces moving together and out
there so what are we trying to build a
VPS we kind of good in a different way
first we remove logic from our own notes
so the notes actually run the customers
images because they did at the compute
nodes you'll run much less that's great
and then we created basically two
services but those are all school
services those who are the services that
you might run we might field either Dino
early 2000s or whatever was when you
really Thomas her book anybody come us
early ago no and so I book this big hey
I I see nothing over there come on
Chicago's expecting more like finance
industry
yo soap and whistling hey so we are
building all these a kind of old-school
services and what it's an extraction we
don't call it like this but pretty much
what we had was a customer to service so
somebody something the customers using
right now which reflecting the UI making
many different things and an internal
tool service which is what our people
use i ascertain the beginning that we
try to differentiate ourselves in
management all several things what do we
support so a lot of time it takes for
somebody to respond to a ticket and how
much quality that response has the super
important was so rude a service around
this and it's great that's what people
doing back then and you know you have
holder other niceties of some serrated
that you accept that most of the stuff
was really going through the database
still the database was the center of the
universe everything was there we had
queues or a database which my favorite
thing ever do that if you just go back
to work tomorrow and dispute human a
database life's too short for to not
really cute database anyway so there's
all this stuff that are we doing miss to
do in to what extent but it was a bit
better it is at least you know these
things became a bit simpler the things
on the top we had the true services
going on me and was all good the problem
then is that the industry moves again
and overall what you know just like it
always happens what's good now is not
what was good ends of it now our clients
that we can have a bit more of an
elastic workload and when I say elastic
workload you may be thinking about all
these netflix advanced stuff
they call it where things come up and
down instantly depending on acid but
don't really a lot of people just want
it to be able to spin more machines over
the you know Wednesday's are my
customers i want you have two machines
71 house kind of thing any became up
complicated with these architecture
because you're building a VPS you're
building a system that kind of expects
your demand to be static elevation tell
me how many machines in it now you tell
me how many machines needing two weeks
from now and i'll make it happen but you
can change like overnight it is no api
to change and that's a bit complicated
so problem dps is so less me and
everybody was moving away from it people
definitely want this cloud now I am NOT
here to define what 12 I would never put
myself just listen I have in the past
but do not listen to me um but to me
there I use the full definition of what
a cloud-based for this presentation is
elastic for clothes right you can or
maybe we're going to have two more there
are going to be we're going to have a
space TV maybe a case work for a TV
station and one of the largest one of
the most interesting bones we have said
whatever was on right now manama TV
channel would have bitch audience for
the website because they represent I
would say the whole say hey go online
now and do some anesthesia with that
everybody go for it whereas up
everything else we had which is dead so
I would love to be able to shuffle my
work
and with a very conservative business to
be honest so all this elasticity is what
else would come associate when I
magnetic of cloud computing so we need
to build this cloud business and one
thing we know is that this requires more
software well means complexity and the
good kind of complex is essential
complexity but Sir we cannot afford
helping others complexity in our current
architecture and the reason was because
these kind of stuff this was super slow
to change so these are these services
the green ones in particular they were
impossible to change almost every time
some somebody to change the smallest in
here you need to go to full require me
to find this one person who some
holidays were knows more about this one
particular part of the system and it may
or may not be affected by the change i'm
going to make and everybody waits and
everybody get your upsetting each other
is just a distortion is super strongly
code review I'm not personally I code
review press and I'm not like a trunk
based development person but really our
culture is super strongly you know
editing must be reviewed by other people
and you can only imagine how that
dragged over and over because this code
bases was so massive and everything that
was going there going on there had to be
repeatable the way I think about this
and then again I'm totally biased you
piss I'm not a big review pressing
but it's like this it's like you have
everything service right here everything
had this ready look in every we had that
you why we had a feeling system have
whatever United this room oh no one is
probably not here because of some act
right decision just throw me in
Leicester everything else
hey yeah whatever it's gonna go there
it's going to be okay it's gonna be fine
and it's the most amazing thing to me it
was not any of these two services what's
that you know I was a consultant for a
lot like a long time and I I was looking
up to a company where we would come I'll
say the name exactly like I i I've hire
them thoughts as I've left them we will
hire to go somewhere and remove things
for example Enterprise Service bus we
are highly explosive and it seems to me
that over and over is caught up in
smaller company I actually ending this
day I don't we didn't send why but it
seems like I know everybody's out cups
become banks super crate somehow leave
like a I don't know enemy so our
database is pretty much our enterprise
service bus thanks renting that in that
gym because we have a we have two tables
I behave like juice for the whole pieces
and then move to different systems who
take stuff from this cave and do things
with it i betray things you never know
um that's kind of how how all this is
some work and that's one of the reason
it was so slow it was impossible to move
something that big where you know
everything you had with go here or
everything else to go to that and by the
way this is the main point of
integration between every single thing
you have things that you haven't heard
of its integrated review okay um and
then we decided to do something a little
bit different can we can we simplify
this is that is that that possible to
get all that um so as I saying beeping a
cloud means adding more complexity and
it's a good car flexi if you if you Fred
Fred groups mixer members and some other
source is written there's two you kind
of compare logic racist
that's gonna be accompanied between
common types of complexity residential
complex in secret card is kind of the
counter for this part of the business
and there's accidental complexity which
the stuff we do because rating movies
any second so any had any account make
it at all so as opposed to a 50s which
is the hosting company had more machines
more than centers more networking more
everything so this more actual essential
complexity good character flexing and I
was trying to think about this why was
it this notion especially when I was two
working remote from building and I I
just stopped thinking about this book
has red HD go anybody has read this book
it's a great book like I find it
appended amazing and this is 2nd edition
so it's a spoon of mentors of
object-oriented design in UML I actually
had the Portuguese translation of the
first edition and it was not in UML
woulda never land use modeling language
he may be patience made up and the first
half of the book was just him explaining
the language never forget to eat if you
read books okay trenton books written in
the early 90s if all of this conference
is fascinating this won't do stuff in
this book if there's anything from the
store you will stay home right just get
a copy of this i don't think they have
innovations that have hard copies um
anyway but this book he talks about in
the context of objects around space
state in space a this kind of i try to
glue the finisher here but it's a mood
for different states object can be in so
for example in this particular case and
really saw you come with it but it says
well this is wait price and quantity
available of some subjecting install
some something to have an adventuring
and what you know that class actually
the class is called product line and you
had different weights different prices
different whatever an appointment here
is that this is how complexes of it is
and over all these points with real
objective object oriented design you can
constrain the space and make new things
with it but in the end of today I think
it applies very much to everything else
around us but in two services in
particular in the sense that this is why
I'm struggling with this these guys over
here because they have so much stuff in
them they have so much stuff going on
that every time I check out the code
base oh I'm reviewing a pull request I
have to is order a 3d graph I have to
think about all the possible stuff there
could be going on at the same time and
we need to reduce that so thinking about
I just met him again I have been through
a similar process in a posture of my own
biases but thinking about it a lot he's
like why can't we why is it so hard for
us to reduce especially to kind of get
the sea blue or even a 3d petrie and
looking at what we've had so looking at
the services we had and look at the
database in our things and talking to
people off I work out there the biggest
challenge was that adding stuff cheering
one of these two services was much
easier then create your own service so
people would really add to click random
stuff to dis not related at all just
because you know I add like you I just
go to control
just operates by the way so I control
them radios and some models here or
whatever is any slide when it's
available and use it and it'll be the
wire bread and like okay so I understand
you know this one of the things we need
many many try to hack peoples of attack
systems like Anderson in whatever
sentence isn't here right so you go you
need to do a job you're paid to deliver
this feature if you get it out as soon
as possible how does that work how can
you get there and this is easiest way
it's okay but then why isn't this this
way what's going on and now I think
somebody some of you might have some of
you wander like who like the divorce
culture might have a guess but so I
would like you to raise your hand if
your guess was right
oh come on Steven work I need together
but before this to the job and risk yeah
so go one chef that's good ah it's a
configuration management joke no yes
yeah yeah that's right so uh because
chef that was the actual thing that out
here almost a button funny thing is I do
have intervention but I don't think
sharks to blame him oh also love is the
reason I hey chad is that chefs like
race or PHP i have heard Ali I've been
printing for a little bit I have heard
that you can use to share recipes be in
a good way I feature water to the
company's I haven't seen it happening
but I'm not a cannibal I'm just a guy
havin experiences I heard Facebook this
very good work to chat inhibitors would
do not know but irrespective chef proper
ended because the answer them all one
sec reason that's my bed to public or to
ansible possess was about these hard
working for life like if you press that
five again it's gonna be something else
but anyway it's and so or whatever is on
happiness right it can be a pain because
even you can be super special shaft
where it can be super painful but it's
not the fundamental all we need to
separate the noise from the fundamental
problem and I don't think there's a
fundamental issue that's going on back I
think the fundamental issue we had is
that everything was managed by share
everything up location you were to
deploy those men pressure so every time
you had to create a new service that
would be
be right in the shed big bags and
recipes and whatever you have to do
which works well when you have two
services like you had before all we have
one service or whatever is but for
microservices architecture it kind of
becomes a problem because almost by
definition to be spinning new services
all the time you're going to kill them
all the time so how does that work it's
more like everything is a pull request
to the chef repository because everybody
uses chef server if you don't use chef
server by the way from chef solo on your
production deployment not on your
machine I would very much like to talk
to you after this but I haven't found
this person yeah um and everything
needed Cobra for the end reversal over
here so the smallest change would have
to pull somebody to review and it takes
just forever in general I think like
everything was painful when everything
was slow I would be I know I would make
a claim here that the worst API I have
there wasn't guys I have dealt with in
the past few years were anything that
could requires into at a pull request a
pull request is under good API if there
is a process in your company right now
that depends on a full request and it's
not something creative that somebody
else is reviewing it's just some
procedural stuff you can't do it wrong
i'm sorry enough time for some secretary
well it is like four requests are awful
for stuff that should be automated and
this is a graph showing a particular
valuation februari the number of pull
request but not exactly commit let's get
help but you can / 10 inch you get
number of changes that comes every not
and maybe five come every day for
somebody to review and you know what
happens a chef right nobody else track
right
it's classic it happens everywhere
anyway this was this was particular bad
in particular slalom experience and
that's where I apply my bias which is I
some polish I felt a chef for years
super miserable but we found a way to
kind of get away from it and it took
four years but we are what key right now
this ocean is like you right now now of
us so lucky in the sense that the
industry is paying attention to what's
going on and we don't wait four years to
learn what we could do differently
people have written about whether it's
big oh it's Martin multi follow from
from saw works who people somehow have
sometimes reservations I guess I don't
understand why do you guys just kept
talking what we to move and that's
awesome because then I can talk about it
to just give you a link instead of total
10 hours um but Martin has one are two
in particular that's really important to
me around microservices which is the
prime requisites for micro services but
no even tried in that if you haven't
done interview guys the two companies
are being very recently and because
everybody else s about many conferences
and other things kind of these rules
apply they not in particular says you
need three things need rapid
provisioning which means getting
machines quick quick you need some based
monitoring and a trafficker rapid
application deployment so I'm not going
to buy you a lot on this but I'm going
to talk a little bit about how we have
applied is at distortion and maybe I'll
give a hint of some other stuff I may
have been through so the first thing to
think about when I look at this this is
a very prescriptive model it is telling
me what to do already if you want to
take a step back and in my case the one
I was looking at is I have for example
my hypervisor is sent
the ER my machines that run clients code
this is the most difficult system I'd
rather work with because this is a
incredibly stable system I'm running
your code I cannot stop your code to
migrate to different server I cannot
stop the coach off the grid integration
of this machine or preferences whatever
I can send you an email and be super
nice and try to give you as a client but
he is super complicated as much as I can
those much as I can I need to do without
interrupting state I have right now the
worst state forces and I've ever dealt
with in my life and it's also been dead
so when we had to migrate these machines
or do something that we want to move a
couple times per here I don't want to be
a few breaking the hypervisor every
every month I don't want to tell you to
shut down your service of the week so
couple pounds per year is about right
than the right rate for us right now
when it comes to something like here
like our databases in our legacy
services the services that we headed I
user-facing service thing in 10 elusive
a couple times per month as they become
more and more legacy yep that's a
process of first of all at soundcloud i
was there for years some cards do has
the greatest one of the runny it's not
talking to the internet they very small
things with you still there so there's
going to be there and that could be it
still changes a couple times per month
because it doesn't change one thing I
haven't found a good solution for in
general is for stateful especially this
fateful systems in those cases yeah you
know but they also change a couple times
per month maybe after the heavy
development cycle one thing that I love
the change every day and actually I
wanted to change
to change every hour in the application
for people to you know continue to leave
your eggs like the point life is no
tomorrow and pushing things out making
it available to customers as soon as
possible so this changed birthday so if
you think about the month and year you
cannot apply the same tool for these
kind of filtration levels each iteration
cycles really one thing that has worked
from in the past against again until a
plumber buys it he's losing chef for the
lowell other stuff you take of machines
and other state intake hasn't be a
problem for her so far a chef now for
the legacy stuff and one thing I have
seen in lettuces does exactly either
dies because you remove everything
useful from it and there's a reason 2010
10 it kind of becomes a beaker echoes he
goes hydrogen building but you just say
there and you need won't come out
forever nobody touches it is okay my
main problem on this layer is dead race
I am having fun of your solution for
database yet I know there's some doctor
people do some focused of dr. database
tutorial but like so uh but I got it and
I haven't used it I don't know that this
moment trusted right now I've series 80
conversion management system her old
squawk on Livingston chefs old school I
River chef was kind of
anyway old school computer management
system to my database is this what has
worked in something else from for the
actual services how they get deployed
over there for a little bit more about
this later but first I want to go back
chair Marty's talking about smart Martin
33 kind of points he had first one yay
like rapid provisioning and that's from
our tool you should be able to forgive
yourself no server like me machine only
compute unit in a matter of hours just
like small cell speak you do that 55
seconds just saying so we don't really
have a problem that we did actually this
solution official version is largest
customer which can get super with it and
you cannot imagine that email account
yeah I'll have one there anyway next one
is based monitoring and this feel he is
detecting technical issues with salsa
water monitoring business issues and
some public had this problem a lot which
I had my first understand see what we
had starts different we had scary
problems with sassy look just like
everybody actually problem no stats day
who here has used graphite
who you think graphite uses this space
very well this space is like like four
megawatts per key right but the problems
I have a reliable live fella next time i
was there a liberal and editions I can
understand of April I was always greater
than this expect running on this place
it's somebody created you actually
dynamically created q HQ Ignacio
certainty each key is for my droids so
you can run out specific so graphite and
in fact the air like monitoring tell me
truth problem similar farewell like they
have worked for sample a farewell for
many years but that's about it right and
at some cloud at some point you
hydration from google who decided that
that was not acceptable and for me to
sing to me remains an open source office
company website for me just on Io as a
kind of it uses to me what sort of i was
great and everything we had their east
ocean both internal monitoring and
problems based on per meters right now
there is a simple whatsoever all it does
not they thought is that it doesn't do
the group code so you still need to
attach this server to it somehow i don't
think there's a lot of priority to offer
that promotes libraries and things like
this but it works for our basket and for
the rapid application deployment we used
to bananas and containers so this is
this something that's i'm super life I
don't know what if there were others
because I feel to project twice in the
past 12 months of each
it's where I don't matter in between mr.
slinko benefits was meant to me do it
it's like I don't even know why we're
talking about just juice whatever makes
sense to hear this particular online
right now reality's though that Google's
putting so much money a little bit so
much money but whatever connections
doesn't happen now it's going to happen
extra keys nobody can compete with a lot
of money google has so we're actually
using proven actions for our ultra to go
to this view which is need to be able to
quickly deploy services both the test
environments of your prediction now
that's what interesting things here
about my processes in my experience
knowledge solutions not there yet but a
trunk lock environments the government
always gonna be folded if you used to
have me in staging environment yeah
someone working I you the way i
recommend you think about this is having
to turn our garments where I can just
spawn an environment may be using coke
computing providing your site and use it
for whatever tests you might have and
then chillin do not need all the power
needs to stay for too long because
you're going to have to alter that again
can have a system into stockton on this
particular topic but in the end of the
day what we actually use me with this
asana choose to back some of this but
then again yeah sure we'll scoop antics
and I'm tell you and then are you going
to your company organization to morrendo
news for bananas we are rightly shitload
of glue code to make it work
so don't think that any of these things
including parameters including this
notion if you know we have very nice API
just saying they work out of the boss
you will have to write blue code we have
normally when you have microservices
your you often had what featured things
work on different microservices just pay
attention how much these things act is
Fanny in bright blue coat and just
consider you might want to have somebody
actually doing that for the whole group
especially if there's in the same
platform same technology I fall into
this trap and it's a lot of waste anyway
there's a lot of glue code there's a lot
of glucose disloyal to code so wrapping
up this is the first step it's just
saying I'm gonna be used to you can talk
swear i'm talking about always been a
bit further and i've been in circulation
not that load and we're talking about
the first cup we are we're taking which
is multi follows rear exits and you
settling what me what we need to get
somewhere but my experience which has
happened another three years ago so the
moment you get this sorted you have the
three primary exposure of stuff so
you're going to have services you have
it out of if you if you wonder how come
up a company with 100 people have 200
services you have the station or than
what anymore just hard to help you stop
it a lot of things come overnight e
everything becomes a service you need to
have a conversation about what is a
service area j get jamie lewis head and
measured against what he's never won
them but a lot happened once you reach
this stage and my focus right now like
wearing my hand
no technical help is to get this there
so that we can start having
conversations and also deliveries right
this way on saying we are beyond seems
to him no none of us we are trying to
deliver stuff while facing the from
other people done right everyone so we
cannot stop doing things and this is 11
management hack if you will they have
applied a couple times that has worked
fairly well and then the next step
though what happens next then the fun
starts because the first thing you're
going to have so you fix the
prerequisites that boom and you're going
to talk about BFFs you have you heard
about this patent this is a very boring
conversation about how can you integrate
the last 500 microservices this building
waves of data and again referring to my
previous experience the soundcloud be
set up for this pattern power BFF we
kind of kettle ordinate somehow it's not
the best way to read it's not the worst
and it's super boring and this
conversation takes forever and stew it
just takes forever the next one is fun
because the programming language Thunder
dome where everyone like we need to stop
this before you see high school this
week we use list is ruined by Tony your
languages truly and then you start like
will fight the other cancer how do you
get to this whatever languages and it's
super fun I in the energy again this
thing but anyway there's a ton of them
days a war fun and then you eventually
will adopt geography of trips if you do
a lot 3 I do recommend wrist max from
twitter is much better than vanilla tres
um but I actually would recommend your
dog jobs yeah and how
this joke I do it when you investigate
geography kisses all good for they show
that in protocol buffers just a bed for
and then thrifty then what else you
build a service directory because you
have so many services nobody knows who
the hell wrote that or did that and it's
super confusing any of you won every
single company I know if it has reached
about 100 services beautiful I was
trying to make one open source mother's
gate you didn't work very well so we
have to suck it up and video my parents
and then you just get bored and go to
sometimes any now it carries back in
some thought most people went to
infrastructure so we have a lot focal
that to work for docketing mrs. fear
google and whatnot but that's that's
kind of this how it happened at some
point people just gets ya something else
um yeah so that's that's what's coming
next job but as with the same vyas at
least ocean particular we used to
starting this with very young a company
in terms of however videos of the
infrastructure and I told I i said i
first said i would not going to sell
anything but i'm going to totally went
you hire you all so it's super young
it's super-new in that sense and you
could be planted well that there's a
link of it I you could potentially click
it but it's that's kind of it it's an
it's an inch in journey I again I'm
having opportunity to do something I
kinda have done before again okay scary
at times because things move slower than
your head
but that's a lot of fun because the new
teams any problem spaces anywhere
everything and I think we have a great
application for something right alright
that's all I had do you have any
questions so this was related that I
guess the sound cloud architecture but
with poober and Eddie's the service
discovery component did you end up just
using a CD or how did how did that work
we are most likely going to use console
right now all the ways to and dance yeah
so I'll talk about this notion of that
was about this ocean is likely going to
use console with vizio internet cell
phone had seven ages ago to use DNS SLP
records which I wouldn't i love them but
i wouldn't recommend because propagation
takes too long but it is something for
the method which is like you know the
technology doesn't work for some how was
going to move to console as an update
I'm yep sorry yeah that was going
demasiado that was there for me to run
on the people who are now who have
chosen difference in abusing the glue
coder problem ah they we actually have a
message processor at least ocean with
some string processing anybody want
today I think there might sex very much
Derek google with these things moving in
the freaking so it's a teachable he
makes more sense to go that way but it's
again I think in the soft choice and if
I won't you have for a larger company
with some businesses not technology a
power God blesses just because
mesosphere has good support directing
paper and I cannot hi because I lose at
verse 47 so the what you were talking to
for about not really being able to
iterate it the database layer a very
fruitful a department I'm assuming
you're talking about like relational
databases and that sort of thing do you
feel like that sort of a win for just
horizontally scalable distributed
databases do you feel like that's not
really ready for prime time in this
scenarios what you're using them oh hang
on what are we what's that for what I
mean by horizontal industry so so like
like a new sequel database or like Mongo
or onion so that's an inch in question
because I'm used to again I feel working
for this are you fall for three months
now yeah we have a lot of data but is
much less data values do I'm used to
later at the banking fees when we have
to consider myself but it's gotta be one
problem especially some amateur I want
people to be able to deliver things it's
all about the machine is not about the
status about how would you taught me you
have is a team what i have found time
and over again is that if you
in small parts of data they could be
separate servers they can be separate
namespaces like Oracle's or whatever is
but it like people have this autonomy
within your own data that that kind of
drives out on me which dries relatively
Nardis cool stuff in general like that
kind of upsets people who have like an
enterprise model myself but again he
might be in this kind of architecture
does that's available against not into
technology just the way our brains work
our collaboration kind of
how much of an experience knowledge of
codification to see you can have that
tendency to use shared one of the cross
for services or how do you balance that
we always had a tendency of principal
photography and you kind of steven three
or four services they thought the same
thing that's not the same so for this
presentation originally had a bit about
is because the distortion central a
relative in there has been this choice
right now we have again level of free of
struggles and we have a library called
for which first you might imagine
everybody went to a caucus-race its
deadly hazard everybody knew are the
integers in so for example if you look
for if you envelop of our cookies and a
grab for chocolate or coffee so droplet
is kind of different like you would
expect somewhere to have a chocolate but
our because this is one and see the core
module but what happens that it's
included by this is a gem cert include
by four or five days of projects and one
thing I realized recently is being goofy
each project monkey patches they help so
either way I wouldn't know what helps
these persist for a whole day I think
it's the back of the day I have pulled a
memorized it yet but it's like 20 odd
component based software architecture is
i guess i'd go for you since base
components we have a component here
medicine because two people
today I suppose have a service that
there's no there's nothing I believe in
our use cases or fundamental problems
that prevent us from having a drop of
the service it's just that that they for
whatever reasons I was later in library
and then we had once fallen trafficking
the way we saw their sample was having a
hierarchy of what the decision to and
that what that means names that for
example soundcloud the music service all
we have we just have to track object in
play lacing so have a playlist or track
service that sits in the bottom of your
affection and everybody talks true so
you are allowed to store something for
you caching purposes or whatever is but
you don't hold it the lifestyle is
matched by this service so we don't we
don't talk to any database something
like that are you could potentially have
stayed it is restored you
because what we call
so we can try to solve it by layering
what's the following objects in moore
who also lets type of food ocean one
thing we've done it's apparatus
firefighters it as well is to have if we
didn't have ideas we have your hands
where it's a false case the central
column tracks called 1237 1230 hopefully
is forward two three and there's a
website very much humane registry where
you can go and check who could see some
homes dead namespace and this isn't
levels and x-rays responsible
philosophical wanted to related to send
a lot of this is human communication in
bristow potential but it has work 12
like 130 developers we have meat bones
but actually are one thing that we did
have a recoger education at some Club
was using pencil because the mobile apps
had only kind
yeah people working these things never
thought of it as a problem so I'm not
sure what I can do what I want to do but
it was definitely yeah if you want to
see something fancy because just
maybe it's not relevant maybe has that
they can rewrite as you go it was at a
factory this is what
well whatever was okay so it's a manager
they getcha like it well oh yeah to
clarify the motivation for having to
suffer api's 14 weapon mobile are you
optimizing than a view layer and sort of
composing several entities into a
payload so you one call instead of like
five or six that was idea we never got
that one of the things we wanted to do
it's not loud was using the Android
application use protocol but friends is
the waterfall never got there well I
thought I mean Nevers off no fun what
see I don't know what they're doing now
but yeah but it was ready well my
question is if you fly crafty well or
fowl or do you feel like that would
potentially solve that sort of problem
if it existed at the time you implement
it I think it's the make this fall koro
experiment to use something like a hurry
engine land but creating creole language
from the client side or something would
always do tricks for in q4 but i
resigned so together but I this won't
pacheco problem with mobile applications
which is mobile pages move much slower
than anything else you have to meet you
at halls of this death is unmissable so
I was actually trying to remove as much
as possible logic horrible complication
into the server side so yeah so that
would iterate like crazy 80s pizza i
specially because you know i also mobile
developers and under easy to find
themselves
to happen architectural e it would make
sense I prominently says that in there
in that aspect but because of our
constraints there's a number of people
and just how slow things food I he was
no stranger
it seems like kind of a Jonathan
off-screen provisioning is so solve this
problem like waiting in a line to get
its ass on the ground this must be
pretty pretty stuff getting a divan from
okay did commit Mozart come out like
push somewhere our ends let it run drug
try different things in passengers so
the way we're doing right now is there
any no I think you're over x minus
that's what happened the way I think
we're going to go prison previous
experience is good performance in my
recent experience the main prob with my
clients is the actual new server there's
no computer purely just like everybody
else I have slapped the hell off Jenkins
to track me to what I wanted plugins I
had baked so miserable one thing that we
were doing visalia left soundcloud was
go city from saw works that's it the
team was like everybody who same sort
answer right there was a vice but that's
been the main phone so far we actually
use drawn DeFeo
the ocean drontal I oh I don't
particularly like it but I'm not ready
to go right now so I have so mentioned
it's only so much I can say but I would
like to see us move into something that
moisture in terms of my plan okay
because that see Miley max mentor has
been your biggest problem any
emergencies but am I uses of it
complicated is it needs more maturity
overall the experience of the give push
the point one is great so you look at
the history on that wrench it's just
like um yeah what why is this working at
a bit like Roku Edom I think it goes
because their deployment about it is
essentially black box per person I think
I mean separate deployment from skating
but this is what it'll be so many ways
you could after you following what I'm
care up with the essence to be in people
to adjourn and accessories previously
released
that the testing you do on your software
so right now we have pretty good sem to
the division later when it comes to a
big change the billing what happens with
it was fairly animal and i had people
working to project just less just like
you told us trying to create to beep
loudly able to create a lab environment
for us because we don't have less what I
would like hard no we have a unit and
integration but I don't like depends on
which lay or the second talking law can
we talk about some application that we
can everything pretty much but I talked
about a hyper first layer or something
like that I don't have a lab properly
set up with the machines reckoning
invested into
say for a provisional I knew the area an
act of aggression if I try provision
tank machines I can get stops and walks
and verify to the command to a sense but
it's nothing that tells me that those
machines reckon spawn things are going
on yes American that's only to do a way
to do this second test in production all
manual testing so this is definitely
something that we need to get much
better and to make it worse I don't
think that's a lot of pride a lot so we
may have a great solution
what happened way
so they show she's mostly go and Ruby a
lot of stuff in Brittany girl Ruby's
like everywhere is what we speed up they
will be somebody hand whereas there
there's one more item because of the
data analysis come beautiful
and this lady from you know the calmness
girls today I mean I'm not her so is it
all will be party let me not talking
about these are another kind of problem
no no no the negative girl yeah so you
mentioned earlier in talk that you
consider an anti-pattern to do code
changes to represent like changes on the
system's reconfig management would you
say that at that point like it's a
deficiency in the API of whatever your
deployment system is when you aren't
able to go back and get revision history
over time of all the red zone the
various states of the system we have to
admit that some thought all in fact
something would happen in middleton i
paged heat to actually work tonight it's
not a time for you to be debugging are
you need to solve the problem this uses
in trouble so just scared us up to 100
businesses from two and then you go to
bed because you probably want the Fed
next day I wake up and it goes up what
the hell just happened oh it was for
their bug somewhere and I'm going to see
you two again in a position like this
this is definitely something that I
think is super like having the trail of
what has happened is embarrassing when a
problem is up with I actually
configuration of gold as the main source
of what i was going to answer what we're
doing now a little bit too much detail
is 15 that describes how many instances
you're running things oh and it gets
committed and it just because very
instead when I don't want to talk about
work but having a common history super
important to me it just if it has to go
through an approval process where
somebody else from some auditing has
looked at my chef go to
approached me in spotting to Lisa's of
this thing they don't even know about
then it becomes a BTM experience but I
got the other even if it's if it's given
get them out super fashionable but
having some kind of record system tell
you what has happened is that so it also
having like a cleaning mechanism for
role that so you can respond or
something yeah yeah I mean best to help
us it roll back roll forward kinda me
and not want to go there cuz i don't
have participated but some way to change
the calculation to a tobacco to whatever
alright i'll be having beers oxide is
anything nobody eats me out of the
beautiful and thank you so much yeah
