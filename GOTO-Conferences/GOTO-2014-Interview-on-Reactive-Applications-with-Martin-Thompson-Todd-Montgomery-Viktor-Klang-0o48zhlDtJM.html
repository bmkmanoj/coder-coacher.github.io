conference Monday morning and we have
this group here Watson Todd Victor and
me Kristen we are giving a talk long
talk this afternoon about reactive what
is reactive what is the reactive
application what is the reactive
architecture so we thought we'd just do
a quick rundown on the content of this
I'm why react to this important as the
words Martin oh thanks person so
reactive is quite interesting because
things have changed of late we have
tried to find applications know that
whenever we see them they become
business critical so this is different
from what was happening on the web said
10 15 20 years ago no I the internet
channel is the only channel in many
cases for businesses that can act plus
we combine that with technology has been
fundamentally changing this we've been
going mass of multi-core going to clog
going to lots of computers is different
from the single big computer that we
used to have and the confluence of those
two things has changed what we do so for
the business critical site thing need to
be up 24-7 we need to do hot of grids
like highly resilient highly responsive
we can grow and shrink these in our
environments and what we're seeing is
there's a standard type of application
that's appearing it can be in many
languages and many technologies but it's
got a similar set of characteristics a
lot of this is not new some of the
techniques have been around a long time
but they're becoming mainstream I think
that's what's really Stanley night at
this point we've been looking at these
about the case and will find it and will
hold at very different backgrounds but
we're all starting to see this
confluence starting to come together and
we've named these properties that we're
seeing is founded so one is things are
responsive is if they don't respond in a
timely manner they're not very useful to
then use it effectively unavailable and
users don't get the benefits they need
they also nearly very resilient because
it's not there you can't offer that
service and people are expecting that
night we also have all of these
interesting data centers with lots and
lots of servers so things need to grow
and shrink we want to
have the right economies the economies
of scale some days we need to run on two
or three computers some days we need to
run on a thousand counter applications
do that well what's interesting
underneath a lot of thought is they're
all fundamentally message driven we've
gone to a world where those things are
synchronous but synchronous designs
restrict achieving some of these
properties and we're looking at this
from interesting why's my experienced
happens to be with a lot of performance
and making things responsive so I'm
looking at what algorithms make things
responsive what design patterns make
things responsive and so we need to like
how much rise expensive cost batch in
the right sort of way be aware of things
like queuing theory be aware how you
make things parallel but avoid
contention making sure things are
coherent it's all very interesting this
kind of fun and passionate your back the
proper computer says that's kind of be
Deeks rather than just the hipsters that
are going on and off of this kind of
coded service that we've got out of
there now it's kind of it that's what
I'm driven from like some of these other
guys are doing cool stuff like rest yeah
I'm I'm really engaged in pattern see
all these patterns that contribute to
systems being resilient so so systems
are as Martin mentioned before we can
increasingly need these systems that are
up 24-7 and the systems are being more
and more business critical that's both
in terms of money I used revenue stops
when the system stops or in terms of
these various government infrastructures
or public services where there's a lot
of I see systems they just need to be up
all live all around the clock so the
stuff for instance that the doctors will
use the emergency ward will use well
when you call it now so um actually
that's the background why I got engaged
in this and started doing a lot of
Erlang and Erlang is in many ways a big
inspiration to to the things that come
out of this they've been doing this that
Eric Sunday have been programming phone
switches that you obviously want to have
very high up China on and you want to
make it fault tolerant so resilience the
concept resilience
is really describing a quality of
something that can weather a storm you
know after being bent it'll Bend back
into shape it will deal with bad things
that happen and when you look at the mix
of multi-core matsu computers cloud
distributed systems in many ways there's
so many things that can go wrong and
they will go wrong and hardware will
brake systems will get overloaded in
various ways in terms of resources io
network is blah blah blah but also as
systems grow they have more human errors
built into the software we I mean I
don't think there's anyone who believes
we can do these large distributed
systems with no errors in the code so we
have all these classes of faults and we
need to have some patterns that we can
build we can use to structure the
handling of these faults in the system
and that's I think a very interesting
angle and our line can chew just less
than that a lot on that of course
there's it's mostly about having you
know several systems that can observe
each other it can keep track it is about
making the errors first class so you can
recent about them in various ways it's
about isolating errors so you have these
isolated things that if one doubles over
it doesn't mean that everything comes
down as a set of DOMA no breaks or
something like that you want to isolate
the errors in various ways so there's
lots of interesting package than that so
there's the elastic thing maybe you'll
come yeah I didn't know yes sir it ties
into that so what's interesting is that
the same it's sort of the same things
that give you the property of resilience
can also give you the the property of
being elastic because being resilient is
about isolation and an elasticity is
also about decoupling so once you are
decoupled you can it doesn't really
matter which machine it runs on right so
what we've seen is that not only do we
not get faster CPUs but we get more of
them so we see that we have more cpus
not only on a single machine but we're
getting more machines so if we want to
take advantage of that then we need to
be sure that we can structure our
applications and systems so that we can
do
so the first thing is to go with
asynchronous we need to decouple the
sender from the receiver so to say and
being able to do that means that we can
now take advantage of these other
computers and more resources but it's
not only about the more resources it's
about the right resources so when we
know how much resources we need in our
system at a given point in time we can
sort try to resize the resources that
we're using and that's very powerful not
only being able to react to increased
load but also being able to know what
the load is going to be in the sense
that payday is going to be one of those
days where we just need 10 times the
number of machines so let's just pick
that in and take advantage of that so
elasticity builds on the notion of
scalability so you need the scalability
in order to get the elasticity part but
the thing that ties them together is
being able to see how much of your
resources is being used like being able
to keep metrics about your system so
that's that's the elasticity part of
things but it really started to get the
asynchronous part of elasticity you need
to go message driven so it's all its
yeah well that's after them yeah i mean
the internet kind of grew because we
actually had a very decoupled system the
from the from the outset something
wasn't saying a centralized something it
wasn't synchronized was necessary and
that actually fueled you know the design
of the internet so if we kind of apply
that we've seen it at various levels of
granularity we see it from just
communicating processes all the way down
to actually the architectures of the
chips that we have they're all message
passing based and the reason is because
it actually follows very good patterns
it probably know puts ball hits in for
resiliency it allows us to elasticity
you know it it makes system so that they
can be asynchronous and what and more
responsive so as we as we kind of look
at you know what are good patterns you
know things that are message driven
things that have an asynchronous binary
boundary you know are good things you
know it's not it's not actually what it
provides it's actually what it takes
away it takes away the ability to type
a couple things together and by
basically forcing these things to be
decoupled you know we get the this sort
of having to think in those terms and
when we think of those terms we develop
systems which are can handle SSD better
it can be more resilient and can be more
responsive and actually we do that and
another side effect is is that these
systems are much more efficient in those
times because they just sort of follow
certain patents just naturally it's just
the way they sort of you know kind of
end up it's like maybe these patterns
have just not New they've been around a
long time Kratz than you mentioned their
inner line go back to tons of non-stop
the work at gym grandpa Helen like loads
of wonderful work that goes back a long
time we just forgotten this stuff but
we're having to do at night has been
hidden in these various niches and
especially the specialty areas right
that needed this thing yeah so we need
to do it like all we're doing is like
we're talking about what these things
are we're trying to give it a name and
that's where reactive is coming from and
the manifestos back you're not up and
kind of make it visible try get it out
there okay cool yeah thank you very much
thank you thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
