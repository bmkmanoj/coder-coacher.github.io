does this Chrome has to do with EPO if
you need to heat things in theoretical
step done can you come up here please
both of you understand it's more likely
you have any ideas on this job I have no
idea there's actually a pattern of this
is the scrums pattern community that's
been working for some years now and the
published patterns are at scrum plot org
and in in there there's a pattern called
proxy owner proxy product owner and what
it says is if you don't have a product
owner you have to create one so in the
best case it would be the customer if
you can't get that then you would have
someone in the company in the business
you get that if you can't get that then
you keep on backing up into the IT
organization if you can't get a good one
there you keep on backing up until you
all the way backed up to the team so in
this case you're saying a situation the
product owner is getting it not doing
the job then that means you don't have a
product order and you need to find one
so a scrum master might do some initial
coaching because the scrum master is
responsible for educating the product on
training the product owner so that would
be the first approach to try to see if
you can get someone to understand what
the role is and they might do it failing
that then this person is not a product
order they're not going to do the job
they are they are now in the position as
a stakeholder stakeholders are people
that a product owner listens to when
building a backlog so you need to find a
stakeholder if it it may back away all
the way up to the team where you have to
exercise a pattern called sacrifice one
person to be the product owner but the
scrum will not work without a product
owners like trying to drive a car with
one of the wheels missing you'll never
get anywhere so follow the pattern and
get yourself a product owner it's not an
excuse that
business product owners not doing the
job you need to immediately recognize
you have no product order the business
is not giving you a product owner
therefore you have to back all the way
into the team if necessary to create a
product owner the product is doing the
job has a backlog it's clear it's
prioritized it's broken down into small
pieces and the product owner is working
with the team to clarify it all the time
that's a product owner if you don't have
one you need to get one even if it's a
team member now at the same time a good
scrum master is usually doing some
negotiation on the side you know we've
had to make a team member a product
owner so we're sacrificing productivity
make that clear to manager that's now a
management problem it's not my problem
is obscure master anymore that's a
management problem losing one of your
developers because we have no product
owner then the management say well we
gave you a product order and the scrum
rest he'll say stop kidding me where's
the backlog where's the prioritisation
where is he he's like a soldier that
went AWOL what do you do with soldiers
that go AWOL what's the evil what the
table missing on duty all of a sudden
they don't show up away without leave
that's that's the American term away
without leave they're gone they have no
authorization to be gone they're missing
what do you do in the swiss army boy
heal them we don't usually shoot them in
the united states but we throw them in
the brig you know they're going to get
court-martialed and thrown in the Brig
yeah yeah a product owner needs to make
decisions yes ma'am how many times these
decisions do cost money it's about money
so what level of authorization or or
management level does a product owner
need to have if you go back to the team
these people they don't dare to to take
to make this decision it's a problem
is he adding backlog stinking it is
question sorry no torpedos if we're
doing scope change and maybe the vice
versa quickly just to know we spoke
about okay owners we're training more
and more product owners particularly the
United States they're realizing how
important the product owner is and so
we're doing more and more product order
training courses and I'm training the
product owners in what they should see
in a scrum team you know products or
wants more stuff as fast as possible so
if you want to get more stuff as fast as
possible and you walk up and you look at
a scrum board and everything is open and
nothing's done you are not going to get
your stuff and so as a product owner you
ought to start going crazy like I
thought I had a scrum team and I got a
completely dysfunctional bunch of people
that I'm going to deliver anything okay
and so we go all through all these
patterns that we see constantly as
problems on the scrum team we train the
product owner to identify them and
actually help coach the scrum master and
the product owner is usually in the
business and usually a more powerful
figure in the business and they can more
easily get the scrum master replace them
the scrum master can get the product on
replace so they would probably more
commonly resort to that the strategy
okay next one acting Pio environment
let's say with a negative had as you're
right i scrub okay maybe chocolate maybe
you can say something about that the
product owner is trying to do scrum an
environment but the in a company but the
people in the company don't like scrum
they have a negative attitude that will
never work we don't like it but the
private owner is trying to get the job
done well i think you know we going to
the state of mind which I'm
was looking at if I go into an
aggressive state of mind all I'm going
to do is alienate so I had somebody
tried to force something on me the other
day and he criticized me and all I did
was get my bathtub so as a product owner
I have to keep my eye have to keep cool
and i think that's that's really a key
issue you know i can set boundaries but
I've got to be able it's not about
losing getting emotional about it it's
having the ability to say yes no with
strength know if you start screaming and
yelling you'll lose yeah so i would i
would question again product i was
trying to implement scrum and cut people
in the company don't like it they they
don't think it'll work that i want to
hear about it well again if I can keep
cool if I if I can go to them enough I
can explain to look I've had to compare
to you today I had to explain to you I
had to keep cool I have to be in control
of myself that's what it's all about it
and I call self-sustainability if I go
to the rest of the public of it but the
company I've got to be able to go in and
select them see the reason I've gotta
stay calm i got a state open focused as
soon as i get it in there and i start
pushing and i'm trying to shove them and
pull them it's not going to work all
your who's going to alienate yeah
certainly that's a mental state that
needs to be addressed if I was in that
kind of situation the product owner I
wouldn't call it scrum I would I would I
would just say to people you know if we
were a great company we'd have such a
great product everybody would have to
have it they would be lining up like
they do when the new iPhone comes out
they just want a pay and get one is that
something that this company is
interested in and then if they said well
no then this company is going to suck
forever you're never going to have
enough money why are we working this
company maybe we should all quit and go
someplace else you know but usually they
won't say that they'll say well yeah so
that's we're complaining about and this
scrum thing is just going to screw it up
and nothing's going to work so the
something but you've got a base of
agreement there we want we
want life to be better we want a bread a
product we want to sell more stuff we
want happier customers well then the
product and always say well I have an
idea that might work and explain it to
them because the product owner always
has a vision right and so a product
always has to get the tape stakeholders
agreeing or signing up at subway to an
idea that he's going to try to implement
so now you got them you know your gut
them aligned with the vision you're not
calling it scrum and then of course the
next step is well in order to do that
here's the kind of things I think we
need to do do you agree yeah we need we
need all those things what do you think
we should do first now he's got the
stakeholders building the backlog he's
just leading him down the garden path
you know built into scrum are things so
great basic I often go into teams
particularly teams outside of software
because in many of our companies now we
have scrum everywhere so with the sales
and the marketing guys and they're all
asking how i doing scrum the first think
question I have them is do you guys have
a clear list of what you want to do in
priority order and they always say no I
said what you have to do have that
before you can even talk about doing
scrum isn't that like business 101 you
learn that in visit where were you when
they were teaching that then they're all
embarrassed and I say okay the other big
question before we talk about scrum is
after you do some kind of initiative or
marketing campaign do you look at what
happened it analyzed what went wrong and
how you could do a better next time and
they always say no and i say my god you
need to go back and whatever book you
took at business read it and when you
understand that then come and we'll talk
about scrum we're not ready to talk
about scrum yet there are things so so
basic it's business 101 and we have
companies right here in Zurich we're
talking to last night
they said this company the management
has 10 projects I mean I think they had
300 by the time we finished but if they
can't get done 10 done let's give them
10 more maybe one of them will pop loose
I mean where are those managers some of
them went to business school but they
kind of erased all the information when
they left I mean you know one of the
things that's becoming really clear as
we start to implement better scrum teams
is that the management is totally out of
control totally out of control they're
not managing the companies now
that'sthat's not true everywhere because
there are some companies like Apple that
has a pretty good management and they
did it very differently than that
companies have it 300 projects and
everything's top priority that's not the
way Apple worked that's why they have
all the money ok so maybe music
correlation yeah maybe there's a
correlation yeah we should get more into
that but we talk okay would you also say
that some of the old managers now are
just they've sort of they've gone to
school they got the job that's it
there's no effort there's no motivation
there's no energy whereas in the new
models which you have more energy more
motivation more passion whereas these
guys are just sitting over there just
you know they're not and I think that's
what's happening with us today incidence
it's in society because we've given up
we're just sort of saying okay that's it
whereas there's new people coming online
with new models are saying they're big
passion I want to change things I want
to make things better and I think often
when I go and talk about my stuff if I
talk about with passion people buy into
it if I go and talk about say yes but I
do you know they don't buy into it and I
think that's product owners gotta have a
passion no yeah I think certainly that's
the case I don't want to be totally
negative towards management though
because i remember a dinner we had with
a guy that was running a business unit
in a bank and he said I've got 12 other
business units beating me up every day
they want their thing done first I'm in
meetings all the time just trying to
wrestle with that problem and the guys
and the scrum teams are coming to be
demanding that I do all these things
because they have their problems and I
don't even have time to think about it
so that maybe think well the scrum teams
ought to be coming to the manager and
saying what's your problem and how can I
help you and then when you clear it
clarify that then you say okay if you do
this for me that I got these other
things that need to be fixed so it cuts
both ways I think in terms of not having
the passion there's a famous jamp
japanese movie about a japanese
bureaucrat that at the end of the movie
they named a park after them does
anybody ever seen that but he came in
every day he was he was kind of the
administrator in charge he had this
little unit that was creating all this
paperwork and everywhere in the you know
he had a room about this size with all
these desk and it's just stacks the
stacks of paper piling up and and they
were keeping track of you know citizens
complaints about parks and buildings
infrastructure for the city and so they
were stacking up all the complaints six
feet deep for years but nobody was ever
doing anything about but the the
Japanese guy he got stomach cancer and
he was told by the doctor he was going
to die within three months so he's
sitting in a park it's snowing one night
and he a woman sits down and somehow
he's an old she's a younger woman he's a
pretty old guy she just asked him
something they start talking and somehow
he gets the feeling I really do ought to
do something for the people of the city
before I die you know and this talk in
the park has moved me so deeply you know
we need it we need to fix all the
citizens complaints about the park
they're complaining about you know the
sewers it smells and this and that and
the other thing so we go back he goes
back to his office stock pulls out
all these complaints of respect to this
part and then he starts going to all the
other agencies demanding than they fix
it and it creates this huge uproar you
know we're talking about the monkeys
pulling all the monkeys tried to pull
him off his perch but he was dying
anyway and he refused and it was just an
example of an older person who had lost
all that motivation and was just waiting
for retirement all of a sudden the
confrontation with you know dying
awakened him and he just created a huge
uproar in that city and the City Council
was trying to stop it and the citizen
was so upset they would run into the
simi city council meeting screaming
crying demanding you know and he became
this kind of folk hero and they fixed
the park so it's just an example of what
can happen if a person's passion is
ignited by some something that takes
them deeper love to get the neighborhood
yeah so there's always hope for everyone
so more hope he can give him a
five-point program to change a company
well cotter the professor at Harvard
that writes about change he has an
eight-point program look read that use
that different you know my wife is a
Unitarian minister Unitarian
Universalist minister which is a liberal
Protestant denomination in the United
States and she's implemented scrum in
half a dozen churches and her view of
life is you know some companies or
organizations they don't want to hear
about the impediments they don't want to
talk about their impediments and they're
definitely not going to fix those
impediments and those organizations
whether they be churches or
corporations they are in a living hell
and they are going to stay there but
there are other companies or
organizations like churches they'll talk
about their impediments they'll be open
about them but they'll never fixing them
and they're in purgatory now is kit are
there a lot of Catholics in Switzerland
I don't know the Catholics have this
idea of purgatory you know everybody is
a sinner when they're alive so beep when
they die they can't go right to heaven
they have to go to this place where they
do penance but eventually they get out
of purgatory and they go to heaven ok so
these companies that won't fix their
impediments they're in purgatory but
this is where all the opportunity for
all the scrum trainers you know the
scrum trainers can go into purgatory
with these companies they can hold their
hand they can commiserate with them you
know you can talk about states of mind
getting a little rested meditation and
then maybe eventually they'll they'll
snap out of it but she said there are
some organizations they will not only
talk about their impediments but they
will fix them immediately and they go
straight to heaven and for a corporation
the revenue just goes wool they got a
hockey stick of revenue so she says
that's the reality of life and that's
the that's the fundamental you know step
one of how to change your company so
often when we go in if we have often we
now today particularly the United States
we have senior management that wants to
change the company even and I just came
from Amsterdam and I was at a group like
this that we had guys from ing a huge
bank and they are massively reorganizing
that company with scrum it's amazing and
so you you in those kind of cases you
have your able to pull together a
transition team I was recently at
Phillips and they had a global
hold a like webinar with thousands of
people not only he not only in Eindhoven
and in the Netherlands but China India
the United States the co-ceos were there
I was there to give a talk and they had
a transition team that was really
powerful people with huge amounts of
energy motivation knowledge and their
job is to surface all the issues get all
the impediments on the table prioritized
for that company and then systematically
go after them one by one because it's
it's the blocks that are holding the
company or the personal back Chris and
back it's probably some personal
understanding related you know what
blocks a person from becoming the great
person that's inside them that's what
you need to get at with the company and
you need to start fixing those things
one by one and as you do the energy will
start to bubble up and you start to get
you start to recruit the power that will
transform a company but without that
without that leadership it's very hard
maybe impossible to change your company
Cotter says seventy seventy eight
seventy to eighty percent of change
processes fail because people don't want
to change and change is hard it's kind
of like giving up smoking actually baby
we're doing better than that with
smoking today I don't know but
one of the five points you know we could
go even deeper this with John's comments
on meditation brain waves that kind of
thing you know before i got into
software i spent 11 years on the faculty
of medical school and at the at the
university colorado medical school they
had one of the leading brainwave
research biofeedback centers in the
country and so they were always looking
for volunteers to wire up and test their
brainwaves well I had been someone who
had been meditating ever since I was in
Vietnam back in 1966-67 I was I was on
R&amp;amp;R rest and recreation I had an
opportunity they said hey we got a we
got a slot on a plane you can go to
Sydney for a week and get out of all the
fighting that's going on in Vietnam do
you want it I said sure I'll go to
sitting for a week so when down there
for a week just hanging out and I wanted
into a bookstore looking for something
to read and I way back in the corner I
was impelled to pick up this book and it
was on Tibetan Buddhism and so in
nineteen this is 1967 maybe the
beginning of 68 I get interested in
Tibetan Buddhism so by the time I got in
the medical school this is back maybe in
the early 80s late 70s so many years
later I had been practicing meditation
so they wired me up and they said you
know it's really interesting you know
you drop into a theta state and stay
there very quickly which is I don't know
you probably know better than I do it's
you know you go for bated alpha and then
you go down I don't know what the Delta
then you go down to theta theta you're
almost asleep filters at the bottom
Delta the divider so theta is just about
Delta Theta that's the best person yeah
so in that state you're almost you're
close to sleep and it's almost a
dreaming state so the arc types in the
mind can surface so I spent many years
working in psychotherapy actually doing
psychotherapy with groups in
dividuals and was a student of Carl Jung
who's a collar collar young is the Swiss
and if you read his you know his his
work is all about arc types of the mind
that will rise up and and he had an arc
type called Philemon which was a wise
old man that was guiding him so around
the time around the time that we that we
I was on this project trying to build
new product and build a new process I
had a coach guy named Jeff McKenna who
was a consultant with the team and we go
out and even like this we talk about you
know how do you do these projects year
after year after 20 years you've been
all these field projects all this
pressure how do you keep the motive the
motivation up you know and we talk about
well you got to connect with something
inside you that kind of keeps you going
and what is that and we just keep
talking we keep talking about that so
one night during this I had one of these
Tibetan tong cos which is a picture of
one of the they have their pictures of
gods and goddesses these are archetypes
in the mind that young was talking about
and meditating one night and thinking
about all this and I get this powerful
experience where the the tonka was a
goddess and the communication was she's
known to have a great compassionate
heart so overwhelming light and love and
peace and grace and so you like in this
state like what's happening so I don't
know what that what that does your brain
waves and then kind of impressions start
to flow and the impression is every
person is entitled to be fully hope
been fully released and to have
abundance shower upon them all the
things you have to lack all the things
you feel you lack there there there
abundantly flowing in the universe and
if you can align yourself properly
they'll be yours so this all sounded
wonderful it might be a buckminster
fuller if anybody heard a buckminster
fuller in here guy that invented the
geodesic dome he used to he used to go
to universities you get a big auditorium
with hundreds of people in there and he
would talk for eight hours straight and
the core of his message was every person
on this planet is a billionaire there's
enough resources that everyone is a
billionaire and the only reason we don't
feel that way is that there are blocks
there are blocks and the distribution
channel okay there are corporations that
are you know cornering the market over
here and stopping you know the banks or
are messing with a money supply and
cutting it off and it's all about these
blocks so I'm sitting there in
meditation and this goes on many nights
and you know the reason that you don't
feel that showering of a pungent
abundance this that there are blocks
what are the blocks well your life is
made up of what you do and you do
certain things and you wind up in a
negative state you do other things you
wind up in a positive state so here's
all the things you're doing that are
keeping you in a negative state and she
gives me this laundry list that sounds
like all the things my wife has been
telling me and I'm like wait a minute
you know are you an echo of my wife
Harley it's just silence and blessing
okay so in the midst of all this we're
trying to figure out what became scrum
so I went to the team and I said you
know we never have enough software we're
always behind management is always upset
they're putting us under pressure
sometimes we can't sleep at night we've
been living that way for years do you
want to live that way for the rest of
your life of course they all said no I
said well I have an idea I have an idea
that might work and I forget how we
started but we took what we knew from
computer science that we started
implementing it the first thing I needed
knew we needed a cross-functional team
and that was because of the research at
bell labs and then I know we needed to
have something at the end of every month
that worked and that was from the Media
Lab at MIT but then as we were putting
this stuff together I would come in and
all of a sudden I would feel emotionally
compelled to do something and it was all
about the people and the dynamics of the
people and being an engineer I was
always in my head you know
intellectually thing but why would I go
over and say this to that person or kind
of guide this person over into this area
because I normally wouldn't even think
about that but I just felt like I had to
I had no choice and I knew it was coming
out of this meditative experience and
the impression I got is that all of this
was put together because people operate
in a certain way it's all psychology
they have families they used to working
in family dynamics they work in tribes
and in these environments they feel
totally accepted and okay and then they
have a role and then they're listen to
and they're guided as you're talking
about and within three months we have
scrum as we know it today where did it
come from people think I thought it up
but I have to tell you I did not think
it up something else
thought it up and so it has all these
things built into it to have things like
these rests you're talking about they
fit with the mainstay the the mental
states they fit with the peace people
and the goddess that I was meditating on
is known as the guardian of the traders
on the Silk Road for thousands of years
she was the guardian spirit of the
traitors so she knew about business and
so she just directed it where it is so
you are the fortunate people to have the
blessing of scrum because I tell you
that's what I feel I've lost for words I
thought no need to say you set it off
thank you okay so anyways as I point I
my view in the five points I tried to do
it a little bit shorter yeah I mean you
have to to situations either management
understands scrum and the values behind
it and everything like understands the
agile manifesto or not if they don't
understand it you might have to do
something like the realest come scrump
you do like under the covers you do some
metrics you show some happy customers
then management maybe you show to
management maybe they understand scrum
if they still don't change job if they
finally get it then just take the next
step when typically you reduce pressure
because as we also get the question like
how do you focus on a visual way you
actually should start if there's lots of
pressure you're trying to reduce
pressure so you get some space then you
start doing scrum scrum by the book um
yes it's it's called yeah just scrum by
the book you're also you guys also do
metrics and that obviously you measure
velocity in particular and then you get
your impact
you make you a list of impediments and
you working impediments me just get
faster so this is just this is all again
another way of saying there's a list of
things that you and your company are
doing that is preventing the company
from being great great and
systematically prioritize those and
removing them unleashes the power and
that works in psychology it works in
psychotherapy it works in family
dynamics family counseling it works in
your counseling and coaching of people
and it works for teams and it works for
companies it's a universal dynamic
that's like lots of psychology in it of
course you have to go like everybody's
against change not everybody but most
people are against change as like models
in that or something all the the
Virginia Virginia says he's such a
change model exactly like where you go
through the valley of tears i think they
call it you go into chaos and every tank
productivity drops and you have to get
through that it's also an Alcoholics
Anonymous the 12-step program it's it's
the same thing okay let's consider that
question answered let's go to time
versus story points a non-pro a question
well here's an interesting thing you
know as soon as you link like why
wouldn't we just have a story point be
an ideal day and the answer is how many
ideal days do you have at a sprint
whatever that number is that's as fast
as you're ever going to go but I have a
team that started at 40 points and last
week they did 250 so so they're doing
what they used to do in one ideal day
you know they're now doing in what's for
tea into 250 it's about a factor of six
so they're doing six ideal days in one
ideal day and that's what you want to
see but if you measure an idea ideal
days you can never see that
not only that you can you know scrum is
about implementing a process improvement
and then seeing a change in production
or quality and if your production
measure is ideal days you can't get any
more ideal days so you do something and
your velocity doesn't go up even worse
you do something that's going to
actually bring it down and it doesn't go
down so it's like you're flying in the
blind with no instruments so these teams
cannot get better and so one of the one
of our pride is very interesting i work
with a venture capital group they use
scrum for everything and I've been
coaching them for five years and they
will not get off these hours and as a
result they've tripled their production
on all their teams but they will never
have a hyper productive team unless they
get away from that because they cannot
analyze and measure their progress
sufficiently to go to the next level
they're stuck okay and we can there's a
long list of figs long is a very much
easier that's why I was reelected a
relative measure of complexity people
Italy much faster and you get much
better estimates there's like if you
have a product backlog and you actually
estimate in the story points if velocity
changes we don't need to do anything
about a product package you've estimated
it in days eventually after we estimate
the entire product backlog every time
you get quicker for whatever reason also
time usually you think of a person for
you if you have to estimate in time you
think of Peter who's going to implement
because he's really good at that and
then the next task in our next story you
get think intelligence again Peter and
luck unfortunately Peter can't do all of
this awkward if you miss a story for
thirty phone is actually a measure
measurement of how much the team can do
another individuals humors your time
it's not the team it's individuals you
want to measure how much this the team
can do and if you measure time you
always forget the meetings the
surprising meetings the phone calls and
all that stuff and so you forget almost
fifty percent of the time which it
really takes I had this yes you know the
other thing you know all this started
back in the 1940s with the
reincorporation under contract from the
department defense to figure out how
they should estimate technical projects
and the Department of Defense reported
back that people are really bad at
estimating hours their error rate is
very high the difference between experts
is very wide the recommendation was to
never use ours now Microsoft has
recently replicated some of that work in
an i triple e award-winning paper if you
go to my website scum digest cellulose
con just Google points versus ours and
you this will pop up and in the in the
paper they have the traditional error
for waterfowl projects the estimation
curve looks like this at the beginning
of the project the estimate will have
very wide error around four hundred
percent as you get more and more into
the implementation you know when you get
the when you get the requirements clear
it'll drop down to one to two hundred
percent and then as you get the
technical design done it will drop down
into the into a smaller range Microsoft
has several projects cumulative showing
okay here's here's a waterfall with this
curve the Arab and on the points is is
so narrow at the beginning of project is
almost as narrow as at the end so
basically points give you better
estimates and they eliminate a lot of
the errors so so that's obviously the
first thing from a management point of
view is you want to know what the date
is and if you're asking for hours our
investors at openview say you know most
of them had been in this business for 20
years they have never seen a correct
Gantt chart and a board meeting and they
have figured out why the error is a
hundred percent and it's because the
management does it not know the rate of
production of any team in the company
they've checked most management
teams have no idea what the rate of
production of any team and their company
is and so those Gantt charts are totally
made up they are a fiction a guess at
best and so that one of the reasons they
decided implement scrum is they said we
need to get away from these Gantt charts
are always wrong they're costing a lot
of money and we need an estimate based
on reality and understanding the
velocity of point delivery in is a
measure of production and we need to
know that for every team and every
company in our portfolio so they want
scrub everywhere it's too bad they won't
implement points internally I mean it
there you know people are schizophrenic
you know I don't know it's crazy okay
let's take the last question here
prodigal in the state of mind how does
he get the team to the same state of
mind how does it how does a farm owner
actually change the state of mind other
people can you do that though I would
say that the objective is not to change
somebody else's state of mind I will
change somebody else the state of mind
is how I change my state of mind it's
how I come across yeah I guess so the
only person I can change is me but what
i can do is i can affect other people
but my behavior yes mm-hmm now it's
basically what I would be saying so how
do you affect you know the team or how
do you affect other people in your
company it's your behavior that's what
you have to folk on it's your
self-sustainability so when I talk about
self-sustainability is you've gotta look
at yourself you've got to look after
you've got to get your sleep you got to
get your food you got it you've got to
look after yourself you have to have
your knowledge you have to do everything
you have to look after you before you
can be any good to your team that's what
I asked
the the way I coach the product orders
is you know they need to have a vision
that's so compelling the team will
follow and I use one of the best models
for this is there's a guy named John
Boyd who was the best fighter pilot ever
and he never lost aerial combat he was
called 45-second Boyd he could have let
somebody else get in his tail and in 45
seconds he had them and he developed an
analysis of the strategy and thinking in
aerial combat that was translated into
the whole strategy of the US military
during both Gulf Wars they implemented
his work he educated the people in the
war colleges the Marines totally adopted
and it's been adopted in in the military
so the the loop that he talked about was
you know it's called the OAD loop you
say okay you need to observe and based
on what you see you orient yourself in
that picture and that orientation is
going to depend on your personal state
so your personal state has to be such
that you can move in real time into the
right orientation then the next step is
decision and then the fourth step is
action the goal is to move is move the
decision time 20 so as soon as you're
oriented you're automatically acting and
that will put you inside the decision
cycle of your competitor so you know if
you're a company trying to build a
product and win in the market you want
to get your decision and you're changing
of your product inside the curving
radius of the competitor now when that
translates into teams you have to have a
vision that's so compelling and an
orientation that at least of the team
appears so accurate that they will start
to follow you before you even tell them
what to do
now that means you need to be a leader
that motivates those people if you do
anything to compromise your personal
integrity they will not follow you that
fast if you tell them how to do stuff
rather than creating a vision that pulls
them you will slow them down the
decision cycle will break so the the
good product owner needs to be a great
motivator and a great leader and the way
he is personally internally needs to be
congruent with that and it needs to
communicate non-verbally to the team so
we've also we've all heard read about or
seen great leaders political leaders
Sports Leaders we know what they're like
and a great product owner is like that
and they may be imperfect characters
like Steve Jobs was one of the world's
greatest product owners but people would
follow him anywhere
