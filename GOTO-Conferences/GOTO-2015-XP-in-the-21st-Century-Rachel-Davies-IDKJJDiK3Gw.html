talk down and I'm gonna talk about
something that's an old-fashioned agile
that's kind of hardly done anywhere but
to try and talk about it as it's as if
it's a living thing because it really
something that we've been doing where I
work anyway consistently so let's see
this is the thing saying you should use
the application so I became a software
developer in the 80s that was a long
time before I Joel ways of working and
there was very different technology and
as Dan was talking about on the first
day yet builds could take a long time
really right any automated tests of that
kind it was a different world with
different problems and the main reason I
became interested in different ways in
working in a in a different way and in
extreme programming was because I used
to work away for years it seemed and
never deliver anything because things
got canceled or they go just got shipped
off to somebody else and you never knew
what happened the code you wrote so I
read an article about extreme
programming in 1999 and it seemed like
it might not work but also I knew that
what we were doing didn't work so I
thought well it's worth giving it a shot
and I sought out the extreme Tuesday
Club in London and met people there
where I joined an XP team and I did XP
as a programmer for a few years but why
was the name extreme which is XP is
short for extreme programming people
don't often call it extreme programming
because it's embarrassing usually to say
oh yes I'm extreme but the thing is that
genuinely it is extreme and you should
not be embarrassed to say we want to do
better we want to make it we want to
push hard to make what we do the best
the extreme programming at the time the
word was associated with snowboarding
and extreme sports and actually extreme
programming is about making it safer to
develop code in an environment and it's
where the practices like test-driven
development came from and the idea that
you could have confidence if you worked
more collaboratively in the team so it's
got a basic thing behind it which is
that you're always trying to turn the
dials up on good practice so if you know
about good practice think about making
it even more extreme and that will help
you to be able to deliver change quickly
because extreme programming is all about
being able to change quickly sadly when
I go to a lot of organizations or
meetups what I find is that well at
meetups it seems like hardly any
developers are there at many conferences
that are agile conferences the
developers have gone somewhere else
they're not around and the things that
people say is they say things like oh
yeah we tried pairing once but it didn't
work or we have a few automated tests we
don't really run them are we trying to
automate our build but it's still kind
of languishing there many manual steps
well yeah we should have all the code
around a bit you know I mean a few
classes of methods but we don't know
we're not really refactoring mercilessly
I mean that the thing the XP name for
the practices refactor mercilessly so
you should what has happened in the
industry is that software developers
have kind of gone away into different
movement so there's been a bit of a
splintering and there's been so this is
just a kind of graph of google trends
DevOps against XP and xp line is
trending down and DevOps is going up so
DevOps people are really interested in
making things slicker being able to move
code around more quickly bringing
agility to the way that we ship code and
build code
so that you can write code without
having to worry about how it gets from A
to B you've also got people who are in
the kind of software craftsmanship
movement and they're much more concerned
with building the skills to write good
tests to come up with good designs and
then you've got a bunch people who are
really interested in building new
products and getting value out there and
what I think is that XP brings all those
three things together so I'm going to
talk about XP but people tend to go oh
yeah that's agile technical technical
practices that to me XP is much more
than agile technical practices it's
where you join agile technical practices
together with actually working to
deliver value and so it shouldn't just
be thought of as oh XP equals TDD and
refactoring it's like XP is a lot more
than that and XP can give you a lot more
value if you look at it as a whole thing
instead of going it's a something you
slot inside scrum because it isn't
something you slot inside scrum so this
is a bunch of XP practices you probably
won't be able to read the writing this
is like a screen shot like a shot out of
the first XP book extreme programming
explained in 1999 and it has things in
it which you think yeah like obviously
it's got things like testing yeah that's
a good thing but it's also got some
weird things in it and it's got things
like 40-hour week and collective
ownership and pair programming and
metaphor what's happened though because
obviously this is kind of a long time
ago is that some things caught on and
like loads of people do them other
things kind of died out hardly anybody
does them or they and other things kind
of turned into something else so they've
evolved over that time they're not
really the thing that was being talked
about in 1999 so what I thought would be
interesting or maybe interesting is to
talk about XP as we practice it
in the organization where I'm I work and
the kind of things that we do now
I'm just gonna go over here just for a
change because I can read easily from
this side so I wrote some post-it notes
and I put the green ones in the middle
this is kind of what you'd think of us
yes definitely core XP XP covers this
and the cool things are things like
on-site customer collective ownership
user stories test first pairing design
improvement velocity continuous
integration so these are kind of normal
themes but the XP that was written about
in the 90s didn't really have anything
to say about infrastructure or support
or user experience or retrospectives
even and so we have added things and
we've tried to think about applying the
values and principles in XP what helps
us to deliver change quickly and what
helps us to turn the dials upon doing
that and we've practiced some things
that you think yeah that's like an
old-school XP practice and then we throw
in other things that are not an
old-school XP practice and we think that
that's what an XP so it one thing that I
think is a really cool idea between XP
in XP is that it is not a Phase II kind
of thing it's not like first we do the
planning and then we do the
implementation and then we do the
releasing we're always doing some
releasing and we're always doing some
planning and we're always doing some
coding and actually it turns out that
you spend if you're in an extreme
programming team sadly you probably
spend less of your time programming
because you're doing a lot of other
things in terms of you're talking to
people to find out what's the right
thing to build your researching
potential options and you're making sure
you understand what feedback you're
getting from the live systems so there's
a kind of aliveness to it and it's not
really
kind of phased approach so this is an
old-school XP practice pair programming
and it's one thing that's very cool to
us but the reason it's cool to our team
is because we believe that collective
ownership helps us to move fast and so
pair programming is valuable in that
more than one person knows how the code
works and more than one person has
contributed to the design so that at any
time you will find that somebody in the
team knows how it works so we practice
pet programming by rotating pairs every
day and we agree at more in the morning
we have a stand up but the stand that's
mostly about who's gonna pay with who
and on what and then during the day will
change around but what we found is and
in the last year we've been doing a
different practice mob programming so
mob programming isn't you know the XP
book but it's totally aligned with if
somebody thought of it at the time they
would have put it in so the idea with
collective with the mob programming is
that you have a group of people they're
all working on the same code and they're
switching it around so rather like you
would do in a code dojo has anybody been
to a code dojo where you've kind of done
a randori style so my programming is
like that you actually have a timer you
switch
driver and the way we've got it set up
here is we have two screens and the
driver has a different view than
everybody else everybody else is looking
at big view and they look at a small of
you and then we kind of switch router
but what we found is even with lot
programming we talked to the guy who
came up with the concept who worked in a
team and how they did it and then we
evolved it so we don't really do whole
team mob programming much and we do a
lot of cross team mob programming so we
end up with mini mobs of people from
more than one team working on things
that intersect those teams then I don't
know how controversial this is and and I
don't also know whether given that we've
been acquired whether we'll carry on
doing this but we
there is no staging those development
boxes and live everybody has access to
live and the idea is that with that
trust comes an accountability you know
you know that you don't just press you
know deploy and then go and have a cup
of tea you better make sure that you're
checking the monitors seen there's not
any dramatic impact on the the state of
the systems and so we have like monitors
all around and actually these lines here
there that the deploy lines and and
anybody including junior programmers
who've just joined this last week can be
in a pair and be deploying we also all
the developers we don't have a separate
group of people who maintain our
infrastructure we maintain our own
infrastructure so this there isn't this
layering of people and there isn't this
layering of access to things the other
place where there isn't layering is
there is no buffering between us and the
rest of the users in the business so we
have to if somebody says this is not
working or then we have to fix it and if
somebody says I would like to sell a new
feature we need to discuss it with them
to try and figure out if it's worth
doing and help them figure out whether
it's worth doing and help them figure
out whether we could measure to see if
it would is there something very small
we could do to test if there's a market
so every day we have one piece person
from each team goes and sits upstairs
with the rest of the business and we
take turns and it's the thing that we
all expect everybody to do is to go and
speak to people in the business and
that's how we work out what we're going
to research to do next we don't have any
business analysts we don't have any
product owners we don't have any testers
these are all kind of intermediary roles
so the developers do everything they are
truly kind of broad broad broadly
skilled people and so his picture of one
team the teams tend to be small because
we don't have all these different kinds
of specialists so a team can be four
people or five people it's not going to
ten people and each person is takes a
certain amount of story research to do
they go and talk to people in business
but then they look into the technical
options they go back to their team and
say hey here's how I think we'll do it
and then what we do is we the people who
propose to the rest of the stakeholders
in the business this is what we think
each team should be working on next so
we have a little cue for each team and
we say oh this is the one or two things
we'll be doing in the next week but it's
not a huge amount of work because we
actually have the rest of our time is
prioritized by us to do things like
technical improvement improve the
infrastructure so there's only a very
small proportion I'd say thirty to forty
percent is spent on new stories and the
rest of it is spent on taking care of
the existing systems to make sure
they're running smoothly this picture I
know it's a bit dark it's the view from
New York into our office so it's we do
use hang out a lot we are a global
company we have offices all over the
world and that means that we do have to
talk to people that are not in Ireland
an office it's not even though we work
do have index cards and things very
old-school XP practice on our boards we
also have electronic versions of those
things and we have to do that so we can
explain them to people who are not
sitting right with us but we try to make
it very accessible for everybody to kind
of join so it's one thing that it's
crucial for us is that everybody should
get time like I mean a headspace time to
do their own research and learning so
all developers in our team have one day
a week that they can spend on whatever
they like and it doesn't have to be
related to the product and they're just
learning whatever they think and it's
really hard to find a picture of
somebody learning so this is a random
picked this is a picture of Thomas he's
doing his gold card
he's randomly sitting at this this table
we call the French cafe table but most
people just sit at their desks and you
can't really tell with for they're doing
it
and you can pair on a gold card if you
want some people were pairing a gold
card yesterday a gold card is what we
call this research time and so there's
something that this Foster's this if
there isn't somebody managing you all
and there isn't somebody telling you
what to do all the time you do have to
kind of track what you're doing so you
can figure out what you can do next so
you can tell that this is not where you
want maybe you can't even tell what it
is but what you might be able to tell is
that it's not set up by a project
manager to manage people's hours it's a
set of magnets and it's a set of magnets
and games characters and it's the way
that we figure out did we get our gold
card I want to make sure I get all my
gold cards my research time it's also
are we staying on top of the technical
improvement tasks that we need to do so
this green list of cards they're cards
that we never expose to the business but
they are the things that we need to do
in terms of improving our code base
because if you've been developing
products from 2006 to now you know
you're going to have some old code lying
around and it does need to be cleaned up
and sorted out so the green magnets
represent those then these there are
pictures of magnifying glasses those are
days when we're spending time looking
into and researching business facing
problems there are some question marks
on the board you won't be able to see
all this but like question marks are
I've no idea really it's kind of a
mishmash today I don't know what I did
but if we have a lot of that then the
team is going to go something weird is
going on we need to get together and
make sure we kind of stopped doing this
so we use this every day we put like
what we do what did we do yesterday in
terms of magnets these are types of work
if you're thinking in a Kanban way and
then we take a photograph and we use it
in our retrospective so we have this is
a picture of us having a retrospective
this is the team gets together they're
looking to think how can we work
effectively and they've got like
actually printed out on the table these
photographs to the board they use that
and this kind of this bit above here is
like a diary so every day we write don't
read the words to click carefully in
case there's there might be swearing and
things like this but the point being the
team has the power to decide what they
measure what they don't measure and
what's useful to them or what's not
useful to them and what I'd hope is that
agile ways of working should be like
this and not be kind of something where
I had to do something because the scrum
master said so kind of thing so the
other thing I wanted to mention is that
we take because we take collective
ownership of the code we also take
collective ownership of our process so
there's very much an a sense that people
take turns to do things so people will
facilitate meetings for other teams and
people will look for volunteers to do
other things so I've just come from our
Tech Talk session which was run by one
of the developers and then somebody else
will run the next one but the idea is
it's not relying on a special kind of
role to make things happen so we try to
have hardly any specialists and if we do
have some specialists but all of those
specialists their job is to work with
the teams to teach the teams it's not
the case of the specialist does a
special thing and that means there are
fewer bottlenecks in our way of working
so the last thing and I think this is
important because so many people can
feel that they only know one tiny part
of a system we know what we do over here
but we don't know what those guys do
over there we have the opportunity where
we work to rotate around and I think
it's quite important to be able to have
that feeling of choice that you
can move and work on other people's code
or and then gradually make it your own
and understand different parts of the
product so we have a few ways we do this
one thing is literally every three
months I ask people do you want to move
around and people say yes or no and
there are some people always say no but
then they have new people who come and
work with them so they literally haven't
moved their chair but they're in a
different team and we also have people
we do this where we do exchanges outside
the organization so we've been having
people go and work with say seven
digital or tim group and do swaps so
we've had people come with work with us
and we go and work with them and again
this keeps things lively and interesting
we're always thinking about new
technology and working with different
people so it doesn't get too stuck in if
you think about it if you were pair
programming with the same three people
you might hate them after a while so
you'd have to kind of mix it up
otherwise you kind of get to know them
too well and so I'm going to come
towards more of a bit of a summary now
so these practices if you were
implementing them where you work you
might do something different and that
will be fine the idea is that you are
trying to think about what will help us
to deliver change more quickly but to
think more out-of-the-box to think more
openly and not to just go in the
practice book it says do this so
therefore we will do exactly that but to
be a bit more adaptive about how you
think you're going to work now I think
that from a business point of view the
benefits of XP are that we're able to
deliver value sustainably so there's
this kind of continuous pace sense of it
you know we can always deliver at
certain number of features and once the
business knows that they then trust us
to work out what the other things we
need to know and they don't inquire you
know what are you doing today every day
they know that we can do
the value and we're delivering it at a
good rate and also I think if you change
things a lot and you do things in very
small slices very small steps you end up
with change tolerant systems so if
you're slicing things as leanly as
possible you do end up with this kind of
systems where they become easier to
change there are some people benefits as
well so I don't know if anyone's read
this book drive by Daniel pink is
anybody few people so I think one of the
important parts of it he talks about the
idea of people having choice and being
able to choose what they do and how they
do it and so I think that XP allows
people to have more choice over what
they do they are more connected with the
business that they work in they have to
understand how their business makes
money and they are able to develop
skills and in all of the kind of moving
around and collective ownership and
being generalists rather than
specialists mean you are able to acquire
lots of different kinds of skills and
variety in there in those skills and so
that I think motivates people to come to
work because they feel if I'm constantly
learning I'm in a good environment and I
especially if I'm learning from other
people and I mean environment or other
learners and I can learn from my
colleagues so this is really I think a
key benefit to XP so to summarize what
XP is about I think it's really about
continuous value but doing it safely one
of the values in XP because there's five
values one of them is courage and the
thing is what helps you be brave
what helps you be brave is that you do
things carefully and well so that you
know that you can deploy and do what
might be dangerous things if you didn't
have a lot of discipline so I think that
that you need courage and that's not an
essential part but that informs the rest
of your practice if you want to be able
to be courageous then you need to be
thinking
how can we do it better and it's not
just something like I mentioned the
retrospectives it's not something where
you think oh yeah retrospectives we go
in a room we think about better practice
and then we go away and don't think
about it for the rest of the time we're
always thinking about it and we it's not
that's one of the things where I feel
it's kind of a batch duck practice where
it would be nice if we could have be
more fluid around how we reflect upon
things so I've probably been slightly
quick there but never mind thank you for
listening and I don't know if we're
allowed to take questions or are they
saving them for the panel how do you do
it yes oh yes and do feedback in the app
please thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
