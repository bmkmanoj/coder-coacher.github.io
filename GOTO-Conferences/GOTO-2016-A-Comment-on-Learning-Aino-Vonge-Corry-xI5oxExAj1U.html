before I start this talk about learning
and teaching how many of you actually
will identify yourselves as teachers in
one way or the other okay cool thank you
so as you can see on my slide I sort of
describe myself I I put speakers on
stage as simon says i am the PC chair of
a lot of go to conferences also have
been for q con conferences and yahoo
conferences so I put speakers on stage
and then I messed with the heads of
students I started teaching in 1998 at
the University Computer Science in
Denmark and since 2001 I've been
teaching in industry as well so I I try
to make people think in a different way
so that's why I have them messing with
the heads and the last point is helping
developers talk with each other because
what I also do is that I facilitate
retrospectives and all sorts of meetings
to try to enable people to talk to each
other sometimes about things that are
difficult like if they made a mistake or
something like that so why would you
want to come to this talk there are
three learning goals and I'll go through
them first and then I'll go through them
in the end so that you know why you've
been sitting here so the first learning
goal why would you listen maybe you want
to become an expert and I suppose that's
probably the most valuable thing for you
so we'll just get that rid of right away
and then move to the other two so there
was some brothers Stuart and Hubert
Dreyfus in 1980 they made a model of
squill acquis see skill acquisition
unfortunately you can't see the title of
my slides it's supposed to say drivers
model of skill acquisition up there I
don't know why it doesn't show but I had
to read it aloud imagine it says skill
skill acquisition up there so how many
of you know that drivers model of skill
acquisition how to become an expert some
of you may have heard it I think
when you see it you recognize it as
something you've seen before so imagine
that you you have a new thing that you
want to become an expert in so maybe you
buy a book and you read about it and
that's when you are no vex nervous and
you know the context-free rules then
maybe you want to learn a bit more so
you go and watch a presentation at a
conference like this and then you become
a beginner a beginner as a one that can
apply some guidelines if you come to a
presentation like this you'll normally
see people talking about their expertise
giving you case studies showing you
guidelines on how to make use of this so
instead of just having the rules and go
by them you learn some guidelines from
experienced people the next step is that
you try to apply it on your own and
applying it is a very important part in
becoming expert so once you apply that
you become what they say is competent so
when you're competent you can actually
respond to the unexpected so instead of
just being able to follow the rules and
follow the guidelines of other people
you start making your own guidelines and
you can respond to the unexpected the
next step is that you discuss your
experiences so you can either discuss
your experiences in your workplace with
your colleagues at a conference during
networks or something like this at once
you start discussing your experiences
you learn you share and you learn from
others and that's when you become
proficient and when you're proficient
you can unconsciously combine the
processes and you can respond to a
nuance of situations but you are still
just proficient so what do you need to
do to become an expert and this is why
I'm talking about this drive for skill
acquisition because it once you start
teaching or giving presentations about
something that is when you become an
expert that is when you have that
intuitive grasp of the whole situation
so once you start teaching something you
will be you'll be faced with a lot of
questions from the students or from the
audience and all those questions will
make you think about things in a
different way
so the software company that I worked
for right after my my PhD and actually
my old boss is sitting right there and
he's the one who did this to me so we
can point at him while we're saying this
he had that idea that if you wanted to
learn something instead of sending you
on a course they sold the course and you
would be giving the course because he
had the idea which I thought was a bit
sadist at the moment that once you teach
something you really learn it but he was
right and that sort of started me in my
quest of anything I want to learn I want
to get into a place where I can teach it
so I want to become proficient so that i
can start teaching about it so that i
can become an expert so this is all a
bit mentor because right now i'm
teaching how to teach computer science
at the university so i'm trying to
become an expert by doing that and
that's why i'm giving this talk today so
that was the first of the learning goals
that i wanted you to have how to become
an expert so the second learning goal
that I want to share with you today is
how to become better at learning
yourself and this to me is possibly the
most interesting part of this
presentation because this is about
research in how the brain works how does
your brain change when you're learning
something because I believe that in
order to to really to make to make use
of it it's better to understand why it
works so I'm going to go through some
different things with you I'm going
going through something called the
chunks of information patterns and
Automator learning preferences and
constructivism it's all really old
research it's based upon research from
the 70s and up to 2010 but even though
the research is old the brain still
works sort of the same and I still make
use of it I started being interested in
the research behind teaching and
learning six years ago and before that I
had been teaching for 12 years without
knowing what I did I had of course made
my own what they call theory of practice
so I knew what worked and what didn't
work but it was only when I started
being interested in the research behind
the brain that I suddenly realized oh so
that's why this works and that's why
this never works
and one of the big epiphanies for me was
that even though people are thinking and
learning in a different way than me
they're not necessarily stupid and since
I have been a university professor for
many years I'm sure that my students
really appreciate it when I suddenly
understood that facts that maybe I
should just treat him treat them in a
different way so that's what I'd like to
share with you today and the third
learning point I want to give you an
anecdote to entertain a dinner party
with and since I think that that's
probably also on the top of your list
I'll take that before you start falling
asleep so this is a picture of a mid
play chess game this is the chess game
between deep blue and Kasparov some of
you might have noticed this is step 22
out of 37 how many of you had already
seen that right a few impressive so this
is the first time that a computer 1 over
a human being in chess so thinking about
what makes you an expert people have
been interested in chess players for
many years because with chess you can
really see a difference between a novice
player and an expert player so they've
been very interested in trying to figure
out what is it that happens in the
brains of experts or more what is it
that happens in the brains of novices so
that they can become experts so a lot of
research has taken place and this is one
of the more fun once I think or at least
the result is a bit fun so this is a mid
play chess board right so we've sort of
taking a snapshot out of the video of
the deep blue versus Kasparov and then
we've showed it to a number of chess
experts and we gave them five seconds
each to look at this board and then we
gave them a board with a lot of elements
on the side and they should place the
elements in the right places then we
gave them five more seconds to look at
the board and then they had more time to
arrange each time all the elements was
taken away from the other board so they
had to start from scratch we did the
same with the novices so the novices had
five seconds to look at the board and
then they had some time to
range it five seconds again that they
had some time to arrange it now my first
question to you is who did best who were
best at placing the elements on the
board after having seen it for five
seconds I'm going to ask you in two
different temp I so first I'm going to
ask you how many of you think that the
novice was better than the expert is
doing this please raise your hand now
right is that a question that you have
all good and how many of you think that
the the master or the expert is better
than the novice so you're about 5050 so
what's that based on can I ask that
question already
so you so you said that the master is
better than the nervous because the
master sees the patterns in in the game
yeah let's look at the result so as the
man said the master is significantly
better than the novice the Masters on
the top here and the novice is in the
bottom and you can see for each time
there's a measuring point they had five
more seconds to look at it and they
start off being far away from each other
and of course the novice is catching up
but the novice actually never even
reaches the master because there's
something that they just keep keep
messing up so that was maybe not so
surprising let's look at another chess
board so this is a chess board which is
not meet play this is actually created
by javascript Smith at random and then
or it could have been a child that put
the elements there but definitely this
is not a mid play chess board we did the
same again five-second each now who
thinks that the master is still better
than the nervous who thinks the master
is still better nobody who thinks the
novice now is better a lot of people
right and you're right so if we look at
it now the master is not doing very good
the nervous is doing exactly the same
you probably can't remember the other
graph but but the nervous is doing
exactly the same as he or she did before
because well it doesn't make sense but
the master is really struggling
significantly worse than the nervous and
of course it is because of the patterns
that we saw before because if we look at
the difference between an expert and
another's in chess and in anything else
what the expert in chess is has no one
hundred thousands of both configurations
and their associated rules so they have
some patterns in their head and they
have some Automator so
if we look at other researchers about
chess players then the novices think
about as many different combinations of
changes on the board as the expert does
but the expert only thinks about the
good ones and if we look at the eye
movements of people looking at a
chessboard there's also a difference in
it you can actually see that the expert
is looking at patterns on the board
while the novice is sort of just going
around with his or her eyes just looking
at all the elements one by one so the
good thing about being an expert is that
you have these patterns and you have
these Automator and you don't have to
spend too much time thinking about what
the best solution is because you know
already that's the part of expertise and
also goes with coding you know that as
well and the reason why the expert did
so badly in that mid play chess game why
was that any idea
yeah so what he said was it doesn't make
any sense to the expert and that's true
so when the expert looks as as a rat a
random chessboard he spent a lot of
energy trying to make sense of something
that does not make sense so he confuses
himself with trying to recognize things
that he can never recognize how she can
never recognize because it's not part of
the patterns in the head and that's a
problem i'll come back to that later and
an example because i want to tell you a
story also i want to to put this around
the story so i know that you're not old
teachers but i guess that sometimes you
get an apprentice in your company
somebody that you have to teach how to
work with the system or the systems that
you're doing or work in the way that you
do in your company so you get this
apprentice and end you and and you
really want to turn that apprentice into
an expert so you figure out what the
append apprentice should know and you
start telling their princes all the
things that the apprentice should know
right so that's the story I want you to
think about how many of you can relate
to that yeah you all know you get some
new people and you need to tell them
everything but I want to do a little
experiment with you first so before I
start going into that story it says now
to something completely different up
here you can't see it and then it says
activity let us divide the room okay so
we can divide the room here and whatever
you do do not write anything down right
now that's what it says as well i'm
going to show you 10 words and you
shouldn't write them down because if you
do that you sort of you you ruin this
exercise so for the people on that side
when you see a word count the letters
and say the number in your head and for
the people on this side when you see a
word say a related word in your head but
in your head right don't start I just
did this in Australia everybody shout it
out they're upside down down there so I
go through all the words and you just do
what I ask you to do you remember that
okay good so
right thank you i'll let you know later
what was what this was all about but
just don't think about it right now back
to the story so you you talk to the the
apprentice it takes all day and you use
numerous examples but the apprentice
still doesn't get it it's just when you
are talking to him right head to head
he'll be nodding and he'll say yes I
understand all of this it's working yeah
I understand definitely and when you're
pushing a button he can push the same
button so it seems as if he understands
ed everything but at the end of the day
it doesn't work he doesn't get it you
ask him the day after the week after he
doesn't get it he's forgotten everything
it doesn't really work so what's
happening what's happening in his brain
that makes it not work so I've got a
picture here which shows the brain
memory it also shows why I went into
computer science instead of creative
stuff so I put some labels on it it's
you can't see it this is the nose up
there it should give you sort of a
viewpoint it's a head seen from above
and the nose is up there right and then
we've got something called long-term
memory in the back of the head and we
got the working memory at the front of
the head so according to George meal
that some of you may have known about in
1956 he made this theory about the
working memory and the long-term memory
and the working memory is the memory
that you can work with right now
whenever I see a chair I walk into a
table I hear somebody say something I
use the elements in my working memory to
take these things into account and try
to figure out what I should do next so
whenever I'm learning something I hear a
new concept I see a new thing on the
screen I hear somebody else doing
something try something out with my
hands it takes up one of the elements in
the working memory so when he came up
with that theory he thought that in this
working memory you could have seven plus
minus two elements at a time
unfortunately recent research shows that
it's only four elements and I don't know
whether we're becoming more stupid with
the iphones and stuff or whether it's
always been like that but anyway you
have to
about it as for little elements for
bricks that you can use when you're
learning something and you could easily
I suspect understand that if you only
have four different elements like four
rows for concepts it's really difficult
to learn complicated things you can only
learn things that contain four elements
and a lot of the things that we do in IT
contain a lot more than four elements
and that's where the long-term memory
comes to rescue because let's see how
it's working in the brain so whenever
you hear something you try to learn
something you're working with this
working memory and you're trying to make
sense between the elements in the
working memory so that the pink stripes
here is where I try to make sense i try
to make a picture of all the different
things that i'm trying to understand
right now and then sometimes one of the
things that i have in my working memory
is related to something in my long-term
memory and when it's related to
something in my long-term memory i can
do what they call decoding something
into my working memory so maybe I've
learned something previously that is
associated to something you have learned
and then I can take this from my
long-term memory and decode it into my
working memory so I can make use of
something which is much more complicated
than four elements because I can take
something which is much more complicated
and make it be represented by one
element in my working memory and in that
way i can actually little by little
built an understanding of something very
complex out of the four elements i have
together with the long-term memory so
let's imagine that we took in some input
from the outside we decoded something
from our long-term memory and now we're
working with it in the working memory
and we also have this still in our
long-term memory so once we figured out
how these things go together with the
new things what do we do then well with
you the other way around and we say now
we encode the patterns into the
long-term memory so we take something
into the working memory we might decode
something out from the long-term memory
we work with it we make a new pattern
and we take
pattern we put it back in our long-term
memory and whenever we've done that we
built a little bit more on the things
that we have in our brain and we also we
use that actually in nit so let me make
a reference to design patterns when you
learnt the visitor design pattern did
you just learn it like this or did it
take you a few times a few
implementations in order to learn it I
could definitely say that for myself
learning the visitor pattern it was not
like the singleton pattern or the
observer pattern of the strategy the
visitor pattern that took time I thought
I understood it when I had it explained
but I I lost it again I had it explained
I lost it again I had to implement it
several times before it stuck into my
long-term memory and that's because as
you can see simply too big to be in the
working memory sort of spills out of the
edges so what you do instead is that you
say well once I've learned the visitor
design pattern it will always be there
in my long-term memory and whenever I
want to make use of it I can take it out
into my working memory and one of the
four elements will just be a reference
to this whole pattern so when I think
about visitor as one concept in my
working memory is actually a reference
to a much more complicated thing inside
my brain so in that way I can work with
things that are very complicated when
you think about patterns in your
workplace I'm sure that everywhere that
you work you have some patterns some of
you might have written them down some of
them not I always try to tell people to
write these patterns down because once
you have them in writing once you think
about how you can cut them out how you
can how you can explain them it's much
easier for another's to actually encode
that into the long-term memory because
you already said these are the things
that belong together and some companies
say that they don't use patterns because
it's silly for instance I have a good
friend in Google and he said that design
pattern we don't really use it well of
course we use visitor but all the others
we don't care about them and we don't
have patterns in our workplace but
actually they do I talked to him and I
try it
making me explain to me so what do you
do for instance is all about performance
where he's working and and and what do
you do then don't you have any patterns
and he said well actually now that you
mention it we do have something it
doesn't have a name but it's about when
we have a bottleneck in our code we have
something which makes our code really
slow but we don't know exactly where it
is we don't know whether it's in our
when I communications with our database
well let's see algorithm or well there's
the communication with the server or
where it is so what they would normally
do was to try to remove all the things
that they thought were obstacles and
then measure it again and remove this
obstacle and measure it again and once
they'd find gold and they would have
removed the obstacle that they needed to
reboot but what they found out instead
was that much more efficient for them
was to do something that we then started
calling the double bottleneck so instead
of trying to remove the obstacle they
just doubled it so if they if they
thought that maybe it was this algorithm
they would run this algorithm tries if
they thought that it was a communication
with this server they would have the
communication with the server twice and
then they could measure it and if it
exploded they knew that they'd found the
right place and the and the smart thing
for them was that it's much easier just
to double something than to try to
remove it and solve it so by doubling it
which you could do pretty easily you can
quickly but of course a bit dirty find
out where the bottleneck is so that's
why they call it the double bottleneck
so we'll actually do have patterns and
you probably have patterns as well maybe
you hadn't thought about them but if
you're training novices it's a good idea
to try to think about it and giving them
a name makes it much more easy to use it
as one of the four elements because
otherwise it'll be oh you know that
thing where we try to double the thing
that makes it slow it's much easier to
have a name it's much easier to learn
this yeah so I have this question what
are the patterns in your workplace does
anybody have a person they'd like to
share
yeah so you have something that you've
written down on a wiki and and you can
use it to communicate with new people in
the company and does it work to have
that no good thank you that was exactly
i'll give you the beer afterwards that's
what i would need these two here but
what if the apprentice still doesn't get
it what if this is not enough with the
patterns and the automator what if the
apprentice still can't remember this I
can't work with this what else could be
wrong then I'll give you a teaching
anecdote from the beginning of the
century so in 2001 when I first was sent
out to teach in the industry I thought
that object orientation was the only
thing in the world and I was sent out to
teach some people who had another sort
of upbringing it was like 45 year old
men which I thought at that time was
really old which I think today is really
young and they had been they had been
working with the like functional
programming other paradigms for 20-odd
years and I was sent out as a very young
girl to teach him about object
orientation and Java he was an uphill
battle I won't talk about the details
about this but I just talked about what
I learned when it when it comes to
teaching and learning so my introduction
to them to object orientation was well
you have this picture of the real world
and then you make this nice design like
rounded in UML with all the classes and
the relationships between the classes
and then you make this really beautiful
java code so that's what you should do
and it should be easy unfortunately
didn't really work that way so I gave
this assignment to my my students in in
the room and I said so this is a real
world problem please make an object
oriented design and some Java code based
on this and I had expected them to do
something pretty like this that it would
be nice to have occurred with things in
classes and small encapsulated things
but what happened was this terrible
thing came out of their keyboards they
made some really really ugly java code
it was still they were still using the
Java language but they were misusing it
in terrible ways and it didn't it didn't
look good at all I didn't understand
what
happened and I was even told that I
talked to some of the people at the
company and they said but these are our
most intelligent people these are really
good programmers and that is why we
spend money on trying to teach them the
newest things so they're not stupid I
thought they were stupid because they
wouldn't learn I would jump up and down
and I would tell them all the beautiful
things about object orientation but they
just didn't get it and they were
supposed to be intelligent luckily I was
teaching this course eight times in the
same company so I started noticing what
went wrong and you'll probably all
figure it out because what happened was
that in their procedural brain whenever
they saw a problem like this the
patterns and the Automator in their
long-term memory would solve the problem
in a split second without them even
thinking consciously about it they would
solve the problem in a procedural way
and then I would try to force them into
putting this into Java code but of
course since they had that all these
patterns in automation in their head it
seemed like they could only make shitty
Java code but it was only when I
suddenly started noticing that the
patterns in the Java code was
recognizable to me as something
completely different than it should have
been I suddenly realized wait a minute
so what I have to do is to try to figure
out how to make them think like I think
because in my objectives it brain the
way that I work was that whenever I saw
a real life example I would instantly
create an objector into class diagram
from it as a response to this so I
needed to figure out how to make them
think in that way so in the beginning
after I notice that the first cause I
said to them now please forget
everything you know about programming
and let's start from scratch that didn't
work it it's not that easy you can't
just say that to people but the problem
is that i had to add to break down the
structures in their brain in order to
make them get some new structures and
breaking things down in the brain is
actually really really painful which is
why it's difficult for people to learn
because there's sort of a little bit of
pain that you're not conscious about but
whenever you're changing the wiring in
your brain the brain don't want to do it
I called pain you could call it use of
energy something else but you're not
really interested in changing the brain
really likes to just when it's got a
world picture let's stick to this world
picture you see that in politics as well
as pose at least in Denmark I don't know
about America so um yeah what I found
out was in order to try to change this I
had to take them on another route so
instead of saying go directly from this
to this and to code I had to figure out
how to cut that into pieces so I said
okay now you've got the real world
domain now the next step is to try and
explain this at that time it was in use
cases try to explain this in use cases
then trying to explain it in analysis
diagrams I never thought analysis
diagram so it was worth anything but it
turned out they're very good for trying
to take people at another route that
they would normally do because they were
they couldn't use their patterns and
automated to make analysis diagrams so I
took them that sort of detour around it
through analysis documents through
design documents through test cases and
then to the code and that worked because
I took them out of that automation of
the patterns in Automator then make them
solve things right away and figure out
there's another way to get them here so
that is one way of thinking about it and
we actually have a Danish philosopher so
on Kierkegaard whoo-hoo set once and
I'll read it aloud because you're
probably Oh Danish is not that good
Edmond no they sent his Kaluga seen a
few admittance key hence it mr. first
and finest lopez por phenom therefore
Henare or bacuna there that makes sense
right yeah to the two days so I try to I
try to compile it but it's not it's not
quite as beautiful as it is in Danish
but that you when you want to succeed in
bringing a person to a certain place
must start by finding out where he is
for
the start so what I'm trying to say here
and what certain key guard was trying to
say here is that in order to take
somebody from some place and to the
other it's very important you know where
he is before you start teaching so one
of the things is that when you start
teaching always try to figure out what
do people know already what is in their
heads that they are struggling with if
you're teaching a course at university
you will know the prerequisites for that
course oh you'll know what courses
they've taken but we've seen in the
physics teaching at universities that
people come up with their childish
understanding of physics that are wrong
you probably all have had that childish
understanding of something that you know
to be true but real theoretical physics
show you that actually is not true and
the interesting thing is that the brain
does not have a problem with that as
long as it can keep to as long as it can
stick to where it was already it doesn't
matter let's take a very simple example
so we have a student here coming to
university thinking the earth is flat
all in his life is sort of based on the
fact that the earthís earth is flat
he's taking a course which is showing
him that the earth is round so his whole
life she changed based on the fact that
the earth is round instead of flat he
understands everything in the course
he's nodding he's doing the assignments
everything works until the exam which
which which is the weird thing where we
sometimes realize especially at an oral
exam that you ask a student a question
and the student answers and then you ask
student another question and the answer
is completely contradictory to the first
answer and then you understand that this
poor student has two different models in
the head of how the world works and of
course the ramping round the world being
round and flat is is a very stereotyped
there is simplistic one but I've
definitely seen students having two
understandings in their head and that's
the other reason why it's so important
to figure out where they are because you
need to figure out what are their
misunderstandings and try to sort of
destroy them before you start giving
them the right information you have to
destroy the fact that the earth is flat
before you can teach them for real that
the earth is round
because otherwise they'll have patterns
in Automator that are contradictory to
each other and that will make them seem
very stupid and confused so it is
extremely important to figure out where
people are but what if the apprentice
still doesn't get it what if it's still
not working even though you're trying
with patterns and you're trying to
figure out where they are and you're
trying to figure out changing the
automation what if the apprentice still
doesn't get it what else could be wrong
well then we got something like learning
preferences we got the Felder Silverman
model I'm going to talk about there are
a number of other models you can choose
whatever you want but I like this I
think it's very interesting so in the
Felder Silverman model about learning
preferences there's some spectrums you
could be either a global learner or a
sequential learner and if you're a
global learner you serve you absorb
large jumps of material and and you do
it almost randomly and then you don't
really understand the details and
suddenly you see the big picture of
everything but if you're a sequential
learner you like to take in little bits
of information if you shown the big
picture first you do not want to see it
it doesn't make any sense to you you
think it's too abstract you think it's
silly to look at the whole picture but
you want to see the little details work
first and then you can build your own
big picture and the interesting thing
about this is that people have different
learning preferences themselves and what
normally works when you're doing
something is to show people the way that
you learned it yourself if you try to
remember how I learned this or how i
learned that maybe you can use that in
your teaching but you cannot use that
without thinking that people have
different learning preferences meet
myself for instance I'm a very extreme
global learner i sort of i try to see
the big picture instantly and then the
details i'm not so interested in they'll
come whenever I need them but the big
picture is very important for me so
that's why when I was teaching I would
always try to make the big picture first
and then give all the details later on
because I thought they were not as
important and that would piss people off
because they were not the sequential
learners they were not interested in
seeing the big picture they thought it
was just a waste of time
the big picture they were not interested
in anything apart from all the details
so thinking about that when you're
teaching somebody is trying to figure
out how do they actually think do they
like to see the big picture or do they
like to see the little things and if you
cannot figure that out then try a little
bit of both say well I'll show that I'll
show you the big picture for my own sake
because it'll make it easier for me to
teach along the way then I can point to
different things in the big picture and
then you can take the details one after
one another learning preference Spector
is the active versus the reflective
learners so some people are active
learners which means that unless they
can discuss things or they can do things
they cannot learn anything and the
reflective learners are on the other end
of the specter they need to reflect
about things they need some time on
their own to think about it before they
can learn it and if you look at
presentations at conferences or lectures
at universities for instance they don't
cater for neither of those because the
people who need reflection they don't
get reflection because people constantly
speak to them so they can't reflect
there are no breaks for them to sort of
take this in before new thing starts and
the active learners they need to discuss
they need to be part of it they need to
do something to learn it so things like
this doesn't really work for anybody on
either side of the specter unless you
try to make them think about things
which is why I have these things where I
want you to think about things because I
want you to give a break to reflect and
all to be actively thinking about your
own experience in relation to this so
back to the activity now if you've got
paper then please write as many words
from the list that you remember or a
phone or something like that i'll give
you a few minutes don't talk to each
other just write them down
somebody is still writing
30 more seconds
right now i'll give you the list of
words and then cow count how many you
could actually remember if you did write
it down it might seem like you could
remember all of them but try to count as
as right as you can how many you can
remember right and then keep keep that
number in your head so how many did you
actually remember if you remembered at
least one word put your hand in the air
okay if you remember two words keep your
head in the air if you remember three
keep your hand in the air if you
remembered four five six okay let's back
to five otherwise this won't work thank
you right so look keep your hands up way
were five words look at this side and
look at that side what is the difference
if we got two out here who can remember
we got six seven over here who can
remember five words you could take your
arms down now so what happened what did
you do over here you counted the number
of letters in the word and two of you
remembered five words and what happened
over here you made a relation to the
word and seven of you remembered and you
are approximately the same number of
people there might even be a bit more
over here so so what happened what's the
difference anybody Association yeah
exactly so you found something that
you're related word would always be
something from your long-term memory
otherwise it wouldn't be there because
you had everything else and you just had
a number which did make an association
to anything and that leads me to what if
the apprentice still doesn't get it
right so this is a brain with content so
we have tried to picture this is a brain
and you have a Content this is what you
know in your long-term memory these are
the patterns and the Automator that you
have and then you have some new events
and you process these events and you try
to encode them into your long-term
memory right and that's what happening
when you're spending a day with a
nervous and then nothing and they're
remembering what you said in the morning
maybe if you're lucky and then the next
day it's gone because the encoding
failed and that's because of the the
construction that didn't take place in
the right way there was a researcher
called Jean Piaget who figured out that
the way that you learn is actually to
construct learning with something that
you already have so unless you figure
out what's in their brains already and
associate that with the new learning the
construction fails and that's an
interesting thing here about teaching is
that we like to have anecdotes we like
to give examples to make people think
about the things that they already know
and some people have been wondering why
women in mathematics and computer
science maybe didn't soak didn't do so
well at University and Denmark but if
you look at all the examples and the
anecdotes that was used in the teaching
it was about beer and football and fast
cars and things like that and I know
that they're women interested in BF
football and fire scars I know I'm
definitely interested in beer which may
have been because maybe that's why I
stayed it at university but if you're
not trying to relate what you're
teaching to something they already have
in the head like the rules of football
if you relate your teaching to the rules
of football and that is not already in
their head it just disappears it doesn't
work you need to figure out what's in
their head so that you can make it sting
to the things that are already there
stick to the things that are already
there so that it stays because otherwise
you're just going to lose it now the
last thing that I want to talk about it
said it's it's not enough to talk about
the content it's not it's not enough to
know what you are talking about and how
you should talk about it if people do
not want to listen to you so let's see
how much you remember of your undergrad
maths what does it say here anybody
logos logos pathos eaters right logos
pathos ethos and this is Aristotle is
modes of persuasion and persuasion is
something you can also use when you're
teaching or giving presentations and
let's sort of look at these in detail
logos what you are saying it is of
course very important to know what
you're talking about otherwise it'll be
a bit embarrassing when people ask
questions I mean you can learn so just
so much by heart but you can't it's it's
not a good idea not to know what you're
talking about so logos is that you know
what you're talking about hey this is
how excited you are how much passion you
show on stage how long enthusiastic you
are about what you're talking about that
of course can be faked if you want to as
we can see online and ethers who do they
think you are and that could be if you
are very respected in the field then you
have a lot of ethos already and if
you're a university professor you
initially have a lot of ethos you don't
have to prove anything but you're
already up here and other people are
down there somebody who's got all three
of these is mr. Obama here he's really
really good at giving presentations I
mean no matter what you think about his
politics I don't think many people would
disagree that he's really good at giving
presentations because he's got the logos
it's it I believe that he knows what
he's talking about he's definitely got
pathos and he's definitely got ethos
he's got all
of them unfortunately we cannot all be
Barack Obama right so we have to make do
with a little less but it turns out the
two out of three as in anything else in
life ain't that bad so if you know what
you're talking about and you're really
enthusiastic about what you're talking
about it is ok that people don't know
who you are this is me talking about
teaching and learning from stage right
now i know what i'm talking about i'm
really passionate about it but you don't
really know who i am and it doesn't
really matter because i've got two out
of three right so we see that everywhere
when we put nervous on stage if they
know what they're talking about their
passionate that's fine ethers can come
later or you can prove these us during
the presentation of course if we have
somebody who's really famous and they
know what they're talking about it
doesn't really matter how enthusiastic
they are I mean it would be nice if they
were great on stage but if it's like
james gosling he knows what he's talking
about and everybody knows him it doesn't
really matter if he's boring which is it
doesn't really matter because we want to
see him anyway and the interesting thing
is that actually if you're really
excited about something and people
really want to hear you speak it doesn't
really matter that you don't know what
you're talking about and I suppose that
some of you have known somebody to do
that right that sometimes if you really
want to see them talk and they're
passionate they don't really know what
they're talking about but it's still
good so whenever you're trying to teach
somebody something or give a
presentation please think about these
three where am I on this where are my
own logos where am I on Pacers and where
am I on ethers and if you're low on one
of them push up the other two or try to
work on the last one ok so I'm wrapping
up now what did you listen to I have
these three learning goals how to become
an expert how to improve your own
learning and an anecdote to entertain a
dinner party with and I think that we
got all three in a row so thank you for
your time
how am I on time two minutes right does
anyone have a question over there okay a
lot of online learning relies very
heavily on testing and assessment as
part of the process could you comment on
how that fits in in terms of the
frameworks you described yep so I think
that all the testing is it's definitely
a good thing to reinforce the patterns
and the automations that you have that
is a way that I like testing so testing
can be used in many ways it can use to
make you aware of what is expected from
you so I know that if I fail this test I
have not learned what what's expected
for me it can also be that the teacher
will know well maybe I didn't do this
well enough I need to do something
differently but testing is definitely
also that you can use to reinforce the
peasants and the automation so what I do
when I'm teaching at University a big
crowd of maybe 200 people I make 10
tests during a three-hour lecture and I
do it with little clickers so I have
maybe some code snippets up there and I
say you've got these three different
ways that this could give an output is
this output this output of this output
and they press the clicker one two or
three and I see how many of them say
once a to say three so what I get out of
this is that I get an understanding of
what they know right now and what they
don't know so maybe i need another
example maybe i should skip it maybe I
should do something completely different
but also they will know well whenever
there's a pause in the lecture they can
think about this code snippet and the
output of it so it reinforces the things
that I already said so i think that the
testing is a good thing for
reinforcements
so if you're interacting with a larger
group of people and you kind of said
there's people that have different
learning patterns and and they fall into
those different categories you mentioned
one strategy for dealing with that which
is kind of do the global and the
sequential are there other tips like
that that you found that have worked
overtime when kind of a one-way
communication or with a larger group
yeah yeah definitely so so communicating
with a large group is not possible I can
speak to them but I cannot really
communicate with them so and I really
like I feel it's important to
communicate for people to learn
something so what I do instead in
situations like these I try to make peer
learning a peer discussion so I try to
make people talk to each other pair two
pair or sometimes in groups and that
also enables them actually to ask me
questions in a big group because if they
know that three other people are
struggling with the same it seems more
okay to ask the question so if I'm with
200 people and I say are there any
questions there won't be well there will
be that geek a front road who's talking
about he'll have a question about
something completely unrelated but
otherwise people will be totally quiet
so what I do that is that I try to make
them talk to each other so that they
know that other people are struggling
with the same but that's also what I do
with the clickers is that they can see
why okay seventy-five percent of this
room got this wrong I'm not the only one
who's being stupid so I can ask
questions to the teacher but also and
not less important to all my co students
yeah thank you i know we're out of time
so please thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
