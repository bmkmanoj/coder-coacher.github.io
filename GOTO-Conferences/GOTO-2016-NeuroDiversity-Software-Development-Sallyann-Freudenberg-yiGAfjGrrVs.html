that actually I feel like I should just
go now
hello glad you've all had a lovely day
before I start I just want to say how
overjoyed I am to be here which I know
there's a little bit kind of cheesy but
there are two reasons why I'm really
pleased to be here particularly first is
I followed the go-to conference series
as a kind of admirer from a distance for
quite a while now and I've always been
all inspired by the amazing speakers and
so it's an I'm humbled and honored to be
up here today and feeling a little bit
spoiled to be to be completely honest
with you and the second reason is Byrne
is just the most amazing city so I've
been here once before and I spend the
day walking around I had a spare dare
spend the day walking around just awed
by the kind of history of the city and I
think for me the city of Berlin really
seemed like a city that really talked
about and was a symbol of unity through
adversity and difficult times and so
this feels like a really really good
place to be right now so I'm going to
talk about neurodiversity
and software development nobody really
calls me dr. Sally and Freudenberg
though to be honest everyone just calls
me Sal so please don't ask me a question
or anything over the next day or so
don't run after me saying dr.
Freudenberg because I'll be looking
around wondering where the mad scientist
is just call me Sal that's fine and this
talk came about a couple of things kind
of came together so I've been in IT over
25 years I've been a developer my first
one of my first jobs out of university
was developing middleware for real time
process control systems for nuclear
power stations that have also done some
work in the water board I've been a
developer designer analyst I've been a
project manager and
I've been doing kind of lean agile stuff
for like the last 15 years or so and
also got a PhD and my PhD or that comes
from laboratory where it kind of
actually should be classed as computer
science and artificial intelligence I
specialized in the psychology of
collaborative software development so I
have a background in in in cognitive
psychology and collaboration as well and
I as part of my PhD I did lots and lots
of research found that lots of really
interesting things about how you know
how the brain tames this incredibly
complex domain that we were work in and
and then I cut that kind of went by the
by I and I went back to work after I
finished my PhD and carried on doing
stuff and about 10 years later some
folks kind of said to me hey so I'm sure
you did some some some research on the
pair programming where is it I can't
find it so I started blogging again and
as I started blogging I realized that
there's all kinds of things we know
about there's some fantastic bits of
research we know about how people
develop software so I got kind of back
into that and back re-infused about that
and then at the same time as this was
happening a couple years ago my eldest
son who's now 11 got diagnosed with
autism and as a research I was like wow
fascinating right and he's go and find
out everything I can possibly can about
about the autistic spectrum and and what
it means to him to be autistic and the
more I read and the more I looked and so
I was kind of watching talks and and
reading and going to meetings and
training courses and all that kind of
stuff really immersing myself in in in
the autistic literature and the autistic
world and it all started to seem a bit
familiar actually and I started to read
things and think how do you know what I
think I do that or I think I think I
think like that or I think I struggle
with that and so I started to wonder
whether I might have I might be autistic
teen and I'm pretty lucky my sister my
younger sister has a double doctorate
and she's a clinical psychologist so
that's quite handy so I phoned her up
and said
yes you know that's that's diagnosis
I've been reading stuff I think I might
be on the autistic spectrum what do you
think and my sister said oh well she's
very diplomatic my sister so she said
well I don't know if you absolutely get
a formal diagnosis but you've definitely
got lots of traits so that's like it yes
really from her she's just being polite
so things like um so so I thought okay
that's quite interesting and then I went
online and I did some tests so here I am
this is this is the data so this is the
aq testing autistic quotient test you
can take it online it's created by Simon
baron-cohen from the University of
Cambridge where you can see there the
dotted line that's the control group so
people who aren't diagnosed with autism
this straight line is people with
diagnosed as autistic and that's me so I
score 41 which is quite impressive I
think and then this is the RIP vote s so
this is a test that's preferred by some
and particularly clinicians because it
gets really good interrater reliability
and you can see here that the threshold
values the suspected autism is in the
total score is 65 and I score a whopping
a hundred and 55 so and that's and you
can see again how that relates to
various you know various different
sectors and different things so that's
that's this year I retook that test so I
struggle with things like non structured
social environments I probably won't
last long at any kind of after event
this evening if there's not structure
and I'm not just talking to a few people
I struggle a little bit with attention
span I struggle with some sensory things
and sometimes when I don't know how to
be I do this kind of extreme mimicking
so I just in case you feel like you need
to cough and talk to me and it seems
like I might be teasing you because I'm
mimicking your body language and I even
absorb accents after a little while it's
really quite amusing if you're watching
then then then no you know that's that's
all just part of who I am
so I'm just going to back off from the
autism for a little bit and we'll come
back to in a minute um as an autistic I
struggle with people and I've always
found I've always been quite logic
minded and I've always found people to
be a little bit messy and a little bit
complicated and so I decided I kind of
lean into that a little bit and some of
the stuff that is on my PhD was about
some of the messier side of you know
what it means to be a humanist
developing software and one of the
things I came across massively early on
I guess was the work of Ed Hutchins who
talks about distributed cognition who
talks about the fact that we don't
develop software in a vacuum then
actually a team of software developers
are part of an ecosystem of people of
tools of the environment that they're in
and all of those things together that
kind of complicated knitting together of
things is what allows software to emerge
and I'm sorry I try and I was take
contextual photos but I haven't been
anywhere here it's at this time so this
is just out of the window but I thought
the bus is kind of doing that this is
Drive a he's got the wheel giving him
feedback he's got the kind of traffic
light so you can see the people all
around him so so hence the picture and
then you know as well it's nice to think
that we know what we know but actually a
lot of the research shows that we have
this knowledge particularly as we learn
more and become more expert in our
domain we have this knowledge that's
tacit knowledge we have this knowledge
that we can't really access necessarily
in a in a kind of straightforward way we
have this kind of gut feel sometimes you
hear people saying that just didn't
smell right
and I think of tacit knowledge as like
compile code we've lost the source code
for right we're not quite sure how it
got there but we know that we we can do
this stuff and one of the interesting
things about tacit knowledge
is it so it's so kind of embedded but
actually when we try and work out how we
know stuff we get it wrong a lot of the
time so this study the reason this has
got tablets on is there was a study by
an arrant and Boulet they looked at
medical practitioners so what my
children call real doctors not like
mummy and and they lose medical doctors
and they said okay how do you get to a
diagnosis how do you get to know Moses
how do you know when something's wrong
with someone and the doctors were able
to pretty much float our out there the
system process right so we thought it
might be this we discounted this thing
we did a little test here we tried this
drug that didn't work we tried this
other thing to the derm and we worked
out this is what it was and they were
really good at doing that
retrospectively so they could say how
did he get to this particular diagnosis
for this particular patient and they'll
say oh well I did this and I did it and
actually it turns out although they can
retrospectively apply logic to their
tacit knowledge
it doesn't actually match what they did
at all okay so there's so it's kind of
this this this hidden knowledge this
this this gut feel that we have and
software developments are creative
endeavor - so this is a very old model
of creativity from 1926 from Wallace
he says there's actually there's five
stages but these are the four I want to
talk about that if there are stages to
creativity that we need to prepare when
we're solving particularly tricky
problems I think in our domain right so
we need to prepare where we get lots of
data and information and we think about
what we would want to solve and then we
need to go away and incubate and that's
the bit that really fascinates me but
actually with tricky intractable
problems we need to go away and incubate
the solution and that we do that
incubation best when we move away from
the problem space and I know you've all
been there right so it's it's 10 o'clock
in the evening you're kind of like this
icon so this may be somebody in your
office tells you well maybe someone home
rings you and says let's just come home
you know just give it up for the night
you okay and you go home
and you have a sleep and you wake up in
the next morning and maybe you're in the
shower walking with dog or whatever and
you think ah I know what the answer is
it was so simple how could I not have
seen that before and that's because
you've you've been through the
incubation period so you've gone away
from the problem and there are lots of
things we know help with incubation like
repetitive fix of the physical
activities like juggling or walking can
help physically moving away from the
environment that you're in going into a
very different kind of environment with
different colors different sounds
different textures so the slide by the
way this is a Luminarium which is a
pop-up structure that's been
specifically created to help people
incubate creativity and you can project
things onto it so colors textures you
can sit in it you can have music in it
and just in case you're wondering
there's this particular ones in
Australia and this is what it looks like
from the outside so it's pretty cool but
it's unlikely that your boss is going to
allow you to have one in the car park I
would say so so then there are that's
some messiness and I'm still grabbing
hold of you know I really want it to be
clean and and I really want to
understand so right let's do a little
thought experiment you can help me out
you've all had a glass of wine you'll be
kind of probably let's imagine you're in
a building and you're you're just rats
going to go through a door but like like
linda's doors that's my age that's going
to door and you you open the door so
just imagine you open the doors and you
see something in front of you you go ah
tima collaborating really well that's
real like intense collaboration what do
you see what does it feel like what make
you see you're here or nothing
talking and since intent it's quite
intense there's lots of talking there's
maybe stuff up on the walls before maybe
a little Huddle's and that's kind of
what we think of isn't it when we think
about collaboration and some of the
researcher they're about collaboration
you know validates that verbalization
helps understanding we know through
talking even if it's just to ourselves
we can sometimes get this effect called
self explanation particularly if it's a
step-by-step logic problem that we're
solving and there's been some good work
by MIT's Vinci in particular around self
explanation and I liked all of that
because actually I'm kind of a
recovering talk--i holic I really like
talking I'm kind of you know this is
good for me because I'm I'm talking on
and I like talking so I really liked all
that and then when I was doing my
research I decided because I like
talking so much but what I would do is I
would record lots and lots of talking so
I thought how am I gonna work out how
pair programmers collaborate I know I'll
record them talking I'll record them
talking
I'll transcribe what they say I'll split
it up into sections and then I'll look
at is it true they work at different
levels of abstraction and how do they
navigate the problem space and all that
kind of stuff
so I did I recorded this seems crazy now
I recorded transcribed and analyzed
fourteen thousand eight hundred and
sixty six sentences of pair programmer
to log and at the time I didn't even
think I was autistic
so and you know what happened I started
to look at the data and I separated it
out into expert and novice programmers
and obviously there were those that were
in the middle and I looked at the
differences in the ways that they
interacted and I was amused and
surprised to find that experts spoke
less significantly Ness
less than novices that's broken my view
of the world I love talking experts talk
less spam and so it began to dawn on me
that some of the stuff I loved some of
the stuff that I'd seen in organizations
that I'd helped kind of transition to a
more nimble way of working had gone from
you know this environment where they sat
at their computers and they got given a
specification you know just like I used
to back in the day and I had phones on
and code away without really having to
talk to anyone else he wanted to and
they'd take our headphones that off at
the end of the day and go home well we
done is we swung the pendulum all the
all the way the other way so we've had
as people saying Oh working together in
groups where we can overhear each
other's really good and we gone ah I
know let's just rip down all the
cubicles and all that and let's have
like people working in a room pretty
much like this a huge exclusively open
plan environment and it dawned on me
that maybe what we've done is we've
actually just replaced one monoculture
that worked for some people it didn't
work for others with another kind of
monoculture that already also works for
some people it doesn't work for others
and I'd seen this I'd seen people in
transitions be miserable I'd seen people
who came alive and it really worked for
biting people be miserable I've seen
people struggle and I'd seen people
leave so
it turns out knowing when to shut up is
a kind of an expert behavior and it
turns out that maybe some of the magic
of collaboration happens in the quiet
pieces when we're interacting rather
than in the noise and interestingly
enough several years ago a guy called
over more talked about and you're going
to think I'm saying this wrong when I'm
not teeth driven development like cup of
tea driven development where he said you
know what I do when I'm pairing cuz you
kind of need a break when you're pairing
and you need incubation time what I do
is we we get together we talk about the
problem we're gonna solve and then I go
make a cup of tea now luckily he really
likes tea so this is good she says I go
and make a cup of tea what on my own I'm
why the kettle's boiling I understand or
whatever you know I kind of have some
incubation time on my own when the
kettles finished boiling I make the tea
I sit down with my with my pair partner
we drink the tea and discuss the
solution and then only then do we
actually touch the keyboard so it kind
of fits in quite well then I started
thinking well you know if we need you
know people who are really talking and
quiet and we need we need people who
thrive in noisy environments and people
are quiet annoys nauseam enviros well
the kind of diversity do we need so just
got some positive happy diversity quotes
for you because it feels like we need
that so here we go Justin Trudeau the
Prime Minister of Canada diversity
fosters new ideas diversity isn't just
sound policy it's the engine of
invention and if that just sounds like
politics then there's two really good
books that talk about this idea that
actually groups of people who are
different solve problems particularly in
Scott Petersburg excuse that's right
they solve difficult problems better
than groups of experts in the same
domain so if you take a group of experts
and you take a random group as long as
the problems hard enough and the people
are smart
and they come with different heuristics
different knowledge different ways of
doing things
then the diverse groups always always
outperform groups of experts and as we
saw this morning as Linda said you know
we have to get used to the idea that
collaboration isn't just about the easy
stuff it's not about just working with
people who are like us I kind of tremor
a little bit when I hear people say you
know what actually we recruit for
cultural fits like a monoculture years
ago I work for IBM
I remember going in for a review which
was which is great I got really good
scores and then right at the end my
manager said to me but I don't think
you're an IBM kind of a person I was
like because I get changed and go and
play the bass in a punk band after work
probably not but um but but but you know
so there's that there's that there's
that kind of need for a similarity but
isn't really helping us with our
collaboration so Katherine Kurt very
lovely Katherine cake over here
and I decided we do something about it
and we've created a campaign we founded
a campaign called inclusive
collaboration it's not for profits we
have badges and stickers and a book out
in the hallway they're free fill your
boots tell people about inclusivity and
we created this to try and kick against
the monoculture of it we've created this
to help people understand not just that
we need all kinds of brains to solve
some of the industry's intractable
problems but actually that as an as an
industry it's our responsibility to help
those people to flourish to help
everyone flourish and Katherine and I
are pretty different too so we're
learning about that as we go along as
well and that we've created in honor of
our late friend and mentor James Baker
who you've pretty much read the book on
agile collaboration
okay and just in case you're thinking
well you know I haven't got autism I
don't feel that different to my
colleagues how does this apply to me I'm
going to show you some people who don't
have autism who aren't autistic
struggling in the environments that we
create for them okay so this is a friend
of mine working at an organization where
I was coaching for a couple of years
actually Donna made everything very
modern there's this breakout spaces we
can have conversations it's really
lovely and she gets headaches and her
team made her a visor out of post-it
notes because she couldn't cope with the
environment there's basically nowhere to
hide in these environments so this is
actually one of Katherine's pictures
this is somebody you know and he's a
little introverted who wants some quiet
time to focus on something and had to
resort to hiding between two portable
whiteboards to find somewhere quiet to
work how crazy is that and yet these are
the environments that we're making okay
so there are many types of diversity I
believe that we're in industry of
thinkers so my focus at the moment and
for the last couple of years has been
very firmly on neuro diversity neuro
diversity is the idea that things like
autism ADHD bipolar disorder whatever
are actually not illnesses so much as
their natural variations in the human
genome and that rather think rather than
look at them as things to be cured
actually we'd be better looking at them
as just part of the human condition and
people and that we should create
environments that are supportive okay so
that's what neuro diversity means and
it's kind of sprung out of the autism
movement initially
okay it's gonna have a drink
so
autism autism said to affect one in 68
people and the latest kind of statistics
and there's a lot of evidence to show
that there's a link between autism and
tech okay there are loads and loads of
studies out there that make a very
compelling story between all of them
this is just four examples so autism
occurs more often in families the
physicists engineering and math mothers
of autistic kids are more likely to work
in highly technical occupations they're
significantly more autism in IT rich
regions the non IT rich regions and/or
test artistic spectrum disorder students
are more likely to favor STEM subjects
at college so there's a lot of there's a
lot of evidence out there something okay
so this fantastic lady is Temple Grandin
has anybody heard of Temple Grandin
hands up a few so Temple grants say
sorry I should say that's my husband
that's me and that's my son and
temporally I need someone in the middle
Temple Grandin is probably the most
famous artist in the world I'd say so
she was completely nonverbal to the age
of four and yet or you're just and she
is now a university professor in America
she splits her time between two
different things one is she specializes
in cattle handling systems and humane
animal husbandry
so about well well over half of the
cattle handling systems in America are
based on her designs - very very smart
lady and the other half it time she
advocates for autism and talks about her
experience with autism
Temple Grandin the reason I didn't have
Temple were in this in this talk is that
one thing I noticed a couple of years
ago about her temper anything she's
talking out a lot take places so you can
go onto YouTube and find temple talking
at Google or you know different places
and she'll say stuff like do you know
what we don't want to wipe out autism
because if it was no autism you wouldn't
have any
and if it was no autism you better
really like your computer cuz you're
never gonna get another one and in fact
you even go so far as to say if there
was no autism do you know what we don't
ever really we never really worked out
how fire works we'd all just be sitting
around yakety yakety I can and never
built tools and stuff like that kind of
be overly social okay so this is steve
Silverman I know if anyone's come across
steve Silverman great TED talk the
forgotten history of autism and I put
Steve up here because he has a great
quote for how understanding autism which
is by autistic standards the
neurotypical brain is easily
distractible obsessively social and
suffers from a deficit of attention to
detail and I like that it's kind of
twisting everything around and saying
how does the neurotypical brain look to
somebody who's autistic so why would
autism be helpful in in tech well
artists very often have specialist
interests they very often have
specialist interests about which they
kind of compile and like to have
encyclopedic knowledge um I went to
comic-con this year in Exeter first year
there's been a comic-con in Exeter I was
very pleased and I walked past his stall
and I thought nice photos and I got
talking to the guy who runs the store
and he said oh no these are my son's
drawings they're amazing and he said
yeah yeah my son's autistic so if we got
talking and I said tell me a bit about
he said well yeah he was really poorly
served by the educational system which
unfortunately is a story I hear a lot
and he so he completely withdrew from
school I think he said he was about 14
at the time and he went to his bedroom
and decided he was going to teach
himself to draw and he obsessively drew
Andrew Andrew Andrew Andrew and I don't
know for sure but the way that guy kind
of told me the story it sounded like he
didn't show anyone his pictures for a
long time so there's this little boy
trying trying trying in his bedroom and
then his dad taught me this and that I
tell you the hairs on the back of my
neck stood up when he said he said after
two years my
and walked out of his bedroom with this
so um and you can see his work here the
artists the artists Baker um is this
somebody who has an innate ability to
draw I think it probably is that he's
super talented but also the fact that he
was like my special subjects drawing I'm
just gonna draw and draw and draw and
draw until I get really good and kind of
get obsessed about it has to have played
a part in him getting that good and I
think why would you not want someone
like that on your tech team why would
you not like somebody like somebody who
knows like every single library function
every single who cares like I remember I
saw the kibitz of coda I've ever I've
ever seen I'm never going I wish I could
remember who it's why I remember going
to a talk a while ago that said if you
ask and neurotypical well if you ask a
developer if you put their own code in
front of them and ask them who wrote it
within about a week they're not sure and
they think it's a bit rubbish actually
so okay so special interests people with
autism also have same people with autism
istic people usually imagine
all-tournament if doing repetitive tasks
by the way I also this at some point so
I'm going to say it now these are all
sweeping generalizations okay there's
not such thing as like a typical autist
so I'm just giving you a flavor but can
be can be that we find repetitive tasks
really nice and calming so you know
those things that you think are nobody
would really want to do that it's
probably best to check with people
because actually for some folks
repetitive kind of work can be really
calming and I spoke to somebody I was I
was giving a keynote in Canada this
summer I spoke to somebody there who'd
worked with an autistic tester who could
just go through ladies and ladies and
ladies of web pages and say that one
doesn't comply with our standards that
one doesn't comply with our standards
but just wouldn't mind her all going
through later later like you know
hundreds and hundreds of these things
and similarly could do really amazing
data cleansing as well without getting
without getting bored of them Temple
Grandin believes and many other people
believe as well that the particular kind
of autistic brain that's drawn to
software development it's very good at
Visio spatial thinking - so very good at
thinking rather than how something works
kind of visualizing where it isn't space
and that really works for me I can
remember once working on a really tricky
database problem and closing my eyes and
kind of almost imagining all these
skyscrapers with into connecting kind of
walkways and stuff like that and walking
around that helping and actually this
reminded me of one of my very favorite
all-time favorite bits of research which
is by Miriam Petri and Allan Blackwell
and Marian and Allan took very very
experienced developers people who were
seem to be experts by their peers and
just post them really really tricky
tricky wicked problems and said to them
I want you to talk us through what
you're doing when you solve the problem
I said okay so talk talk talk talk and
actually what marrying an hour and then
the researchers were interested in also
wasn't what they were saying it was what
would happen when they stop talking so
they stopped talking and marrying and
the researchers which must be really
annoying said what something and
eventually when they answered they were
baffled themselves to realize that they
were going to started to describe these
multi-dimensional really rich Visio
spatial 3d 4d 5d models and that they
had of the problem so they said things
like I've got some quotes here they said
stuff like it's like a great
whistling multicolored scaffolding of
pipe work and gadgets floating in space
oh they haven't so be there it's on the
horizon so I can keep an eye on it but I
really don't need to know or it's like
describing all the problems all the
dimensions of a problem in 3d but
there's an extra dimension where I can
actually tell how close we are to a
solution as well and with these models
they were stopped ibly dynamic so they
could be like a debugger they could run
them forward a little bit and then stop
and then reverse of it and change
something and run the forward a bit and
these help them with problem solving so
that's some of the kind of superpowers
the autistic brain
along with that comes some difficulties
come some areas of challenge okay one of
which is language and communication
artists may not be very good at getting
off their specialist subject see I'm in
my element right now this is my
specialist subject I get to just talk
about it they might not be very good
with turn-taking
they might even talk about their
specialist subject when it's entirely
inappropriate so my son this is lovely
picture I'm gonna pay pee right now had
norovirus you know just continual
vomiting for a week thing so he at 3
o'clock in the morning he's in the
bathroom
being sick he looks up at me he says
mummy and I think he's going to say
something like I feel terrible or can I
have a hog or can I have a glass of
water so he says his mummy and I say
what and he says you know super Mario
like okay right so it's specialist
subject fixation in a you know not
necessarily terribly suitable moment um
such language and communication social
and emotional issues stuff like I
already mentioned stuff like
unstructured parts of the day stuff like
collaborating intensely stuff like eye
contact one of the reasons I struggle in
cocktail parties and stuff like that is
that I don't run I don't really
understand what the rules are what are
the rules I don't know it's okay to
start a new conversation with somebody
right now when can i when can I leave a
conversation without being rude home is
that rude how long do I stay oh and then
I kind of uh it also just get completely
befuddled I heard if you grant something
like agreement there I think and also
that I listen my hardest when I exclude
other input so if you're ever talking to
me and you try and explain something
quite complex and I stop looking at you
it's not because I don't want to look at
you it's because actually when I look at
the floor and it's the same where I'm
talking as well when I look at the floor
I can better listen to the words that
you're saying I can really focus on the
word
which I can't do when I'm looking at
your face okay and the third which is
flexibility of thought so flexibility of
thought includes things like struggling
with changes of routine and surprises
literal thinking so maybe someone says
I've got butterflies in my stomach and
you're kind of picturing they've really
got butterflies and like what could they
have eaten but also theory of mine so
theory of mind is understanding that
other people don't know what you know
other people won't react the way that
you react to stuff are though people
aren't feeling the way that you're
feeling so those are the kind of three
areas and you need for a kind of formal
diagnosis of autism you need to score on
all of those so there's also sensory
processing disorder sensory processing
disorders like a Miss calibration so I
can be over or under sensitive on any
other senses so so those might be the
senses that we think of all the time so
I might be over sensitive to noise go to
have been amazing and created a quiet
room here which I have taken sanctuary
and already for about an hour today
really wonderful so if you are over
sensitive to noise and you needed like a
break from the noise and the social
contact that's that's amazing but also
shows how if you're over sensitive to
noise these kind of exclusively open
plan environments just aren't going to
work for you you can also be over ins
and ER sensitive to touch and maybe on
your team you've had somebody who really
wax the keys on you'll keep on and it
seems kind of annoying possibly right
that might be just so that they can very
under sensitive to touch and they can
get in a feedback for them to realize
that their fingers have press the keys
sorry
well yeah and so they might be under
sensitive to sound too right and so
these things you can be you imagine like
a mixing desk things can be turned up
and turned down so I just want to I just
want to focus on two other senses there
a bit less common for us to think about
one is the vestibular system which is
your inner ear that tells you about
balance so if you have somebody who
needs to rock on their chair a little
bit sometimes that's restating their
vestibular system so that can help them
balance and the last one is the
proprioceptive system so the
proprioceptive system helps your body
understand where it's physically located
in space okay so if you'd like to I
offer you the opportunity to close your
eyes and put your right right arm out
try not to bang the person next to you
you can do this in your own time if you
don't want to do it now but you feel
free to do it now if you close your eyes
and then touch your nose with your
finger that's your proprioceptive system
they'll let your body know where your
finger is because there's no other
there's there's no other sense that's
helping you to do that and so if we
struggle with yours proprioceptive
system you may need to walk about a lot
or spin around to reestablish where your
body is in space okay so this is Jamie
this is Jamie night Jamie nice a senior
accessibility specialist and developer
for the BBC in the UK Jamie's kind of I
was embarrassed in my saying this
Jamie's my autism hero really
Jamie's written Jamie's a dev he's
written code that runs in space and
Jamie masters autism for a long time I
eventually made a meal and so now he's
decided that he's going to explore what
it means to be artistically happy so he
no longer masks when he has a thing that
he needs to do or a thing that he
struggles with he just struggles and he
just and he's trying to find a way
through that a way that he can exist as
an artist and have a happy life
so he's talented developer so you think
she'll notice straight away from him one
is this is Lian so Jamie and I and go
everywhere together
Jamie's quite happy to say I'm not
deluded I know he's not real or alive
but actually he helps me in awkward
situations if people want to give me a
hug I just give him lying there hug line
instead
say say James got a job Lions got a job
- lion is head of antelope management at
the BBC general says that's because lion
said he was and everyone's too
frightened to argue so that's the first
thing to notice before a Jaime just by
looking and the second thing is that
he's wearing this vest this funny kind
of vest thing and Jamie calls that his
squeezy vest this has got a little pump
because his proprioceptive system it's a
little bit miscalibrated sometimes he
says were particularly stressed out not
only does he not realize where his
body's in space he actually forgets that
he's got a shape he says it feels like
his atoms are just kind of going all
over the place and he can pump up this
vest to apply pressure to his body to
remind him that he's got a shape Jamie's
also done some really cool things with
with with technologies to help him so
he's he's changed their firing arms in
his house so that they're not too noisy
and freaky when they go off he's he's
can activate on his phone when he's
feeling panicky and have all the lights
they'll all the lights in his flat will
dim so so yeah Jamie is very very
inspirational if you get a chance to see
him speak very occasionally he does
speak he's predominantly nonverbal but
he's on Twitter and occasionally he does
do talks at conferences he says it takes
him at 50 hours to prepare for one hour
talk he can talk in this kind of
structured environment because there's
the social interactions really not not
two ways so that works okay and he
struggles with things so he struggles
with crossing roads for example because
he'll stand at the side of the road and
get start getting obsessed with the
patterns that he can see like red car
red car blue car red car red car blue
car eco blue car and then hope oh so he
has to UM have people with him
okay I'm not gonna cover all the other
things there but what I would like to do
is just cover some of the practical
things that we know already helps or
that you can add to to help even more so
if it's up here nine o'clock having a
daily meeting at the same time in the
same place with the same kind of
structure really calming no change of
routine really practical that would
really work using personas or having
some way of understanding that when
you're developing software you're not
developing it for yourself really
helpful with theory of mind how we doing
for time
um this I've been a bit tiny bit cheeky
here because I put this isn't this is a
planner an activity planner for an
autistic child and this is a kind of
Kanban board and not being rude I like I
like both of these things so but you can
see how actually is having some way of
physically being able to see the
structure it's like tangibly being able
to see the work that you're doing where
am i what's completed what am i doing
right now what's next actually for my
son even having a space that says
between this time and this time we're
gonna have unstructured time kind of
helps him because he knows to expect
that there's some unstructured time
coming up in meetings we can be
structured have a clear purpose given a
gender out in advance let people know
who's going to be there in advance
write down actions really clearly and
concisely give people time ahead to
think about things so I've always been
and I've loved that you know let's do a
retrospective at the last minute I'll
tell you what's gonna be all think on
your feet all right you get three
minutes to round to post-it notes and
then BAM we're gonna we're gonna get
some insight I know I'm kind of liked
you know what we need to embrace the
fact that there will be people who will
want to think through things through
carefully in advance before they're able
to contribute again I don't know if
you've come across them I've worked with
all kinds of people I've worked with
people who will hardly say anything all
day and then at the end of the day that
will come out with one a beautifully
thought out perfectly delivered sentence
that would just make everyone go whoa
I want that in my meeting and keep
meeting short maybe have some working
agreements so again this is an autistic
this is for an autistic child it says
things like home I can take relax and
take a deep breath ask someone for help
be polite and respectful I never scream
run away have a tantrum see some
meetings I've been to we would have
needed that hopefully not needed I never
spit or hit or kick other people though
but actually just having some ground
rules of how we're gonna work together
some working a room it's up front really
really helpful capitalizing on special
interests or evil awesome text we had to
swap laptops capitalizing expand upon
specialisms that says so a friend of
mine in the states told me that they had
somebody on their team in their
department sorry who was absolutely
obsessed with coding standards right so
whenever they had a team meeting this
person would be like oh I know that
controverted that contravenes coding
standard number three point two point
four point one four six or whatever and
it and it kind of drove everyone a
little bit crazy um so what they did was
they took that person who said you love
coding standards do you know what how
about we make you the person who trains
people including standards when they
join the company and you can start a
community of practice about it and you
can and you can you can do that so
really have finding ways of capitalizing
on people's special isms and maybe just
expanding them gently rather than
expecting people to go off on a complete
tangent and do something that doesn't
doesn't work for them at all provide
motive multimodal information not just
text I'm proud of this side piece
extinct so one of the things I've
learned to do with my son is to go is to
take away information every time I talk
to him if he doesn't understand so we
used to say that can you fit shoes on
that can you fit shoes on otherwise
otherwise your feet will get cold
seconds if she's on it's time for school
and your feet will get cold
it's that can you put your shoes on
because it's time for school your feet
get cold and your brothers will be late
okay and then what we realized it's the
first time he doesn't even he kind of
might clock that there's a noise in the
world the second time he goes on as
someone talking but third time he says
they're talking to me the fourth time
impact
listens by which time actually most most
times before I understood to do this I'd
added so much information he couldn't
pass what I was saying anyway so what I
know he's know to do is to take
information away all the time ok so you
need to put your shoes on
sex shoes on shoes Zach shoes Sakshi's
and most of the time because I'm not a
perfect parent but most of the time it
never gets to the right now because I've
understood it just takes him a while I'm
human thank you
just a couple more things so this is
three minutes 33 this is a piece of
music with no notes that's completely
silent and it's just to help us to
remember to actually relish the sign of
this think about pacing think about
breaks understand that interacting six
sorting sometimes I do training courses
right I teach all day and then my
friends will say are you in the city
brilliant let's go out and I'm like I've
interacted with people all day I'm going
home to my hotel room to sit in the dark
to lie down in the dark with a cold
flannel on my head and talk to no one
for a couple of hours because I'm
absolutely exhausted help provide
structure so I tell you in in social
events quite often I go off and do the
dishes because that's like it's a
repetitive task it's calming it's
structured I can go to people and say
hello how are you can I take your plate
and then interact with them anymore if I
can't cope with it
so find ways of them helping them to do
that find ways that maybe being
sensitive to prolonged eye contact if
you've got a difficult conversation to
have with someone in your team go for a
walk so they're next to you they don't
have to look in your face the whole time
last rites
say continually busy open nosy open plan
spaces with lots on the wall might not
be the best option for everyone we need
to offer alternatives we need to find
kind inclusive safe places where people
can that cater to people's varying needs
without singling people out as well
because let's face it it's much easier
to say I think I'm just going to go and
have a cup of tea than it is to say I
just need to stand up a minute to
reestablish my body's position in space
and learn to be okay with being quiet
that's been a really tough one with me
and and what I've started to learn is
actually you can fake it and this is
Gina Baker coming around my mouth right
now ask a question of a group give them
space to answer and if you struggle
behind your back you can count to ten
by the time you get to about eight
someone in the group will have got more
uncomfortable with you with the silence
and they'll say something okay so
there's a book of experiments that that
I threw together very quickly in about
three weeks mostly in the evenings
because Katherine and I wanted to get
something out there for people that was
helpful to people it really is a bunch
of experiments it doesn't tell you how
to be more inclusive but it what it does
is gives you some ideas of things that
you can try to help you start to think
about how to be more inclusive go into
little field trips in your workplace
have little sessions where you think
about the kinds of thinkers you got on
your team that's free there are 50
copies here I don't know how many are
left now but there's some copies out of
there on the table
it's free on lean Pub or pay what you
think I think it's $10 on Lully but
anyway so so you can have it for free if
if you like there's a quiet room here go
and use the quiet room look it's lovely
and it's quiet you can even have a
little nap in there that's it for
content I have lots of references of
papers and research still got a bit of
the academic in me so that's there still
there are some companies out there doing
great things there are even more and
more consultancies that are specifically
training out and placing autistic folk
in organisations thank you very much
if you have questions please come forth
to the microphone
otherwise I will start with one question
I have a lot of positive feedback in
here that I will show you later but
there's also one question so do you have
any idea how to spread the idea about
being different than normal standard but
being valuable and not being Rain Man
kind of seventh so on Savan yeah or
Savannah yeah so I think Rain Man was
really good for the autistic world in
they raise awareness of autism as a
thing but unfortunately what it also did
is everyone thinks if you're autistic
then you will be Rain Man
so like it will have this special
ability to count matchsticks when they
you know know how many matchsticks are
on the floor or whatever it is but you I
don't know by your y-fronts room came
out whatever it was he did anyway and so
useful in some ways but but not in
others and I think that's what we're
that's why I'm here that's what I'm
aiming to do that's what the campaigns
aiming to do
we are absolutely reaching out to
anybody who would like to be involved as
an ambassador for us and help us spread
the word so we that's what we're doing
that's so that's what I hope these talks
are doing how do you do it in your
organization's I think just start the
conversation I think there's a huge
chance let's face it like a one in sixty
one person is 68 in the general
population is autistic we know there
that's going to be a higher number in
tech so you know there is definitely
there is definitely going to be autism
in your teams in your organizations it's
there anyway even if we didn't even if
we don't specifically going out go out
to recruit autistic people because of
their amazing traits you know we've
already gotten inner organizations and
some of the stuff that we're doing to it
that we're suggesting to help you know
having more structure and isn't isn't
just useful to to people you know
autistic people it's useful to everybody
right most people need some quiet
thinking time from time to time so
offering alternatives offering spaces to
people
think is necessarily just an autistic
thing it's things like things that can
help with any kind of collaboration and
one more thing to add to that which is
particularly as we have teams now that
work across business areas much more so
if we're thinking about different
thinkers you know it's probably a person
who's decided to have a career in IT
it's going to be quite a different kind
of a thinker - somebody's had a career
in marketing and you need to work
together so I think it's just applicable
outside of the autism world - there are
more questions just flying in okay
I would I would take this one does a
thing like light form of autism really
exist oh there's a lot of debate so
there's this so there's a lot of debate
about that in the world of autism and
many autistic folk don't like the phrase
high-functioning autism or or mildly
autistic and the reason one of the
reasons for that is they think that it's
harmful and it diminishes how much of a
struggle people have so one of the
things that I sometimes get is well you
don't seem very autistic and one of the
things we know about particularly women
but-but-but-but guys but particularly
autistic women is we're very very good
at masking so we're good at copying
we're gonna learning rules we're good at
we're good at finding ways of coping
that allow us to kind of function and
hide our autism and actually that can be
quite that can be quite detrimental to
our mental and physical health and so
the idea is that that maybe having
having labels like high functioning and
low functioning isn't such a useful
thing because it kind of can take away
from the struggle that anyone with
autism is having and the kind of support
that they need okay one last question do
you have any suggestions or know about a
research about being inclusive in hiring
practices best best I'm sorry
specifically regarding challenges in
use stuff like this okay so I know a
good place to look for there is either
Microsoft or specialists and so mike
rizzo and there's another open source
model as well Microsoft had autism
specific recruitment process that
they've been experimenting with and
basically what they did is they took
their recruitment process I think from
like a set of racial interviews to a
three-month process where they have
people coding stuff with Lego toys and
they you know they they send people
photos of so one of the really simple
things you can do send a photo of
yourself to the person if you're going
to interview them send a photo to the
room of the room that they're going to
be in so just kind of minimize surprises
maybe don't don't look for this this
person shake my hand hard and make loads
of eye contact because maybe you'll be
excluding people right from the off
temple grandin tells a great story about
you know the nuclear reactor in in Japan
that failed because because you couldn't
shut off the bit that you needed to shut
off she's like I've got a facial mine I
would've seen that straight away there
was a thing with airbags and toddlers
see she's like I would have seen that
straightaway because her mind works in a
different way but she's been to those
companies and said you would have
screamed me out in the first 10 seconds
of your interview and again I think this
probably goes back a little bit Linda's
talk this morning which is about we all
have those inbuilt prejudices we all
have those in bill that you're not like
me things so maybe it's about
understanding that and putting them in
check a little bit just long enough to
give people the opportunity to shine
because there's some brilliant minds out
there and we can't solve the problems we
need to without them
I think if there are no more questions
from the audience thank you very much
for your talk
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
