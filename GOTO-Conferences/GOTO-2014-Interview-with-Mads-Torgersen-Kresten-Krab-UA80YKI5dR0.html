aarhus uh i'm here with matt's torgeson
custom ah and we have striped socks so
that's yes do have been here many times
and of course I know you're good
Microsoft story started here that's true
um 10 years ago it was 10 years ago
today we're very close at the Java
conference as it was called back then
that was the first time Microsoft was
invited until then they were shunned and
the community was shocked to see
Microsoft people here including Enders
Harrisburg who is the father of C sharp
and he essentially invited me to come
work mm-hmm who so I did good it so
you've been away i'm very sad actually
he's been away from ten years is one of
my best friends so and you don't miss it
be nearly enough I know I know anyway so
what are you well you I get to buy the
ticket every now and then or have your
community hey it's a good to come here
visit me for java webbing on it yeah go
to go to that so what do what are you
here to talk about this year well I've
talked about the work on the c-sharp
language and then the team at the sassy
chef for Pilar and and tool support oh
yeah that's why you saw your p.m. I can
never figure out what that is yeah I'm a
program manager the program oh that
sounds fine it's very much like they
don't really talk them what it exactly
depend right and also i also don't do
any managing because it's actually not a
manager position it's alyssa okay now a
program manager is it is someone who
designs and coordinates and does you
know thanks you guys to throw a new
whatever you know I do because but only
because I'm a program manager for a
product that involves coding in itself
but because it's a developer to over
tonight so as as a representative of the
customer so to speak i get to program
like the customer but i don't actually
build much as a saucy write the test
programs with it the test us do that but
I kind of yeah I kind of through
whatever you're like I do the idx the
experience part of it so you've been
adding a lot of tools support or like a
generic compiler or something why is a
week so we really you're doing good
about this time right yeah yeah so we
threw out the old c-sharp compiler which
was very good and was a good to throw it
out or was that both actually it was a
great compiler but all it did was take
source code and produce IL so the
bytecode of the clr and it didn't do any
other things really well which you know
it didn't expose its understanding of
the language in any decent way and so
what we built was a compiler villain in
c-sharp because it's nicer and that
exposes all the knowledge that the
compiler has about a given piece of
source code as an API it's an exactly
just sorry to talk about persistent data
structures with david nolan it's
actually exposing persistent data
structures that represent the syntax
tree of the api and the semantics the
bindings all that kind of stuff so these
representations are immutable you can
have you can express code
transformations that you want to have
built refactorings for BS for instance
you take the syntax tree of what's there
you create a transformed version you
post that back you can show it in a
preview because the two can exist at the
same time you can look at the preview s
kind of a window into the future so it's
really nice also really efficient and
really safe to work with these immutable
data structures and that's that's made
it that's sort of very nice I said the
first time you really done something big
with the immutable data structures ah
that's probably true yeah oh you mean me
personally but certainly the team name
it is the program you're managing the
program I manatee is this um it's
wonderful yeah yeah it's really paying
up guys I'm so great to work with I've
been doing a lot of stuff in like
functional stuff also so and so I mean
people know from eclipse and other other
places where they've done this kind of
thing a little earlier that getting an
object model off the code is you know
opens opens up a lot of possibilities I
remember it is getting eclipse um we
were using Emacs before and one of my
colleagues optimistic we have to use
Eclipse and I didn't really understand
this complicated ide but you know
suddenly seeing they do that the program
is now a model that you can
too late yes that's wonderful that is
great and so we've needed that for a
long time we started send a lot of
business down to restore / or not so
that's why do those kinds of things
that's right that's true except we now
we can sort of open it up so it's not
just those companies piggybacking on it
but everybody can actually super easy
that's part of what I did it live in my
talk right it's a few lines of code to
produce something that will highlight a
pattern in your code did you don't like
and offer a fix for it all and it all
lights up with the pre with the preview
of the fix and all cotton it it's just a
whole infrastructure you just plug into
this it's yeah so you imagine rebel
writing this themselves i'm in in-house
do coding style analysis or wood is
typically i think there are a couple of
different scenarios definitely a company
of a certain size would use it in house
to to help people right coat the way
they want them to write in so it will
just highlight well here we do it like
this so your and and and provide the
fixes you can imagine these Diagnostics
going along with api springs since when
you publish an api you would also
publish the diagnostics and code fixes
that will help you use it in the right
way and so you get discoverability of
the usage patterns for free in the tools
so to speak very cool so is it out now I
said coming in expertly there baby use a
poppy if you search for visual studio
ctp you can you can download install
lilies so what's next well that's next
and this is netbook but that makes this
like getting this actually out in do dis
head and there's some little language
features and so on as well coming out
but they're not actually like they're
not super big things when your concepts
and stuff like that I think that after
we've done this we'll see I don't know
what scenario is we can always change
whenever the lands right we never know
but I think I think there are certain
things that we're ready to make more of
a push on at the language level I think
it's time to get to pattern matching
maybe we'll maybe we'll take a sink to
the next level and start dealing with
async streams or something
that other people are starting to pick
up on as well but that's just a bunch of
teams that I want to kind of investigate
and see is there something I regala
things some Java 8 things yeah we hit
steel it's kind of I mean just like
stealing from me for that exact arena
every new iteration that's not funny
everybody's stealing some more
functional stuff than putting it right
it's fine now we everybody's been
stealing a single for us for a while and
after I kind of weave a feeling bad game
very cool so I think um yeah I think
that's fine you're getting bored now no
the audience might so uh I want to have
you to myself bumpers I came to tank
here with our sucks for a while okay
okay well thanks for listening it's
great to have a kind of station with you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
