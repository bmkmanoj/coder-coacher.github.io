right full of energy no hard day in the
office yeah so my name is Matthew Kane
and I think from that name and my accent
you can tell I'm not Swiss I'm
originally English and I've actually
been working in the agile world for
about three years prior to that i spent
about 20 years losing my hair working in
waterfall it's not much fun and but the
Epiphany really happened about two years
ago when I work for a software house and
we just couldn't deliver a thing well if
we did deliver it was full of defects
and it was late and it was not what the
client wanted all the usual store is
nothing new it was awful the piece of
software had been started eight years
beforehand there were 14 major major
financial institutions around the world
using it they were every single one of
them was very unhappy with us how do you
get new sales if they're all unhappy
ain't going to happen so we decided to
change the way we worked we had to come
away from waterfall we had to go a child
and that was great people thought though
we can we can do this we can we can go
our jail and we have our little teams
they're agile oh yes we made some
progress and yes things improved but
actually it was 12 months later when we
actually sat back and looked at what
we've achieved as a company we had some
amazing results and I'm going to show
those results right at the end of the
presentation but it wasn't just the fact
that we went a July it was the fact that
we also had teams such as marketing and
sales the IT infrastructure we had the
clients we had senior management they
also had to be aligned to the rhythm the
heartbeat of the IT teams who would
delivering the software
without it we didn't have alignment
without it it was like a car revving his
engine and not going anywhere so we had
some improvement with agile but actually
when we had the whole company or the
line that's where we got real results it
only took 12 months and i'll show you
the results at the end so maximizing
agile what we're going to be looking at
is the clients first then senior
management human resources sales and
marketing partners if you've got
consultants working with you support the
IT services and then i'm going to show
you the results now maximizing agility
throughout your organization agile the
holy grail of software many people think
so yeah it does go a long way to help
you deliver on time in scope quality it
certainly goes a long way but also there
are failure cases of agile adoptions
I've got Jeff here yeah I'm being a bit
out there at the moment but yes there
are some Fela cases it doesn't always
work and yeah everything seems so good
though but why didn't it work and one of
the things that we believed was getting
that alignment to get that alignment
going I've already talked about the
high-performance car if you've got a
journey to go from A to B you have to
have everything working the car has to
be in the right gear you have to have
the driver steering the car properly you
have to have all four wheels attached to
the ground to actually move you have to
move the gear you have to steer the rest
everything has to be aligned and if you
got that alignment you can get from a to
be very very efficiently and quickly a
notch our techniques it's exactly the
same you have to get your ducks in a row
you have to be aligned if you've got
that little team very agile that's great
but if nobody else is working with them
that little engine is going to be
steaming away and nothing's going to
happen so let's a look at the clients
what does that mean so some of you will
be focused or I've got for ubs people in
the front here yeah their clients all
internal our clients were external
doesn't really matter you still have to
have alignment with the clients the
clients if whatever you have is a time
box two or three weeks we had three week
time boxes the clients have to work with
you they have to be aware of that they
have to that expectation has to be their
vehicle external clients who are used to
working in waterfall it's going to come
as a big shock that all of a sudden
you're asking them to be involved with
you more frequently at least once every
two or three weeks but because you can
plan your time boxes in your sprints in
advance you know your dates you know
when you're going to be giving a demo we
for example had a webinar every three
weeks all our clients dialed in we could
demonstrate the software eventually they
were saying hang on a minute can I take
control so they also did the clients who
beforehand didn't want anything to do
with the software until it was delivered
and then they were very reluctant to
take it all of a sudden they were going
to hang on we want to see this software
it's great it's doing what I want to see
I can see where I can have some
improvements and we were a software
house with release is three or four
times a year so we could say this is
when the beach release is going to be
available and this is when the final
release is going to be available and
they were fixed we can communicate that
to all the clients we never shipped we
never we never delayed one release in
one year we did four releases not one of
them was delayed
and obviously the benefits for the
delivery team itself they get assurance
that what they're doing is correct
because they're working closely together
with the client they learn quicker and
the client acha mention wants to get his
hands on the software earlier if you're
a product house working with waterfall
you deliver your software the clients
never seen the software he's got it what
do I do with this now and he'll delay
and delay and delay but if you've got
him engaged he's going to actually see
the software want it and when you do
that final release is going to say great
come let's get this into production now
it's completely different to what I've
experienced in the past so I see a few
people nodding their heads seems
familiar story right let's talk about
the senior management know those three
guys are very scary guys very bad choice
of tie yeah yes they are important why
are they important but they've got to
know that they need to reduce their
command and control so those are the
user a scrum masters you know that they
can they need to reduce that command and
control that the team's work however in
our case we had software that had been
started to be produced eight years ago
the management with the original
developers so when the team said oh this
will take was X amount of days the
management guy said that can't be right
as complete rubbish went in my date
would have taken me 20 days but the
software base has grown in although
dimensions it's a ultimately a lot more
complex and it wouldn't be any way why's
that absolutely yeah so they have to
stop dictating the estimates or how they
would have done it for years ago they
have to help remove that impediments
we've all been we all know about scrum
and you have to remove remove your
impediments
a software house working away doing
sales and sales will come in and say
I've got a problem probability of
winning a 1 million pound deal if I can
show some functionality we can prove
this piece of functionality can we get
that out of the door in one week
management and we're going to look at
that in a minute but management need to
control sales to stop them from doing
that because if they do that they come
in from the side is going to disrupt the
planning of the team excuse me it's
working in an agile way need to leave
that team focused delivering new
functionality don't let them be hit from
the side for p dode if you like what
I've also seen is the management team
who don't quite get it they will come in
and go hang on I mean I've got something
interesting i'm going to take these
three developers from this team and i'm
going to put them on something else that
poor team SAT there going hang on a
minute we're all committed to doing
something if you have that sort of
behavior repeating nobody's going to
believe yeah nobody's going to believe
in their plans because they know is
going to get destroyed you have to have
consistency the management also needs to
know its role there's just a few
examples human resources change effects
people
so these guys hey char need to react as
quickly as possible because there's a
whole list of things that people care
about they care about I'm going to start
with that first one actually fifteen
percent of the workforce can't go agile
they actually like to be told what to do
by when yeah if you keep those guys in
your agile team the agile team is still
you're going to get frustrated HR need
to get involved then you've got
recruitment what does your recruitment
job specification look like now
interviews do you really want to recruit
that guy who sits there and says I'm a
fantastic java developer I'll sit in a
corner for six weeks and come up with
the best solution you'll ever have I've
certainly seen people claim to be able
to do that but it ain't going to work in
an agile team
you've got evaluation schemes you've got
things like reviews when do you do
reviews what are you looking for a new
review bonus one of the bonus schemes
like an example I heard just a week ago
at the lean and agile scrum conference
was a team in Germany fanatic football
fans were asked what bonus they would
like to have if they achieved their goal
and they said we would like flights to
Germany to not to Germany flights to
South Africa to watch the German
national football team I just hope that
they weren't going to watch the england
it's a very painful day then so there is
an example ask the team's what sort of
bonus they would like money is nice but
it doesn't actually motivate people
career paths job enrichment I'm going to
come to job enrichment when we talk
about support but then you got to think
about your career paths if you had seen
you java developer junior java developer
what are they now once we've gone agile
and these are the sort of things that
are always going to be at the back of
people's minds it's a people question
software is a people business ok there's
some software in there but it's all
about people all of that needs to be
looked at then you've got sales and
marketing I just love this guy yeah
would you trust him Klaus hmm how many
of you have heard engineers say sales
have old its old I've got a few knots
yeah and we also have sales saying
development have not delivered who's
heard that hmm it's this reality this is
not an made up
to help with the sales guys you need to
get them involved in your weekly or so
in your in your time boxes or your
sprints so that they start to appreciate
that you're making commitments so the
teams can see so that soy so the sales
guys can see that the teams are really
trying to reach those commitments that
they've made then they'll start to
appreciate that when they come in from
the side with that torpedo there's going
to upset the team get those sales guys
involved in the time boxes get them at
least seeing the demonstrations so they
appreciate the work that you're doing
they may be SAT up there on the fifth
floor what they call the carpet floor
yeah we'll get them down get them
appreciating what you're doing now this
one's the tough one we were talking
downstairs in the bar before about
having a good product owner and it's a
product owner that needs to know what's
coming to come out not just in the next
two or three weeks but in six months 12
months even have an idea what the market
needs in 18 months it's more than just
your backlog they also need to be
engaged
partners who say who's an external
consultant 123 few external consultants
we were as we re wealth the company I
work for was a software house we had
great external consultants we were very
lucky that they were familiar with agile
concepts with time boxes with Sprint's
etc if they were not you've got the
issue of who's going to pay for them are
they willing to actually adopt your new
methodologies but if they are familiar
and you are now agile you can now plan
your time boxes you've got your plan of
time boxes you know the schedule that
when you need those key resources you
can turn around to your supplier and say
I need them in these weeks because
that's when we're doing planning and
that's when we're doing demonstrations
so you can plan in advance and your
supplier will love that because he knows
what his utilization rates of his people
are he knows what money he's going to
get and you know how much you're going
to spend if you as a consumer of those
resources can't tell that supply that
information a supplier is actually going
to be thinking about putting his
resources on other projects you need
those good resources and you need them
working for you and not for your
competitor
support I love the picture of the dog I
don't know if you can you guys read it
sorry I can't help you sir I'm a dog
says they needed cheap labor and I work
for sausages don't we all it's about
sums it up when you think about the
people who work in support how much
respect do they get in the average IT
company it's a hard hard question not
very much they are over often overlooked
often disregarded poorly trained highly
exposed and they have a very high
turnover but think about it for a minute
they know the end-users problems they
really understand the pain that the end
user has from usability point of view
from a system performance point of view
from a defects point of view we've got
the usability expert here from ebay
right yeah so the end user knows so the
end user has problems it's the support
that's the first point of call they know
what the issues are so I talked about
here letting the dog bite the tail what
does that mean yeah it means that if
I've got an agile team that's producing
ropey software leather agile team
managed the support and the maintenance
there's a very large software house in
Switzerland with nearly 700 employees
they have one group of people producing
you functionality and one group of
people maintaining and supporting it
doing defect fixing do you think that's
good teamwork yeah I think one set of
people think they're prima donnas we're
great because we're doing all the all
the sexy new stuff on one group of
people not liking them because they're
having to fix defects at nine o'clock at
night you know the first group
that's true yeah yeah so our solution
what was to actually move these people
doing support and make them part of the
team make them part of the RL team when
those will give you an air another
example a widget on the on a user
interface pull down menu pull it down in
the test environment extracts five rows
from a database table a major financial
institution there's exactly the same
time thing and loads it with 600,000
rose only the supporter knew that
problem but because it brought them back
together into the team the supporters
hang on a minute and we see this problem
before we need to we need to make sure
that we don't make that same mistake
again and all of a sudden those prima
donnas quite frankly there's a lot of
prima donnas they no longer have that
power because they're being challenged
by the support guys and they go yeah
actually he's right I do need to do that
better so you start to dilute the
influence of the prima donnas in your
organization and I talked a little bit
about job enrichment because your team
is now full of business analysts testers
developers and support guys they start
to learn from each other they know the
business they know the product they know
the clients after you after a year 6 18
months these people are perfect to go
and work in pre-sales they're perfect to
go and be consultants themselves
revenue-generating they move on you get
somebody else from the Marquis who can
backfill them try employing a consultant
off the market who knows your products
your business in your clients they don't
exist
so as a final team you've got the IT
services guys now these can kill you
they can hold you to ransom they have
great power they can slow you down a lot
you as developers will want to have
faster hard disks you will want to have
a you will need to upgrade your
development environment if you're using
JIRA you will want to have greenhopper
in place maybe you want to upgrade
greenhopper or JIRA you will want faster
service because of a sudden you're doing
in continuous integration continuous
testing that produces an awful lot of
data and if you're really doing a job
properly you'll have system performance
servers as well to do testing that's
just a few your group of software
developers business analysts who is
going to give you that hardware who is
going to do the upgrades for you see IT
services guys they're not there they're
not going to do it for you you're just
going to get frustrated and you're going
to slow down and that wheel on that car
is just come off going back to letting
the team's focus the development teams
need to focus so if the guys are coming
to you say okay we will look great JIRA
for you on Wednesday midday good idea or
bad idea it's a bad idea got risk it
stops you from working so as you do as
what we did was as we were building our
release week started to collect a series
of items in a backlog for this for the
IT guys to consider are now on the first
time box zero we said to the IT guys
this is what we want you to do this is
our highest priority they gave us faster
discs they upgraded JIRA they gave the
servers or within that first time box so
that when the developers actually start
to work on the new release they had this
uplift of energy hey all of a sudden my
compilations are much faster I've been
waiting for this for seven or eight
weeks great so the or are you
automatically get an uplift in
motivation for the next release so you
have to get the IT guys planning with
you in your rhythm so I've won through
that quite quickly yeah I had about 20
minutes to do it in so what we've looked
at is clients clients need to be on
board clients need to know that they
have to give you input regularly there's
a lot of advantages when they do that
senior management need to make sure that
they play their part human resources
they've got an awful lot to think about
two people business sales and marketing
we love to hate them yeah but at the end
of the day they're the guys that make
the money they bring the cash in
partners if you're working with external
partners make sure you you nail them
into your projects and you can do that
with agility support get them inside the
team's IT services make sure they do the
upgrades when you want to them and when
you need them and when it makes more
sense for you so the conclusion is the
greater the alignment that you have
around all these people the greater the
impact of the agile world and the
greater the results and we within 12
months at these results we had forty
percent better teamwork we had some of
the biggest egos coming in and saying my
teams on track I've finished what I need
to do what or the team can I help that
is a remarkable this was from a guy from
the ETH double doctorate they had a
brain the size of a horse
we had a slight problem with ego and
prima donna nobody wants to work with
him beforehand but afterwards an amazing
change around turn around quality the
global head of a financial organization
said to us and it also ties in with the
seventy-six percent less uat issues I'm
not happy with the quality of your
software that you're delivering now I am
ecstatic his uat testing campaign was
too many years that's how much time he
used to allow for the upgrade of our
system that's how embarrassing it was
yeah imagine how much that cost fun
everybody in the company thought yes
we're having a lot more fun we had
people actually bringing in food from
their own ethnic backgrounds sushi curry
I didn't bring fish and chips don't
worry and having lunch together it was
amazing beforehand they wouldn't even go
for a beer after work so people started
to get a much more stronger feeling of
teamwork and when it came to what she's
selecting oz is a preferred vendor the
committee that made that decision ninety
percent of them chose us because of our
processes and because of our people not
necessarily because of the product but
because of the people and the trust that
they had in us and at the after 12
months we had one hundred percent
satisfied clients and a lot of people
ask how did you measure that extremely
simply we asked them all if we have a
client a prospect who wants to talk to
you about us may we put them in touch
with you and they all said yes not a
problem you've improved tremendously
that's how we measured it so if you get
that alignment going of all those
different teams around your central
engine
you can really make a difference and
this is the sort of figures I'm talking
about and it could be you so at this
point I want to say thank you for tri
fork and Klaus and like I said Cirie
Fourier 34 sorry i can't pronounce it
for a moment yeah but letting me do the
talk my little pitch there is on my
website you will find a download talking
about this particular piece of work and
there's business cards here if you want
to collect one so thank you any
questions yeah yeah they are very
important go back yeah so this one we've
addressed ok the satisfied clients the
ninety percent preference for us that
was the client that was the prospect
saying hey you know we had 10 people
nine of us said we wanted you
seventy-six percent less critical uat
that was just statistics innovation fun
quality and teamwork we asked all the
staff what they perceived to be the
level of teamwork or fun at a particular
point in time because we because there's
an expression that says night a
perception is nine is nine-tenths of the
of the truth or ninety percent of the
truth yeah so we asked them what did
they perceive six months later we ask
them again and six months later we ask
them again that's how we got those fall
and it went across the entire company
not just the developers of the agile
people it was really react the marketing
in support we even asked the
professional services people there was
another question over here yeah
to usability and we had people maybe we
look at it let's have a little bit of a
discussion on that one we had silos of
developers the silo a business analyst
and a silo of testers in a silo of cute
QC guys when we first adopted that chil
we made teams or co-located them in a
room and those teams had just business
analyst testers and QC you guys that was
what we originally had and like I said
after a period of time we realized we
needed to get the support guys in there
so you have your specialists so you have
your specialist developer but your
business analyst in New testers are
going to be working together to fight to
put the together the automated testing
for an end to end business case for
example when they're doing their
planning you'll have all four of those
skill sets all contributing to how
something is going to be built does that
go some way we the the team consists of
those experts now they are you have
developers who specialize in development
we had business analysts who specialized
in business analysis but they also
helped out the testers the test has also
helped out their business analyst but
the business analysts and the testers
can't really help out the developer
apart from you know giving him advice
etc yes actually they did they did
because we found that for example if
there was a slow period the test has
always had something to do they always
could improve some egg pre-existing test
at the new test case the business
analyst can always think about what's
coming up in the next time box the
support guys have always got a support
call somewhere that we also said to the
testers we wanted them to produce the
reproduction steps on defects that the
clients found
because they didn't find it in the first
place now this is that awful lot you can
just takes a bit of imagination you very
quick to fill them yep collocation of
these experts whatever experience with
the organizational food tables and
everything there are people have this to
disturb when they do their work in
offices and other people like that
because yeah it's an interesting
question and I think that but the nicest
way to answer that is to think about the
time horizon so what we did was we said
okay we go we have a target of a release
in four or five months so we organize
the teams and we had everybody move
around and some people just didn't like
where they were sitting because when
somebody walked into their room they
could see exactly their desk no so
they're back was facing the door yeah
nobody likes sitting there but what we
did is the end of each release we change
the team's we move them around because
as a from a company perspective every
time we're building a new piece of
functionality sometimes we needed a new
skill set or we needed to dilute the
risk of one person being an expert in
SQL in a particular area so we were only
having one person with that skill set
was a risk so we wanted to take it put
somebody else in there put him on some
other task no he would obviously coach
him but by changing the formation of the
team by changing where they sit on every
release you address the issues of I hate
where I sit they know that they're only
could be SAT there for a period of time
and change is good you know if you put
so if you'd if you just you know try it
if some of you have got you know VIN sat
in the same place or the same teams in
the same seats for the last year go back
to your boss and say I think we should
just change the where we all sit it's a
bit hard at ubs maybe and it cost it
across 5,000 for every time you move
but that but that mere act of change
actually creates motivation and energy
and hey this things are changing that's
good humans like it does that answer
your question yeah yeah okay yeah we
it's difficult to do all this yeah yeah
we have got a couple of experiences one
of them is an office where the rooms are
all of different sizes and we could
actually take advantage of that because
we'd have some larger tubes some smaller
tubes and we'd rotate them we also had
an air an open area as well and there
yes sometimes got a little bit painful
and but people knew again that it was
change again so people can get used to
it and they know that it's not going to
be forever and I think that's the
important message yeah and I have not
introduced it to the UK I would say that
the UK is more advanced in terms of
agile technology our child than
Switzerland and mainland Europe and I
there is certainly that in fact there is
definitely research that the Brits and
the Americans are happier with not
having a fixed long-term goal and are
more comfortable with unknowns an
unfinished work than our Germanic hosts
there is statistics there are facts that
the Germanic hosts like to know what
they're going for and and that they like
to have things nice and finished and
high quality yeah that's that's the
Swiss world excuse me
yeah I think the culture is a very
highly underestimated influence yep yep
absolutely the New Age companies you see
to do 10 years old captain system pump
Street online free internet complex yeah
I came through that system companies
over much more difficult like old can't
help these funny guys he just it's very
hard for them to adopt I don't either
now adopted in little pockets and then
just go straight I think what do you my
understanding of this is that a lot of
the people that are running the larger
companies like Siemens etc and six group
and all of these people a lot of them
are managed by its old managers command
and control and they just don't know
anything else as you take it you're
younger company full of young energetic
young guys they're already there already
agile they're already you wanting to do
it they know exactly what they want to
do and the issue is when when they
mature reach a particular maturity they
say okay now we need the general manager
general manager comes in and says I'm on
a minute the way they were developing
software is rubbish I've seen it my last
that could the software house i was at a
guy came in and said the way we're doing
software is rubbish came in on the
Monday and said this is how we're going
to do it and it was waterfall yeah yeah
he didn't survive very long hi that's
what ya need lost the best of it he
turned on fun sorry have you turned down
fine fifteen percent ah that was what we
had was a business analysts working with
us when we turned when we became agile
the business analysts just couldn't cope
they really just didn't get it and they
just they we just had to say okay we
have to
coach you out is the nice expression it
was fact yeah yeah we measured velocity
within a release yeah so all we were
looking at is making sure that the
velocity kept on going up during a
release the velocity stayed flat all
went down then we knew we had a problem
but we just kept it stable for that
particular release we had to change each
release the structure of the team's to
be able to deliver effectively what the
clients were wanting we couldn't we
couldn't put that artificial constraint
on us to keep the steams and the same
and also by changing the team's you get
them moving into different rooms you
keep it provides a different motivation
of different energy level three weeks
yeah and we found that two weeks was too
short we needed three weeks gave the
team's time to ramp up actually produce
something and then they're 23 down
usually we had the longer the shortest
period was for Sprint's of functionality
we kind of did it slightly differently
at a time box zero in a last time box as
well but we have four weeks of
functionality and but the longest whisk
was at least seven months worth of work
so it was between three and four
releases p.m. how much did you improve
your process from the one from the way
that you brainstormed it out dealing
yeah to the what you ended up running ah
at all month later yeah okay different
was it um I'm not sure if forgot can you
give me the location different words you
in there no John what always yeah okay
we're going to go out of multiple sucks
yeah yeah I parts are unhappy yeah how
much did the process aren't at the end
running with the teams and moody's
releases and yeah how much of that was
designed at the beginning of this is how
we're going to do our job we're going to
design it yeah and and and after 12
months how much did it resemble we were
so desperate to change to improve that
we sent our people on training courses
they came back so this is gravy so we're
going to do it these were the tombs so
we put together that the tombs you form
the tombs we said okay this is the
backlog that you're going to implement
and we we didn't actually sit back and
say this is what we want to achieve yeah
we just knew that we had to change and
we had a deadline we went to our clients
and said you're all very unhappy with us
we need two months to get our in
into shape and then we need five months
to to implement what you really want
give us those seven months and all the
clients were actually quite reasonable
about that they could wait so that's so
we had a seven month timeline enriched
you to prove that he was working for us
and I think that it's difficult to
answer your question but really what we
got to the end and what we thought we
would have had were completely different
we were astounded by the statistics that
we we put together we were amazed that
the clients every single one of them
said we will be very happy to give you a
reference call in terms of the building
blocks things like continuous
integration testing we already had that
more or less in place what we found was
we could close all the gaps that we'd
had within three releases we had
regression test cases for all the major
pieces of functionality and that was
something we didn't expect you to have
achieved I got this guy was first we
grab me later on you mentioned the
support yes how did you do the plan that
that's a very good question everybody
goes how to do maintenance how do you do
support and we took a holistic view and
we said we need to reserve a certain
amount to full-time employees during a
year to Fedun maintenance and support
turned out to be around twenty percent
so during a time box we said okay we're
going to fill up the time apart from
twenty percent and if it's not used we
can use it if it is used then its
maximum twenty percent but what it
allowed us to do is on a three-week time
box as if an urgent issue came in I mean
obviously if it's a production blocker
and the it just doesn't work yes you fix
it there and then that's your number one
priority in all organizations software
houses but if it's not so if it's not a
blocker then it was a case of okay the
average time before the team's can start
to analyze it will be in one and a half
weeks because the worst-case scenario is
the beginning of the time box and then
you have to wait for three weeks the
best-case scenarios that you render a
time box and say okay we can look at it
on monday so that sort of communication
with the clients is much better than a
big black box weather where they
registered the issue and nothing
happened for months
okay yeah thank you very much have you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
