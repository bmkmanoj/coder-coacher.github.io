parents gave me a conveniently internet
unique name do this for your children
okay I did it for my children yes I did
google their names when they were born
just to check that the first last name
combination was unique and it has paid
off so my older boy now has his own
domain name you know so you know that
moment was like 14 years in the making
now normally what I talk about I worked
myself I talk about kind of proper curly
braket nerdy stuff normally talk about
software architecture design patterns
development practices very code focused
stuff talked a lot about test-driven
development talked with a lot about
programming paradigms so I'm not going
to talk about any of those today well
actually I am a little bit but one of
the other things that I seem to be known
for is a fondness for pictures of
software failures this is one of the
kind of classics for me
this is Madrid Airport terminal 1 2006
October 2006 and it's it's one of these
things that it's fascinated me for a
while we have and software developers we
are the producers of the largest amount
of installation art on the planet and so
you know with this one I remember
specifically with this one that's why I
remember the dates my youngest son was
only nine months old at this point
nine ten months two-year-old and I
pretty much threw him at my wife while I
got my camera out to take a photograph
of this because it's a huge error
you know it's it's large enough I have
to take two photographs of it because it
goes all the way across and so you know
I'm looking at this as a piece of art as
something provocative this you know you
sit there and try and work out the
operating system no it's not windows
because windows does not use the
language of kernel except in one
particular error message
so this is most likely a Linux distro
and you know I'm looking at this game
all this is really interesting everybody
else is focusing on the words free
because that's what humans do five free
packets I don't know what they are but I
need to claim them how do I get them so
you know so this is a constant source of
fascination to it
now there's an incidental feature
because we live in political times we
always have but we live in political
times European Union only I'm going to
come back to that one we get it on our
screens we get these failures I take
screenshots I'm going to come back to
Facebook later as well but I love this
your feedback will be used to improve
Facebook thanks for taking the time
travel to make a report I mean it's just
like yeah I mean I did not just take the
time I really took the time I took it
all the way back if you look at that
this starts telling you something about
the nature of failure because look at
that 31st of December 1969 yes I was I
was alive but I probably wasn't
programming much but if you look at that
what's significant about that date it is
the day before time began
yeah the 1st of January in 1970 that is
officially that when the universe began
according to Unix so and one of my other
favorites that you can take this one
goes back about 10 years and tell it I'm
using Mozilla at this point it's the
Dutch rail website and there's something
interesting about this java dot lang got
a nullpointerexception
because i was after a friend of mine
lives in lived and eivin directs and i
thought i'm going to go and visit him
and i would like to get an earlier train
so i will look for an earlier train
there are no earlier trains there is
only nullpointerexception you will look
into the void and it will look straight
back at you now what I find fascinating
about this and this starts telling us
something about the theme I want to
explore in this talk which is the
relationship of failure to people of
software failures to people and here we
start seeing something here even if you
had not guessed by the completely
uninhabited URL this is a java
application when an
vacation fails all of the efforts of the
software architects the developers the
testers to encapsulate their software
all of those encapsulation decisions are
rendered useless it's like when you drop
something you see how it breaks you look
at the fracture lines this breaks and it
shows you what's really under the hood
you've lost all encapsulation at this
point we can tell how it's built
importantly we can also tell how it's
built because this is a really simple
error to trap what we're learning here
is something about the development
practices it's really easy to test for
this case so what does this tell us
about the team were they under a lot of
pressure or did they not know well
they're not familiar with conventional
practice you know big try block around
everything do not let the user see this
kind of thing you know give them a
message in Dutch or in English saying
I'm sorry things don't appear to be
working right now but don't give it to
them in Java and so there's a sort of an
interesting thing here we're learning
about the team what pressures were they
under what knowledge do they have do
they have an incentive to improve are
they aware of these practices
so it starts telling us something about
the organization that creates it so from
this tiny fracture we can start asking
some questions it has now reached the
point though that I no longer have to
take photographs people now send me
photographs I have I have 800 and this
is this was said to be and another
beautiful example when something breaks
you see how it is built here it is using
PHP we can see the object model you know
it fractures on the floor and so we
start learning about these things it has
actually got to the point and things are
retweeted to me so often but apparently
these are now I'm now an adjective it's
a careful in heavy screen
and a week and a half ago at agile in
the city Inn in Bristol where I live one
of the guys one of the organizers John
Clapham said Kevin there's one of those
screens here in the in the venue I think
we should take a picture of you standing
in front of it I will tweet it and then
you can retweet it so we can have this
kind of like cyclic effect so yeah I'm
absolutely fascinated by all of these
things now some of these are obviously
kind of just general configuration
errors but they make a point about the
impact all of these that I've just shown
are it's some level minor inconvenience
and we don't just see it out there in
the world or on our browser we see it in
our apps and sometimes it deals with
money
this is actually fascinating you cannot
pay by paypal for orders over 0 pounds
that's not very useful so this is the
interesting thing these are all small
they represent personal inconvenience
the bugs that we have somebody laughs at
them they take a photograph they tweet
it to me and they represent a minor blip
in somebody's daily experience but what
happens if it gets bigger so I want to
take you back to 2012 here because I
apparently I can time travel according
to Facebook which is a really neat skill
I want to take you two back to 2012 I
want to take you back to the 31st of
July 2012 and the new york stock
exchange new york stock exchange it was
introducing a new system and a
particular company night capital group
decided to upgrade their servers in the
week before in anticipation of the
changeover on the 1st of august 9:30
Eastern Time Eastern summer time
actually has daylight savings time they
the market opened and they started
trading nightcap group realized a 460
million u.s. dollar loss in 45 minutes
not bad 10 million dollars a minute
that's skill that's algorithmic trading
doing the wrong thing at high speed
okay it'sjust but actually the story is
worse than that in some ways I mean
let's just put it this way night capital
is no longer with us in its form because
it only had assets of about 400 million
but they actually lost more in that day
this is the amount that was outstanding
after everything had been rolled back
there's a kind of a agreement that
software is you know if something arises
through a software you roll things back
this is as far as they were able to roll
it back they lost billions in 45 minutes
outstanding now there's a really good
blog I'm going to quote from I've read a
number of reports about this but I think
Doug sevens won a couple of years back
he takes a DevOps perspective he's
looking at it from the perspective of
how the system was configured but as a
couple of points I want to make not only
does he summarize it well there's a
couple of other points
he says the updates Mars was intended
the system in question was intended to
replace old unused code referred to as
power peg functionality that night
hadn't used in eight years when I'm
talking about software architecture and
software quality and the effect of this
on agility my normal pitch is that dead
code has a problem it is the dark matter
of your system it shapes your system
even though you can't really see it you
don't notice it it is still there and it
has a very strong exerts a very strong
force on your system and the problem is
there is no code that is truly dead okay
it turns out all you need to do is make
a small assumption a change of an
assumption and then suddenly it's no
longer dead it's zombie code it has come
back to life and the zombie apocalypse
costs money now by the way if you're
looking for a safe haven the world is
changing place if you're looking for a
safe haven so I said in Bristol where I
live the City Council actually has a
zombie apocalypse plan okay
you can google it zombie apocalypse plan
City Council Bristol should probably get
you there yeah it's a 2 3 page
description of you know it's we actually
have plans so I feel safe um but not too
safe against this because this is zombie
code so there's a point here there's
dead
code here in the system now this is the
interesting thing
dug 7 then observes why code that had
been dead for eight years was still
present in the code base is a mystery
but that's not the point actually it is
because what we're dealing with here is
the the eight servers that were supposed
to be upgraded
there was an incorrect deployment one of
them was not upgraded just for those of
you who are interested in this
it was manually they were manually
updated okay so this is yeah this is
okay so this should have been automated
but seven out of eight were updated but
not the eighth one so it's running the
old code not the new code now an
important point here is he says that's
not the point
no it is because when things like this
happen they don't happen because of one
thing or another they happen because of
one thing and another had it just been
an incorrect deployment and there been
no dead code to bring back to life this
problem would have mad that wouldn't
have manifested itself had it been a
correct deployment and the dead code had
still been there there wouldn't have
been a problem so the point is that
these events occur because of a perfect
storm of things so that is part of the
point there these subtle things they're
very difficult to recreate it's an
assumption combined with another
assumption combined with another so what
was the assumption well I'm sure
nobody's ever done this I have the code
that was updated repurposed an old flag
that was used to activate the power peg
functionality you recycle an old flag
you recycle an old bit of memory
something to save you having to change
the format of something that is
established within an organization we
can't change that that group says that
we can't have more bytes in our headers
and all the rest of it so something
happens like this and that was the issue
and then at that point boom first 45
minutes the market was open handled
loads of parent orders four million
transactions and against nearly 400
million shares and goodbye night capital
so it turns out that this little
coincidence had very very big knock-on
effects but if you want something really
explosive then one of my other favorite
examples
was the maiden flight of Ariane 5 in
1996 4th of June I remember correctly I
mean Ariane 5 is a magnificent launcher
it's a very powerful launcher for
putting satellites into low to high
orbit and its maiden flight looked a bit
like this one of the world's most
expensive fireworks that's 370 million
dollars it was estimated that and that
was about 38 39 seconds into flight so
10 million dollars a second yeah so yeah
beat that night capital so the point
here is they scattered pieces of the
cluster mission over the forest of
French Guiana which I'm pretty sure did
not need that kind of topping and
ultimately it turns out I dug through
this it's kind of interesting I found
the original Cove yeah I read about it
in 1996 but I didn't find the original
cones about 5 or 6 years ago my
co-author Frank Bushman showed me
something he said Kevin have you seen
the code from the you know the Arianne
thing and I said yeah I sometimes talk
about it have you seen the code and he
showed me a little piece of code and I
said that's not the code and he said how
can you be sure I said I can read it
the guys who wrote this code they they
don't read stuff like this in fact if
you want to guess the language as you
know some people are guessing but I the
most perfect description came to me from
Linda Riesling when I'd use this slider
a couple of years back and it's a de
Tran in other words it's a de but spoken
with a very strong Fortran accent yeah
okay
and use it makes no use of any of the
facilities of Ada whatsoever and and
what you can see is even without knowing
the language there are some things that
might if you're if you're a software
developer there's some things that might
arouse your suspicions it's like hard
coded numbers the same hard-coded
numbers that obviously have some kind of
16-bit significance and also that's the
same number in hexadecimal so not only
they're hard coded but the programmer
got so bored that they switched base
just to make it more interesting
okay the same structure the same
checking what we're doing here is with
Thresh holding we're checking that
something's not too great if it's too
large then we cut it at an upper limit
it's saturated arithmetic what they're
doing just for a bit of guidance here is
V and H that's vertical and horizontal
and what they're doing here is their
threshold encoder flow to have integer
to floating-point overflow in this case
so this one is unguarded that one is
unguarded it's not possible for Ariane
four to exceed this now if you've been
paying attention and I know it's the end
of the day you might not have been
you'll notice I'm talking about ariane
for now
this is reuse this is ariane for code
sitting in ariane 5 this code doesn't
even have a purpose in ariane 5 it's
dead code it doesn't even have a role
and the funniest thing is at 40 seconds
it shuts off but at 37 seconds it
overflows and causes a very spectacular
spiral of the rocket and
that point a really neat piece of
software kicks in it's called the
self-destruct system that's what the
self-destruct system does you see up
until 1996 I was used to think that
self-destruct was a thing they did in
Star Trek and other films but actually
no real Rockets it turns out have a
self-destruct system because it turns
out their missiles and you really don't
want those going out of control so at
least the self-destruct system works so
if you were the author of that code well
done nice one how do you know your code
works yeah so what we see here is there
are some really interesting impacts what
we're dealing with at this point is this
had profound
repercussions not simply a business not
simply some small company it's not a
ripple in the market this actually had
some major implications for aerospace
the owners of the cluster mission and a
lot of stuff how easy is it to stop this
stuff how can we address this or it
turns out a recent paper makes a very
very simple point we know we should be
testing but do we have evidence simple
testing can prevent most critical
failures almost all catastrophic failure
in an analysis of certain open source
distributed system software almost all
catastrophic failures are the result of
incorrect handling of non fatal errors
explicitly signaled in software in other
words what we're dealing with is oh no
something's gone wrong and the code that
handles the oh no something's gone wrong
goes wrong these are very untested paths
I remember first coming across this
phenomenon about 15 years ago there was
a paper that explored the Linux kernel
and the defects in the Linux kernel it
turns out that most of the defects are
on the error handling paths in other
words oh no it's gone wrong but we've
never tested it because they're
unfamiliar paths what was interesting
was one of the other results came out of
this paper a majority of the production
failures as in 3/4 can be reproduced by
a unit test I mean that's that's that's
really high people often say oh we don't
really want to deal with the unit tests
and stuff like that we want to test the
whole system but a unit test it's very
very modest it's very simple and what's
interesting is that when we start taking
this perspective and I realized as I was
putting this talk together this fits in
with a class
that dates back to 1980 guy called Maya
layman Maya mani layman he came up this
classification and his focus was not on
correctness his focus was on evolution
technical debt as we would now consider
it and what happens to code over time
and he classified programs into three
groupings s P and E s programs at s
program one whose functionality is
formally defined by and derived more
from a specification if you do any
coding carters or you look at most of
the kind of training examples or
teaching examples in computer science
they mostly fall into this small
problems that are well-defined and
sometimes we dismiss them as toy
problems except that how do you build a
large software system you build a large
software system out of small bits of
software that's the point we build large
things out of smaller things and smaller
things out of even smaller things
Turtles all the way down and that's the
important idea is that if we can compose
and that was his thesis we can compose
more complex systems out of S programs
that whose maintenance and lifecycle we
can control but importantly that are
unit testable that's the additional
point P programs are larger programs
what we're talking about is although we
can define the problem the acceptability
of a solution is determined by the
environment in which it is embedded it
turns out there are some things where P
is for real-world problem in other words
although I can characterize it to put it
into software is is difficult the
classic example of this is climate
modeling and weather forecasting all I
can show you I can tell you what the
equations are actually I can't I'd have
to look them up but we can look at what
the equations are you can't reproduce
those faithfully in a digital computer
so therefore you have to approximate and
if you want it done within the lifetime
of this universe and preferably by next
week
you really have to approximate so
therefore although we know the nature of
the problem we are unable to state it
exactly as it occurs because there's so
many different variables we actually
find this in a lot of social systems
which leads us to the next one e
programs that mechanize a human or
societal activity in other words ease
environment the probe
has become a part of world models it is
embedded in it it is embedded in the
environment and the output of the
software affects something in the real
world that ultimately becomes its input
in a very obvious example of this a
particular scale which involves a few
devices is an air traffic control system
an air traffic control system whatever
comes out of that goes through a human
to another human that then guides a
plane based on that that then has
feedback through that in other words at
this point we now start modeling a
surprising number of the systems that
we've created today and they dominate
the world today we are in a world of
assistance so what are the cons what are
the consequences what can we learn from
this well one of the things we can learn
is that by the way christmas is coming
this is a really good book ok 101 things
I learned in architecture school it's
got nothing to do with software
architecture but it does make you look
really smart ok if you have this book
and people know you have this book they
will look at you and they go you're
smarter you're more intelligent more
educated ok you're not just a software
person it's also a really nice book
aesthetically but about half the advice
in it applies to any design or creative
discipline always design a thing by
considering it in its next larger
context and that means even the small
stuff
and here's how s stuff if you get it
wrong can have a really interesting
effect on the East earth ok what if we
stay what did we just deploy a piece of
code anybody can use it what how much of
any one earlier this year
because it was known as the left pad
incident as the headline the register
how one developer just broke node Babel
and so on in 11 lines of JavaScript this
is what they describe the author of a
little little feature left pad pulled
his code from a public repository for
reasons that were entirely entirely
justifiable and to do with rights but he
pulled this the Django metaphor is
perfect he pulled this and lots of other
things came down let's look at that 11
lines of code ok
so I think this is a beautiful beautiful
one from the if you not come across the
oh really books or they're really joke
covers co-written by some stranger on
the internet is always perfect
taking on needless dependencies fragile
development guide it's a perfect
illustration of this so that eleven
lines of code what does it do well it's
not even very well written this is the
eleven lines of code it's what it does
is it pads out a string and you can
typically Pat it out using spaces or
zeros these are the normal things so you
you pad it out to a particular size I
mean this is really clumsy way of doing
it and most programming languages have a
better way of doing it in this since
that was pulled something else has taken
over maintenance they've ended up with
this this isn't a talk on development
practice but honestly really it's not
what it's let me put it this way it's
not an improvement it real and it does
all those terrible things I'm going to
optimize something actually it doesn't
optimize them and oh it's shocking so I
had a go at doing it and I ended up with
this now I'm not asking you to read that
I'm just asking you to count the number
of lines I'm also asking you to realize
I'm not a JavaScript programmer but it's
a case of like well yeah this is
solvable it's a programming problem how
do we know that it works well I decided
given I wasn't a JavaScript programmer
to write a simple set of tests and I
wrote a test framework for it just to
prove that so this is all easily doable
these are all everything I've shown you
here is s program classically s program
when you run it against my code it all
passes it's all green what's funny is
when you actually run it against the
published versions of Left pad it's got
three bugs it doesn't actually do what
it's supposed to and I'm sure people
have got workarounds out there that deal
with this now apparently as a result of
this one of the future versions of Java
Script or ACMA script is going to have a
little function called pad start to
avoid this I mean quite frankly if you
do if you're using a proper language yes
I am going to have language Wars in this
session you thought you were just come
into IT in society then you know if
you're doing this in person you do that
or that
that's it one line well there is no
problem the Internet does not collapse
as a result of this but it's a valid
illustration regardless of the language
of Anderson's law I get to see any
problem however complicated which when
you looked at in the right way did not
become still more complicated this is
Paul Anderson his science fiction author
and he has hit the hole of software
development on the head with this quote
this is the nature of it and we've known
that this is not news this is not news
in fact we can go back to communications
of the ACM Edition in 2000 essica
Dijkstra just before he died
wrote a very simple piece but he said I
therefore like to posit the computing
central challenge how not to make a mess
of it has not been met most of our
systems are much more complicated
because it healthy and are too messy and
chaotic to be used in comfort and
confidence it's that were their
confidence where does our confidence
derive from what are the consequences
what we find is that we might look at
these as isolated things oh I'm a
developer I've just made a mistake or
maybe I can skip that or I'm an
organization that does development and
yeah our our customers report back these
things when they have bugs but the
implications are not merely between you
and a social responsibility or a kind of
professional responsibility it goes much
much further because clearly that
professional responsibility goes to
people you will never ever meet or
interact with so a few months ago the
swedish research has published a paper
titled the paper software faults raise
questions about the validity of brain
studies or title one of the headlines
turns out there's a lot of functional
MRI activity that is actually not
activity there's a whole series of
algorithms that I use to classify in an
MRI scan whether or not a voxel whether
or not a visual element a volumetric
element is actually valid and is it
active and then above this is another
set of algorithms there identify
clusters of these so we can say oh look
that part of the brain lit up that part
of the brain didn't and it turns out
that the the voxel identification is
absolutely fine
it's quite conservative but the cluster
identification is very very poor so what
they found is they frequently assigned
activity to a region where none is
likely to be present giving one of the
classic results that a dead salmon
apparently has high brain activity so
this is how much that's that's pretty
worrying you can be getting false
positives and negatives at this level
and indeed when they they when they ran
these tests they also found a bug
they've been sitting there for a decade
and a half yeah so these are not
insignificant this is affecting medical
advice this is not a case of the Machine
crashes I mean that's certainly
inconvenient but it's one of those ideas
that are well at least it crashed now we
know this is subtle we are progressively
and continuously misinforming people
through errors through inappropriate or
incorrect things things that we did not
know were broken and this kind of scales
up but there is a kind of a wonderful
assumption here that was originally
positioned Charles Babbage yeah these
days famous for the analytical and the
difference engine in the 19th century
one of my favorite one of my favorite
quotes of his he says on two occasions I
have been asked pray mr. Babbage if you
put into the machine wrong figures will
the right answers come out I am NOT able
rightly to apprehend the kind of
confusion of ideas that could provoke
such a question and yet and yet we live
in a world where this appears to happen
all the time what am I talking about one
of the most common things spreadsheets
so here if you think oh yeah functional
programming is the world's next greatest
thing I've got news for you everybody's
using Excel more people have been doing
functional programming than there are
software developers interested in it and
unfortunately it's not always functional
sometimes it malfunctions really rather
badly so we have a number of examples so
going back there's this
is this observation from Steven Levy
people tend to forget even the most
elegantly crafted spreadsheet is a house
of cards ready to collapse at the first
erroneous assumption he wrote this in
1984 so there wasn't even an axle this
was just the early days this was Lotus
1-2-3 and VisiCalc in August 1984 Wall
Street Journal reported a texas-based
oil and gas company had fired several
executives after the firm lost millions
of dollars because of errors traced to a
faulty financial analysis spreadsheet
model in other words this is 1984 we
this was already known as being an
emerging problem and it's reported like
old news at that point and these days
we've seen this scaled up paper earlier
this year Jean a mare is a widespread in
the scientific literature so a lot of
people in there in the genetics base and
in by and as basically pharmaceuticals
biochemistry all of this kind of space
they use a lot of Excel spreadsheets as
well as crazily enough a lot of Perl I'm
just a little bit concerned about that
although some of them are moving to
Python which is good it turns out that
they're they run foul of the defaults
spreadsheet software Excel when used
with default settings is known to
convert gene names to dates and
floating-point numbers which is not the
kind of conversion that you expect for
your genetics it's not going to give you
any kind of x-men powers either a
programmatic scan of leading genomics
journals reveals that approximately
one-fifth of papers with supplementary
Excel gene lists contain erroneous gene
name conversions so there are companies
making decisions based on these papers
about how they invest and what products
are going to create and you know
basically the future of genetics but we
also get just bad science ok
Christopher Essex and Ross McKittrick
their climate change deniers in the
number of years ago they published a
thing basically that try to say oh look
if you take the right kind of average
you can end up with you can actually
demonstrate the data shows a global
cooling and a science blogger Tim
Lambert made this observation back in
2004 he said Essex and McKittrick
present an example that purports to show
that whether you use the arithmetic or
some other me
can affect whether or not you find a
warming trend when they calculated the
trend they found an overall cooling
trend of naught point - naught point one
seven degrees and I would say they are
they found a cooling trend now this is
interesting they were doing a thing that
it's known as a root mean square which I
let me put it this way that's just bad
physics that's not how you average
temperatures they were trying to take an
average average the temperature around
the world so they are using root mean
square that's not the correct way to
average temperatures so first of all bad
thermodynamics then it turns out that
some of the data is missing and so
they're actually using bad statistics it
turns out that they are making averaging
assumptions based on missing data and
Tim Lambert spotted another thing I
looked at the graphs and something
seemed wrong to me the thing that seemed
wrong he observes the missing values and
he says when calculating the root mean
square they treated the missing value as
if they were measurements of zero
degrees this is a newbie Excel error
okay this is a really I was interested
so I contacted Tim Lambert because
unfortunately spreadsheets are no longer
available is quite an old blog but he
sent me their spreadsheets I'm not a
spreadsheet person it was obvious when
you looked at it it's just like really
you overlook that this is you know
anybody who's been using Excel for more
than a few hours knows about what the
question of empty cells and if you're
doing proper science you don't use Excel
so that's a that's another issue so the
point here is that what you see here is
nothing this is an empty cell okay if
you use the average function then Excel
ignores the field this is correct if
you're taking the arithmetic mean it
will ignore the field it just means that
they were doing bad statistics as
opposed to programming errors okay so
bad statistics and bad thermodynamics
wait a minute if you want to do bad
thing with dynamics well and have a
programming error you then end up with
this it turns out that root
in square is not supported by by Excel
so you have to hand code it which they
did and at that point empty cells take
on a different meaning very basic error
so this is also by coincidence the
number of peer-reviewed papers that one
of the authors Christo asacs has had in
terms of climate science the other
author Rosberg Ettrick he's an economist
and economists they're rubbish right
Harvard University economist Carmen
Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff acknowledged
making a spreadsheet calculation in
their classic 2010 paper growth in a
time of debt also not a peer-reviewed
paper it turns out um this is important
this paper because it has been used as
the basis of justifying austerity the
austerity economics that has been used
in the Western world since around 2010
has been justified by this and this is
this is where we hit the next level this
is not just bad science that informs say
a niche niche group of climate change
deniers this is also not simply a case
of misclassifying gene names or putting
a company out of business we've now got
to a point where whole economies are
effective what happened is they left out
a few rows it turns out if you leave out
a few rows in your spreadsheet and you
want to average things up and add things
up it turns out there's a significant
result it turns out that if you put the
wrong things in you don't get the right
answer out by this much instead of
shrinking the economy it actually still
grows that's a really big difference if
you're going to inform political policy
so it turns out that these spreadsheet
errors Steven Levy observes with
spreadsheets the danger is not so much
the incorrect figures fed into them is
that garbage can be embedded in the
models themselves the little little
formulae are untested they are ad hoc
they are also reliable truth people take
a spreadsheet as a particular source of
truth but we need to remember one of the
oldest sayings in programming is going
garbage in garbage out and that's what
we get now the problem is that these
days we have ways of making this faster
I'm going to go back to trading so I
don't know if you've been following the
fate of the pound as a currency but hang
on let me just show you something the
pound has not been doing so well due to
a little thing in summer and I can just
find it dig through here we go so this
is roughly the new 20 pound note you
might not see it but it's 20 euros
that's how much a pound or 20 pounds is
worth almost it's pretty much close to
that it is dropped massively but not as
much as on the 6th and 7th of October
where it really did if you look at this
cliff edge here Wolfe against the dollar
by the way the pound has recovered quite
nicely in the last week against the
dollar
what happened here this is not market
confidence this is not this is not
somebody announcing a policy that pushes
it one way or another this is not a
politician saying something this is an
automatic trading system that has a
slight bug in it and as I said earlier
you can really if you want to do
something wrong you want to amplify an
effect it says that computers can do the
wrong thing faster way way faster so
Elvina he came of Venus laws he's a he
was an avionics safety critical expert
and his summary of the challenges and
the paradox of automation says digital
devices tune out small errors while
creating opportunities for large errors
they amplify these effects and they can
run away before a human being has had
time to say wait a minute that's not
right and if you have a whole system
that set up of devices that are running
the software humans aren't really
involved anymore it turns out that not
only can we affect an economy by
misinforming through economic policy it
turns out we can have a radical effect
even faster at this level by getting
just computers to do the whole thing
slight misunderstanding as to the
context the larger context the next
larger context I was talking about
earlier it also turns out that human
beings are part of the system it's not
just we're affected by the economy it
turns out that when you put a constraint
on people people respond my uber driver
describing how drivers coordinate to
engineer surge pricing say a big event
finishes drivers know this so they shut
off apps in unison they're not available
so therefore if there are no other
drivers available then driver
availability is a scarce resource so
therefore if you are going to be a
driver you want to be the only driver or
one of the few drives at that point the
pricing goes up at that point they all
sign back in they created an artificial
shift in demand in other words this is a
pure esis 'tom
you've now actually and the problem is
it's not a software to software system
it's a software to human it starts
exploiting the defects in us we start
gaming the system this is also as a
point it's one of those things I've
always felt uncomfortable with SEO
search engine optimization what we're
doing is we're getting people to
effectively game a system professionally
and that system is something like Google
so there is an effect here I want to
talk about democracy so let's talk about
democracy and show you how good the
British public are with democracy some
of you may be familiar with the boaty
mcboatface incident earlier this year
that um I mean I you know it was the
will of the people I'm surprised that
it's not it's not actually now law that
this is the case but what happened is
back in March this research vessel was
going to be named and it's put out to
the public and somebody proposed boaty
mcboatface and then via the joy of
social media this effect happened
disappointingly they didn't call it that
right but I think that it was the
people's will we should have gone with
it and this obviously has broader
effects so once you then get the next
effect we start looking at how this
works with people this is a famous
saying it's an actually quite an old
saying when it's made more famous by
Facebook it's a general engineering
saying move fast and break things
does that include democracy well number
of points been made today about the
effect that we've got here but this is
interesting because what we have is
normal groupings of people naturally
have a filter bubble that they create
they naturally create an echo chamber
this is known within social networks and
I don't mean social media I mean
ordinary social networks of human beings
just talking associating and so on and
it turns out you there's already an
exponential reinforcement that may be
reduced or increased depending on the
diversity of people you come into
contact with the problem is that the
algorithms that people like Facebook use
are also exponential so therefore it
creates a higher power experience
which is basically a vertical wall you
cannot hear the effect of things now I
said I live in Bristol we do a lot of
street art in Bristol this disappeared
in May fortunately we managed to get rid
of the fellow on the right well only
sort of Boris Johnson but sadly the one
on the left somehow made it in but
there's this really important
observation here that we can see this
effect brilliant tweet the other day
Facebook is now in the awkward position
having to explain why they think they
drive purchase decisions but not voting
decisions in other words the purpose of
advertising is to influence people to
buy something so therefore you're
selling advertising space on this and
there's a lot of research that goes into
doing this and there's a reinforcement
boundary that they create I don't think
they necessarily don't maliciously but
it's normally people doing lots of small
things without realising the bigger
picture there it's not obvious they're
doing this except that actually we can
see that they do do this it was an
experiment in 2012 that only came to
light two years ago three years ago this
is the abstract from the paper that was
based it was a huge great social
experiment on Facebook we show Vyra
massive N equals six hundred and eighty
nine thousand and three in other words
that's the number of people that did not
know they participated in an experiment
on Facebook that emotional states can be
transferred to others via emotional
contagion in other words if we make some
people slightly let's see more unhappy
posts do they themselves become unhappy
and post things that are unhappy can we
change people's moods in case you're
wondering what the answer is the answer
is yes that's the whole significance of
n so there is a there's something else
going on here that some level there is
an awareness now sometimes people say
well that's just Facebook That's not me
I'm afraid if you do a B testing you
need to find out where your line is
because you are changing by choosing
between a product a and product B you're
not simply is a better or be better if
you are using a B testing to influence
people's product decisions Hey look on
a we got more click-throughs and more
people spent money you are changing
their social behavior you are changing
their bank balance when does that start
changing mood when does that start
changing other effects a B testing is
not without a moral side it turns out
they just happen to do it on a really
big scale at Facebook and we have the
filter bubble effect that reinforcement
so this was posted the day after the UK
referendum I am actively searching
through Facebook for people celebrating
the brexit leave victory but the filter
ball is so strong and extends so far
into Facebook's custom search I cannot
find anyone who is happy despite the
fact that half the country is clearly
jubilant today and despite the fact I'm
actively looking it turns out that we've
ended up we've shifted from the past
where we actually had relatively little
information and by this I mean when
going back a couple of hundred years to
a time where we have loads of
information but what we lack is not
quantity but variety and we have
accidentally created a system that
reinforces that so there is this idea
they're trying to keep us happy we're
trying to please people we're trying to
please all of the people all the time
and finally we have the opportunity to
do that so we created algorithms to keep
all of the people happy all of the time
including it turns out the advertisers
the point here is we don't discriminate
between true or not true just big or
small just popular and unpopular there's
a difference here and we're also there's
that also into this Facebook is making
editorial decisions effectively and it's
not doing those consciously the fact
that they are being done by algorithms
rather than human editors doesn't make
Facebook any less responsible this is
the kind of classic effect you may
remember this from not very long ago at
a couple of months ago this is one of
the iconic images that is seen to have
changed our reporting and our concept of
war in the 20th century and this was
posted in a Norwegian paper which had an
outlet on Facebook and Facebook decided
automatically no we're going to take
that down and
in fail to reinstate it at the
appropriate point because well you know
it's child pornography no it isn't
that's a that is a young child screaming
she has a napalm burning on her
background is also one of most important
images of the 20th century even when it
was pointed out to them they did it and
they also managed to when the Norwegian
Prime Minister also put it on her page
they blocked her blocking heads of state
is generally considered to be a bad
thing
okay so we've now ended up with a
massive escalation here
an accidental escalation and nobody's
actually set out to do anything
malicious but what it does is it
highlights a sort of a social
responsibility that we may not have been
aware of a broader effect so I'm going
to close with a kind of observation I
run a page on Facebook word Friday where
I talk about linguistics and where I
post things are about listening
linguistics like every Friday I post an
unusual word and it's definition I
recently posted this word mecca NOC
recei mecca NOC recei government or
control society by machines or a state
or other association of people run in
such a way now of course this kind of
sounds very ominous it sounds a bit rise
of the machines terminator but the idea
of machine rule brings to my robots but
the term refers more broadly to the wide
scale to my automation of governance and
social management through software we
are in that era now and it turns out
that it's not quite the happy story we
thought it was going to be it has
engagement it offers engagement it's
great there's a whole load of stuff that
we we don't want to give up because it
really is very good there are a lot of
things that are massively improved it
brings us into contact with people we
would not normally have contact with it
also unfortunately has some side effects
and we seem to have a blind eye to those
side effects the problem here is not
that you know it's it's it's realizing
the social consequence of that that we
may accidentally without meaning to end
up with a situation where we as we're
part of the feedback loop we end up
squeezing ourselves you know through
this desire for mekin ah cracy for more
efficiency for better business for a
neater algorithm or just making a piece
of code available but
not worry about testing it we may
accidentally end up receiving the wrong
feedback and I followed I partner a
tweeted this recently there's there's a
kind of classic Churchill quote we shape
our buildings and afterwards our
buildings shape us and there is this
idea that we have now become part of the
system and we are responding in kind
