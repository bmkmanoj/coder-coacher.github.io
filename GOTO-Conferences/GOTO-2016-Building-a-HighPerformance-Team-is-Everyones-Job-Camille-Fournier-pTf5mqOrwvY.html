myself so that's a good sign
okay so uh I gave that title the title
that's on the program kind of
arbitrarily as I was thinking about this
talk as I wrote it it's currently titled
rebooting culture
I might even change that but we'll see
we'll see how you all react to this uh
so yes I'm very excited to be here I'll
tell you a little bit about myself so I
spent the last several years kind of
being a manager I was I was a leader but
I was definitely a manager and so this
is a little bit the typical software
developer career progression I managed
to get all the way to CTO unfortunately
not being a actual you know religious
figure when I was crucified I did not
come rise from the dead or anything so
some quotes on management just to
lighten the mood and get us all in the
right mindset here the key to being a
good manager is to keep the people who
hate you away from the people who are
undecided
that's one casey stengel uh one that I
wish that I had heard three years ago is
you do not lead by hitting people over
the head that's assault not leadership
Dwight Eisenhower said that I am pretty
smart guy okay so how about me so I most
recently was the CTO of Rent the Runway
but I started my career as probably many
of you in this room maybe all of you I
was a software engineer for a long long
time it was a individual contributor I
actually built big distributed systems
that was my gig I built a bunch of
different systems for a big company I
worked for a big financial company and I
got to be a tech lead and I managed a
few people but mostly I was focused on
architecture distributed systems you may
know me from my work on the Apache
zookeeper project where I am
occasionally involved uh so that was
really fun and I really enjoyed being an
individual contributor and I did that
for a long time and I'm really glad I
did I became really good at architect
and code and writing code and and that
kind of stuff
but about six six and a half years into
that kind of career progression I
decided that you know I was kind of
feeling like I needed to do more I
wanted to do more I wanted to try
something new and I've been at this big
company for a long time and I was like
you know maybe I should try a startup
right that was like the cool thing back
in 2010/2011 era and why not go work for
a start-up that seems to be where all
the action is happening right now that's
where all the excitement is a bunch of
my friends had moved from big companies
to startup so maybe it was time for me
to do that and you know if I go to a
startup I can be a leader I can be a
director of engineering I can get some
kind of an fancy and plated title that
sounds great because if I say at this
big company I'm gonna have to wait for a
long time for that fancy title so that's
what I did I went to work for a company
called Rent the Runway so Rent the
Runway rents designer dresses and
accessories for short-term rental if
you've never heard of it it's a very
useful service it's a great company it's
grown a lot and I took a job there
in late 2011 as a director of
engineering specifically the director of
infrastructure engineering so - Clara
clear up some myths that some people
have about me I'm not a co-founder I was
not a co-founder of Rent the Runway Rent
the Runway actually had been around for
a few years when I joined it have been
around just long enough to be not
totally super super early risky company
and just long enough to have a gigantic
pile of tech debt so this was great I
joined this company thinking this is
like a technology arbitrage opportunity
because this is a great business great
business idea and I can fix this
software no problem I am good at writing
code I can fix this system so I took a
job and I started fixing the systems it
was a big pile of Drupal PHP yeah
written by a bunch of people many of
whom are great people and they were all
trying to do their best but as anyone
who has ever worked for a really
early-stage startup knows like you're
just trying to write code as fast as you
can to keep up with the growth of the
business so the code that tends to come
out in those early years is not very
good so we decided to do a rewrite
we were rewriting into Java services or
micro services whatever and I had a
small team
but mostly I was writing code and being
an architect and you know to give you a
sense of me as a manager at this time I
had this poster up and I meant it
I really really meant it I'm very very
serious about writing code and the right
way to write code I'm a very you know I
I take pride in my work as an engineer
and I want people who also take pride in
their work as an engineer so this is all
well and good this is all great so I do
this for about nine months
everything's going really well and then
we experience what I would describe as a
cultural segfault you're going to notice
by the way a lot of Arts in this talk I
took a lot of these these pieces and
these captions from a website called
classical programmer programmer
paintings calm which is like a tumbler
with funny captions on classic art that
I really find amusing anyway we had a
cultural segfault which was that my boss
the VP of engineering left the company
now I described this as a segfault
because nine months into a big rewrite
you can probably imagine that things are
not perfectly stable this is still a
pretty early startup it's not like the
earliest days but it's still pretty
early so we're all under a lot of stress
to deliver we're under a lot of stress
to grow and scale the person who left
had hired a lot of the members of the
team and therefore a lot of the members
of the team wanted to leave when he left
and in fact many of them did and there
was really no one to take over for him
kind of but me so I looked around and I
said you know what this is totally fine
I can do this I'm great I am a great
engineer and people like me right like
I'm you know I'm nice I'm fun I'm smart
I'm interesting I can totally do this
job so I said put me in let me be the
interim lead of the team well you tried
to go out there and find some great you
know grand pooh-bah CTO to hire him and
so they said fine okay somebody's got to
do it so I guess it can be you so I
spent some time as this interim leader
of the team and you know they looked for
new people and in the meantime we're
building and things are really stressful
right we did have a lot of people leave
the team the
because my boss left that was
unfortunate we also had a bunch of new
people come on to the team because we
were really rapidly recruiting and
growing so we're in this position of
really like massively fast transition
new people new code unstable super
stressful and I go into my first review
my first performance review as a leader
my first one forums for you as a leader
given to me by a non engineer by the CEO
of the company and I'm sure she said
some good things but she said the very
first thing in my negative or whatever
area for improvement feedback was that I
had created a culture of fear yes I had
created a culture of fear my team was
afraid of me they were afraid to take
risks in front of me they were afraid to
fail in front of me they were afraid of
my reactions when things went wrong let
me tell you that is a not a fun thing to
hear especially when you think of
yourself as a good person we all think
of ourselves as the heroes of our own
stories right I'm sure everybody in this
room when you're you know when you're
thinking about things you think I'm
doing my best I'm trying and when you
get negative feedback sometimes it's
okay but you know you're the hero of
your own story you think you're doing
okay and to hear that you're doing not
just not okay but you're doing something
really bad something that makes you feel
really bad that is a hard thing to
experience it was a huge wake-up call a
huge huge terrifying wake-up call for me
and I'm really grateful that I got to
experience it I'm really grateful that
somebody was brave enough to write that
feedback and give it to my boss because
I don't think she necessarily saw this a
lot herself I think this very much came
up through the team through the people
who reported to me and I'm really
grateful that they were brave enough to
say something and that she you know
conveyed that information to me because
then I could finally start to say oh wow
I need to change I need to change what
I'm doing and so over the next three
years of leadership I did just that I
worked really really hard and I believe
that by the time I left rent the runway
last fall we had created a culture of
trust we had gone
something that was hugely fear-based and
stressful and where people were kind of
unhappy and everyone was at risk of
leaving at all all times
something where we felt pretty good we
were performing well we were shipping a
lot of code and more importantly the
team really trusted each other and they
were doing good work together as a team
so lesson number one to take away is
that this takes a long time going from a
culture that is falling apart to
something that is actually pretty good
is not an overnight change I knew I had
to change and I was very committed
immediately upon hearing that feedback
to changing but that doesn't mean it
happened overnight so I'm gonna tell you
some of the things that I learned in
this process some of them will be very
obvious and some of them may not be the
first one in the most obvious one is
speed we have the author a continuous
delivery here right this is great
because speed is one of the most
important things to creating great high
performance teams and it's one of the
most straightforward things that
engineers can figure out how to do and
execute on because it barely requires it
doesn't require a huge amount of
cultural nuance right as long as you
have the ability and the will to focus
people you can probably make it so that
they can release code faster and this is
essential because if you are leading a
high performance team guess what number
one people want to ship people are gonna
want to be getting a lot done and number
two you will not have a job if you don't
actually get things done so you've got
to get things done so how do we do that
well let me tell you the story of very
quickly of my experience with speed
starting with this horrible slide of
Garba the girl Ridge goal buddy Cooke
the point of this slide is not to read
it it's just to look at it and think
that looks like a bad something
something bad is going on there right
there are a lot of connectors hither and
yon so two years ago at go-to I actually
talked about the things I learned
rewriting our systems it's a great talk
if you're rewriting any systems I
recommend watching it you can watch it
speed up sped up that's fine and it goes
through a lot of the lessons that we
learned in this rewrite right because
few people I think a lot of people do
rewrites or try to do rewrites not all
of them succeed I'm proud that we
succeeded but we made a whole bunch of
mistakes along the way and one of the
big ones that we made was creating this
monstrosity which was which is kind of a
representation of the way our storefront
was architected and what you had to do
to deploy it into production so you can
imagine a big consumer website the way
that most functionality gets to the
consumer does involve the website being
deployed right Valve's assets changing
javascript changing Ruby changing
something changing on that side even
though a lot of the business logic was
living in Java services we still had to
deploy the website to change things okay
so that makes it a real critical
bottleneck for actually shipping
features and getting things done and
this complexity meant that it took like
four plus hours to do a release so as
you can probably imagine we were not
releasing continuously or even every day
we were releasing maybe once a week and
this was an improvement from when I
joined where we were probably released
saying once every two weeks to once a
month so not terrible but not awesome
and so we took the team away and said
you know what some of the team was like
we really want to change this and we
were all like yes let's make it so that
we can release more easily that's great
so they went away they cleaned this up
gets sub-modules apparently we're
involved originally and I've never heard
a single person say a good thing about
get sub-modules don't use them they're
there apparently they're just a disaster
so clean up the get clean up the you
know clean up all these things that we
had over built in the name of failure
tolerance that had actually done nothing
for failure tolerance and just made it
much harder to deploy put in more
automation improve the process and
towards the end of this I said to the
team hey what do you folks think how
about we make it so that not only our
deploys easier but we do them every day
so again not continuous I knew that we
didn't quite have the freedom of
bandwidth to get all the way there at
this point but I also knew that if we
could do them every day that would make
a huge improvement in everyone's lives
and the team said sure if we can do that
no problem so they they fixed a few more
things they made it so that you could do
easy feature flagging and bada-bing they
made it so that you could dilute release
every day and didn't take too long and
that's all great and the impact on the
culture of that part of the team that
had to deploy the website was immediate
it was an immediate improvement in
culture yes
engineers like to ship they like to get
things done they like to be able to see
the results of their work quickly
particularly engineers at startups
that's why they're there they're at a
start-up so that they can move fast
right people want to be able to move
fast and that's really important but if
you have all of these technical problems
that keep them from moving fast that's
just like this drag on their souls it's
drag on their energy and the real lesson
that I took away from this you know why
is it that shipping quickly is a is a
big thing for people well it definitely
helps you learn faster it gives you
shorter feedback loops but it also makes
it so much easier for people to behave
autonomously so when you have to
coordinate to ship code even when you're
all on the same page even when you all
believe that you're doing the right
thing you're working on important things
you've got this unnecessarily resource
constraint you've got this unnecessary
bottleneck unnecessary dependency it
always goes this way I'm sure you've all
experienced this probably all right
we're cutting the build for the release
wait I've just I got one more thing
can I just gets one more thing in if you
just wait half an hour oh whoops
can you wait 1 to 15 more minutes oh I'm
sorry I broke the tests I'll just give
me a give me another hour while I fix
the tests are we ready yet are we ready
it's it's a constant sort of negotiation
for what should not be a constrained
resource right deploying code there's no
reason for deploying code to be a
constrained resource but when you create
it as a constrained resource what
happens well people start to have to
fight each other over this scarce
resource anytime you have a scarce
resource in an environment even when
everybody loves each other and everybody
believes everyone else is doing the
right thing and trying to get to the
same place you're gonna have friction
you're gonna have battles you're gonna
have contention so making it so that
people can deploy very easily removes
this as a constraint removes this as a
bottleneck and encourages autonomy the
team now what is your takeaway from this
besides yes you want to make it so that
people can deploy easily I hope that
everyone in this room cultivates
impatience when it comes
new processes or tools that are
unnecessarily slow right we've all been
this this cowboy waiting for the builds
right we've all been in that situation
where it's like why does this take so
long and the answer is maybe it takes so
long because you haven't yourself gone
and looked and seen is there anything I
can do to make it take less time right
this talk is not just for CTOs or
managers it's for everyone and I truly
believe that everyone can take part in
all of these things and as a non CTO or
a non manager right you have the
opportunity to live in the environment
where you can see these frictions you
can see the points that are making it
harder for you to deploy and build be
impatient and say something about them
okay so part two structure or not I
don't know people get really touchy
about structure so maybe I'm talking
about learning or transparency it's not
clear that structure is exactly the
right term for what I'm talking about
when you ask people about structure a
lot of people use words like slow or
unnecessary innovation crushing
bureaucratic which is unfortunate that's
what those are actual words that came
out of a survey of people from startups
that I read recently and that's I think
that's really unfortunate because that's
not really what structure is structure
is kind of neutral structure just is if
you want to scale you will create
structure if I gave you 50 thousand
lines of spaghetti code JavaScript in a
single file and I said do something to
this to make it so that multiple people
can work on this codebase you would
probably add structure of some sort to
it because structure is how you can more
easily consume things so you can more
easily scale things how you can more
easily understand them right there's
some rule that goes complex systems can
only be built from simple systems I
don't know if I agree with that rule
exactly but it's an interesting thing to
think about structure is just the
building up of simple systems into more
complex systems that naturally happens
as you scale as organizations grow as
software grows as code bases grow I
think of it as lower
the required activation energy to get
things done as a focusing element okay
but really structure causes us problems
when we just sort of arbitrarily apply
structure to things when you don't
understand why a structure is there and
it seems like a bad structure and you're
frustrated with it or upset with it
you're probably not gonna like that
structure right and that usually comes
from a lack of transparency so changes
in structure in a good organization come
from learning right there they're an
outgrowth of learning particularly in
cases of failure changes in structure in
maybe a bad organization or a less
healthy organization may come from
learning and some part of the
organization but they're really not
clearly articulated they're not
transparent to the rest of the company
so you know I like to think of structure
of best structure actually does come out
of learning from failure right this is
the Tacoma Narrows Bridge a structure
that famously failed yeah and it
famously failed after you know what 40
something days I believe because of wind
shear right they had designed this thing
and they had taken into account a whole
bunch of things but it fails so do you
think that they said let's just canoe
across this river let's just kayak it's
Pacific Northwest no big deal right no
of course they didn't they said oh well
we learned something big from that
failure we're gonna go and we're going
to create something that will withstand
that failure condition we're gonna
create a structure that's slightly more
complicated and that accounts for the
failure that we just learned about right
so structure comes about and evolves out
of failure so the story I want to tell
you very briefly about my experiences of
the culture is actually my experiences
in creating an engineering ladder so
many of you may have heard of or maybe
not Rent the Runway shared our
engineering ladder our engineering
career ladder so the levels that
engineers go through to get promoted on
various tracks we shared it publicly a
year ago and that structure came out of
multiple rounds of failure the first
round of failure was not having one at
all it's very common for small startups
not to have career titles and levels
which is good that's a good thing when
you are a small team and you're a focus
on the job and you're all basically
equals and it doesn't you're all sort of
generalists working on
problem it doesn't matter what your
title is but at some point you grow to a
certain size and that's really just not
the case anymore you are not actually a
group of the same type of people doing
exactly the same thing in a very focused
environment and if you're trying to hire
people let's say that you want to call
senior engineer as you're trying to hire
people that you want to call certain
kinds of managers or certain kinds of
specialists it helps to have some kind
of structure in which to pay those
people right this there's a kind of an
HR problem to be quite honest what will
happen if you don't have any kind of
structure is that you'll grow this team
with random titles maybe or maybe they
don't have random title so maybe they're
all called software engineer but I can
guarantee you that they are not all paid
exactly the same amount so we decided
okay this is a problem we need to have
levels in order to take care of this
really random pays that we have paying
that we have around the team and we
actually did have random titles so I
went away and I came up with this ladder
and this is just like a small example of
it here
it was very lightweight very low on
detail as you can see from this from
this small snippet of it and it was
great for solving the problem the
failure of people aren't in levels so we
can't pay them fail it fairly and it's
hard for us to recruit but it was a
really bad for the problem of people
want to know why they're at a level and
what they need to do to get to the next
level and what they need to do to be
successful in the level that they're in
so I tried to be ambiguous and not put a
lot of weight or whatever on the ladder
and what I ended up creating was stress
and uncertainty and unhappiness within
the team I may have solved an external
problem but I created an internal one
with this ambiguous non transparent way
of assigning people to levels so we
created something with a lot more detail
and I'm not gonna leave this up because
it's just too many words you're just
gonna read words I'm just gonna take
that up the screen but you can actually
find that online if you want to read
more about it what I learned what we did
is we went away and I went away not just
by myself but with the other senior
engineers the other engineering leaders
in the company and we took a bunch of
examples from other companies and we put
a lot of work into creating something
with a lot of detail
people could actually use to say this is
what it means to be at the level I'm at
and this is what it means to be at the
next level that we could actually drive
a lot more clarity around so structure
again I don't think that structure in
this particular example is good or good
or bad it is it is something that you
tend to need as you grow an engineering
team but you will fail at creating it if
you don't think about it in a
transparent way and you don't
acknowledge when you've failed at
creating it and you know iterate on your
process okay so what can you do what can
any of you and all of you do hopefully
you've heard this term learning review
it's the new it's the new term for
blameless postmortem hopefully you've
heard the term blameless postmortem if
you haven't heard that it's the old term
for learning review so learning reviews
when things fail when you have an outage
when something happens that doesn't go
the way you expected it to go right
hopefully everybody here has done a
blameless postmortem
which is a process where you go through
the incident you go through the timeline
of what happened and you try to
investigate and interrogate the reality
around what happened and figure out why
what contributed to that failure right
because most of us are working in
complex environments in very complex
systems we're not working in places
where there's one cause for a failure
almost almost any time is there not one
cause for a failure right like oh yes
that that operator fat-fingered
something that's usually not that might
be the most direct immediate cause for a
failure but then you can ask yourself
well why could they do that why should
they have access to that system why were
they so tired that they weren't paying
attention to what they were doing why
were they doing it alone why were they
doing at 3:00 a.m. all of these
different kinds of questions can lead
you to multiple causes for outages right
multiple causes for outages and usually
they cause you to understand structure
to understand the structure of what is
happening around the operating of your
systems this is a chance for you to
investigate interrogate change or
improve structure a more specific and
tangible example that I would also like
to like you all to consider is you
code review process how many people here
love their code review process
no one Wow I figured at least some of
you okay we got one over there great so
most companies nobody really loves the
way code reviews happen and I'm not
gonna stand here and claim that there is
like one true awesome code review
process but often when you don't love it
no one around you loves it and you could
actually probably get together and
interrogate what is wrong with the
process of our code reviews that all of
us feel like they're just not really
going the way we hope they would go
maybe they don't happen fast enough
maybe people use them to bully one
another over over style which I have
seen in a lot of companies right there's
just so many ways that code reviews can
be failing and sometimes the answer to
solving problems like that to solving
things that are not going so well
is actually to create technical
structure to remove people structure so
if people are bullying each other ever
style maybe you should put a linter in
that just automatically corrects a bunch
of the style thing so now you don't have
to have that conversation every time
someone checks something in and you're
like is this spaces or tabs where's the
semicolon what's going on with this so
this is again just something that you
can think about when you are working to
help your team get better help your team
in interrogate its structures okay good
this is going fast and I love it ok the
last big area that I want to talk about
so we talked about speed hopefully
everybody gets that one that's that's
obvious that's not to say it's easy it
actually takes a lot of work I think to
get that kind of thing in and to really
continue to grow it and make it work but
it's important everyone here can do
something with that I think you can also
start to think about an interrogate
structure and examine it and notice it
and evolve it the last thing that I had
to learn a lot about though was
relatedness so what is relatedness well
relatedness is that feeling of community
that you get when you when you like care
about your co-workers and you think
don't feel like they care about you you
know that sort of general feeling of
goodwill towards man and woman are the
people that you work with and I was an
individual I was an individual
contributor for a long time
as I said so I was really good at
sacrificing relatedness in the name of
efficiency so my days as an individual
contributor looked very much like this
get to work work for four hours go to
the gym for an hour work for four hours
and leave and I got a lot of work done
but I did not spend very much time chit
chatting I did not spend very much time
getting coffee getting lunch or hanging
out with my colleagues that was okay for
me when I was working on these small
teams where I could get to know people
just through the day-to-day course of
work and I didn't have to you know go to
great lengths to get to get to know my
immediate colleagues but as a manager
that was terrible
because I was ignoring getting to know
my team in favour of I don't know
there's not much more important as a
manager than getting to know and caring
about your team and having that
relatedness quotient with them so the
real reason that you care about
relatedness is because relatedness is a
core element of vulnerability this slide
so this slide has two parts on the left
you see this series of things this is
from a Google study so Google has been
studying what two great teams need and
they did a bunch of research and they
came up with these five things so we're
just gonna talk about number one which
is psychological safety right great
teams in fact all feel comfortable being
vulnerable in front of each other taking
risks in front of each other right so
here's the way the best way to think
about psychological safety is that if
you talk about things on the internet
that's like the least safe environment
to talk about things probably right like
you say something slightly dumb on
Twitter and then like a million people
jump down your throat or on hacker news
or on reddit or wherever it is that you
participate in public forums on the
Internet right we have trained ourselves
to look for any slight misunderstanding
or failing and jump down each other's
throats and that's the absolute opposite
of psychological safety right if you
want to be in a group that can really be
awesome and take risks in front of one
another you need to be able to say dumb
things occasionally and know that your
colleagues are gonna you know gently
nudge you perhaps in a
front direction okay the triangle here
on the right is actually the elements of
the five dysfunctions of a team which is
a very famous management D leadership
e-book it's actually like I'm pretty
good I enjoyed it and the very most
basic dysfunction is an absence of trust
right again an absence of trust this is
not the trust that says oh this person
who I have seen write a bunch of Java
code can write more Java code that is
not the trust we're talking about this
is the trust that says we are all in
this together we are all trying to do
our best even when we say something that
sounds crazy it's no one saying that
because they're trying to torpedo the
project or they're trying to you know
make you look bad they're saying that
because they have a reason for that that
they they believe something different
than you right if you don't have that
basic trust in good intentions if you
don't have that basic safety it's very
hard to build anything else on top of
that because you're always gonna be
worried about somebody misconstruing
your words misconstruing your actions
and you know frankly you're gonna be
worried about making mistakes and that's
a very hard world to live in this was my
big problem right when it came to
culture of fear I could do all kinds of
technical and structural things to
improve the world and I did but I had to
crack through this vulnerability and
this ability for people to be honest and
open in front of each other and in front
of me before I could really put that
culture to bed so what can you do well
guess what I'm gonna guess everybody in
this room has or will do a lot of
interviewing and the way that we tend to
approach interviewing the act of
interviewing another person as engineers
is the anti recipe for creating
relatedness right when you go into an
interview and you barely take the time
to introduce yourself and you say
alright listen so I need you to reverse
this string but you only have this
amount of bits to work with and you have
to do it in C++ and you just you set it
up so that you're grilling someone your
your whole goal is we only have a little
bit of time so I'm going to grill the
crap out of you in that little time we
have
you are setting up this person to feel
incredibly stressed out and really not
at all related to you right not at all
like oh this is a person who wants to
see me succeed no you're just in there
to judge them you're in there to judge
them you're new to see can they code or
not okay but let's think about that for
a moment because realistically yes you
want to know if they can code or not I
agree that's important but your best
colleagues are probably the people who
have this ability when they get to the
limits of their knowledge to ask good
questions and to collaborate with you
right when they don't understand
something they don't just shut down and
stop talking and don't ask questions
they actually probably ask questions go
go away do more research get a group
brainstorming together that's what you
want to find in an interview you want to
find someone's behavior at the limits of
their knowledge but to do that requires
vulnerability that person needs to be
able to feel like they can take a risk
in front of you that they can say I
don't know I don't understand can you
clarify this right and we can try to
push it on the interviewee to force them
to understand that oh this is part of
the game you should know that you're
supposed to ask questions in an
interview but it would be nice if we
also set ourselves up to interview
people from a standpoint of actually
trying to create a little bit real of
relatedness with them before we get to
this grilling part of the interview so
that they can be more open they can feel
safer to make mistakes in front of us
one of my good friends is a woman named
Kate Houston and she gives a great talk
on interviewing and she talks about a
lot of things in that but one of the
things that I took away most from her
talk is that she talks about how we
should think of ourselves the
interviewers and treat ourselves well if
we want to give good interviews part of
that is making sure we have enough time
making sure we've eaten we've gotten
something to drink we've gotten coffee
we've used the restroom before we go
into these interviews if you go into an
interview yourself feeling stressed
you're probably going to run that
interview as a stressed-out person and
stress out the person you're
interviewing even better you can take a
moment take a breath close your eyes and
think about somebody or somebody you
love or something you love your dog your
spouse your kids go look at cute
pictures of animals on the Internet
do something to put yourself in the
mindset of goodwill towards humanity
before you go meet this person to
interview them put yourself in that
relatedness mindset for that very first
meeting this is really I really think
that everybody can practice this and
this is a good opportunity so uh when I
left Rent the Runway this is my
going-away gift
it's a very large Fitness hammer it
weighs about 15 pounds unweighted
because my nickname was the hammer among
other nicknames no less even less
flattering not not not uh not obscene
just less flattering so why did I have
the nickname the hammer because I am the
kind of person who will come in and when
I think something is not going the way
it should be going I'm willing just put
the hammer down and say we're doing it
this way you know this discussion has
gone on for too long we need to move
forward so here's the direction we're
going right for better for worse it is a
characteristic that I that I that I have
and one reason that I feel good about
having left the team and much a better
culture than when I came in is that I
had to use the hammer a lot less towards
the end of my time than I did at the
very beginning of my time but that link
brings us to kind of the final brief
topic that I want to go into which is a
topic of conflict so as you can probably
guess someone with the nickname the
hammer is comfortable in conflict but
conflict is an important part of
creating actual healthy teams so a lot
of teams I would say that the number one
red flag that I see in engineering teams
these days is actually a fear of
conflict a lack of conflict is that
people are unwilling to have honest
conversations with one another and the
thing is that we all have different
perspectives and we all have different
different ideas and different views of
complex situations and we need conflict
to draw out as much of that data into
the open as possible that being said I
love conflict and maybe I'm a biased
observer so I have tried to move away
from conflict myself and I would advise
the manage
and leaders in the room to move a little
bit away from conflict more into the
vein of curiosity so you can still probe
differences of opinion without
necessarily making it into a shouting
match and in fact I would really
encourage you not to make it into a
shouting match that kind of conflict is
shuts people down you don't want to do
that right so instead of embracing
conflict as a battle think of it more as
oh you have a different perspective than
I do here's my perspective I'd love to
understand more about yours the more you
can approach differences of opinion with
a curious mindset the better but the
thing is I don't care which one of these
you do personally you have to do them
because too many of us are sitting
around in boring meetings and you should
not be sitting around in boring meetings
boring meetings are a sign that your
culture is not doing a good job
cultivating discussion curiosity or
conflict so here's you know here's a
quote about meetings and meeting exists
of a group of people who have little to
say until after the meeting if this
describes your meetings you have bad
meetings happening right because one in
the freaking world is the point of
getting all these people in the room
together if nobody feels comfortable
discussing the issues in that group and
you all wait until the meeting is
adjourned to actually discuss the issues
I think that sometimes we over script
our meetings we say meetings are bad and
therefore we want to make them super
short and the way to make them super
short is to over script them to make
sure they have this really tight agenda
and we curtail discussion and we curtail
debate okay I get it I don't want people
to waste a lot of time in meetings
either but gathering together of people
face-to-face is a really valuable thing
to do and it's a valuable way to gather
to bring the group together to get to
know each other it's a valuable way to
tease out nuance to tease out complexity
and to have real discussions and good
discussions are at the core of great
teams great teams are capable of
discussing fraught complex issues
together as a group and coming away with
resolutions so you know think about that
when you're sitting in boring meeting
upon boring meeting upon boring meeting
maybe you should be sitting in fewer
meetings or maybe your meetings need to
have more of your opinions in them maybe
you just need to ask more questions or
like you know engage a little more with
the actual concept of what's going on of
course no talk on fear rebooting culture
whatever this talk is about would be
would be complete without the important
final act of apology if you are a leader
or in any kind of position of power and
we probably all will be occasionally and
you screw up apologize I'm sorry I am
sorry that I yelled at you I am sorry
that I nitpicked your code and that was
you know I don't know what I was
thinking I am sorry that I fat-fingered
that command and accidentally brought
down the website for a while
guilts is actually okay to feel a little
bit guilty is not an unhealthy emotion
guilt is kind of like your conscious his
way of telling you maybe that's not the
awesomest thing that you just did right
there what you don't want to feel is
shame you don't want to feel that I am a
failure I am a screw-up it's okay to say
I failed and feel a little guilty about
it though but most importantly as a
leader when you fail and when you screw
up if you can apologize to people and
move on you are showing them what it
means to apologize and move on you are
showing them that it is safe to fail it
is safe to screw up and that yes we do
expect our leaders to apologize we
expect people to apologize when they
fail but that it's not the end of the
world right again this is about moving
away from a culture of fear so the big
big part of that is being able to admit
that you have failed being able to
apologize and being able to open up to
the team about that all right
so in conclusion long summary you can
look at or not but look you want to be
able to move fast you want to be able to
help people ship right you want to build
a culture of learning and transparency
and you are gonna have to think about
structure structure is part of our lives
but it's not it's not good or bad it
just is it's just a thing that's always
gonna be there so don't be afraid to
interrogate it open
practice relating to your colleagues as
humans right just that's really
important if you have a remote culture
practive IDEO conference they don't just
chat at each other right chat can be
even within the same office chat is this
disintermediated way of communication
try to talk to each other face-to-face
or visually as much as possible don't
waste your time in a place where you
can't ask questions don't waste your
time having lots and lots of meetings or
no meetings where you don't have real
discussion you need to be having
discussion if we are willing to stand
fully in our own shoes and never give up
on ourselves then we will be able to put
ourselves into the shoes of others and
never give up on them that is a quote by
Pema Chodron
and I leave you with the final concept
that empathy is a learnable skill and I
think the whole industry would be better
we would all have higher performing
teams if we all took a little time to
practice caring about one another as
humans empathizing with one another and
just you know work on this as much as
you work on your programming skills and
your life will be better and that is all
thank you very much
some resources
thanks very much that was awesome
we have time for a few questions about
nine eight minutes in fact so if you
have questions you can tap them in or
once I run out of questions here I'll
throw to the floor the first question is
during an interview what is a good way
to assess technical competence while
still focusing on relatedness yeah
so I do that mean I understand assessing
technical competence is what you are
there to do relatedness is merely in
many ways the mindset that you use going
in and the the sort of structuring so
introduce yourself to the candidate and
ask them how their day is going it
doesn't take a long time you don't have
to like go through their resume in
detail and ask them about their lives in
fact there are many things you should
not ask them including things like are
you married what's your religion there
there are you know HR violation
questions so be a little careful but you
want to express the time that you know
look at the person in the eye smile at
them shake their hand as you're doing
the technical assessment try to make it
clear if you expect them to fail that
it's okay like I really want you to ask
questions we want you to you know we
realize that this question has a lot of
challenges and a lot of unknowns in it
so if you have questions please feel
free to ask me I'm here for you think
about the way your body language is is
expressing itself right people see a lot
in body language if your body language
is this you're scowling and you're just
like you're impatient you're tapping
your foot you're playing with your phone
or looking at your computer and not
paying attention to what they're doing
that is a anti relatedness body language
right so give them the benefit of your
attention open body language as much as
you can just ask them briefly how
they're doing do you need anything do
you have any questions for me leave time
for those elements even though you
I know and I do understand that you have
to ask people technical questions that's
the point of the interview
okay so I'm just reloading here it's the
problem with not just asking people what
communication techniques or methods
would you recommend for managing
conflicts around technical decisions
within an organization so I think that
this is this conflicts around technical
decisions often lend themselves to a bit
of structure so having policies and
practices around how do we make
technical decisions here can often
remove a lot of the conflicts that
organizations face for example well okay
when we want to make a technical
decision we ask that people do a little
bit of work to pull together a case for
that technical decision if it's a big
change right you know explain why this
is the direction we should be going why
this is the language we should be using
what are the requirements that we think
are important for making certain
technical decisions and how can we then
present it to a group I think that that
is often like when you don't even have
any kind of sort of clear process about
what are the things that we care about
and how do we do how do we evaluate
these kinds of decisions and again it's
an ambiguous thing it's non transparent
process and you leave yourself open to
this weird you know battling back and
forth right you don't have transparency
about how you make decision so you get
into arguments now look I'm not gonna I
can't give you the like you know the the
easy answer for oh we have all of that
people just disagree I mean at some
point either the leader has to make a
choice or the people ideally the people
who will be responsible for using
running implementing that decision will
ultimately carry the heaviest load in
making the decision right so not just
sending decisions down from on high but
giving the people who will be most
impacted by the decision a large voice
in that decision I think is a really
really important part in negotiating
those kinds of conflicts deep how do you
promote a culture of trust when working
with team members who are afraid to say
no
uh.well so if your team members okay so
so some people are just not talking some
people just don't like again don't like
conflict right if you believe that your
team members want to say no but they're
just a little bit afraid there are there
are some things that you can try to work
on to tease their that that out of them
right so you know if you think that
they're just afraid to say no make it
clear that they can say no especially if
you're in a position of leadership
sometimes I think leaders forget that
their voice carries a huge amount of
weight so when they ask for something
people say yes right away even when they
don't have enough time I tried to make
it very clear a lot when I was asking
people to do things I was like you can
say no like I think this could be a good
thing to do but right now I'm just
drawing this out here as an idea that
you can say no to sometimes though you
know when people are afraid to say no
what you kind of need to do is ask them
like do you really have the time for
this do we really where does this fall
on the priority list and help them
articulate that oh actually like we
can't do everything so we are gonna need
to say no to some things how do we
figure out what to say yes to and what
to say no to again in a more structured
and transparent way so it doesn't feel
like you're just constantly being asked
say yes or say no you'll be penalized if
you say no and you have no structure to
judge your decisions or base your
decisions on okay we have a time for a
couple more questions from the floor
anyone want to ask a question from the
floor yeah one here and one here and
then that'll be it and please vote
before you leave if you haven't yet do I
need a leader at all sorry one more time
do we need a leader in any organization
can we have like a self managing self
organizing team and I think that you can
I think self-organizing teams work in a
very small scale when you have a group
of equals who are all like all have
basically the same skills you have a
very very focused task with a time limit
you probably don't need a leader in that
case in most other cases you inevitably
ten
if not a leader you need people assigned
to specific responsibilities right you
need structure of some sort now I look
I'm not an expert in self-organizing
teams my you know my general experience
is that most people don't actually want
the burden of having to take full and
total responsibility for every decision
they make and just leaders you know a
big part of the job of the leader is to
take responsibility for the failures and
give credit for the successes to the
team so it's kind of a it's kind of a
job that a lot of people really don't
want to do which is why I actually think
that leaders are kind of important for
most organizations but I recommend you
read the tyranny of structuralist nests
if you are interested in this topic it's
a great text on structure and has
nothing to do with engineering but it
has everything to do with structures of
organizations the tyranny of structure
lessness ok last question thanks for
taking this question I as you come from
a very highly technical background and
getting into leadership my question is
what learning you have that you could
share with some of us coming from a very
technical background to make sure that
as you grow as a leader you don't lose
sight of customer oriented culture thank
you yeah so when I when we think about
tools and technology from a leadership
perspective when we have a highly
technical leaders it gets into tools and
technology instead of solving a customer
problem and how would you inspire your
team to do that yeah so I think I do
think it is important to realize that as
you become a more senior leader
especially at at any company whatever
your background your job becomes less
and less of a specialist and much more
about what does that what do you need to
know and drive for the company to make
it successful so you kits very hard to
be a successful leader in a product
focused company so Rent the Runway right
we were building a product for customers
of consumer facing company
being great at technology was super
helpful in a lot of ways but if I didn't
understand and have some sense of what
was the what was actually valuable for
the business as a whole and for the
customer I would not have been a
successful leader in the team because
ultimately you know just the decision
between Java and Ruby or Java and Scala
is not was not going to be the
make-or-break decision for the growth of
the business so I do think that you know
as all of you grow as leaders depending
on the kind of team and the type of a
kind of company you're in and the kind
of roles you're in you know notice what
the new skills you need are and often
those new skills are not going to be
technical at all they're going to be
around appreciating the business that
you're working in the people that you're
working with your peers and other parts
of the organization and being able to
communicate with them and understanding
their values as well as you understand
engineering values so thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
