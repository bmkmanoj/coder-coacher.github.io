heard there was a max for the wind so I
had to do a film for victory I am
definitely not a vain expert I've been
using them for about two and a half to
three years I find that Venus is kind of
like medicine you you could actually
kill people if you do it wrong and
there's always there are always better
doctors than you so I'm gonna show
basically the reasons that I think film
is awesome first of all you couldn't get
this guy's diagram without vim as you
can see Emacs is very nice it's like
early but vim is always difficult no
matter what and there is there's there's
a joke that says how do you keep it keep
a student busy in the open fame and you
ask them to close it for four hours yep
and and it's true I remember that was
the first time I opened vim that was a
serious condition of what the hell am I
doing here
now the reason I started using vim is
because I I tried to get out of my
comfort zone and there's no better way
than getting out of your comfort zone
and to learn vim but I did it I actually
joined I became an intern at a ruby shop
I was a CTO I was working in dotnet and
I decided you know what I have to find
out what are all these people talking
about
and I went I became an intern in a ruby
shop there were six angry Russians
sitting on their MacBook Airs just
cursing of their computers all using vim
and I remember this joining and then one
of them just grudgingly just took my
laptop started setting up everything
I've never used the math before and they
and it was like the biggest if you've
ever jumped into a very very cold pool
and anyway I don't want to get graphic
here okay anyway anyway okay so the
reasons that I that I that I after six
months I really started liking some of
the vim stuff and one of the reasons was
does it's lightweight and I came from a
place where we would use Visual Studio
everything would take you know a minute
or two to start up and here there was
this thing that we just load up and very
very quickly edit things fortunately
unfortunately still doesn't work good
for dotnet stuff still have to use
Visual Studio but I'm using a vs
plug in for visual studio when I need to
work on that net stuff
the other cool thing is that it's
actually some of the editing stuff that
I always hate doing is really easy with
vim so there are something I'm going to
show you shortcuts first things that we
do all the time
they take maybe one half a second more
and that saves you a lot of minutes
during the day when you work on text but
it doesn't mean that I use them all the
time actually use vim sometimes and I
use other editors like IntelliJ etc for
for other things so it's it's a tool
when I need it for editing things well
what I find is an editor it's really
really nice another thing that we found
is that when we were doing remote coding
with other people we could just connect
via SSH and use screen and T Macs and
actually connect to the other people and
just open them and it would work because
it's all ascii-based basically it would
work so fast that you'd feel as if the
person is sitting next to you coding
there was no lag whatsoever there's no
graphics work to do and it was really
working very nicely and I found that
pair programming with SSH and Tmax in
vim was a very productive way to work
especially on Ruby projects I do think
it's an important skill sometimes in
your life you're gonna need to know VI
keyboard shortcuts as a simple example
you can actually use VI chord shortcuts
with Z shell and actually in the command
line you could edit your command lines
with the VI stuff with just correct
binding and I do think that it's
important to always feel stupid and to
and that's the only way that you learn
something is to feel completely
uncomfortable out of your zone and just
doing something where you say or one
part of your brain says I have no idea
what I'm doing here I just want to go
home and do the things that I really
like and I'll just let's go watch Game
of Thrones or something but the other
part says yeah this is good
you're hating this it means you're
learning something and I definitely
learned a lot sometimes you find out
things you didn't even know that you
didn't know so here's a short demo it's
not going to be the basically the huge
demos that you've seen before it's just
very very small things and I had to I
didn't even want to use code for this
because the editing is editing it
doesn't really matter
words are words and I had to
generate something so I used hipster
ipsum because I find that's a bit nicer
and just to make things a bit more
interesting I used Pokemon Epsom on the
second paragraph and I find that makes
editing nicer so the nice thing about
them to me some people don't like it is
that it has two modes and the first mode
is called command mode
I call it surgical strike mode and
basically you cannot write anything the
cursor is basically your target and
you're basically targeting specific
words or sentences etc and then you
decide what action to do on them for
example if I wanted to just delete the
current character that I'm in I would I
could do different things for example I
could just press X to cut it but I'm not
really editing anything and I just
pressed you to do undo if I wanted to
select the current word I would increase
the target size by saying V which is
selection mode in word i w and now the
whole word is selected and I always
hated being in the middle of a world and
trying to select the whole thing always
in all editors this sucks the only
company that ever helped me to do that
was the company that's built in Kelly J
and they also build resharper for visual
studio so it's a bit easier but it's
always been such a chore and now it's
very very easy to do so you have this VI
W sounds weird but you just go yeah W
like that and then you just do something
like I want to change this or I say C
for change and now I can actually start
typing I'm gonna press escape to go back
to command mode press you to do undo and
now I can continue for example now I can
say delete and then I can say the target
for example D and then word delete the
current word DW will delete the current
word okay that's very easy but I can
also be in the middle of a word and then
the targeting thing seems even more
interesting di w delete in word di W
works from the middle of the word as
well so it's very very little things
like that to say you know what that's it
just saved me a another half a second
here another half a second there
but when you get used to it you become
really really productive in editing for
example if I just wanted to delete the
current lines I go into what's called
selection mode so it's either V Force
characters or
shift v4 hole lines and then I can move
with the keys which are HJ K and L so I
don't have to move with the arrow keys
and then when I move the selection just
changes with me
there's also another type of selection
if I press control V I can select
vertically and then move things and now
I can press the same commands that I had
before like see for change and then do
something do and then say escape and all
the columns under me have also changed I
don't know if you saw that so that's
another very neat way to go for example
and say let's select everything here and
change and insert one Oh in the
beginning in space and press escape and
you got that that thing here it's very
very easy to do these kinds of things
when you have that surgical mode etc you
can also use numbers so I want to say
delete 10 words so I would say 3d W to
delete the next three words and I can
then press dot to just repeat the last
action that I did etc I can go down and
then do the same etcetera etcetera I can
press D D for deleting the whole line I
can press I can press different things
to get different results for example one
of the things that I like to do is I go
to a line I say I don't like this line
for whatever reason I would just go
either to the end or from the specific
place and just say you know what from
this point on I just want to start
changing I would just press shift C that
will start changing things and delete
everything from here on so it would be
just shift C and then I would just start
typing and that's a very common thing
that I always do now that's just the
basic editing syntax when you get to him
by by default it just does that stuff
but then it has hundreds and thousands
of plugins one of those plugins would
show you the current system of files
that you work on another one will help
you surround things automatically others
do highlighting so there is a hundreds
and hundreds of thousands of things that
just do million things and then they
give you shortcuts and of course you can
map everything to every shortcut and I
find that's just
a simple way to get around just to edit
the text stuff let's see if there is
anything that I missed yeah so those are
the basic things I find that you just
know these things that already saves you
a lot of time once you get into the
habit of getting from one end to the
other like with a it's always after but
shift a is the after the end of the line
once you get the hang of it and you
start to understand how him thinks you
can become pretty productive for example
you can see oh and oh but one of them is
actually smaller that's a another common
task you're in the line you want to add
the line just above so you would say
shift o to add the line above and then
start typing or a line below just oh and
then you start typing and that those are
things that we all do as programmers all
the time and I find that that's a very
very easy way to to do it now if you
want to learn vim
don't do this diagram this is a simpler
diagram of the three modes but there are
many ways there are many diagrams if you
google for vim modes you're gonna find
this one for example with all the
shortcuts there's this one that's kind
of like command mode and all the shifts
and all that stuff this is kind of nice
it shows you all the keys and of course
you can get it from the slides later but
they all have the URL and where you got
where I got them from so you you hang
this up on your wall and you just decide
to do five minutes of like vim kata
every day that you just start editing
some things and the first few days
they're just gonna be horrible and then
the next few days is just gonna be
really bad and then maybe after a couple
of weeks gonna be like ah well I just
dislike it little etc etc etc so you
know it's it's kind of like marriage
okay now if you want to configure them
what you do is that you have a dot VM
file or you can have a dot dream
directory which contains VM files and
then that's where you could put a lot of
scripts and plugins if you want to have
the same setup as I have I'm using the
Astral's dot VM on github which is a
very nice already set up with a lot of
plugins pre-configured it's really set
up for rails development but if you
google for vein Janice you're gonna find
that another very very good example of
another vim setup with a lot of plugins
pre-installed and then what you do is
you go through each plug-in and you read
the manuals and how and how to use it
but only do that once you have some
basic editing experience otherwise it's
gonna be it's just gonna be overwhelming
so I find you just taking these small
doses it might just work my favorite
plugins are to use the nerd tree which
is the tree that you saw with the files
there's fuzzy finding which for example
if I'm if I have a whole file system
here and I want to go and find a
specific file I can just click a special
key that shows me all the files I can
say just give me everything with Travis
in it and it will immediately jump to
that file I don't have to be inside the
tree to do it just everything with XML
it will find that file etc so it's
called fuzzy find you can just type in
the few first few words it's like finder
within vim if you are using them in
other indie shell for example you set
the bind key - V and then you can have
cool things like this if I'm gonna open
a new Z shell here and resume type this
is something and I press escape to go
back into command mode and by default
now I can press B to go back a word and
I can press W to go in and I guess a
shift C to change from the current word
and just start typing press escape again
press 0 to go to the beginning of the
line press shift C again to change it
etc so I can actually do all that all
that stuff from within my command line
and command lines are as someone who's
not like a command line at
spirt this is really helpful to me
because I always mess up my command
lines I'm sure that's only me so if you
are working in Visual Studio vs film is
a very nice free plugin for visual
studio if you're working in word you can
have VI commands for word and if you're
working in Firefox or Chrome you have
plugins for that as well where you can
actually hit a key and get and see the
numbers of all the links and then click
just type the number of the link you
want to navigate to it's it's pretty
cool I tried it didn't work for me but
you might have other notions of success
and that's it basically thank you very
much appreciate your time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
