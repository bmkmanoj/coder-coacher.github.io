been here I used to work for cable and
wireless and i absolutely love coming
back all the time when i get a chance
it's a great thing so thank you for
having me so real quick I want to
actually kind of understand the audience
if you could help me out a little bit
who here actually feels like your major
discipline that you work on every day as
security raise your hands okay cool cool
how about operations few more all right
development awesome devops ok turn it
cool cool cool this helps a lot ok fine
management yay all right so if you like
this presentation please rank it so Who
am I I have been in this industry for
well over 25 years I started out as a
kid basically in the industry I was in
banking was my first job I got a work
permit in states and basically showed up
and was a security analyst and what I
found out very quickly was computers
worked in mysterious ways and so I
started out life kind of interesting
right I've actually worked on many of
the big breaches out there cable &amp;amp;
wireless was a company that had a few
things out there say data centers and
you know telco equipment and all kinds
of ways for hackers to take advantage of
the equipment there and i also have done
things like development I've gone out
and worked with startups I've worked
with large organizations and I currently
run our dev spec ops team it into it and
it's around 12 people they've gone
through some really interesting
experiments I'm not good with carbon
based lifeforms I will admit I may be
one but I'm not very good with them
so people actually gave me folks to
manage and said go ahead try it out
you've got this DevOps thing we'll spend
a year trying to figure out what we're
going to do with it and how it works and
oh by the way at the same time you're
doing that can you go to the cloud with
sensitive data and so really that's what
I do right now is I actually figure out
how to make DevOps work for sensitive
data in the cloud all right disclaimer
you may find out things during this talk
that are very difficult to understand
that are going to be hard to hear the
truth sometimes it's difficult to bear
but what when it comes down to it if you
are a manager you actually want to hear
about the truth more often than not if
you're a developer you probably are
going to really like what I have to say
because it's geared towards you so I'm
really excited to have this opportunity
to talk to you all right so why is
rugged important and so you know when I
think about working on dev psych ops one
of the things that I learned a long time
ago and it was about 15 years ago was
that I was always the person who was on
call I actually grew up where there
weren't a lot of women in the industry
and when it came down to it I was the
person who got the 3am call because it
was kind of fun to get the girl out of
bed at 3am to go take care of the large
breach because she wasn't going to know
who to call it was going to be really
difficult and just fun to watch so I was
fun to watch and so when it came down to
it I actually started learning some
things very quickly there was a huge
need for a case for change waterfall was
happening I went through night after
night of incidents and outages and
trying to figure out what the difference
was and going through people's code line
by line finding out that people didn't
do very nice things in their code and
really shouldn't have been allowed to
actually push the buttons anymore so
obviously I kind of got a little grumpy
and so I started doing things like
security testing there
and before the three I'm call they would
get a midnight call to say oh by the way
your code is busted could you please
wake up and fix it so there was a love
hate relationship that started brewing
and very quickly I said well I'm really
tired of waking up to fix your breeches
could you fix your code so that we don't
have those and what God invented right
then and there was really this notion of
rugged developers who wanted to come
work with me more often than not because
I would actually work to test their code
to find things that were security
related and so I became valuable very
quickly I thought that was kind of cool
because I stopped getting the 3am phone
calls I started getting more
participation and then as I went from
organization to organization I sort of
had the same mantra over and over and so
that was sort of the you know invitation
to being rugged over time I have
developed code pretty much in darn near
every language because at 3am you stop
worrying about whether it's Java C++ or
whatever you got to fix it you got to
get the customers back online it doesn't
matter that your security person because
who cares if it's a code outage it's a
code outage and so all those lines all
those all those things that were
barriers to try and make the customer
experience better actually went away so
you can imagine that really for me this
became a way of life so my peers however
started to invent these really long
documents 300 plus pages I'm sure all of
you have seen these you probably have
been handed a huge stack of paper you
know 300 plus pages please make your
application secure come back in the
informants and I'll sign off anybody
heard that before yeah yeah yeah by the
way I have to I have written tons of
applications myself I've gotten my
team's to write them and I got tired of
getting handed the 300-page document to
try and make my code secure so that it
could operate properly
and so what I actually did is I started
to do things like scripting the 300-page
document and actually turning out an
answer instead of having somebody review
it it actually approved itself so I
invalidated the need for the person who
was going to sign the approval it was
kind of my take on it the other thing
that was not helpful was having to go
through the process that looks like this
where you show up with your code you
want to get it to production your
customers unhappy they really want their
feature and the sea so has this whole
laundry list of things that have to
happen before an approval takes place
and you can imagine that this is really
frustrating because I know it's really
frustrating it's even frustrating for me
running in a very DevOps world now to
see things like this happen which leads
me to this by the way I actually have
this sign in my office and I constantly
use it every day and it really helps to
get my message across you know I hate
making developers lives miserable in
fact one of the things that I've asked
my team to do is to make it so that
every developer who walks through the
door wants to actually stand hang out to
do red teaming so that they can learn
how to make their code more resilient
more rugged and more easily maintained
over time so my question to everyone in
the room is why wouldn't you ask your
security team to operate like this in
fact why wouldn't you demand it this is
such a critical part of the culture
change for DevOps you all actually get
the opportunity to make this change
happen you get to request better
security better ways of operating and
really it starts out with developers
requesting a better model our team
created this model out of sheer
necessity we started out as DevOps one
of the things that I've long heard is
that embedding is the way to go and so
I actually took that experiment
personally and I said all right let's
try this embedded thing oh I'm game I'm
willing to do it we have 3000 developers
and 12 security ish people and so if you
have 3000 developers in DevOps around 5
to 600 teams 12 people five 600 teams
it's a lot of work for everybody every
day it means that we're causing things
to go slow it means that we're not
providing the best value it looks like
approvals and exceptions and
consultations and one of our favorite
things to do meetings I actually started
to really question that and the value it
created for our teams one of the things
that came up in trying to put this to
paper was how do we take 12 people who
all do different things and make them
useful by putting them embedded into a
dev ops team so instead of the 500 to
600 projects basically we went down to
12 to 24 we realized very quickly we
actually had to cover 36 to do anything
of business value so that meant that
three projects per person had to be
handled at any given time and what we
discovered through this model is that
the context switching was really tough
for a security person they needed to
write write code and they didn't know
how they knew these things that were
paper documents and they knew how to
actually transcribe it for somebody but
that caused a lot of slowness because
when you come with a 300-page spec
obviously that's going to be really
DevOps friendly right no and so we got
to the point where we realize well we're
security people we need to do things
different and we need to provide value
and so we discovered very quickly that
we also had a hive mind in the 12 people
that's sitting at the table and actually
producing value was the most important
thing we could do for our company and
creating self-service tools and actually
thinking about automation and getting to
the point where we could do compliance
operations so you got real-time feeds
into the dev teams as a compliance
enforcement officer it was such a big
change for our team but we discovered
embedded didn't work we pulled back and
said all right so how do we run a
central function which always hated for
DevOps everybody wants embedded but I
will tell you there is a way to operate
so that you can have a very hybrid mode
your security team can do things like
code produce self-service tools and ap
is and so there is a way to actually do
this so the problem statement was very
very clear we had to run DevOps style
security easy right oh by the way we had
to scale that was a huge piece of the
puzzle most of the security team doesn't
actually deal with carbon based
lifeforms very well like me which is why
they're managed by somebody who doesn't
do that well because that's the best way
to get the most productivity out of
people is to give them all the same kind
of culture right and so when I think
about how we got here what the five
things were that were so important they
started to line up and they lined up
again back to be rugged we started
realizing wow wait we came from being
rugged we're starting to go towards
being rugged why not just be rugged and
oh by the way that didn't mean just the
security team becomes rugged it meant we
were expecting people to come to us that
were already pre rugged they were
already becoming dev ops teams who could
actually have a security discussion who
could quickly walk through the issues
and figure things out in near real time
and the discussions turn to something
like this Vera code recently gave this
discussion out at RSA and it was really
well received actually it is about the
cloud it's about software-defined
environments what's great about
software-defined environments is that
security now gets baked in as code which
means it puts the power back into the
development community to start making
these choices in real time with the code
our clothes that need to change and
basically it oh wow did I just hit the
dirt sorry am I going forward or back
thank you I must have happy so Verica
gave this discussion during the RSA
conference and what was really amazing
about it was this discussion about how
to do this work and not make it part of
the workload for the developer but to
actually start to produce information
that could make it so developers could
make choices and one of the reasons I
really liked it was aight aight rouille
believe that developers need to take on
some of the security context need to
make choices need to actually learn and
experiment with security so that things
can get anti fragile so that you can get
to the point where your workloads
actually operate without attackers
starting to take advantage of them and
so what was really great about this
discussion was that there are now
security people who are starting to
figure out how to write code in the
clouds software-defined environments
move quickly do DevOps and start to
understand what it means to have a
conversation with somebody who's doing
these things but more importantly what
came out of this discussion was even
more incredible and it was something
that we're actually participating in
which is we stopped having theoretical
conversations we're not trying to put
everybody through threat modeling we are
starting to ask you to think about
things like adding an attacks markdown
file to your code base as part of your
documentation so that it becomes part of
your living workload and we're also
adding things like red teaming so we
have something we call red team Monday
and instead of making somebody have to
understand all of this magic and
information we Red Team the workloads
that are in our environment every Monday
and that means that we pen test them we
hack them like we are external attackers
we do every
of black box testing white box testing
anything we can get well social engineer
and so what's really good about that is
now you actually have the adversary
that's internal to your organization
that's helping you to get your workloads
ready so that they can be in the in the
outside world in some cases they already
are in the outside world and so trying
to put your workload through a testing
environment in a way that could achieve
scale doesn't necessarily happen so
wouldn't it be a lot better if somebody
could start to do recon like an attacker
and be able to publish your publish
information about your workloads so that
you can make the changes in real time
that's what this is about so the big
question in our mind was how do we
return value to the organization as
security people well we figured out we
really need to do DevOps to we can't
just say okay DevOps teams you need to
do security we need to understand it
ourselves and so instead of trying to
preach and tell all these stories we
started to realize that we were failing
to communicate without understanding the
problem by not just adopting it
ourselves so now the 12 people who work
for me actually write code all day long
they check in multiple times per day
they have all of their stuff integrated
into the cloud we run solely all of our
security workloads in AWS and what's
great about that is we get to see every
bit of a software-defined environment
right security of code ourselves
understand the frailties become experts
in it and provide that information back
to anybody who will listen inside of our
organization and the other thing that I
wanted to bring up on this slide too was
we also kind of got to the point where
we realize that our communication was a
critical factor in trying to help people
to be more rugged with how they thought
about things we started to do this
notion of grading so everybody's gone to
school we all get
grades for how we've done in school we
take our tests we get an A through an F
it's a pretty universal language and
instead of getting a you know sev five
vulnerability or a p0 or whatnot we've
actually started communicating with just
letter grades your workload is failing
your workload is getting an A it's very
easy to understand and when you do it in
real time it becomes really powerful
because somebody can just track their
grades they can see how their GPA is
doing over time and it's just a
different way of thinking about things
but we realized that if we could
translate it to something that's simple
as security people we could actually
help everybody who's trying to become
better at writing code and you know
returning value to the customer without
trying to provide more overhead and
getting them to understand security at
the level of detail that we already do
so this is kind of the pitch area of my
slide deck I would tell you that one of
the things that would be really helpful
is to have every developer go back to
their security organization and say why
not do dev Chekhov's why not do rugged
why not do something that's going to
start to change how you operate because
it's such a critical piece of the puzzle
really app sex should be part of the
development process you should have
tools at your disposal like gauntlet
like all of the scanners that a security
person runs against your workload why
aren't you getting the information to
make changes and so if you think about
it sometimes development reports you
know come out and you actually get the
information you need to make a change
like QA reports right but security
reports are often held tight to the vest
god forbid you know where all the
vulnerabilities are in the whole
business I mean after all why would we
entrust that information to anyone and
that's kind of the thought process of a
security person but truly that needs to
change it needs to get to the point
where you need to demand that
information to make your workload safer
and so
it's actually upon everyone to start to
figure out how do we make security
everyone's responsibility in the
organization and how do you play the
part of a security person in the
organization the other things that have
gotten added as a result of trying to
make security part of DevOps has been
how do we actually turn security and
code so not every platform has all of
the code that it needs to become more
secure so things like secure components
validation components something that
needs to be imported into your workload
and I use workload is sort of a full
stack implementation and includes your
infrastructure as code it includes your
security as code it includes your
application and everything that actually
supports a full stack implementation and
so all of these things that are being
added are actually part of that process
curity engineering is really just knew
in the way that we're framing it because
we're actually asking our security
engineers to start writing code they
have to put out things like cloud
formation templates or security group
templates and cloud formation and that's
been a big change compliance operations
is sort of new as well instead of
getting a 300-page document you actually
now get information to include in your
workloads you may get tests to put into
your testing agents you may actually get
as part of compliance operations tickets
hate to say it but that's sort of the
evolution is you got to go from paper to
tickets before you can actually get to
full code and then if I think about the
other thing that's actually been
relatively new at security science when
you start to move your workload into a
software-defined environment to support
DevOps instrumentation is absolutely
critical you have to have the ability to
have more visibility in your workload so
that you know when something's failing
which means wouldn't it be great if the
red team hack do you want to Monday and
by Monday night you've already fixed
what they found so that it can't get
reported up to the board or whoever is
at the executive level of your company
you really
want sort of that feeling towards how
you're actually implementing your code
and especially with DevOps so if I think
about the journey here one of the things
that I've I've been thinking about is
how do we programa ties this process
right DevOps and security really haven't
been mashed together very well yet there
isn't a lot of information out there
this has been again sheer necessity
we've been experimenting with it in fact
over the last couple of years I've been
going out to talk to people to learn
more because every time I give this talk
I learn more from everybody in the
audience I learned from your questions
and then we go out and we try those
things that we've constantly been
creating the learning environment that
even a developer has in dev ops so a
security person we are trained we are
trainable I hate to say it but we really
are it takes a little bit to get through
to us we're a little bit hard to
understand and figure out but ultimately
I think when your hearts in the right
place as a security professional and
you're trying to figure out how to
support DevOps it can be done it's just
no one else has actually written it down
there's nothing out there honestly the
closest we've gotten to it has been
rugged and trying to really understand
how we bring more of this information to
the community has been top of mind so
when we think about application security
what I would tell you is I have our team
actually turn our scanners around so you
get to go and run an API to run a
scanner against your work load your code
as part of your continuous integration
and continuous deployment process and
that's great because it means that the
information is not just coming to us as
a security team it's actually going to
you as a development team or your
operations part of your team and you're
able to actually assimilate that
information make decisions about it and
render your workload less vulnerable or
we actually have the cleanup process
which is
is every Monday we actually set our
sights on that same information so we
share it with you basically and we use
it to figure out what could an attacker
do with this information if they had it
so as an example when a scan runs on
your web application and it's vulnerable
to a struts attack why not have a
counterpart in the organization like a
security team who can actually exploit
that struts vulnerability before an
attacker does that helps to take the
theory out of the conversation and it
really changes how everybody gets to
communicate and it gives you the
environment with a security professional
that allows you to make the choices that
are necessary to help your business I
think one of the things that actually
also came up for us was a total failure
getting people to walk in and get an
approval for understanding risk at a
context level has always been a dismal
failure for security people in fact i
would tell you all of my career has been
about how do you have a security
conversation and how do you change the
landscape for it how do you get the
right information to the right people at
the right time to make choices that are
going to help and make a difference
without impacting everything about that
business at the same time so red teaming
has been knew I would say it's actually
not for the faint of heart this is
really very different so if you can
imagine every Monday my team sits in a
room hacker style with a bunch of
metasploit and you know the whole music
thing and it really looks like a bunch
of hackers and even got like you know
their hoodies and everything because
they got to play the part we actually
even have call signs now so we kind of
have fun right I mean we've got a
Hollywood hacker and he got the name
Hollywood because he's got like four
panes and he takes over multiple boxes
at the same time it's kind of cool too
because they have a little bit of fun
with it they actually use captivate and
do demo videos so not only do
get information about how something got
broken into but you could actually watch
the video and learn how it happened so
we kind of have a little bit of fun with
this and I think that one of the best
things about into it that I love the
most is the willingness to experiment
and change and learn is really built
into our culture I would also say one of
the other really interesting things is
scoring has become part of the fabric of
how we operate as a team we have a a
scoring capability it's all built on a
through f it's basically you know the
setup tests you try to actually figure
out how something is vulnerable instead
of trying to relate it to some security
matrix we relate it to something very
simple and say hey so did the intern
break in or was it Holly with hacker if
it was the intern that's probably a p0
and if it was Hollywood hacker it's
probably a p4 and so we kind of do some
of that and then we actually know okay
well this is an F and that's like a sea
and people know how to make choices
based on that information alone instead
of having to have us call you up set up
meetings you're able to actually operate
and make choices so compliance
operations I think has been one of the
most revolutionary pieces of this puzzle
really taking away the documents and
trying to just simply get down to guard
rails guidelines principles information
you can pull in we run all of our
security now out of github everything is
a markdown file you can do a pull
request against it you can actually
change how things are operating and
what's actually really great about that
is now the security team knows how to do
get and they understand where
information goes and they actually now
are checking things in and trying to
figure out what does this look like if I
have to scale it so instead of just
giving you paper documents they go from
paper documents and to get and from
there how do I actually turn that into
scripts and change how things are
happening and I think that that's really
been a big change for our team is that
compliance now happens after you publish
your code you actually get information
right away you get tickets you get a
flood of tickets and all of a sudden oh
wait hold on my workload doesn't work
it's not compliant and therefore it
probably may have issues and I'm going
to find out on red team Monday so I'd
rather go fix some of these issues that
I have the ability to do that as a
developer Blue team so you can't have a
red team without a blue team I learned
that very quickly and it was a ultimate
failure for myself was to just set up
the red team I realized very quickly
that the red team goes out and does
stuff like an attacker but a blue team
is really really really important and
the reason why is that they're the folks
that actually write the rules to
discover the patterns that the red team
actually creates so that the next time
we see it we can actually respond to it
quicker and so when I first set up the
red team I didn't really set up a blue
team to begin with because I realized no
I'd rather try and figure out if this
red thing red team thing is going to
work how many people am I going to piss
off in our organization first and then
figure out whether the blue team is
useful and what I discovered from
talking to the folks on the team is
actually we needed to do both and so we
enlisted our team to do it and then
realize we didn't have enough people to
do blue team so we enlisted more and
actually at a certain point we got to
the point where we realize everybody was
a blue team member the organization now
has the ability to come over and write
searches and write rules and check those
into the code repository for the
monitoring platform and so now your
entire code base gets published in to
get and it becomes basically a living
part of the environment so data is
critical this is something that my team
built
and we run all of our stuff in AWS like
I mentioned earlier we have s3 we have a
variety of big data workloads we're
running EMR right now we actually killed
our splunk implementation because it got
too big we have 1400 accounts we used
accounts as containers in AWS we spend a
lot of time instrumenting the accounts
so we take in as much data as we
possibly can from the instance from the
application from AWS if we could force a
their BS to give us more data we will
and so we just taken a ton of
information and then when we read team
we instantly have information to write
rules against so we leverage every bit
of the same environment we're trying to
protect to try and understand more about
it and so this actually builds up skills
for your security team if your security
team is not actually developing code
they're not running in AWS they're not
running in some other cloud environment
they're not running VMS or docker
containers they don't have the context
and that's something we learned and we
learned the hard way we learned as
security people walking into a room
theorizing and being told no and that we
were a terrible team to work with and
banging our heads against the wall going
how do I actually fix this and then
realizing hmm okay why don't we just try
and go code and coding for security
people is really ugly don't do it don't
do it right away in fact i would tell
you some of the devs in this room
probably have a better opportunity to
learn how to be full stack engineers
faster than security people we ran that
experiment discovered that a developer
has the ability to be five times fast or
becoming a full stack engineer than a
actual security person which is really
cool it means the security person has to
learn how to code and that takes a lot
longer than teaching a developer how to
understand how to make security happen
and change how security gets remediated
and the other thing we actually learned
from this platform was also pretty
unique we learned that our workloads are
actually vulnerable every ten days we
gave that information to our community
we learned that the best password was 11
characters except for on Red Team monday
when the red team didn't care about
cracking the password they just stole it
so that was sort of a well we did all
this infant interesting information and
calculated exactly what we needed and
the red team went in and found some hole
that caused it so that we could actually
just get the password anyways and so
that you know you learn from those
things you learn from the failures and
you learn from the successes just alike
so you know I think what I love about
our journey has been just simply
understanding what it is we're trying to
achieve and experiment with it so you
heard about hypothesis driven
development earlier from Adrian and that
just spoke to me because we actually do
something called incident driven
development which is exactly the same
thing hypothesis has to get created an
experiment needs to get run and a
security person needs to be trained to
do those things so here's some emerging
statistics and things to know about dev
psych ops and rugged and really coming
together with these concepts when I
started doing this there were only I
think I was the first one who actually
put dev psych ops on my LinkedIn profile
because I was just crazy enough to do it
and so far there's 36 people and we're
trying to build up more momentum in the
industry we're actually going out and
actively talking to folks about this
what's also great is we've seen other
things emerge so stuck DevOps started to
have subtraction we're starting to see
DevOps sec have some traction I'm not
sure that I care what you call it at
this point what I would tell you is that
security has to become part
of what you do every day so that we can
get ahead of attackers and in my mission
in life is to make it so infeasible for
attackers to do anything with the
workloads that are out there that it
becomes a non-business and I think that
that's actually what's going to change
how we move forward with more technology
so that our children can actually take
advantage of it in the future so thank
you everybody so much I really
appreciate your time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
