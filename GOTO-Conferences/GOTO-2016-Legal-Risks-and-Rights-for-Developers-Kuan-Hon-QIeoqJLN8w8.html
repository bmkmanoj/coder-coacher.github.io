talk freely to try and raise awareness
of some major issues that are going to
affect you personally as developers and
also your organization's so they've
asked me to put this rate the session so
here it is right after an introduction
I'm going to be talking about mainly
intellectual property that's what I've
been asked to talk about I'm going to
talk a bit about data protection as well
if there is time I don't know whether
there's going to be time for questions
but I'm around later on or tomorrow so
by way of introduction this is me for
hats 5 clouds and two weasels I have two
hats in the sense that i've got degrees
in both computing science and law I've
got two other hats in that I am both an
academic and a practitioner so with my
practitioner hat I've worked on several
cloud law projects including being the
lead author of eight chapters of this
cloud computing law book and with my
practitioner hat I have advised clients
who are both cloud providers and cloud
customers on legal issues to do with
cloud computing so you're going to hear
quite a lot about cloud computing the
two weasels are that first this is just
general information not legal advice and
secondly where I say represents my own
opinions and not necessarily any
organization with whom I'm associated
and here is the musical version of my
disclaimer for Elvis fans but only sing
this in the shower because if it's a
public performance you risk infringing
copyright in the music as we're talking
about intellectual property rights so
laws are simply rules that the state
will back and they're staples in force
so it can come from legislation Acts of
Parliament here what judges say and of
course enforcement system will include
courts regulators so you can be jailed
you could be fined etc and a contract is
just an agreement between parties who's
going to do what what happens if they
don't etc that the state will enforce
and of course because it's an agreement
that the state will enforce their
situations where the state will not
enforce a contract so certain
price will be completely invalid because
the state doesn't recognize them or
certain parts certain terms of contracts
may be invalid or unenforceable for
example laws to protect consumers
against unfair terms so intellectual
property intellectual property is
intangible property property you cannot
it's not physical properties property
you cannot touch and obviously it's
state-backed it's right to control or
monopolize the use of information that's
all it is and of course the most
well-known will be things like copyright
as in source code and patents inventions
which is possible for some kinds of
software I do want to say something
about data ownership because keep people
always keep saying you know owning your
data do you own your data who owns your
data that is a fallacy ownership
remember like any other law it's a
state-backed concept and that applies to
physical property as well as
intellectual property if the state
passes the law saying they're going to
expropriate your house then they will
own your housing you won't it's it's a
state-backed concept ownership so really
with data it's more about control and
yes you can control data through
intellectual property rights like
copyright based on the limits of the law
but there are also other laws like the
laws on data protection which enable
control of data but there's not the same
thing as ownership and of course legal
control is not the same as practical
control it often is overlaps but it's
not necessarily the same thing so with
software basically you create software
you might exploit it and use it or other
people use your software so the key
issues with intellectual property rights
what are those rights how do you get
them do you have to register or file to
get a right I mean with copyright in
most cases you don't actually get
copyright until it's whatever it is is
recorded when will the right expire how
can you transfer or license then what
are you allowed to do or not allowed to
do what are other people allowed to do
or not allowed to do what's restricted
what constitutes infringement for
example of copyright and what are the
exception
even if you've got a right like
copyright other people are allowed to do
stuff anyway like in the US fair use or
in the UK fair dealing which is a lot
narrower and I emphasize that it depends
a lot on which countries laws you're
talking about different jurisdictions
have different laws some of them might
be broadly similar because of
international treaties but a lot of them
the detail is going to be different and
of course the devil is in the detail and
with so many countries it is just and
talking about digital data and the
internet is actually pretty difficult to
reconcile all these laws and to work out
which on supply and and what's happening
under which law so the main thing of
course I want to focus about focus on is
creating software so you will of course
have your source code you might have
other content like in games you might
incorporate graphics music etc if you
create software what is the ownership
situation with source code it's usually
copyright or patent inventions that
apply and different countries as i
mentioned have different rules so for
example software patterns are much
easier to get in the US than here
interestingly last week there was a case
in the US which actually seems to be
reversing the trend and not allowing
software patents in quite so many cases
as before it's kind of interesting
because traditionally a lot of us courts
have been very much in favor of software
patents so I just wanted to ask um who
is an employee working for your
organization okay so most of you anybody
who is a consultant or contractor so a
few of you okay right well oh so let me
ask you with this question you write
code who owns the copyright do you think
who thinks you are in the copyright um
who thinks whoever hired or engaged you
owns the copyright okay so most of you
and who thinks it depends a few of you
okay so most most think it's whoever
hired or engaged you okay and supposing
you work on a side project in your spare
time so who owns the copyright in the
code who thinks is you who
copyright okay not many people okay who
thinks this is yan your employer who
owns the code nobody okay and whose it
thinks it depends quite a lot of you
okay well in law it depends you know it
is so much that's why lawyers always
keep saying it depends because it does
depend on the interpretation and the
context and the probabilities and which
country is involved you cannot just
treat a situation in isolation you have
to actually look at everything and
that's why it depends and that's one
reason why lawyers and technologists
that notice have quite different
mindsets technologies to tend to think
in binary in ones and zeros in black and
white and lawyers tend to think in
shades of grey and that you know there
is a real good reason for that so the
answers it depends are you an employee
or a contractor in most countries
probably virtually all if you're an
employee then everything that you the
code you create in the course of your
employment belongs to your employer in
terms of copyright and even if it's in
your spare time even is on your own
equipment at least in this country it
could belong to your employer unless the
contract says otherwise if you're a
contractor actually you own the code
even if somebody paid you lots of money
to write the code for them you own it
unless the contract says that they own
it and assigns the copyright to them so
it does depend and in different
countries is different as I say in some
countries whose resources you use to
write the code can make a difference so
if it really does depend there was a
case where a games developer had his own
ideas before he joined a company as an
employee he pitched his ideas that that
got developed to some extent he tried to
say that it was his copyright in the
game not his employer and the contract
said you are there was an own time
exception if you did inventions in your
own time then you own it but it didn't
say anything about copyright inventions
are about patterns and therefore
actually because it carved
out patterns but not copyright he didn't
own it so the contract makes a big
difference and the timing is really
important obviously if you're going to
start a new job check the contract
before you sign and go into the job
otherwise it might be too late and you
might be stuck with it and similarly if
your company that's hiring a contract
and make sure you've got the contract
right before you actually hire them and
start the job and the situation can be
complicated with collaborations and
joint ownership as well who owns what if
you're actually working together no time
to talk about that now but this just
gives you a flavor that it can be quite
complicated and depends on all sorts of
things including things you might not
expect necessarily so the other side of
the coin what are the risks if you are
creating software and of course one of
the major elements is if you're using
other people's code and it's copyright
to them what happens one major warning
is just because code is publicly
available doesn't mean it's not
copyright it's not the same thing and of
course you might be using open source
code but there are complications there
as well if you're combining open source
code with your own code and cloud is an
interesting example where some companies
took open source code and they said and
they modified it and then they offered
it as a service in the cloud and they
said well we're not modifying sorry
we're not distributing it so therefore
we don't actually have to contribute our
modifications back to community and the
ephir o license was trying to get around
lad but it doesn't quite work but you
know that that's the attempt and it
shows some of the issues that can arise
even api's can be copyright there was a
case here in the EU a few years ago
which wasn't on api's but is taken by
most people to mean that actually you
cannot copyright AP eyes but in the u.s.
it's a different matter I'm sure some of
you have heard of the famous case of
google and Oracle which was about
google's use of java api sin android and
oracle one in the sense that the court
the appeals court said yes you can
copyright AP is the lower court the
judge before them had actually said you
can't and that guy had actually
some programming experience and you said
you can't copyright AP ice but
unfortunately it went up to the appeals
court the appeals court said yes you can
copyright AP is the Supreme Court
refused to hear the case so we kind of
stuck in the US with yes you can
copyright AP is therefore what Google
did will say well okay even if its
copyright it's fair use and I mentioned
the concept of fair use earlier in the
US and it's quite a broad concept and in
May a jury in the US said yes it's fair
use Oracle has said they're going to
appeal so this is going to run and run
but you know that that's another example
so there are many possible ways that you
could infringe for example with the
copyright lots of things copying
modifying communicating to the public
etc and recently in the European Court
there was a case about if you link to
copyright infringing content is that a
communication to the public which
infringes copyright and court said it
depends on a couple of things which I
will go into um so I've talked a lot
about copyright but there are other IP
rights and legal rights they could be
relevant like trademark database right
etc and data protection rights and of
course you have to think about all this
not just in relation to your code but
other elements you incorporate into your
software like graphics and music so next
bit exploitation getting money out of
the software that you've created and of
course there are lots of issues to do
with marketing advertising consumer
protection since i'm not going to go
into that because they're not unique
necessarily to software so one question
is I'm interested to know when in terms
of your own software your organization's
own software that you're selling are you
who's supplying it for some on prem
installation ok ok not many um who's
offering your software company software
through cloud through SAS so quite a few
okay and who's thinking of doing that if
you're not already know ok so mixture
and I suspect the rest of you you're
probably just using your software your
own software in house is that right ok
so obviously when you're exploiting
software you're giving permission to
other people to use the software on
payment of a fee or similar an important
point is that your rights and
liabilities and I'm not just talking
about intellectual property but just
generally your legal rights and
liabilities will vary with how you're
giving them permission to use a software
for example online terms and conditions
they may or may not be enforceable
depending on the situation your delivery
model is going to be important you've
said most of you aren't actually
offering software for you know online
sorry on prem installation downloading
etc but i guess a lot of you will be
using web apps or cloud some of you
might be using App Store's the delivery
model does make a difference legally
they're obviously risks involved when
you're exploiting software liability for
bugs security issues etc and often
you'll have contractual exclusions of
liability but as I mentioned earlier in
some situations the validity could be
called into question um cloud a lot of
you have said that you're offering your
software through SAS obviously you've
got issues with contracts with your own
customers but also because I suspect a
lot of you aren't actually self-hosting
you're going to be using AWS or as your
google cloud platform or IBM bluemix etc
you've got your contracts with them and
there is an issue of liability risk if
you have mismatching contracts which is
often the way they're also data
protection law risks as a processor
that's coming up under the GDP are but
i'll talk a bit about that later now
using software I'm not going to talk a
huge amount about because I was asked to
talk mainly about your position as
developers rather than as software users
but I just wanted to mention a little
bit about that and so again who is using
software running software in the cloud
for internal use by your company is
anybody doing that or just yeah a few
okay so you're probably going to be
using as or pairs either to provide
services sorry to provide services
internally I guess rather than to
external customers
who's planning to who hasn't already no
one oh ok well if you're using your own
software in the cloud whether you've
created it or you've taken open source
source software you put it in your
installing in the cloud obviously your
contract the eyes or pass provider is
going to be important and normally as
you know it's on the providers standard
terms and the scope for negotiation is
pretty limited unless your government
body or your financial services and then
you can probably negotiate a bit there
are legal risks when you're using
software in the cloud actually whether
it's your own software or somebody
else's whether it's I as pairs or says
there's the liability position as I've
mentioned for example often the ultimate
cloud provider will disclaim liability
for data integrity if you're using a
cloud service for content storing
content generating content etc then
there could be risks there and I would
emphasize I would but I but this is
absolutely right you should involve your
in-house or external lawyers early there
have been so many cases where you know
projects been going on the lawyer gets
thrown a document and said and told oh
wait it's going live next week so can
you have a quick look and that's too
late for them to do anything about it if
there's legal risk in those contracts
which is excessive it's too late for
them to do anything about it if you're
going to be going live the next day or
the next week so in the long run it's
actually cheaper to involve lawyers
earlier rather than later and of course
there are lots of related practical
issues which you can address through
measures like backups fail overs
encryption etc if your contract isn't
good enough or even if your contract is
pretty good it's still much better to
have a backup then to have the claim for
damages for lost data which you can
never recover location is really
important because laws are pre-digital
pre-internet but even pre-digital
however of course with the internet and
with cloud there's location independence
the person who's using the service or
the end users they don't care about
location except perhaps for latency
reasons
but in the law location makes a huge
difference so for example if you are
writing a deathless novel and you're
storing it in the cloud or or indeed
you're hosting it on a server somewhere
it's actually the location of the server
which is probably going to be important
because that's recording the work that
you created so that could make huge
difference whether it's your location or
the server in a different country as to
which countries laws apply another
example in the EU there's something
called a database right when you collect
data not when you create it but you
compile data for a database if you
actually do this and you store your
database in the US which doesn't
recognize the database right and not in
the EU maybe you won't have a database
right at all you know so that there are
lots of factors and that book does talk
a lot about the intellectual property
issues with the cloud in case you're
wondering about the picture on the left
of the very typical internet user that's
actually meant to represent a Swedish
church lady who was prosecuted for
uploading onto a website personal data
of her colleagues for reading by church
members but she was prosecuted for that
honor in data protection case so i said
i wanted to talk a bit about data
protection because it's one of my main
areas and i think is going to be a lot
more important now currently we have the
data protection directive that regulates
the processing of personal data of data
subjects individuals by data controllers
I've got lots of quotations around there
because a really important point which I
don't think is emphasized enough is that
the same words can mean different things
in the ordinary meaning and the
technical meaning as opposed to the
legal meaning so processing I mean to a
lot of people when you as processing
data they think it means computation you
know as in doing something to the data
but actually in the legal sense and the
data protection sense processing
includes storing just storing data if
you're holding data you're processing it
if you're just transmitting data you're
processing it so it's a lot wider than
you think and similarly the definition
of personal data is a lot broader than
non data
lawyers would think so there are special
meanings in law which only data
protection lawyers for example will
understand in this context it's not the
same as what you would normally think of
in the technical sense now the Data
Protection Directive has some exemptions
so you don't have to comply with data
protection laws if you're processing for
personal purposes only like your email
address book of course this big
exception for national security and the
data protection directive is implemented
nationally by legislation from each
country for example here in the UK we
have the Data Protection Act the
liabilities and obligations are on the
controller the person who controls the
purposes and means of processing
personal data and the controller has to
comply with certain rules when it
processes personal data like fair
processing like security measures and a
controller can use the processor to help
it process personal data but they're
more rules that apply there and the
relevance of cloud here is that if you
are using a cloud provider to process to
store or otherwise work on your data
then the cloud provider is considered
your processor whether it's as eyes etc
you have to comply with rules when you
use a cloud provider not just on due
diligence but also what the contractors
contain regarding security and location
as I've already mentioned is very
important a lot of data prediction
regulators require data to be kept
within the borders of the european
economic area and just a brief mention
that the data protection directive is
not the same as the infamous cookie law
or laws about human rights misuse of
private information etc they overlap but
often to the same situation you can
actually apply different laws and see
which one applies and how and even the
phrase data protection has a different
meaning in the legal sense as opposed to
the IT since the I'm sure you've heard
of the general data protection
regulation and this replaces the current
directive from May 2018 potentially they
are huge
including for security breaches and
their fines are not notifying preachers
when you should have and it's really
important and relevant even though we
have in the UK brexit because a if
you're doing business if you're in the
UK but you're doing business with
anybody in the EU then you it's still
going to be relevant and secondly if the
UK generally and wants to be considered
the country that is fit to do business
with the EU then adequate laws then it
has to have something similar to the GDP
are in it in order to enable that a
major point is that processes are
directly liable under the DDP are
including cloud providers is anybody
here from a cloud provider no okay but
yeah they are going to be directly
liable and I suppose actually you are
from if you are providing your software
as a service via saz then you are a
cloud provider okay you considered a
cloud provider for the processor for the
purposes of data protection law and
what's interesting and perhaps not so
positive for you is that if you were
offering your software for on prem
installation download whatever then you
wouldn't have these new processor
liabilities but if you are offering your
software as sad as a service then you
are considered a processor and you are
going to have these obligations and
liabilities under the GDP are so the
delivery model actually makes a
difference as to what your legal
position is going to be I don't have
time to talk about the GDP are in detail
so here's a quick workout that's a
barbell that the dog is holding in case
anybody I can't see um ABS
accountability not only complying but
proving that you're compliant and audit
rights big fines I'm sure you know about
which make this a boardroom issue and
there's two tiers there's the lower tier
which is ten million euros or two
percent of annual turnover if higher or
20 million euros and four percent of
annual turnover if higher and this is
the group's annual turnover this is not
just the offending organization so if
your company's part of a group they're
looking at the whole groups turnover
this is competition law proportion
ss4 security security obligations not
just updated controllers but on
processes including cloud providers
including saz service providers just to
give you a picture if you see those tiny
slippers on the left and those are the
single biggest finds that the UK
Information Commissioner the UK
regulator has issued over the last five
years and even talked talked a couple of
weeks ago that would have probably been
about the size of I think 2013 or 2014
was the bigger so far and if you compare
that to the two percent in the four
percent rate the yellow in the red of a
large UK financial services company you
can see that it really draft in
comparison and even if you take the 10
million or 20 million euro amount which
are the two on the extreme right then
you know you can see that the fine sir
did are tiny compared to what's possible
and those were pre brick citrate so they
will be even higher now next biceps
breach notification obligations for the
first time if it's personal data
international transfers storing or
processing otherwise processing personal
data on servers which are located
outside the eea more and tighter
restrictions generally class actions
quasi class actions are going to be
possible so you have to worry about not
just finds but also quasi class actions
and compensation enforcement powers are
going to be bigger processes I've
already mentioned have direct
obligations and liabilities and
requirements about the contract security
I've already mentioned but security by
design is going to be important and if
you've got good security requirements
and you can show sorry you've got good
security measures you know industry
standards etc that can be a factor to
reduce your fine if there's a breach so
it's really important their pics
procedures organizational procedures are
going to be important not just technical
or legal measures encryption
tokenization etc are going to be a lot
more important and codes and
certifications approved for gdp our
purposes not just industry standard but
approved for gdp our purposes are going
to be a lot more important to show
compliance and
to reduce fines and so on and s will
start preparing now because it's less
than two years so from a developer's
viewpoint if your software is actually
dealing with personal data and picked
out a few accountability evidence
privacy by design those obligations
apply two controllers security
obligations I've mentioned they apply to
controllers and processes so all this
means that secure coding is going to be
a lot more important for example a
taking action against some SQL injection
etc secure architecture encryption
everywhere you can that's going to be a
lot more important data minimization and
deletion retention not collecting
personal data unless you absolutely have
to deleting it as soon as you can
because that's going to increase your
liability if you haven't minimized your
data and there's a breach for example
and there have been a couple of fines
where there were hacks and one of the
fines and one of the reasons for the
fines was oh you've kept all this data
you didn't actually need it this was
from customers from years ago you've
still got it and that's been breached so
you know that actually is an aggravating
factor towards your fine a final thing
there access controls logs and audit
trails because of this accountability
and evidence emphasis it's actually
going to be much more important to have
logging and so on so if you're producing
software your customer and that's meant
to handle personal data your customers
will be demanding more logging and
ordered trails and that sort of thing so
you'll need to try and build those in
and of course an interesting twist is
that even logs could contain personal
data themselves so delivery model
offering cloud is going to be a lot
harder if you're offering your software
as a service as opposed to just for
downloading and on prem installation
there's going to be a big difference
these required contract terms will be
much more detail and difficulty is they
have to be flowed down so your says
you're providing us our service you're
using say AWS AWS maybe using a
third-party data center and so on your
obligations in your contract with your
end users have to actually be flow down
so you're going to have to go to Amazon
and Microsoft and Google etc
and say I want you to actually accept
these tougher obligations they might
have to flow down to the data center
operator if it's a third-party data
center and I just am not sure how it's
going to work out in cloud and this is
actually going to be not just cloud but
lots of modern supply chains and I've
already mentioned the title requirements
on data location and remember it's not
just physical location of data that
matters it's not just data center
location it's also remote access so if
you've got staff now you've got
contractors in India or wherever who are
actually providing support then their
remote access to data that's a transfer
which has to comply with the rules in
the current regulator sorry current data
protection directive as well as the
regulation ray of light as I've said is
there will be these GDP are approved
codes and certifications and if a
company's got one of those you could
actually transfer to them without any
issues there are different
considerations again from mobile apps
and the apps or model so the delivery
model is going to make a big difference
and I'm worried about the impact the GDP
is going to have on the cloud again only
sing this in the shower for Roberta
Flack or fuji fans so really you've
gotta plan ahead I mean two years less
than two years isn't long at all privacy
by design and privacy engineering is
going to be a lot more important and
also privacy impact assessments or data
protection impact assessments so as part
of your before you actually start a new
project a new service the new product
your risk assessment has got to include
data protection as well as other issues
and coward is going to be a lot more
difficult but do consult your tech
lawyers early sooner rather than later
and I would also mention a slight
warning I have seen so many things out
there which say GDP is coming this is
really scary huge fines buy our product
by our service and you'll be okay be
careful about that because if I've
already mentioned data protection law is
quite specialist and the terms can mean
different things you might read the
words but that doesn't mean
you actually understand the legal
implications because they have different
meanings in law and real life and IT and
so on so just be a bit careful about
that I've seen actually quite a lot of
mistakes out there even in the media
they say oh the GDP are is going to do
this a gdp is going to do that and some
of them are quite wrong so just be a bit
careful about that there are some
sources for free I Tino advice so
there's no excuse not to get it if you
need it q legal for startups boot law
has free meet up again particularly for
startups including IPOs etc own it has
IP advice not necessarily IT maybe more
music in art but there is someone I t
but full disclosure I'm associated with
the university behind q legal although
I'm actually got nothing to do with cool
eagle and I'm associated with the law
firm behind brute law but they do happen
to be I think the best in that area in
London at least and of course they can
only advise on the position here
different countries have different
requirements so you've got to be careful
to make sure you talk to laws in the
relevant countries and for legal news
affecting technology outlaw I personally
think is the best again the law firm
that I am associated with is behind
outlaw but I was reading our Lord even
before I joined them and even before
became a technology lawyer SEL org is
actually a great site for again
technology law news and more analysis
again I'm disclosure and on the
editorial board for that but it really
is a great site and a lot of the content
there is now free and of course there's
lots of blogs around that provide free
information about technology on there
lots of data protection resources offers
the best practice resources for security
are going to be good for security and
regulators actually come out with
opinions and guidance for example the
article 29 working party which is the EU
regulators collectively in the UK we
have the information commissioner and
they've got guidance on things like
mobile apps and on big data and so on
