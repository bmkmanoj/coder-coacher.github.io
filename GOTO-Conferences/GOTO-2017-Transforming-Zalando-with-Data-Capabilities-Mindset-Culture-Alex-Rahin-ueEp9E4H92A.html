I'm Alex ranking very happy to be here
today I wanted to talk to you a little
bit more about not the specific details
of you know how we go and optimize
different algorithms or solve specific
little problems I think these are areas
where first of all I'm sure there's much
smarter people in the room to to give
you better tutorials secondly you know
it's information that's really available
what I wanted to share with you instead
are some of the thoughts that we are
involved in at zalando as we work on
many related issues to data and to
scaling so this is really I'm sharing
some of my findings and some of the
lessons I've learned from the trenches
if you will okay so first of all about
the lander I'll be brief as you know
we're a fashion platform with the
largest in Europe it's an amazing story
in terms of a startup that was founded
in 2008 really grew faster than anybody
could keep up with we went public in
2014 and today were the largest provider
of fashion and trends in Europe some
numbers to kind of put things a bit in
perspective so we currently have
presence in 15 countries we have four
four female centers and we just
announced a couple of days ago that we
will have a new one in Sweden
perfect timing for this talk right and
then you can read the rest over or about
20 million active customers
we just announced a guidance on revenue
for 2016 of about 3.6 billion big number
of products and over 14,000 employees
and this is the area where we're
actually growing really fast as well
these are some of our main sights a lot
of our R&amp;amp;D happens in Berlin we have I
believe about eight or nine different
buildings so we have quite a quite a big
presence in Berlin which is an amazingly
fun city to living by the way but that's
a whole other discussion I want you to
visit really if you haven't already we
do have also R&amp;amp;D sites in in Dortmund in
in Dublin and in Helsinki
these are R&amp;amp;D sites focused on very
specific technical area you know like we
have areas where we focus on search on
data sciences machine learning we try to
provide an environment where colleagues
of the same area of specialty can build
synergies work together and learn from
each other
lastly I believe today we have about
1,500 techies if you're interested to
learn more check out our website ok so
today's agenda right so this is maybe a
good point in time to give you some
context about myself I mean I'm an
engineer many years ago I started my
career in InDesign hardware and software
projects and really ever since ever
since I started my career I've been
knee-deep sometimes neck deep in data
was a math major as well so this is
something that I really like to be
involved in you fast forward 20 plus
years after having learned a lot at
you know places like Microsoft and
Amazon and Intel and if you startups
along the way my task at Zalando is to
understand what is the value of data
what is the data we have and how can we
help the companies scale and have
velocity as you saw those numbers you
know we're not we're not a you know
toddler or a baby anymore perhaps you
can say we're a teenager so we need to
start getting a bit serious I know it's
a scary world but the point is we're at
a stage where if we want to sustain our
growth we need to have some structure
and some discipline in place and the way
to do that is data so I want to share
with you several thoughts here first of
all how do we think about this problem
you know I'm obviously the lander is not
the only company going through this
transition there's a lot of books out
there about the topic of scaling I just
wanted to share you our experience at
Zalando so we'll start high-level I also
want to show you what does it look like
when I say scaling with data organizing
building teams at a high level I want to
make that a little bit more concrete for
you and then first and foremost I think
the one area you see repeated throughout
this talk is mindset and culture because
how we do it is not really having the
best algorithm or you know the best
ideas or even the best people actually
believe it or not all these things add
value if the right mindset is there and
that is across the company I would say
our number one priority because you know
the language
everything's relative zalando is already
a very data-driven company
it's absolutely amazing even you know
for a guy who came from came from a
place like Amazon however there's also a
lot of areas where we can take it to the
next level so we do this through
focusing on the mindset focusing on
workflows and tools and processes this
is something that's a little bit of a
tangent but I just wanted to share with
you some of the things that you may find
interesting some of the things I talked
about Ronnie I think about randomly here
and there is about really the impact of
data in our lives even beyond fashion
even beyond zalando really at a global
level I also think these are areas that
are going to produce quite a bit of
value and quite a bit of disruption in
the future so first of all and I'll be
very quick about this but I want you to
to at least put this in the context of
the rest of the things I'm talking about
so data extraction and analysis so
obviously you know there we all know
what Big Data is perhaps I don't know
everybody thinks of it differently I'm
here where I'm going with this is that
you know the the scale and the size and
the complexity of data is exponentially
growing there's a saying that forgive me
this gives me a little bit but it's
something like you know a billion years
ago
you know maybe humanity and life reached
the point billion minutes ago is when
you know Christianity started but a
billion Google searches ago was
literally probably a few minutes ago so
we're on this accelerated curve that
it's really not going to slow down and
if you really want to understand what's
going on and
apply to your line of business you
really need new methodologies and new
technologies so I'll talk about storage
which is one very key area for us
methodologies also are important because
you know that is things like machine
learning for instance data analysis data
extraction so these are overarching
challenges that I think all
organizations have and we're also
addressing it at zalando personalization
and customization this is an interesting
one so you know today we kind of take it
for granted right you search for
something pizza you expect your
smartphone to show you pizza around you
right you take it for granted but if you
really look at it for some people it's
actually uncomfortable right because
there is a bit of a maybe implicit
exchange going on here right
for instance you you want to get a loan
right you give information to your
banker several years of taxes your
paycheck your entire financial existence
right that's kind of scary to me
personally but I know jeez I have to do
it if I want to get a loan right same
with your doctor you tell him everything
to get medical advice well
personalization customization is the
same challenge and I think this is an
area that's just my opinion
where there are some frictions in place
for the right reason
one example is one of our products that
handles customer data we have a very
interesting legal challenge in Germany
which is we cannot mix for instance
navigational customer data meaning what
they do before and on the site we cannot
mix that with transactional data meaning
things they've bought things they've
liked things they've returned all of
that so you know I don't have a good
reason to explain to you why but
obviously you know this comes from the
the concern of protecting privacy and
governance and moving for it's going to
be I think a bigger and bigger problem
continuous experiments I think this is
also a very important so I would say you
know the core of this problem is
differentiating between a correlation
and causation if you will right they're
not the same thing for instance what's a
good example in this room for instance
let's assume you know all of you guys
are data scientist on the first row and
you're sitting on on blue chairs right
great but sitting on blue chairs doesn't
make your data scientist right so
there's a lot of these situations that
work where we're analyzing data and
there's a source of confusion at that
level what is the answer
experimentation so this is an area where
I think all of us need to be very
disciplined knowledgeable and we have to
have the right tools and methodologies
in place to kind of have it under our
skin right this is part of how we do
work the last one I say a new kind of
contracts due to better monitoring so
this one is big actually this one means
that today for instance there is a
computer somewhere in every single
transaction okay a cash register is a
computer a data center also is a
computer technically right so what that
means is we've kind of decoupled we've
kind of decoupled the transaction
between the two ends
and we've enabled really low level
engagement so for instance you're seeing
now car sharing programs right where a
car has been divided to very very very
small increments of use and you list
directly only what you need right I
would also say if you really think about
cloud computing that's also in a sense
similar trend and there's going to be
more so what is this gonna go I don't
know but you know one kind of a fun way
to predict the future is to maybe think
of it this way
whatever rich people have today the
average people are gonna want it in five
years and the poor people are gonna want
it in 10 years and that's actually
accelerating as well example driverless
cars right people have chauffeurs now
you can go get a driverless car some of
us cost is gonna go down eventually
everybody may have access to it that's
another example that's I think you get
the idea so this is important in terms
of how we run and monitor our businesses
as well these are really the four areas
I think overarching as you think through
how you want to build products these are
some of the angles that we consider so
let's bring it down to the level of the
land all right what is our data
philosophy as I mentioned earlier we
want to enable the platform that can
scale and innovate at high velocity it's
all about speed
remember the Neanderthal to Christianity
to Google search analogy it's all about
velocity you need to have a platform
that allows you to innovate fast
experiment see what's working and what's
not
iterate Double Down and what works get
rid of what doesn't
it's really the only way to work and
it's not gonna get any easier moving
forward so we want to enable that that's
the first point
what do we start well there's many ways
of looking at a product define it
prioritize it develop visions for it we
believe everything starts and end with
customers when we initially start
talking about a new product or a new
feature there's some very specific
things that are required who's the
customer what's the value to the
customer how do you measure success you
think they're easy questions but you
know if you sit down and you really want
to give a precise answer well
thought-through based on data they're
not easy but once you do it the rest of
the the rest of the strategy almost
writes itself
and then at the other end of course you
have to have success criteria the
instrumentation and the tooling to
measure it and then iterate whereas data
coming will data up plain and simple is
a voice of customers right is is
fundamental solando is actually a very
fun company because we have different
parts of the company that bring in very
different points of view and
perspectives and skills for instance you
know in one building
we have techies in the other building we
have models shooting you know people
just kind of making sure they look good
we have in another building let's say
buyers merchandisers people who deal
with big brands so on and so forth right
so you know take an example where we
have a big campaign coming with adidas
or Nike pick your favorite brand what
are the customers so obviously our you
know branding group has very strong
opinion these are some of the things we
need to prioritize based on hitting this
customer which is great that's
essentially what made solando successful
over the last years but we want to
complement that as well with with
data-driven understanding because here
we have the voice of a customer over
several million and this voice also it's
our job as the data organization to make
sure it is surfaced properly with the
right insights with the right messages
so we can run the company not just based
on one or two or three opinions but
based on the market based on a large and
precise understanding of the market this
is our grand how do you do it right in a
big company well look at where we are
today
well you can't look but when I look at
where we are today again we're in the
face of growing up we have a tremendous
amount of talent a lot of projects
coming in the may or may not always be
ideally coordinated right I think this
is a problem many companies have big and
small really the process is always
behind the innovation and the and the
product so what we're trying to do here
is have methodologies based on
end-to-end view of a given flow for
instance data I'll show you in a minute
what it looks like right data starts for
us
and every company's different starts for
us at the very bottom where we have a
data infrastructure that we use for
storage for processing for making data
available across the company and there's
hundreds of different micro services
that take the data do something with it
whether it's a signal that they can use
in a product or sometimes it's a set of
enrichments modifications to the data
that then gets pushed back so other
services can use right so it's a very
complex picture how do we have these
people work together right different
departments different goal
so on and so forth so one fundamental
way we we are using is have an
end-to-end view what does that mean for
data you go from the actual creation and
storage of data at an infrastructure
level a one level of abstraction above
we have data platforms focused on
specific areas I talked about customer
data but we also have of course product
data we have different understanding of
various influencers around the web where
we create insights for instance imagine
if you monitor the fashion world one
part of it is you know several hundred
influencers fashion bloggers fashion
news people influence the fashion
industry so you know when we track that
occasionally we have some surprising
insights right you may see that geez you
know the for some reason over the last
two weeks everybody is talking about red
shirts okay so what's going on with red
shirts right we don't know if we don't
do this we're not gonna know we're never
gonna know so then now what do you do
with this information well you have to
surface it you have to make it
actionable you have to add more insights
so that's the enrichment part but then
all this intelligence I talking about is
completely worthless if you don't have a
good ability to surface it your
customers right and how do we surface it
to customers this is where it branches
right one is for external customers
obviously fields such as search
recommendations personalization and we
also look at some emerging technologies
you know things like things like BOTS
and some other crazy things
sizing technology if you guys have some
good technical idea
about that one come talk to me please
and of course internally bi-rite in
parallel the way we organize the
business this is where these are the
culture components right talking about
making this a natural way of how we work
we also have a product analytics team
that is essentially the Evangelist for
data-driven thinking methodologies but
also providing the tools right you can't
really go and say hey be data-driven
okay if I don't know what it is I can't
do it if I know what it is but I don't
have the right tools to do it I still
can't do it so it's a it's a two-sided
approach first understanding what the
KPIs are what the metrics are how do we
measure them how do we experiment and
how do we actually track where the
rubber hits the road essentially which
is with our customers so let's go even
one level lower day-to-day what does it
look like so we have small autonomous
teams at the londo and you know
different groups are different however
there is a common model I would say
typical model which includes a
collaboration in a small focused team
with a product owner who sets the
strategy and division for the product
defines essentially the why why are we
doing this and that's where data-driven
prioritization and thinking comes in if
you make a case make sure you have the
data to back it up because you know
doing a feature for us doing a product
is another right it's actually a
privilege right you get access to
company resources you have to be very
clear on why are we doing it what's the
impact otherwise we'll not gonna let you
do it right is very simple so this is in
itself a big cultural shift because
you know some parts of the company and
some parts of many companies are very
much engineering driven and engineers
are you know some of the smartest people
there in the room you know they want to
do they want to build they don't really
know if it's going to be used
necessarily who's gonna use it why but
it's like building Legos right I'm sure
all of you have built Legos you sit in
front of a bucket and you just can't
stop and the better Lego builder you are
the craziest thing you're gonna build
right so what did I just build well I
mean I don't know it's kind of it
started like an airplane but then I
thought you know if I add this thing
here it could look like your futuristic
castle on and on right you see my point
so it's very important for product
development to work together very
closely and we take it one step further
is not something we add to how we work
is actually a big part of how we work
meaning when we do even resource
planning topics such as experimentation
testing and validation or part of the
planning it's part of how we work it is
not something down the road where the
schedule is late you're gonna do
trade-offs against it no it's not an
option it's part of how we ship products
so these are all little changes but as
you can see I hope you can see a picture
emerges where we're kind of taking our
execution in a simple agile
high-velocity type of a thinking that
frees people from all the work that we
don't want to do things like setting up
systems figuring out what you do some
basic methodology and framework that
really frees your creativity but that's
a side effect and it is amazing when you
see it at work so KP as we talked about
it that's part of that's a fundamental
thing one of the first thing I did when
I joined the lando I work with my
colleagues and basically we thought our
KPIs right KPIs are how you measure
various things
and you know there's business cap here
is there are specific product KPIs and
there needs to be a framework that
allows you to understand the
implications understand how you can
steer it and it's a big topic but this
is quite frankly perhaps the first step
you know as a leader in the data field
you gotta have a very good idea of what
you're measuring and why it's important
and then lastly you know we don't want
to build products that nobody use so we
are very firm believers in using MVPs
and using iteration so this is like a
little funny cartoon that I think
expresses this point really well better
than I could say in words we all have
tendencies to kind of have a vision
obviously right everything starts with
the vision and then boom you want to go
execute the vision right you have a
vision for a car that's the first that's
the first approach but that's not how we
do it right it's not about the car right
it's not about the car it's about
transportation you want to go from point
A to point B so we're like well you know
what do you need wheels
you know we build a skateboard you make
it better you iterate and then you have
a Porsche at the end or a Volvo sorry
Volvo at the end okay and then since I'm
running out of time looks like I just
wanted to leave you with a couple of
suggestions one is a small book that I
really like I've made this create I've
made this book a required reading in my
org is a very small book it's written
for product managers but it's written
for product managers with a very high
emphasis on on technology so I think
we've we've used and as you can see you
know the writer worked at Google and
Amazon I haven't worked at Google but I
can tell you it's a very nice summary of
Amazon's technologies and methodologies
and what the impact is so I think you
know make this a baseline for
operational excellence across your org
you're not going to regret it and then
if you want to go crazy there's one
topic you can read up on which is this
topic of econometrics it goes back to
what I was telling you about about
causation versus correlation you know as
big as these buzz words got so quickly
you know big data machine learning AI
perhaps this is the next big thing so
you know read up on it and I hope you
enjoy it thank you for your time
so we have time for a couple of
questions anyone have any questions over
here thank you I just didn't get the
point very well about your continuous
experiments how you do it and to end
these kinds of things and continuous
experiment your company what is your
culture yeah so there are different ways
to test but I think where the rubber
meets the road is having access to
actual customers and having the ability
to measure through a/b testing
methodologies what is the impact of what
you ship so you know we're going from a
model where let's say we have several
dozen running at the same time to
several hundreds to several thousands so
that's the thing we're scaling and this
includes you know these things I
mentioned first of all making making it
I hate to say required but it is
required to do where it makes sense but
then also scaling the infrastructure
that makes it very easy and shows
results right our first instantiation of
a product for a/b testing is is a
product with just phenomenal
capabilities but it wasn't the easiest
thing to use now we're moving it towards
more of a self-service model where you
can design your products you can design
your audiences you can launch a product
given criteria you can get the results
analyzed for you and insights actually
presents it so we're going more and more
towards making it something that's fun
and easy to use for anybody not just a
technical person any further questions
over here
before you embark on a project to test
an experiments where do the intuition
come from usually in the company is that
the brand manager is that the techies
where do the intuition come from usually
that's actually a very good question so
we welcome good ideas from any source
right that being said but typically
there are I would say three areas where
we where we look for ideas one is
business health operational excellence
right if we have systems that are
supposed to be 100% of the time
available but they keep crashing sadly
that's actually most of the time the
highest priority right so we essentially
take that idea to the next level we do
continuous post-mortems on projects we
identify issues and then you get three
types of opportunities one is the
business health the operational
excellence the second one are projects
that either come from senior management
or even from product owner level and
sometimes even product specialist there
are global projects right so there's a
whole workflow for global projects that
actually include several team several
orgs and then we also have local
projects which essentially means it can
happen within you know one or a small
number of teams and the source of it
comes through collaboration between
product management and development we
expect the product manager doesn't need
to invent what we do but he needs to own
it he needs to understand it he needs to
build the business case around it he
needs to make it tangible
so through all these different sources
on a regular basis
depending on parts of the or quarterly
or sometimes half a year we gather all
these ideas from these different sources
and there's more then we go through a
prioritization period and we publish you
know very simple to use and simple to
communicate prioritize lists of what the
company is going to work on throughout
the next year and quarter okay that's
all the time we have for questions
unfortunately I'm sorry one last thing
that's actually my favorite can't
believe I forgot it there is also
obviously an interface we have with a
research group so a research group they
are you know you're hardcore
data scientist specialist also I almost
want to say rocket scientists because
they're awesome I mean we have some of
the most amazing people you can have in
the field so there are always
essentially Applied Research and we also
have a channel from from that
organization to take on some of the some
of the ideas that are at a place where
we want to see if there's a potential
for that to become a real product that's
also another source okay thank you thank
you for my hand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
