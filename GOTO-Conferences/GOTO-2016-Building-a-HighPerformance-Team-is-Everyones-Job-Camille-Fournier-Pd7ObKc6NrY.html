but I will remind you to engage the real
title so I like to like play with titles
and writing titles is really hard
conferences always want titles really
early and I'm never know what I want to
call my talks until like the last minute
so you know this book that I'm almost
done with is still untitled this talk
was untitled until fairly recently but
the current working title is the
elements of scaling so we're going to
talk about scaling our talk about
scaling teams we're going to talk about
scaling companies we might even talk a
little bit about technical scaling if
you're lucky so how do we scale well
some people have you know written things
to talk about scaling and what they say
is that the way to scale is to hire a
bunch of these 10x developers I've heard
of this the 10x developer they're like
these magical unicorn creatures that
somehow by virtue of their brilliance
just work ten times faster than other
engineers and so if you hire one of them
it's like you're hiring ten people and
therefore you can build a whole company
of these magical ten Xers right and
therefore you don't have to hire that
many people and you you're scaling
problems are super easy and also they
write beautiful code which means that
what's what's nothing sorry which means
that you don't have to worry about
refactoring rewriting their beautiful
code and it will scale to your user
demand to 10x developers magical
wonderful well unfortunately also not
really a thing so instead we must deal
with humans now insofar as 10x
developers maybe are really a thing they
are probably a thing because they're in
great environments that help them be
productive that help them be effective
right this is the effective delivery
track and I think that what all of us
are trying to do when we think of
effective delivery as we're trying to
think about how can we make the people
on our teams better how can we make them
work faster how can we make them more
effective right more efficient
and that really means that what we're
talking about is kind of team building
which is kind of like management so I'm
gonna talk a little bit about management
today not just about management this is
a top for everyone if you are not a
manager don't worry there is a lot of
content in here for you but to give you
a feeling of management I have a couple
of quotes to start us off the first is
by someone named Casey single the key to
being a good manager is keeping the
people who hate you away from those who
are still undecided so there's one one
idea of management another one by Dwight
Eisenhower you do not lead by hitting
people over the head that's assault not
leadership
and I wish I had heard that one earlier
in my career but okay so about me so as
was said in my introduction I am an
engineer I consider myself to be still
an engineer I still do things I actually
work on a couple of open-source projects
you might have heard of I'm part of the
Apache zookeeper group committers and
program management committee am I also
and part of the I'm sorry this mic is
just having issues here I'm also part of
the drop wizard web framework if you
never heard of that it's a little bit
like spring boots only I think it came
out before spring boot it's a nice
lightweight java web framework so I like
to think of myself as still being
technical still being an engineer but
yes I'm also a manager and how did I get
there
well I started out working as an
engineer and becoming a tech lead as
many of you probably have done it's a
very common path I manage small teams as
a tech lead for a long time working for
a really big company in this case
Goldman Sachs you may have heard of it
little investment banks been in the news
a lot so I worked for Goldman Sachs for
many years and I had a great time there
I eventually sort of graduated into one
of those lovely senior individual
contributor roles you know the ones were
like you get to be kind of smart and
design big systems and it's awesome and
you don't have to worry too much about
humans except that at a big company you
always are worrying about humans a
little bit you're worrying about all
those humans you have to convince that
you actually are smart in order to you
know get them to use your projects so I
was at Goldman Sachs trying to convince
these smart humans to use my projects in
this case a big zookeeper discovery
service for the goldman sachs a
service-oriented architecture which they
probably have rebranded as micro
services I'm not sure but that's what we
all did at some point a few years ago so
I was doing that and I and I really
enjoyed it I really enjoyed writing code
and designing these big systems but at
some point I was like you know I think
that I want to do more I want to have a
bigger impact it's very frustrating not
having a team that I'm leading myself
it's very frustrating to have to ask
other people to give me people to work
with me right so that we can actually
get bigger things done and I have a
feeling that if I had a team working for
me if I was actually in a management
role I could get a lot more done so I
did what a lot of people do especially
you know five years ago a lot of people
did this which was I said oh I'll go
work for a start-up because startups are
where you go when you're at a big
company and you want more power right no
okay hopefully not hopefully not that's
a bad joke I really don't mean that
seriously but I did go to a start-up I
went to a little company called Rent the
Runway what is Rent the Runway Rent the
Runway is a company in the States that
rents women's designer dresses and
accessories such as this lovely dress
that I'm wearing today
I went to Rent the Runway as a director
of infrastructure engineering so I was
the director of infrastructure
engineering I was not the CTO I was not
a VP of Engineering I was not the
co-founder all right I was managing a
team but I was writing a bunch of code I
actually went to Rent the Runway cuz it
was a great business and because they
needed a lot of help technically they
were in a bad situation
technically they had this old Drupal PHP
framework that they were using to run
this rental website
unfortunately that was not a good match
right it's not a great thing to try to
hammer in a bunch of bespoke logic into
Drupal one of my former teammates
described Drupal a little bit as an
amazing mold you can pour concrete into
it and get out an apartment building but
if you want to replace the sinks in the
apartment building you are chiseling
through concrete to do it it's very
difficult right it's not very modular
so we were doing a big rewrite and I led
this rewrite out of this Drupal PHP
framework into Java based quote/unquote
micro-services and it was great so I
joined Rent the Runway and to give you a
sense of what I'm like as a hands-on
manager so I was managing yes but I was
writing a lot of code this is what I'm
like as a hands-on manager right if you
don't test your commits I will bury you
I'm very particular let's say in the way
that I believe good quality software is
created and I try to teach people how to
do that but sometimes I can teach it by
being kind of a hard-ass right so it's
all going well we're doing this rewrite
everything's going on it's stressful
it's a startup right things are not
perfect but it's okay and then what
happens oh well we have what I have
decided to call a cultural segfault so
as I said I was hired in as a director
of engineering I was hired in by someone
there was a VP of engineering at the
time who had hired many of the people on
the team and he ended up leaving the
company and there was really no one to
replace him I was the most senior person
on the team who had been with the
company the longest and this is about
nine months into my time there so what
did I do well I said hey I had a
start-up and I came here because I
wanted to learn and grow and stretch
myself so hey boss hey see CEO why don't
you put me in let me run the team I can
totally do it it's no problem right
running a whole team is like no big deal
I can I can do that it's just a startup
no I know how to do code I'm good at
that I'm charming right sort of you know
it'll be no big deal right and so she
realized that for the time they had no
better option and let me be the interim
head of technology and I eventually went
from infra interim head of technology
into VPS VP of engineering into CTO over
the next three years however not without
some bumps so my very first review four
months into this job as interim head
I'm sure that the CEO told me good
things I'm sure she had some good
feedback but I will never forget this
review for being one of the hardest
reviews I've ever received because the
negative feedback I got from this review
was that I was creating a culture of
fear yeah like oh that's really bad I
think you wanna hear it's not an all the
thing you want to hear in a review it's
kind of terrifying to hear something
like that you're like oh you know
especially when it's unexpected and it
was unexpected I did not realize that my
team was afraid of me they were afraid
of making mistakes in front of me that
they were afraid of what I would do if
they screwed up I you know I knew that I
was harsh but I had come from Finance
where yelling at people was ok and
apparently that's not the case
everywhere uh so this was a wake-up call
for me right this was a huge wake-up
call like wow you know what the
dysfunctions on this team might be
coming from inside the house they might
be coming from me in fact right so I
spent the next three years from that
wake-up call until the time that I left
Rent the Runway a little bit around a
year ago building what I believed was a
culture of trust so moving our team out
of this culture of fear and into a
culture of trust and this talk is about
some of the things that I did and
learned along the way doing that that I
believe are applicable to everyone right
not just those of you who are in
management positions although if you are
a manager please pay attention there's a
lot of stuff here for you but frankly
even if you're an individual contributor
even if you are a new individual
contributor you are contributing to the
culture of your team right your actions
your behaviors the way you treat other
people and you are interacting with
other people unless you are truly a solo
operator working off on the side on your
own stuff in which case I don't know why
you're here because most of the
challenges of effective delivery are
really more about teams and about
individuals but you know if you were on
a team if you were a member of a team
there are a lot of things that you can
do to help that team be better even if
you're not leading it why is this talk
called the elements of scaling well
oh my god I'm sorry
scaling scaling scaling systems and
scaling teams have a lot of similarities
and challenges right scaling systems
let's talk about scaling systems for a
minute I'm a distributed systems person
so I'll try not to you know go too far
down that rabbit hole but when I talk
about distributed systems I talk about
the challenges of distributed systems
being really the challenges of
communication largely right it's all
about communication over the network and
one of the big challenges is actually
also about coordination the more you
have to coordinate the slower these
systems go because of the challenges of
dealing with the network that's a
fundamental truth of distributed systems
if you are distributed systems engineer
I'm sure you know this teams are very
similar right you want to add people to
your team you want to grow your team
effective scaling is about having every
person that comes in be as effective as
the first people were right not losing
effectiveness when you add people or
even better
letting fewer people be able to do more
right those are the goals of scaling but
to do that well especially if you're
actually adding more people requires you
to think a lot about the overhead of
coordination and in particular if you
don't have trust you're gonna have to do
a lot more communication and coordinate
a lot more because you don't trust one
another Trust allows you to kind of get
rid of a bunch of the coordination
that's necessary to make good teams work
because trusting teams just work better
together they know more when to
communicate they communicate in better
ways all right anyway so let's move on
let's really get to the meat of this
prop this talk the first thing that I
learned was all about speed and this is
the most straightforward section of this
talk this is the easiest understand
hopefully everyone here is fully bought
in on the concept of help your teams
move faster by helping them deploy more
frequently basics continuous deployment
we actually didn't do continuous
delivery but we did move from when I got
there maybe once every few weeks
deploying to once a week to once a day
and this is a pretty essential element
of making your teams work better so
let me tell you about getting there when
we did this big move this big rewrite to
micro-services right we also rewrote the
front end to be this ruby layer it so
this ruby layer that was serving the
website serving you know all the content
serving on the assets well as with most
rewrites we did some things well we did
some things poorly you don't even need
to read what's in the boxes here but as
you can see from a diagram like this
this is kind of complicated this was all
the complex interdependencies that we
somehow made the website serving layer
of our code do after all this free right
we just basically over engineered it we
were trying to do this fault-tolerant
swimlanes thing and we ended up with
kind of a big ball of mud with a bunch
of get sub modules and it was a mess it
was a mess and it took a long time to
deploy so we were deploying this once a
week but it was taking a few hours now
we were missing automation but we also
had a lot of complexities with how do
you actually join all these assets
together again these were all supposedly
separate things sometimes deployed in
two different environments so we said
okay this can't stand right nobody liked
this the engineers the managers nobody
was happy with this so we sent a team
away and said okay let's make
deployments faster and so they
simplified the git they started to work
on things it was great they put some
automation in place and then towards the
end of that process I said hey let's go
further instead of just being able to
deploy faster let's deploy every day now
going from faster deployments to the
ability to deploy every day is not just
a matter of saying okay cool now we do
play every day you have to do some more
work you have to teach the team how to
break their code down into smaller
chunks you have to add things like
feature flagging but we did it we did
that work it was not as hard as I might
have feared and we started deploying
every day and the impact to that was
immediate positive massively successful
change in our culture so turns out
engineers like to ship especially
engineers at startups engineers at
start-ups wants to be deploying code
your team probably everyone in this room
you want to be able to say that you do
you have the opportunity to do what you
do best
at work every day right and if you are a
software engineer and that's what you do
you probably want to say I want to be
focused every day on writing code or
designing systems I don't want to be
spending days and days dealing with
broken releases dealing with the release
process right so just letting people get
through that hump was an immediate
benefit but even more than that the
frequent releases the frequent easy
releases removed these bottlenecks of
coordination that we had because when
you're only releasing once a week your
releases become a bottleneck the release
becomes this scarce resource and we all
know what happens right you're getting
ready to cut the branch for your release
and someone says oh can I just have 15
more minutes to get this change and
please just 15 more minutes my product
manager is breathing down my throat so
you say fine 45 minutes later they're
done they've broken the bills so now you
wait give them another 15 20 minutes to
fix the tests and sometimes they do but
sometimes they don't and then you have
to roll back and start the testing
process again and it's a nightmare and
three hours later you finally done the
release that you started four hours
before that right and you just feel
annoyed and frustrated and this is every
week after week after week after week
that's because your releases are so
scarce that it's a contended resource
once you free up that resource from
being a contented resource all the
sudden people feel more autonomous they
feel like they're able to kind of work
independently they can get their stuff
done when they're ready to get it done
there's no product manager breathing
down your throat because if you don't
get it done this week your next chance
isn't it's for another week I promised
that I would give you all something to
take away here's number one thing
whatever your role is be impatient be
impatient on behalf of your team when
you detect things like why weren't
releases take four hours to do if you
can use that impatience and channel it
into solutions channel it into a desire
to make those releases faster to make
that process faster you will make your
whole team better
okay so the next element is structure oh
okay maybe not structure because a lot
of people are really have a bad kind of
attitude about structure kind of
understandably right we've all
experienced some kinds of bureaucracies
that are really unpleasant right and
startup people in particular I actually
read something where they surveyed some
startup folks and they were like what do
you think when you think of the word
structure and they were like slow
unnecessary innovation crushing was one
that I heard which is like ooh that's
really bad alright but so let's not talk
about structure let's talk about
learning and transparency because really
structure is kind of inevitable if I
were to give you 50,000 lines of
spaghetti code and say make it so that
the team can work on this code what
would you do well you might refactor it
somehow you might add tests you might
add documentation you might rewrite it
in another language you would do
something to add structure to that code
because structure is what helps us get
to the essence of what needs to be done
more quickly right structure is that
stuff that lets us bake an apple pie
with some pie filling and a pie crust
instead of inventing the universe to do
it so structure is not good it's not bad
it's simply something that comes to be
to make us more effective in particular
I think that the best structure comes
when it comes out of transparency all
right when it comes to transparently so
you understand why that structure is in
place and it comes out of learning
instead of learning really from failure
I would bet that most structures you
interact with even the ones that you
hate are kind of a reaction to something
there are a reaction to something failed
and somebody said oh let's try to
prevent that failure and so they maybe
put some process in place they put some
structure in place to learn from that
failure and to try to correct course
because structures fail right this is a
the Tacoma Narrows Bridge it's a famous
structural failure in the United States
and you know this bridge stood for about
40 days something like that and it
failed due to wind shear and there's
like video of it so it's very cool it's
very famous for that reason now
structures fail and we've all
experienced structural fail
but we don't just say hey you know what
this bridge failed so we shouldn't build
a bridge there that's a bad place for a
bridge no of course not
and we're gonna just make people kayak
across that river they instead said okay
let's learn from this failure
let's encode those learnings into oh god
I just said in learnings sorry
let's encode those lessons into the next
bridge that we built right let's build a
better bridge and learn from our
mistakes so I have a famous famous quote
unquote famous structure that I created
that you may have seen or maybe not it's
called the Rent the Runway engineering
career ladders so if you're not familiar
with this engineering career ladders are
like the job descriptions by level for
engineers right so engineer one engineer
two senior engineer you know staff
engineer things like that right that
shows you the things that are expected
at every job level as well as for
managers right so engineering manager
engineering director etc etc Rent the
Runway actually open sourced hours we
put ours online so that anybody could
use them take them copy them modify them
and a lot of people apparently have I've
heard from people all over the world who
have used this as a starting point which
is awesome
those letters ladders I'm very proud of
them I'm very proud of the work that the
team and I did together to create those
but they came from failure the first
failure being that we didn't have
ladders at all we were just kind of a
team with people with random titles
senior iOS engineer all right systems
engineer junior web developer that
didn't really correspond to anything
they weren't correlated together they
were just kind of random depending on
when you got recruited and pay was kind
of random like it wasn't all over the
place but it was a little bit all over
the place so that was a failure and we
knew we needed to fix it
so I created the very first version of
our engineering ladders and it looks
something like this
very very basic the the D and D
characteristics are awesome I can't take
credit for that I actually stole that
from a different teams ladders but I
kept their format actually which was
super basic very little information and
I gave it to the team and I put people
in levels and I said here you go here's
the levels here's the ladder go forth
and
you know and whatever now it was good
that we did this exercise because now we
kind of knew what levels people were at
and we could recruit for things but this
was still a failure it was still a
failure because in trying to make
something basic I wanted people to not
obsess about their levels and not obsess
about this whole career ladder thing but
instead I made it very ambiguous which
actually made people obsess a lot more
right they didn't have a role in the
creation of this document and they were
really afraid this is the kind of
structural failure that we've all
experienced and we probably all remember
so we went back and we created something
better and this is and it's snippet from
the existing one I'm not gonna leave it
on the screen because there's way too
much text on there you can google it and
find them online the point is that I
went away and took a bunch of the other
people on the team and we together
created something that was a lot more
transparent there was a lot more and
well-understood that was created not
just by me off in a corner somewhere but
by me and the other senior members of
the team and then I used inspiration
from external people and then I gave it
back out to everyone in the world so
that they would have a good starting
point when they decided to do this for
their own startup teams so the lesson
here is that yes my structures have all
started from points of failure and
they've all gone through these points of
failure but what I have found is over
and over and over again as I've
interrogated these failures I've created
something better by being transparent
about them by learning from them and by
encoding those lessons into the
structures which brings us to what you
can do so the learning review how many
people are familiar with this term
learning review ok very few of you it's
it is it is a rebranding of the term
blameless post mortem which I hope more
of you are familiar with right what does
a blameless post mortem something goes
wrong and instead of you know pointing
fingers and saying Bridget screwed up
Bridget fat-fingered that command she
doesn't know what she's doing we
shouldn't let her you know have root
access on the boxes anymore Sava will
solve our problem you say well you know
why why do we have anyone with root
access right why was Bridget forced to
fix this at 3 o'clock in the morning
why did this thing go wrong in the first
place what what are all the different
factors and causes and try to do it in a
way that's not blaming someone right
because there's usually not really a
single person to blame there's usually a
lot of little things that combine to
create these failures learning reviews
blameless post-mortems
are an amazing opportunity for you to
interrogate structure and learn from it
and make it better right
so interrogate structure whenever you
see failure and try to ask yourself how
can we make this a little bit better one
final note that I'll leave you on though
processes tend to fail when they tell
people exactly how to do something right
checklists have their place in this
world but if you find yourself relying
on career scon creating processes that
are very very explicit sets of steps
that a human must follow in order to do
something see if you can't automate that
because humans are not really very good
at following very precise steps you may
have found I certainly have processes
are best when they help you understand
what needs to be done not necessarily
exactly pinpoint how to do it all right
so effective delivery what the heck does
a relatedness have to do with effective
delivery all right you might sort of by
structure maybe relatedness what is
relatedness relatedness is feeling like
you belong it's feeling like you're a
member of a family like you're a member
of a team like the people that you're
working with care about you as a human
being you care about them as a human
being doesn't mean your best friends
doesn't mean you know you feel like
they're family but makes you feel
comfortable and related to them when I
was an individual contributor I was
really good at sacrificing developing
relatedness for efficiency and focus so
I was one of those people who would like
come to work and work for four hours and
be very focused I would go to the gym I
don't want you to talk to me at the gym
because gym is not for socializing and
then come back eat lunch at my desk be
focused for another four hours and go
home
I didn't do a lot of coffees I didn't do
a lot of lunches I did occasionally do
drinks after work right um I was an
individual contributor I was working
with like five other people regularly
I got to know them through the course of
doing work but I really didn't
understand why all these more senior
people especially like the managers like
did all this small talk stuff what they
asked to me about how I was and why do
you care about that stuff it's not work
I want to talk about work I'm interested
in work let's focus well I learned my
lesson remember I created a culture of
fear and that was one of the reasons
that I did it because I didn't really
spend a lot of time getting to know
people but if you want to create a
really effective team culture people
need to feel like they can be vulnerable
in front of one another so this diagram
that you're looking at the the picture
on the right is from Google Google did
all this study they have so many teams
so many peoples and they're very
data-driven so they did this study that
they've been talking about a lot
recently about what made their most
effective teams now we'll assume that
they're interviewing incredibly well
whether or not you buy in Google's
interview style they certainly are
interviewing very thoroughly but their
best teams had nothing to do with like
whether the people on the more the most
awesome engineers or not the number one
fundamental effort was whether or not
the members of those teams felt
psychological safety around one another
whether they felt safe to make mistakes
to ask questions and to fail around one
another that was the key that was the
key of gelling that team into absolute
effectiveness are there other elements
yes but that baseline psychological
safety was essential right if you look
on the pyramid there the pyramid is the
five dysfunctions of a team with the
baseline dysfunction being absence of
trust when you don't feel vulnerable 'ti
you often don't trust the people around
you and this is not the trust that your
peers can write code well right this is
not the trust in like just basic
abilities this is actually the trust in
intentions the trust that they are
trying to do what they think is best
when you don't have relatedness you
don't have vulnerability you don't have
trust and all of these erode the ability
for teams to effectively work and
deliver together to correct this start
by learning how to apologize especially
if you are in any kind of leadership as
and that includes those of you who are
simply senior engineers somebody's
looking up to you and you're gonna make
mistakes sometimes and when you make a
mistake it is okay to simply apologize
say I'm sorry and move on you don't have
to have an elaborate apology you don't
have to you know defend yourself just
apologize because the thing is that when
you don't apologize especially in a
leadership position when you make a
mistake and you don't apologize it or
admit it people start to internalize
that they start to say oh well communal
made a mistake but she didn't apologize
she kind of just ignored the issue and
swept it aside that must mean that it's
shameful to make mistakes that must mean
that mistakes are bad that we don't
admit mistakes we were only care about
appearing strong right strong and
resilient and I never make a mistake and
I must be perfect and that is terrible
for effective teams you want people to
feel capable of making mistakes right
especially in a start-up environment
you're trying to push your team's a
little bit past their breaking point
sometimes you want them to push
themselves you want them to take risks
some of those risks are not gonna pay
off that's okay but if you want me to
take risks they need to be safe feel
safe failing which means they need to be
able to fail and apologize for it and
move on one place that you can all
practice this relatedness beyond
apologizing is when you're doing your
interviews interviewing it's kind of a
drag especially if you're in a team
that's growing really fast and you're
having to interview a lot and it
interrupts your coding time and all you
want to be doing is just like I want to
be thinking about this problem and
you're distracting me and it's super
frustrating and sometimes we take it out
on the people that we're interviewing in
fact often we take it out on the people
that were interviewing I'm sure many of
you have had that experience I've had it
plenty of times where someone has been
interviewing me and it's clear that they
are just like I'm a waste of their time
and I've probably given people that same
experience practice developing just a
little bit of relatedness at the
beginning of your interview ask the
person how their day is going you know
offer them a little chance to go to the
bathroom get a drink of water just take
a little bit of time to say hey you know
how's your day going like how was your
night how are you feeling something
innocuous something that just shows that
you care about them a little bit as a
person that you're interested in getting
to know them a little bit as a person
right because you never know this person
that you're interviewing even when
you're in a bad mood may end up being on
your team and now you feel a little bit
more of a connection with them and when
you're interviewing probably what you
want to do is not just figure out you
know do they match these skills or not
the best interviews you're trying to get
someone to their edge of their skills
you want to figure out where is the edge
of their skills which means you want
them to make mistakes in front of you
you want them to fail in front of you so
that you can discuss those failures and
they are more likely to do that if they
feel comfortable around you again
relatedness relatedness is also
important because it helps us foster
healthy conflict you might think that I
would say we shouldn't have conflict a
lot of teams especially in the United
States I believe there's like a huge
fear of conflict that's happening these
days where people just really are afraid
to say you know that they disagree with
something they feel like it's just
there's no room for that but conflict is
good I think conflict is actually a
pretty healthy thing when you have a
disagreement with someone when you and
someone else disagree and you disagree
sort of this isn't like a moral
disagreement right you're having an
intellectual disagreement the conflict
is what helps you get all that data all
that information into the open you want
to understand I'm a I'm a smart person
they're a smart person we disagree on an
approach why do we disagree let's get
the data that each of us knows into the
open so that we can evaluate it more
thoroughly that being said this is a
photo of me with my going-away gift
from my team at Rent the Runway it is a
very heavy fitness hammer
they have CrossFit here and in Denmark
yeah maybe a little bit I could suck it
see the Danes being kind of into it so
this is a picture of me with a very
heavy fitness hammer sort of popularized
by CrossFit esque
exercise
and my nickname at work was the hammer I
think maybe work as a hammer
you know partly because I am really cool
with conflict I'm comfortable getting in
there and expressing my opinions very
firmly well as you can imagine as a
leader that's also not really a great
thing when your boss comes in and
forcefully slams the table and says
you're wrong you're not listening to me
this is what I said this is where we're
going done very very very occasionally
that might be the right thing to do but
probably not it just makes you shut down
it makes you not want to share
information that also shuts down that
flow of information which is the whole
purpose of conflict so too much conflict
is not great either in both cases
whether you are conflict verse or like
me conflict you know grabbing replace
that conflict with curiosity just try to
replace that desire to argue or that
fear of argument with a desire to ask
questions and be curious about why
someone has a different perspective than
you right most people when it when you
ask with genuine curiosity not fake
curiosity not the oh really you don't
know that I I just can't believe you
don't know that not fake curiosity real
curiosity right real honest curiosity
they open up right there have people are
happy to share and they can tell when
you are being honest and open and asking
them questions which leads us are a very
very very final point right you want
curiosity because you want to have a
workplace where you go into those
meetings and you have really effective
communication and you don't have a lot
of boring meetings there are a lot of
workplaces with boring boring meetings
right either because they have too many
meetings or pretend potentially because
the meetings that they have are far too
scripted I'm not a fan of highly
scripted meetings most of the time
because I think that you actually can
shut people down right and that's not
necessarily the best way to run these
kinds of conversations a meetings should
not consist of a group of people who
have little to say until after the
meeting right that's
of a boring meeting meetings are our
highest bandwidth communication
opportunity as a team whether you're in
the same room or you're on a call
because your remote or whatever the goal
of meetings goal of having meetings is
that focused high bandwidth
communication remember what I said
scaling is hard because communication
and coordination are hard
well if communication and coordination
are hard why would you want to waste
your precious high bandwidth
communication opportunities don't but if
you have a bunch of boring meetings
you're definitely wasting them right you
want healthy conflict so that you can
have meetings where people can actually
express their opinions and you can
discuss real issues so to summarise move
fast right engineers like to ship if you
if you aren't moving fast if you're
reluctant to move fast just get over it
I've really encouraged you you will be
so much happier and your team will be so
much happier if you just constantly
focus on helping people do their job
faster and better right structure
neither good nor bad be transparent
about it and interrogate structure when
you have failures and improve it
practice being related with your
colleagues factors relating to people as
humans you don't have to be their best
friends you don't have to go to the bars
with them all the time but you know
asking questions how was your day how's
your dog how's that marathon you ran
whatever right you know asking questions
about their lives and getting to know
them as humans will make you care about
them it will make you them care about
you and will make your team more
effective and don't settle for an
environment where you can't ask
questions or you can't get into it where
you can't have active discussions where
most of your discussions are passive
discussions rather than active
discussions if we are willing to stand
fully in our own shoes and never give up
on ourselves then we will be able to put
ourselves in the shoes of others and
never give up on them
that is a quote from a woman named Pema
Chodron and I think it's important
because at the end of the day what I
learned in growing as a leader and in
grow
from this culture of fear to this
culture of trust is that I had to open
up myself I had to open up I had to
become more vulnerable I had to question
things that I had assumed had to be the
way they were and once I started doing
that all of a sudden things got easier
and my team got better and I really
learned that empathy is a learn about
skill like believe it or not when I
started asking people how their lives
were just a little bit I started caring
about them more and they started caring
about me more and I you know turned into
someone who is less cold and standoffish
and and more you know demanding but
inspiring right and I think what's the
point in scaling a team what's the point
of scaling a team was a point in scaling
a company if you end up working with
people that you hate and with that we
are done here are some of the resources
that are referred to as Dan said I am
writing a book if you are interested in
that please stay tuned early next year
out of O'Reilly and I am happy to take
any questions or comments and otherwise
I'll let you all go thank you
so we have a couple of questions one one
I suspect is quite fast the other one is
is a bit of bit chunky I really like
this I've heard 10x developers refer to
as technical debt loan sharks what do
you feel about this statement so 10x
developer says technical jet debt loan
shark loan sharks you know here's what I
think right I think that it's very hard
for people especially if you have worked
your whole career at stable to large
companies to appreciate that you need
those loan sharks when you are in a very
early stage company and that there are
people who are just like amazingly good
at spinning out new code when there's a
total greenfield environment it's bad
it's often usually even bad code but
they're really good at doing it the the
thing is that like they're not 10x
developers they're just really
productive early-stage startup
developers and you're right they are a
producing code that is probably not
gonna send the test and the test of time
but when you are in a start-up you don't
know if your company is going to stand
the test of time
the code is less important than the
company and it is extremely rare that
the code is what makes the company not
stand the test of time unfortunately for
all of us who come into these companies
when they're a little bit more stable
and they need bailing out and you have
to deal with all this loan shark e debt
code yeah like that's that is
unfortunate that's an unfortunate
situation but you know I just I kind of
want to balance it to just be mindful
that like there is a time and a place
for producing that kind of work and that
that is why we always say 10x developers
if they exist are really a function of a
culture and an environment the right
environment for them is what makes them
so productive but yeah I don't know
anyway long story short there's a time
and a place for all that technical debt
you're lucky to survive your first two
years as a start-up but yes you probably
don't want that person spinning out
reams and reams and reams of code in
your stable large team environment
because they'll just drive everyone
crazy
fantastic thanks I have one other
question though I suspect might be a
whole other talk which is how do you
build up a distributed team how do you
build up a distributed team I am NOT an
expert in that I think that Bridget
might there might be a talk tomorrow by
Bridget
at the end of the day toward the end of
the day talking about distributed teams
distributed teams are hard and you kind
of have to I think the the best the best
best practices out there today are if
you want to do a distributed team you
really need to from the beginning be
thinking about how to effectively be
distributed right a lot of companies I
know that have effective attributed
teams even when there are people who
work in the same office together they do
all of their meetings on video chat even
with the people who are in the same
office right to force that concept of
like we are all nobody is assumed to be
in the same place at the same time but
that is a whole nother talk hopefully
Bridget will touch on some of those
points tomorrow and yeah and I'm not
really an expert in Milan anyway
I'm saying lots of nothing from Bridget
so whoever asked that question this is
you've come to the right conference it's
on the wrong day so we've got another
couple of minutes so does anyone have
any questions that I can run around with
this microphone and shut up over there
let's go there hey you were talking
about how we need to build a culture
that failure is good you have to learn
so the failure people should not be
afraid of it but at the same time you
said that you should apologize if
mistakes happen how do you reconcile
these two if you start saying I'm sorry
it's like the mistake is something wrong
right I think it depends on the kind of
thing that you're apologizing for right
so like there is me there are times when
you have set up to fail when you're like
we're running an experiment that might
fail right you're not gonna apologize
for a failed experiment oh that sucks
you know move on but in most
environments where you want people to
take risks
sometimes what they're gonna do is
they're gonna move before asking right
and sometimes in moving before asking
they're gonna screw up something that is
not a good thing
right that digit that does deserve an
apology oh I should not have deleted all
of that code and pushed to prod without
talking to the person who wrote it
because I thought that I was you know
just like getting this thing done and I
really didn't understand the context
that I was working in okay I'm sorry
right I'm sorry I screwed up yes I took
a risk right and I'm in a company where
we are encouraging people to take risks
but sometimes those risks do come with
sort of the human and team cost and they
deserve an apology when your wrist when
you take a risk that you either know or
don't know but ultimately ends up having
a human or team cost that is when you
apologize right when you take a risk
that is just an experiment that's kind
of like we know we're gonna run
experiments and sometimes they'll
succeed and sometimes they're fit
they'll fail you don't need to apologize
for that so I have another question is
coming on the app so I'm sure this is
asking for a friend but when you're in
an org organisation managed by fear
where do you start to change it ask you
for a friend
yeah when you're in an organization
managed by fear where you start to
change it I mean so my my experience the
flora and fauna I've seen from other
people the biggest thing about
organizations managed by fear is that
they they often have just like certain
behaviors they you kind of have to stop
so yelling as I mentioned right yelling
not awesome berating people blaming that
sort of whole like series of
interrelated behaviors is definitely a
huge contributor to culture of fear and
getting rid of those is is important and
you you know part of that really means
that the senior most people especially
if they're the ones who are yelling need
to learn how to stop doing it they're
the ones who are yelling or blaming or
criticizing publicly they need to take
it down if they're not the ones that are
doing it but there are other people on
the team who are they are letting
behave that way then it's the job of the
managers to pull people aside and say
hey you know what
that's not cool we need you know we want
you to be respectful of your peers here
or want you to be respectful of the
other people on the team and I know that
we've let this go for a long time but we
need you to stop all right that I think
is that sort of just basic behavior
right read about blameless post-mortems
and start doing that if you're not if
you're if failure is treated with a lot
of blaming blameless post boardrooms
actually can be a really great practice
to just add to just you know just to get
rid of that habit as a team fantastic I
think we can take one more question one
more one more question why did I make it
this hard thank you okay so maybe I
missed a point of it but the define
titles the exact purpose of that what
was that was it the exercise oh you mean
that for the engineering career ladder
yeah so so the purpose of it and this
you know I can't know how cultural this
is right it may not apply nearly as much
to those of you who live here in Denmark
in the States at least so the purpose of
it is a few things first is helping
people understand what the progression
through certain levels of recognized
success is in a company so you know when
do my senior engineer how do how do I
know what that looks like what what are
the things that I need to have
accomplished I need to have shown
ongoing strengthen in order to get from
a person straight out of college
straight out of school to becoming a
senior engineer
alright that's that's you know that is
not determined by numbers of years on
the job that's not determined by any one
simple metric it's actually determined
by a set of you know accomplishments and
attributes that you have gained as an
engineer over time so in the States
these these levels you know we use them
for hiring so we say hey I want to hire
someone and I need
hire someone who's at least a senior
engineer for example into this position
because that's kind of the level of
Independence that I need I need to hire
an engineering director it's helpful as
a manager and as a leader to help people
understand what areas they might need to
work on so when you're writing reviews
coaching people saying hey like you're
awesome you're a great engineer but
you're kind of a jerk to people and
that's holding you back and it's very
clearly laid out in this sort of
communication and leadership column it's
also for frankly for paying people most
companies in the States
pay is tied to some extent to what layer
you are its what level you are rather
and it helps actually like be explicit
about like look if you are a senior
engineer or a staff engineer if you are
really senior person on a team there is
something to be said for someone who has
really proven and shown that they have
the experience necessary to make good
decisions for rewarding and recognizing
that right and that's not to say that
that person should shout down more
junior people to them but I do think
that we lose something when we refuse to
when we pretend like everyone's the same
and we're all the same level because
that's just not true in most teams
especially not large teams so those are
some of the reasons that that we did it
and then we use them cool and with that
we're out of time so thanks very much
come out thank you
