the most the most buzz words in my title
except in and uh you know their their
field words that just make the name
longer my name is TBA lukovitch
shortening TB I've been around for a
while I've done development and hydro
technology advisor because I've done a
lot of training a lot of consulting and
not going in and you know punching the
hours just helping people understand
technologies help to keep people you
know taking the leap starting with the
new programming language starting with a
new framework and lately what I've done
was starting to work as director of
technology for a company where I help
our customers to move to the cloud you
know I would have put the digital
transformation in the title you know how
to be nimble and agile when you did
digital transformation I don't think
would have been the right choice of
words or the buzz would be enough in
there Microsoft is a most valuable
professional why I have no idea but they
think you know I'm more the word in case
you didn't notice so far i'm a geek but
you don't know it's on father as well i
have two lovely daughters we can find me
on Twitter as Tibor 19 and if if you put
the hashtag go to LDN people will be
able to track it and see if there is
anything of interest here so of course
there won't be any agility discussion
without this you know the job manifesto
and everybody knows that if you want I
can give you around 10 minutes to read
it and I'm assuming you already know
what's in there but most of the people
forget is you know this the footnote the
small thing here that is while we're
there is value on the items in the lead
in the right we valued items in the left
more and one of the problems have seen
over time you know people are just
taking stuff out of context they are
just reading and they say oh we want
working software over comprehensive
documentation and the way they do that
they put documentation sprint at the end
and of course the customer doesn't have
the money for the documentation and the
customer just gets the just gets the
working software sorta
or individuals and interactions over
processes and tools how many of you are
doing the you know the daily stand-up
just because someone tells you that you
have to do a daily stand-up without
actually giving any we're not actually
getting any feedback or understanding
why do I do that why do you do that and
when you ask why there are very few
people able to tell you why or you do
all the scrum board just because you
know someone might walk by and you will
do busy you know they will see stuff
moving around so although you were not
you know you are not trying to stall or
anything the value are bringing is not
really a good value cuz the customer
collaboration over contract negotiations
and so on and my pig pig is actually
scrum why because what was promised was
something like this you know everything
gets nice and everybody works together
and we are actually trying to achieve a
common goal or at least you know to
solve the problems that the customer
asked us to solve but what happened is
that the customer sees it like this I
don't know the light it a little bit too
bright on this one but you don't see the
customer here actually I know which is
at the bottom of the scrum and everybody
Trump's on him and there you know and
nobody understands the requirements
anymore or perfect so now you see the
customer you see he's here suffering and
we are the developers we are on top on
him and all we try instead of solving
his problem creating more or as the
developers is it you know everything
it's muddy we have our scrum master he
screams at us he tells us what do we
need to do how do we need to solve that
and a lot of other discussions like like
this so one of the things that I really
appreciate about the claddagh and you
know looking lately at how people start
to develop software and how how the
cloud can help us is the fact that we
can abstract away the infrastructure
this was our biggest problem from the
very beginning we have a production
system and more or less we are locked
into that we need to make sure that our
development system mimic the production
system our test environment may make the
action system and everything is locked
in god forbid you know come with some
idea of patching the production machine
or doing something better because
everybody is scared and nobody knows of
course we have another buzzword I should
have put that in the title as well
DevOps you know so maybe that would
brought even more people to my session
today but one no can you turn it off
click oh I got it yes okay okay thank
you so doing you know looking at the way
we are trying to do you know and develop
our applications it becomes pretty you
know pretty interesting to try to find
an answer to the you know to the
question how do we update our production
system or how do we treat our
infrastructure as an artifact as a part
of what we are developing so we
shouldn't be you know locked into that
if you I don't know by show of hands how
many of you are developers okay so
everyone and I'm how many of you have
problems with IT department whenever
they need a machine something how long
how long it takes until you get it so if
we look at you know let's see we decided
how you know what applica what our
application is to do we start the
development so the very first thing we
look at you know is how can we actually
provision a local network or you know
some environment that we need for test
for whatever the very first thing you do
will order the hardware and of course it
has to go through procurement it has to
go through all the approvals your boss's
boss needs to approve it or depending on
the you know how big is your the
organization you go all the way up to
the CEO of the company for approval
image of a machine because you really
need to do the testing and most of the
time we got the machines we put them in
place and what happens we use them a
couple of days we did our test and then
yeah maybe we remember about them in a
month or two and we use them again and
so on of course when you get the
hardware that's only the first part then
you have to go and speak with your IT
department they need to install it they
need to configure it they need to start
to start actually setting up your
network and then after they set up the
network they need to set up the servers
put them in
place then install OS could patch it and
whatever whatever whatever and then T
until you get the machine so you can
start using it when you got the machine
you install your application and then
you start configure it so how long do
you think it takes something like that
in an agile era two weeks three weeks
it's a lot of time and I mean I want to
prove some theories I want to try
something out to make sure that whatever
I'm you know I'm trying to solve this
sprint I'll be able to try it out I want
to be able to test it i want to be able
to even run it may be against production
data in a you know pin some kind of
isolated environment but because of all
those problems it should be difficult
for us to to to realize that so how do
you do in the cloud well regardless of
what provider you choose most of them
have exactly the same kind of approach
the cloud at the end of the day is
nothing more than just an abstraction
and you have three building blocks
that's that's it is nothing more nothing
else you have storage you have network
you have compute those are the three
building blocks that you would have of
course you can do all kinds of
combinations you can get all kind of
compute when your infrastructure you can
get a sequel server you can get to
couchdb server whatever whatever if you
know you need you can you can get there
and the operating system as well so if I
want to do something similar in the
cloud I would use the infrastructure you
know I would have to configure the
storage because I'll need to save all
the information somewhere on someone
else's hard drive and then I would need
to configure my virtual network it's
still a network but I still need to
configure it then I have to deploy the
virtual machine of course it would be
difficult for me to go with a DVD and
put it somewhere because it's someone
else's computer that i'm using so I'm I
need to make sure you know that I I have
a gallery or something like a library
where I can where I can get the
necessary images I need to configure
something like a load balancer or
whatever if I want to you know to really
have a good infrastructure if I want to
make sure that the infrastructure is
actually it's stable if I don't have any
requirements for hand you know high
availability then I can just go and do
you know one machine of each and they
just tested and I will assume that
everything works at least for the
duration of my test then I will install
the application I will configure the
applications and this is actually
something that can be done far more
quicker just as a little demo I've been
doing a lot of a lot of customer
engagement even customer that said to us
you know what we both we bought a
subscription from Microsoft and we want
to use our sure but we don't know how so
the very first thing they get I'm afraid
what if i press something wrong what if
i start actually paying money for
something that i really don't need or I
don't know how to use and Microsoft uses
you know I don't know how many of you
are using sharepoint oh good my
condolences what can I say yeah it's a
you know in my experience I would just
say sharepoint each one of the you know
it's the worst asp.net application that
was ever written unfortunately it's very
used by a lot of people and is not is
not much we can do about it but you know
such is life so if I go you know and try
to do something for instance in my you
know being my a sure Bob portal I just
go to the portal itself and then from
the portal I'm let me refresh here from
the portal I can choose what do I want
to deploy what do I want to create in my
you know in my virtual machine in my
virtual environment so what Microsoft
uses as you know as the biggest demo
ever and when you want to show or
impress a customer what is the bigger
thing you could do they just go here and
say I want to create something new I
want to create a new virtual machine and
then actually what I want to create it a
shirt it's a sharepoint server farm and
they start the discussion you know how
much it takes you know how do you know
you need to do it in right order and
everything needs to be done in right
order and if you don't keep your foot
like this and your finger like this your
sharepoint server farm definitely won't
work and you will have a problem so we
have the solution you just go in here
now you press the button angry
even tell me do you want something to be
high availability or do you want it to
be you know just for your test
environment how do you want to deploy it
and when you do that you know it takes
around two hours which is actually a
very good improvement it's still not
very quick but it's a very good
improvement compared with what would you
get if you want to do a deploy a manual
deployment of SharePoint so ask any IT
product has done that you know they'll
do it once or twice and they will stop
doing that because it's such such a
bloody experience no one wants to do it
another way to you know a simpler way to
do it is just go here do a compute and I
say I want a new machine or I can look
at the marketplace and I can choose some
existing machines button at the moment
oh look even that you get as a first
thing here you can do it you know that's
so you get it in a very first page you
can choose whatever machine you want
they have a very big library of machines
that you can just create and deploy all
if you go into the old port o you can
even access some of the machines that
are specifically made for their msdn
subscribers so if I want a machine with
visual studio 2015 it takes me around
five to ten minutes to get it deployed
and just start working on it so if i
look at my gallery here I can choose
whatever I want I will say give me the
msdn images i will take a visual studio
2015 Enterprise Edition running on the
windows 8 dot one and then I say
continue I will give it a name demo go
to tell the end what kind of machine I
want and based on how many you know how
many horsepowers do I need in my machine
I can choose the one or the other a user
to access the machine I think I need to
learn how to spell my name password and
again password thing Microsoft doesn't
like that to come on so that's something
that they just add it come on two three
four yes two three four yes now I got
the episode
so it's password 1234 so you know I
created the machine it asked me if I
want to add it into a cloud service a
cloud service is an abstraction layer so
I can you can consider that as the rock
where you install your your virtual
machine in there you can configure your
network you can say which ports do you
want to use how do you want to use them
if I want to have a dns name normally
you want to have that especially if you
want to access that vibe you know via
rdp and via internet so you get actually
an end point where you can connect from
your local machine and access that
remote desktop where do I want to place
it I would rather have it quite close so
it's easier for me to access it
availability set if I want to have
several machines that are complementing
each other and I want to have something
you know like high availability
configuration I need to configure that
as well but because this is my
development machine I don't I don't care
do I want to access remotely the machine
via powershell I would leave the Power
Cell port open if not I just remove it
and then I say next and then it will
tell me what else do you want to do if
you work with puppet or chef old you
know if your machine has support for
this kind of do you want in your
configuration need support for these
kind of things and you use like desire
state configuration that's a very neat
way of doing it and I press next and
then it will just start doing that and
it won't take long everything will be
done you know in like 10 minutes top and
I i'm convinced that by the end of our
our session that would be done another
way I've seen that used by Microsoft
internally is whenever they come up with
a new version of visual studio if they
want us to test it as MVPs they give us
a link I activate a link and that the
link would automatically provision a new
machine for me because they are using
shadow copy it takes no more than 30
seconds to get the new machine provision
for me to be able to use it you can even
use remote applications with visual
studio so there there are a lot of
things that you can do and you can
actually start being agile in a manner
that you can create the stuff that you
need there are a lot of discussions
again when you go and talk with the IT
pro department
they are very scared now that you know
you won't need them or you will but not
the way you used to need them before
that you go to them and they can block
you for two weeks and not doing stuff
for you now even have access to do to do
those things so what they can do they
can give you access they can give you a
quote on tell you how long you know how
much money are you allowed to spend for
instance so you won't go wild you know
and then deploy a Hadoop cluster with 32
notes that will you no will actually
render the company broke so you have I
have this control you can tell exactly
what kind of services do they have
access to if you want you can create
that services for them and just give
them access to the services so they
don't have access to that so you can
still control that another very
important point a lot of people do not
take into consideration is the fact that
those machines can be turn off and on at
any time when you turn it off because
you don't need it what happened you
don't pay you pay for the storage by the
storage is very cheap you pay like a
pound per month for a I don't know 400 I
know 150 gigabyte or something like that
so if you create a machine and you keep
it off for a whole month you Oh
Microsoft one pound for that so it's not
that much money anyway that you have to
pay for doing that but you know that as
soon as I need something if I want to
turn it on I just turn it on of course
if I want to create a network I can
create a network if I don't want those
machines to be available on the internet
so I don't want to have any public
boards open for you know for the
machines I can just create a little
Network and they have various solutions
like I came from my computer connect
into a network on the cloud and my
computer would be part of a virtual
network in the cloud and I can access
all the machines that did you know as
would they be next to me I know that one
of my biggest problem as a developer is
to get the database server up and
running I do a sequel express or I do a
sequel local but it's not really you
know I'm not really happy about it all
the time so what I have to do instead
you know is to create another virtual
machine somewhere on you know on my own
server at home just to have a database
just to run some of the tests and see
how it's working and completely forget
about it and then I have a bunch of hds
that they are just you know growing and
growing
I'm not doing anything with them with
this I know oh I use the server now I
can turn it off I can even create the
database is straight into the cloud I
don't even need to have access to the to
the server itself but this is a bit of a
problem the way I see it at least let me
go back to my presentation which is this
which is this I don't have any
automation or at least not so far and
without automation this becomes a
tedious process you would have to always
remember to put in some names to put in
some values to vote in some stuff and
again you need to reconfigure all the
stuff so if I want to do with some
automation the way I would do it i would
look at what is you know that i can that
i need to repeat what exactly is it if i
look at my configuration right now okay
so i have those two machines that they
need names they would need you know
network interfaces they would need a
storage account they would need a
virtual network because they need to
communicate with each other they would
need a local database or a database
server connected to the same virtual
network and so on and so on so I can do
all of these you know I can look at them
and try to identify them when identify
them I can use to build automation
different build automation processes to
create that until now the most common
way was to do everything via powershell
so Microsoft had a very let's say
imperative way of doing all those
deployments but now to introduce
something else that it's called Asha
resource manager which as a resource
manager is more declarative way of
creating your environment and whenever
someone asks me what's the difference
between the clarity and imperative I
used to you know I use my wife as an
example so if she asked me to go buy
some milk if she does it in an
imperative way she will tell me
something like this go into the hallway
take your shoes don't forget tonight you
know to knit your yeah you should yeah
choose then go downstairs turn right go
200 meters go inside Tesco go you know
back on the last row there pick a box of
Milk you know go to the cashier pay come
back don't forget to take off your shoes
put it in the fridge thank you you know
and we thank you which is a very
imperative way of doing it you know it
tells me every single step detailed like
I would be you know my seven-year-old
daughter if she would use a declarative
way of doing she just says you know or
assertive she will say we need milk or
declarative she would say go buy milk
what's the advantage of the one and the
other the advantage of go buy milk
versus you know go take your shoes and
stuff like that it first I know up front
what she wants second if she changes her
mind she doesn't have to you know go
back the whole story and say no no no
wait wait a second you need to go into
the whole way and then when you get into
this tesco you need to go there an end
there she will just say go buy milk go
buy yogurt and then I go and buy both of
them and you know in my mind I can
actually I am able to do some
optimization of the process so I'll be
able to actually realize that I don't
have to go twice to the tesco to both by
the milk end of the yoga tai will do
everything in one single step and the
same goes here when you use a
declarative approach to solve your
problems makes it easier for someone
else to you know to read it to
understand it because believe it or not
your code actually would or whatever you
are producing you know as an artifact
would be read far more many times than
you are writing it you know especially
if it's the you know if you need to to
maintain it and your code will run
eventually and of course when you've
done your configuration in a declarative
or imperative manner you need to execute
it and when you execute it you get
everything deployed one other advantage
with them as your resource manager is
that it uses something called desired
state configuration so it means what I
want to do is I want to get into this
state with my you know with my with my
environment be you know my production my
staging my tasting a testing environment
whichever I need to get to this state so
if I want to change something it smart
enough to realize oh the state you are
in right now is this machine this
machine this machine this machine what
would you you would need to get to the
desired state is to add this and this
and configured this and that
and then just that did instead of
redeploying everything from the very
beginning if you have multiple
environment you can just parameterize
that and then execute based on your
parameters and the nice part is that
Microsoft actually offers now a whole
gallery of stuff that you can run in the
cloud you know using arm so if you look
here I can just go and say oh I would
need a you know starting template with
some validation and I will start from
there because I already need I already
know what I need to do or actually you
know what I want to create a the same
thing that i done earlier with visual
studio I want to create it now as part
of my deployment so I will go and say I
want the visual studio development vm
and this is the explanation this is how
it works everything it's public and
github you can just fork it and you can
change it as you wish and when I'm done
with it I would just go here and say
deploy to usher what it does it takes me
straight into the portal it gives me all
the parameters that I have in my
template gives me a chance to fill in
the parameters and then when i press
execute goes on and start executing all
the stuff that I need to do so let me
see here where was it not this one this
one so this one is still running and
trying to provision let me put some
parameters here demo TG I want to use a
standard storage again i would use west
europe vm name would be demo vs go to
tell the end that's the beautiful
machine name a user name again TB now i
need to put password
one two three four the password here the
size that I want and what version I want
again I want 2015 enterprise with Azure
sdk on windows 8 Note one now and the
dns name let me use the previous name
from here which was it this copy paste
cancel I need to press ok first yes of
course ok I can create a new resource
group when you create a resource group
it's like a folder for your files so
every single artifact that you are
creating it would end up in this in this
folder the biggest advantage with having
a resource group is that when i'm done
with it i can just go and remove the
whole resource group I don't have to
remember which storage I had you know
created what was the name of the virtual
machine what was the name of the network
what was the name of the database
everything would be in one resource
group that i can i can actually manage i
can even create you know give users
permissions on the resource group level
i can say ok you get access to that
resource group meaning that it can get
access to my vehicle machines you can
get access to all the configurations and
all the stuff that i was adding in there
so i don't have to go on eating the
individual artifact you know like item
in my configuration to create that and
the resource group would be demo RG LDN
create there is an error yes I need to
say that I'm ok with the conditions it's
a bye but it actually are not buying
anything it's a little bit misleading
and now it's starting to do the
deployment and again it will take a
while maybe as long as it takes to those
oh this one it's already done so i can
say connect now it will give it will
give me an rdp file i can use this rdp
file and say connect
and I would say the user name was TB and
the password was password 1234 ok i
think it was password 1234 remember my
credentials ok was only one two tree i
think it's nothing it's the problem is
this TB it looks at the microsoft
account and there is no Microsoft
account called days one two three four
okay yes that's correct now now I have
the virtual machine and he took 10
minutes hmm thank you thank you and then
the other one will take us long now if
you want to do something a little bit
more advanced you always have visual
studio go figure so microsoft created
now a new type of project so if you look
at the cloud project that we have
available it's one called as a resource
group so part of my whole solution part
of my deployment i can actually deploy
now whole resource group in this one and
what i get is actually a JSON file and
by the way let me show you back here
when we look at those starters i have a
short deploy JSON file and I promised
yesterday that I would show some code on
the screen so this is it is not really
in my powerpoint presentation but this
is you know as as close as we get to
coding in this session the version of
the file and then you know what exactly
parameters we have available and then
what I need to do so my resource is that
I want to deploy first of all would be a
storage name and then I would have to
have a virtual network with some
properties for that and some sub
networks if I want to create those and
then a network interface card and after
that i would have to create a virtual
machine connected to that particular
virtual network and then i start the
deployment and it will do that and it
will create a public IP address
I've seen sometimes that when you try to
do that it fails because the IP address
that tries to allocate sometimes cannot
allocate it and then you just have to
retry and it will know oh this one was
missing let me add it for you and it
will work in visual studio I can choose
a resource group of course it's called
as a resource group 1 i'm very inventive
with the names let me see and then again
i'm moving quicker than my computer and
it doesn't like that and i can choose
some standard configuration like I want
a virtual machine to be created or I
want a web application process a plus a
sequel server or whatnot so you can
choose here you have some elements in
the gallery you can in a later version
would be able to populate your the
gallery with your own with your own
templates there and I have some script
that I'll that will be run this is my
power shell script this is the one that
will be used automatically to deploy
deploy the resources into a sure and the
templates that I need to be able in
order to be able to create application
so here gives me it gives me all the
information it's exactly the same thing
they are working on a visualizer as well
so we can actually create a layout of
your infrastructure here inside Visual
Studio and it will generate Jason behind
the curtains and it will put the wind
when you say deploy it will just do the
deployment for you so if I want now to
deploy I have a deploy option here I
haven't created any deployment in order
for me to be able to deploy I need to
configure my information and say where
do I want to put the data let me take
again the demo account i can use an
existing the network group or i can
resource group on or i can create a new
one let's do create create a new one the
name would be this why not I wanted out
automatically in West Europe i would say
create a resource group the template the
parameters the account name for storage
would be demo vs
STG username again TB password would be
password 1234 and dns name for public
access would be let's do that and then
what kind of visual of Windows version
do I want on that of course this is the
first step you can take then the virtual
machine and then you can add you know by
by means of desired state configuration
you can add your own your own features
of Windows you can have your eyes you
can have whatever you need you can add
it there I can say save and then i will
say deploy it will try to deploy it and
when is deployed i can go into the
interfere into that that is for the
following parameter yes i forgot to
press save password so now it starts to
create a deployment package sensitive to
usher and then it will do the deployment
and then when everything is done I will
see inside my visual studio exactly what
I had to do and what it did and it gives
me the output and then I can I can
follow this ok
so do i do this still there question
what do you think about it what does it
look not as scary as it was at the
beginning or or I don't know I usually
when I when I speak with customers and I
show them that they say oh it was that
easy yes it is that is he's not as as
scary as it seems and if i can create
three virtual machines in less than 40
minutes 35 minutes of presentation you
know and talk at the same time i don't
know if it's multitasking or it's really
something that can be used you know when
when you really need agility when you
are able to actually adapt to change ok
remember to rate the session i told you
the green button you know and thank you
questions done think it like savvy so
there's three questions one of the
questions is just one word so i'll just
read out the whole question testing of
what so it's the testing environment or
is the testing go of your of your
infrastructure how do you test your
production infrastructure today your
hardware how do you test it today you
have any i mean i don't know who what's
the question but how do you test it
today silence a lot of people don't
write all is the people in this room
don't because pics is in a data center
do all that and we hope that it's all
working yes or something so if you look
at I mean one of the things that I like
to tell people is if you decide to take
a dependency on you know on something
bigger like AWS or Arthur or whatever
cloud provider and they promised you a
certain level of agreement I think you
can pretty much sleep better at night
just because you know it's something in
place of course you can be as part
as you want and then you would be able
to get the 69 if you want a 69 but then
the question is is it worth it cost-wise
will it be worth it for you to have this
or not and then Microsoft for instance
at least in the Earned outer side they
have a lot of a lot of solutions for
this kind of scenarios fantastic um so I
think actually another thing that
occurred to me while you're answering
that is one of the things that this sort
of move does is it brings me as a
developer much closer to having to think
about testing why infrastructure yes
which is a thing I haven't really had to
think about before so what advice can
you give me for how to start reasoning
about us so I mean why not the way Stig
do testing for a structure physically is
that someone goes in and pull the plug
on the network or you know pulled up the
plugins on the whole on the whole
machine you can do something similar in
the cloud you have actually the
possibility to stop a machine and it
will just stop it without saving any
states or asking you do you are you
really sure you want to do that you know
hundreds of time so you can test
something similar and see what would
happen with my system in case of that
and there are you know one of the things
I really like about the way Microsoft
akasha is that they were trying to solve
the hardest distributed computing
problems so they didn't go and say oh we
have a bunch of machines in our data
centers that we are not using please
come and use them you know and pay us
some some money they were looking first
of all what is you know what is hard
today when you create a distributed
computing you know environment and from
that they grew actually into offering
virtual machines so between machines
came like two years after they start
offering you know cloud solutions for
two reasons one because they found a
very good appealing solution and two
because the customers were asking
Microsoft is more customer oriented than
than ever they listened to the customers
more than anyone would be you know
willing to admit but they are they are
actually doing a lot of stuff like that
so you have possibilities you can do
this kind of testing of course but some
of them you know it it has to do
actually we
you know the resilience of your system
or the ante fragility of your system in
the fridge did you put the shoes or the
milk in the fridge there was a
specification problem so now because it
was imperative you know my wife told me
exactly what I have to put in the fridge
so you know the fact that I didn't
repeat it correctly it's my problem it's
not you know it wasn't it wasn't her so
as a specification era x okay yeah I'm
sorry so the other the other one would
question i have is security ? so how
many of you that's the whole other track
going on yeah I know I know and then I'm
glad you have questions even answer to
many times okay so everybody talks about
security and everybody says oh if you
put everything in the cloud that's a
very big no-no because of the security
problems you might have Microsoft
actually does a lot of a lot of stuff
for specifically for that not only
Microsoft all the cloud providers and i
would actually i can actually say that i
think they're done of the best secured
environment that you would ever get so
as soon as you know if you believe that
what they do is secure and you try to
take your application you would be all
set but now the other question is how
many of you as developers because every
almost all of you raise their hands when
we were talking about you know who you
are are thinking about security when
they are developing applications yeah
two or three the high exactly what I
thought I I always have the same you
know the same problem i'm going and in
speaking with customers and the dancer i
get out that's not our problem you know
it's the IT department that needs to to
fix that and the question is how i mean
if you go to them and tell them they
need to fix your security the only thing
they know to do for you is to open port
80 and then you end up you know having
HTTP donating single protocol that is
allowed in every single organization of
the world or https because they heard
that you know can be more secure if you
use https but those are the only two
protocols and most of the times you as a
developer if you don't understand the
implications or dictate technology you
are using and the
curative implications of that then I
think it's you know it's more of our
problem than the IT pro guys problem in
my personal opinion couldn't agree more
and we have ok this is interested so how
about deploying boiler plates and full
stack applications or template
applications MV style style type things
in Azure so one of the things that I
don't know if I know I moved too quick
but exactly above my msdn checkbox was
my disks and my images so you can
actually take a machine you can do the
whole configuration how you need it and
then you can save the image and then you
can replicate it create new replicated
the image and create exactly a new new
machine if you want to do a complete
environment there is another interesting
thing that you could do here let me show
you you have an arm Explorer so you can
actually look at whatever you have
deployed in a sure you can look at it as
an as an arm template our resource
manager template and you can take that
particular template change the
parameters as you want you know the name
and the network and maybe the IP
addresses and stuff like that and then
just redeployed and then you don't have
to go you know click all the buttons
right all the names you know in
different text boxes and so on you can
just recreate that and you can read an
existing arm template to do that
fantastic and then one more quick
question so i'm i'm very new this whole
cloud thing you told me how easy it is
to create instances spin up instances
clone instances and all that when how do
i know that i need another instance of a
thing dude do we one is you wait for the
customers to correct it I just really
it's crap or actually there is something
called out of scaling both offer that
you know and you can base your auto
scaling either on the view no sip cpu
load time of day or memory load and so
on so based on you know based on various
parameters you can configure your your
auto scale so you say ok if i have a
load over eighty percent for more than
one minute or two minutes please spin up
on your machine and it will do an
identical machine of course the whole
stateless discussion is a different one
but it will spin up a completely new
machine that would do exactly the same
as the original one and then it
just you know help with with you know
serving the request and what whatever
you need and it like balances across the
aisle yes you can choose the kind of
load balancing you want if you want you
know if you want down dropping if you
want based on the load or hbu nope so it
if I'm not sure if you can even do
stickiness in you know like the session
stickiness at some point but you can do
that so it does that automatically so
you don't have to you don't have to do
it is not your have to save your
explicit responsibility to do it which
is which is very good you really want
the automation another way to automate
things is you know as I said you can
look at odd hours and say okay nan I
know that 9 a.m. every morning we need
to do you know all the sales guys are
coming in and they are running ourselves
you know but they go to Salesforce and
they run the reports and then I really
need you know I don't want them to wait
for one hour to get your report so
between nine and nine-thirty because I
would actually will take far more longer
if I far more next time I would say you
know what spin three more machines so
instead of you know taking a lot of time
to do one report I know for the you know
for the half an hour or have four
machines and everybody will get their
reports far quicker you can even shut
down your machine so if I have a test
environment that I know you know or my
development environment i know that i'm
using during the day i can actually go
in configure it and say you know what
every single evening at 7pm please turn
it off in the morning at eight-thirty
turn it on so by nine when i'm there
he's already started i don't have to
wait for you to to to get started and so
on Oh fantastic and very briefly then
then these guys can get a coffee ahead
of the next session and the so all looks
super easy to use how do you think it
compares in terms of ease of use to
something like Amazon I think that
that's the bottle that you know they
have did they will start fighting now
because the ease of use is the most you
know is the most appealing at the end of
the day they be if you really want to
compare you know in terms of what they
are offering they are pretty close to
each other of course there are some you
know people have some preferences they
would go with amazon if they come from a
linux background because they know that
Microsoft is not you know is not really
although it does not true anymore
and if you work with Windows most people
would tend to go to Microsoft although
we have big customers as well that are
going with Amazon we have actually
customers that require both of them so
they want to abstract even the cloud the
way you know the cloud provider they say
we don't want to take dependency on one
single cloud provider we want to use
both of them you know for various
scenarios like disaster recovery being
one of them you know like the single
most use case for that chrome fantastic
