about going about how to design the
right product for your customer and this
is a cautionary tale some of you may
remember in the 80s the Sinclair c5
which was a great bit of design and
really ahead of its time in terms of a
sustainable form of transport but it
it's now a museum piece and the reason
for that is there was lots of kind of
issues why people didn't really want to
use the Sinclair c5 it's very low quite
dangerous people felt they look stupid
in it so I think you know although it
was a great piece of design there was a
big lesson to be learned there about how
to develop and launch a product and for
me personally back in 2002 I was working
at a digital agency in near Cambridge
and we used to do a lot of mobile
development and at that time if you had
a mobile phone at that time you'll know
that the connection speeds were
absolutely appalling and we were trying
to design a search for like a second
hand car search for a company in England
and we thought we had a fantastic
product we thought it's really exciting
you know it's all based geolocation it's
quite you at time and so we developed
this application at the time spend lots
of time designing I designed lots of
wireframes and flows and really exciting
stuff we tested it a lot internally and
then we launched it and it was a
complete flop and we might as well have
to develop one of these so this is in
England we have this saying that
something's as much use as a chocolate
teapot and actually the real problem
with our particular approach to that
project was we made lots and lots of
assumptions so we didn't know anything
about the the customers using the
product except what our client told us
and we took that as there's the truth
and we also didn't go out and validate
any of the assumptions that we had about
how people might use this thing we just
kind of had ideas in our heads about how
it would work
and most importantly we didn't learn
anything about our customers our clients
customers and how they might use this or
how they already went about searching
for secondhand cars and unfortunately
there's a lot of other stories about
products or startups that have failed
because they haven't taken the right
approach with talking to or
understanding their customer needs so I
just randomly found this one through
doing a google search for startups that
have failed and this was a company that
was doing cloud-based software for
developers and what they were saying in
their kind of lessons learned blog when
they closed the company down was they
were very honest and they said that the
mistake they made was that they focused
far too much on the actual kind of
technical development and they didn't
take the time to go out and understand
whether they were building something
that would work for their customers or
even if they had some customers in the
first place so this is a really key
concept that I think's been more talked
about recently with Lean Startup which
I'll get onto and google ventures is a I
guess a kind of consulting company
within Google they go out and do use
design thinking and the kind of lean
startup approach with various different
startups and braden carrots who works
for google ventures it's got a great
blog post the links just down in the in
the bottom there but basically he says
the amount of times that he goes out and
talks to startup founders about whether
they've actually understood what it is
their customers need and what problems
they're trying to solve for their
customers and he says you know quite
often they're embarrassed to admit that
they haven't actually spoken to a
customer for months and they're just
busy too busy developing the product and
designing the product without knowing
whether it's actually going to solve the
customers problem and I think this is a
real treat and i know i've been very
guilty of this in the past that it's
very easy to design
software products that have way way too
many features you mean you get really
excited thinking you know oh well this
would be really cool if we could do this
and this would you know and then we
could kind of expand it and do something
even better and actually in reality your
users will only use a handful of of the
features in your product and i think you
know if you look at some of the bloated
software and i won't name any names but
a particular SAT a large company that
makes desktop products over the years
they've got very bloated and they've
learned that that you know scaling back
so the reason google i think has been so
successful is they've scaled right back
and the functionality is is just what
people need to use and there's actually
some research to back this up so the
Standish Group they basically gather
lots and lots of data and do some
analysis on this type of thing and what
they've found is that actually in
general about twenty percent of features
in software and only twenty percent ever
get used which is quite quite a shocking
amount if you think how much effort how
much time your teams put into developing
your software to think that only twenty
percent of that is actually useful to
your customers and they use the the
Pareto principle the 8020 principle and
they say there's no doubt that focusing
on twenty percent of the features that
give eighty percent of the value will
kind of maximize your investment in in
the software so from from that kind of
thinking there's there's various
different methodologies and approaches
to designing and developing software
which I've been learning about over the
years and trying to incorporate into the
way that I work so firstly a few years
ago probably about eight years ago now I
was working in local government and at
the time I did some training in lean and
the thing that I guess really struck me
about that was firstly this concept of
only delivering things that have value
to your customers
and the second thing was this idea of
Kaizen or continuous improvement and the
Toyota Production system kind of
approach to things is an approach that
in my last company regulate software we
took very seriously and in fact we used
to have Toyota consulting within the
company because we saw so much value for
the products we were working on and
again the principles of the agile
manifesto I started working in an agile
way back in two thousand eight and the
first principle up there our highest
priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery of
valuable software now I think in this
case actually the customer was the
client but I think it's still a useful
principle if you think about customer
being the end user of the software so
beyond that I then got interested in
some of the things that Steve Blank was
saying and Steve Blank wrote the startup
owner's manual with Bob Dorf I don't
know if any of you read that but it's a
really useful book particularly for
product managers like yourself at the
front and one of the interesting things
that you said in the book which is so
sort of common sense you think well
actually you know I should this is so
obvious but you said it's really
important that the whole team gets out
of the building so don't kind of sit
around waiting for facts to emerge
within your building you've got to get
out there and actually listen to your
customers and taking that a step further
I guess was there at Greece who wrote
the lean startup and this was a book
that in my last company when it came out
our chief executive for 150 copies it
went completely viral in our company and
we were all encouraged to read it and we
actually had Eric come over and talk to
us in two thousand and eleven or twelve
i think it was and really this is more
about kind of product development than
user experience but what eric was saying
was the real thing here is not can can
you build the product have you got the
of the ideas and the skills it's whether
you actually should be building it so
does it have a use in a value to your
customer so the principles of lean
startup are really about kind of
eliminating uncertainty there's this
idea of developing a minimum viable
product which is really something that
that's enough to give you evidence that
it will bring value to your customers
and I think the thing to remember here
is with it by saying Minimum Viable
Product it doesn't mean you know the
smallest amount of work you can do that
that isn't very good but that kind of
actually gets a reaction from your
customers I've made that mistake before
so when I worked in Red Gate we were
developing a product for Oracle
developers source control product and
one of the kind of issues where we were
developing a beta product and we were I
guess it was probably more alpha than
beta actually and we had a list of
people that we were in regular contact
with and we kept shipping releases very
very frequently and getting feedback
from them and what we found in ago on a
couple of occasions we just released
something too fast and it wasn't good
enough and people were very honest and
came back to us and said hey guys this
isn't up to your usual standard it's not
good enough so we learnt a lesson there
but Eric talks about this concept of
validated learning and there's a there's
a kind of a cycle in this and it's
really about kind of building a thing
and it doesn't have to be an actual Cove
piece of code it could just be a
prototype it could even just be a
website that people don't go and kind of
sign up for product that doesn't yet
exist just to see their interest I'm not
sure I totally agree that that's a great
thing to do because I think as a user if
you sign up to something you kind of
expect to be able to use that thing but
the idea of kind of constantly measuring
how people are using a product and what
feedback you're getting from them and
then iterating it and iterating the
direction it's going in
so although does this concept of
validated learning it's a bit of jargon
really and I guess the thing that that
really means is does the thing that
you're building solve a problem for your
customers or your end users and that
that's the key thing really so after the
lean startup thing had sort of blown up
and we all got very excited about it the
next thing that I came across was this
guy called Jeff got elf now Jeff is a
user experience designer he's based out
in the States and he was working for a
company called the ladders and Jeff is
the person who coined the term lean UX
and I remember when there was a lot of
sort of talk about lean UX and some
people in the user experience community
were quite unhappy about it because they
thought it sounded exactly like what UX
people have been doing for years and
years which is designing kind of
sketches and prototyping things and
going out and doing testing them with
users but i think i think it was
slightly different because it is this
concept of basically coming up with a
hypothesis and going out and testing
that hypothesis the idea of
experimentation and the key thing for me
about Jeff got elf is with which i think
is really great is he talks about
requirements as being assumptions so
whenever you're writing requirements or
most probably user stories in the case
of most people here you don't know for
sure that these are things that your
customers actually want until you
validated it so just remember that when
you're writing user stories that they're
generally assumptions up to the point
where you've actually bought some some
kind of feedback or signal from your
users that that's that that's actually a
need they have and usually that there's
a variety of ways you can do that which
I'll cover a bit later to find out what
people's needs are so some of the
principles of lean UX it's kind of one
of these things a bit like agile it's
just a sort of a philosophy a way of
working there's no kind of hard and fast
method
but the idea of having cross-functional
teams this idea of continuous discovery
so your whole team going out and finding
out about your customer that's that's a
kind of really key thing and one of the
great things i think about lean UX is
it's about the whole team actually
owning the user experience of the
product it's not just up to your user
experience designer the whole team can
go out and do user research and you can
all learn about your customers and then
analyze all of that together and build a
better product so having a shared
understanding about what kind of things
your end users need and how they're
using your product is really important
so if this is a similar very similar
looking picture really to the Lean
Startup one but slightly slightly
different more aligned with a kind of
view a traditional UX process and I'm
going to take you through some methods
that as user experience people we use
within the kind of lean UX environment
but firstly I just wanted to give you an
idea of how this kind of thing works in
practice and talk about a couple of case
studies so the first case study is
actually back when Eric Ries came and
talked to our company he put on a video
which was about a company called
Nordstrom nordstrom are a big retailer
in the u.s. they basically had set up an
innovation team to look at areas of
where they could kind of use digital
products to improve their customer
experience and what they did was really
really interesting so rather than sit in
their office developing some kind of
exciting new digital product for their
customers what they did was they took
all of their computers and they went
into one of the nordstrom stores so it's
like a big department store and they
they went into the store and they set up
right in the the ground floor and they
have their Kanban board and they had all
their desks and their computers and they
were doing design work and coding and
they were basically developing
prototypes for
app which customers could use to help
them choose sunglasses so because they
have the customers just over there
looking at sunglasses as soon as they
had a new design on paper like a paper
prototype or they had later on the more
developed version on the iPad they could
actually just walk straight over and
test it with customers get immediate
feedback and come back and integrate
those iterations into their camp am
bored so just a really kind of
responsive way of working um myself and
some of my colleagues at Redgate were
really really inspired by this idea in
this case study so and we were thinking
well our customers are developers there
they're very geographically dispersed
how can we possibly do something you
know we can't go and see them in they
don't all come to one place where we can
go and see them and then we thought
we'll hang on they do they go to
conference since they do gather in one
place we had a big conference coming up
which was the biggest Oracle developer
conference so so we went along and we
turned off stand into a basically a
design and development kind of stand so
all of the other people who are at the
conference had your fairly traditional
kind of stands where they were doing
demos of their products and what we did
is we over on the left here this is
where I did use a research so this is
where i would get people in to talk
about their process it was actually at
all for source control in your databases
and your oracle databases so i talked to
them about how their team use source
control what kind of processes they had
in the team what kind of problems they
had source control in their database and
in fact whether they even did saw to
control their database which in most
cases blood sir was the answer that
basically people hadn't got a tool that
would help them so we did use a research
over here in this bit and over on this
side i was using paper prototypes to
start with and over on this side my
colleague David was coding up using
Twitter bootstrap a very quick prototype
of how this tall might look
and our customers could see the code on
the big plasma screen here as he was
kind of coding it up and it attracted a
lot of interest we even learned to scrum
board into the design of the stand so we
had that point over as well to be more
aware conference we had about well
basically every time people went into a
talk we would then have a stand up you
know how are things going what are we
going to kind of work on next and then
when they came back out into the
exhibition hall we would do more user
research so it was a it was a really
exciting time and in keeping with the
kind of the lean UX or lean lean startup
philosophy we had a hypothesis so this
idea of experimentation what is it
you're trying to validate so we thought
the Oracle developers and dba's needed a
better way to source control their
database but we didn't know that for
sure that was just an assumption we had
so we decided that if we got more than
seventy percent interest in this idea
that we could develop a product so we
did a number of sessions so this is an
example of one of the sessions I ran
with some of the people at the
conference and they were just sitting
down I'd put a paper prototype of the
tool in front of them so it was kind of
like I think this is something that you
might hear more about in the next talk
if you come to but basically we had a
sketch of each different screen and I
would put it in front of them and kind
of ask them you know how do you how
would you use this and we talk through
the process and I got lots of really
really useful feedback and at the end of
each session we well the cheekily kind
of asked people to fill in one of these
little cards and this was to validate
our hypothesis and I know that people
was intention to purchase something is
kind of different from whether they will
actually purchase it but it did give us
a enough of a kind of signal from our
users that this was going to be a useful
tool from them and we learned so much
and this was in two and a half days we
basically went from having some very
rough ideas about the product to having
quite a kind of
you know a good idea of what the product
was going to do what kind of features it
would need to go to be in a sort of
first version and we collected all the
feedback on the wall we have loads of
post-it notes so collected information
about what source control systems people
were using lots and lots of feedback
about things to the problems they had in
things that would be useful to them and
all of this went into the design of the
product and we had people returning
throughout the conference to come and
see what kind of things other people had
asked for or were you know what was so
basically we would talk about their
process I would observe them using the
prototype and people were interested to
come back and see whether the things
that they'd found a problem were the
same father people as so as I said we
had an HTML CSS prototype by the end of
the conference and we were able to take
that back and turn that into a real tool
and we did lots of regular releases so
after that we continue to get feedback
from our customers all the time to feed
into the product and we quite often had
sort of very small assumptions so going
back to this idea that requirements or
assumptions we did continual validation
so things like interviews surveys
usability testing we did a lot of remote
usability testing where we were calling
people up asking them to use the product
and observing them use it and we learnt
loads of really interesting things from
that that we could build into the
product so by the time we launched our
first version it wasn't a surprise you
know the reaction to it all kind of the
feedback we got because we'd already
been getting feedback for the last few
months and the you know the product was
a success because we've been engaging
people all the way through the process
so I'm going to talk a little bit about
some of the tools that you can use in
your teams and practically how you can
go about this so firstly the first stage
of this is is I guess
doing some kind of research
understanding what what kind of problems
you're trying to solve for your users so
the first thing I'd say is before you
even get to that stage have some kind of
plan have a kind of quick one page plan
that describes what problems you think
you're trying to solve what kind of
assumptions you have and how you're
going to test them and there's a few
different examples of this there's the
business model canvas there's the lean
canvas and as the experience canvas
they're all broadly similar but they're
great tools you can kind of fill one of
these in really quickly with your team
in a probably about an hour or two hours
stick it up on the wall and then you can
keep going back to it and seeing you
know it just it's just a way of consorte
of everyone understanding are we of what
kind of problem are we trying to solve
so it's it's a real easy way to
understand why you're doing this who
you're building this thing for and how
you'll know if you succeeded so the
second thing that I do before you go out
and do any any kind of user research is
just stating what your assumptions are I
think it's it's really easy to you know
not have this mindset of thinking about
things as assumptions and thinking that
that you already know what it is people
need so think about your user stories
think which of these are assumptions
which do we actually know to be true and
which ones are just an assumption which
ones are high risk because those are the
ones you want to go out and test early
and find out if they're if they're going
to be a problem so this is just an
example of something I've done on a
current project I'm working on at
University we're working on quite a
quite difficult problem which is to do
with how academics get published and
we're basically that there's a change in
the government policy which means that
academics now have to publish their
papers in a way open access their freely
available and this is a sort of a
completely turning the publishing
industry on its head so I've written
down a whole bunch of assumptions and
indicated which ones are highest risk to
us
so for example if academics don't know
which version of their published paper
that they need to give us because
actually we don't want the final version
to comply with the policy we want an
earlier version if they don't know which
version then we've really failed that
that's you know that's a really
important thing that we need to go out
and test with our users so once you've
kind of figured out what assumptions you
have what things you need to go out and
test and to learn about you can go out
and do some user research and this is
really about kind of understanding
exactly how people might use your
product in a real context and as I said
earlier it's really important to try and
involve the whole team in user research
I think it's it can be problematic if
you just have one person who you
designate as a kind of usability or user
experience person and they go out for a
few weeks and they disappear out the
office they do some research and they
come back and present it to you but it
kind of it's very hard to understand if
you actually go out and observe
firsthand or perhaps you do some remote
usability testing so in Red Gate we used
to phone up our customers share our
screen with them watch how they use the
product or even just a clickable
prototype that I'd made in PowerPoint
and the whole team would be SAT around
the table watching this and listening to
what the customer was saying that it's
invaluable to have everyone
understanding what kind of problems
people face so the key thing is to kind
of observe you can do various different
ways you can do this kind of research
observation so you can go out and you
can interview people see where they work
understand kind of what you know if it's
a if it's a product to like herb for an
end consumer maybe you know go to a
place where they would be using that
product and try and understand the
context in which they'll be using it you
can also do things like guerrilla
usability tests so the project's i'm
currently working on we did some designs
and some concept sketches
and we put our backpacks on and we went
straight out to a load of canteens or
cafes in the University and we just sat
down with people and said you know do
you mind if we spend five minutes we
just want to show you something we're
working on and see if we can you know
see if this thing would be useful to you
and that was you know just it takes a
takes some guts to go out there and just
sit down and we'll try and you know grab
someone as they're walking past but once
you've done it a couple of times it's a
lot easier than you imagine and it's
actually quite good fun so I really
recommend trying that because you learn
an awful lot another good source of
information is product forums or beta
lists so actually you know if you get
into a dialogue with your customers
sometimes there's some really useful
information to be had there and also
don't forget things like your help desk
or call center if you've got like a
support center for your products that's
also talking to the people that talk to
your customers every single day that
there are really really useful source of
feedback don't just think of them as
your support team you know who at you
just constantly moaning at you to get
you you know things fixed in the product
and they're actually a brilliant source
of information so Kelly Falls whose user
experience designer in the UK talks
about the importance of understanding
the context in which people use your
products so this idea of getting out of
the building is quite critical because
you you can't sort of think about say
someone using a mobile app just you know
in the in your office you know at your
desk it just doesn't help you don't
understand the different tasks that
someone might be doing they might be
having different kind of conflicting
demands on their attention so you really
do need to go out and observe people in
context and think about how and where
people will be using an application you
might be developing or perhaps who
they're with as well so people don't
always use
websites or applications on their own
they're quite often using them with
other people there's something you need
to be aware of when you do any kind of
user research and that's asking people
what they want or what they would do so
the reason that this is important is
there's been several behavioral research
studies done over the years and Margaret
Mead who was a very famous
anthropologist said that what people say
and what they do are entirely different
things and there's lots of studies that
back this up people's intention to do
something what they say they'll do is
quite often very different to what they
actually do so you might have some
experience of this yourself if you think
about you know if you're going to see
your doctor and they ask how many units
of alcohol you drink each week sometimes
you're not entirely honest about that
anyway so that's just something to bear
in mind and i think the the kind of key
thing there is to avoid these sort of
questions so apologies to the product
manager in the room but I this is
something that I have tried so hard to
get across to product managers that you
can't just ask people what features they
would want because you know it's like
asking someone if they want the moon on
a stick they'll sure you know that
sounds great yeah I'd love that it's
brilliant yeah ok we'll go build that
but actually what you need to do is
really understand if that thing is going
to solve a particular problem they have
and the best way to do that is by
observing them and interviewing them so
those are some of the questions that you
want to avoid so things that how would
you like this to work don't ask your
customers to design the product for you
but that's that's really not a good idea
so the kind of questions that you could
ask try and get people to talk about a
particular situation so if you're
interviewing them for example tell me
about the last time you did whatever it
is and usually that will elicit a much
more real
it kind of interesting story about a
problem that they had and quite often
you can start a probe into that so ask
them okay that's really interesting tell
me more about that or what went well or
what didn't go so well and what happened
why was that those kind of questions are
the sort of things you want to be asking
your users so to get a shared
understanding of user needs one of the
things that I really like to do with any
team that I'm working with is that we
analyze the results from any research we
do collaboratively and the way we do
that is we basically if we've been out
doing user tests or we've been doing
interviews during for example during the
user tests I did at Redgate while while
we were doing the usability test
everybody in the room had some post-its
and a sharpie and they were writing
things that they observed on the
post-its and at the end of those
sessions we would spend maybe half an
hour getting together around a big
whiteboard and we would just put all of
those post-its on the whiteboard and
then we would greet them all together in
areas that kind of were related and that
was a really helpful way for everybody
to understand the feedback really
quickly I didn't have to write a big
report for them or anything like that
and we could also discuss at the same
time why we thought these things were a
problem and how we might solve them so
the other thing that you can do in a
kind of lean UX world is to you might
have come across personas is anyone had
someone in their team create same as
before it's that familiar thing okay a
couple of people so personas are really
a mark types of behaviors they they
don't represent real customers they are
basically a design tool so they help you
understand groups of behaviors that
you've observed in people that you do
research with and then you can design
for those behaviors and they're just a
way to make those behaviors kind of seem
more personable and more realistic so
they're a design tool but you can mock
up some very quick ones like this which
to tell you things like people's pain
points and kind of problems that they
have so the next stage in a kind of lean
UX cycle once you've done some research
is the kind of making things too so
you're making something you're going to
go out and test to validate assumptions
you have about the customer so this kind
of idea of prototyping there's lots of
different ways you can pray to type
again it doesn't have to be real code so
one of the things I like to do is a
design studio and that's when you get
the whole team together again and it
doesn't matter if people can't draw
can't sketch because everybody can draw
boxes and circles and scribble and we
get some pens and paper and we just have
you know really spend sort of I don't
know an hour drawing we might spend five
or ten minutes drawing some ideas for
how different screens might look for
different kind of flows of how someone
might use part of an application or
product and then we put all of those
ideas up on the wall and we all look at
them together and decide which ones we
think are good and which are bad and
very quickly we can come to some good
ideas and I've found that even though I
do design work that quite often some of
the developers that I've work we've come
up with some really great ideas and you
know everybody can have design ideas you
don't have to be designated as a UX
designer to have good ideas so the other
thing is that it's very quick and easy
to create these kind of sketched
prototypes so this is like some examples
from the project I was talking about
earlier where we went out in the
university with some prototypes and this
is what we took with us just some
sketches and these took maybe you know a
day or two for us to put together
they're just on a four bits of paper and
we took them out that people can really
imagine you know what they're
interacting with so you have to ask them
to to use a little bit of imagination
but you do get some great feedback so
I'm a fan of paper prototypes not
everybody is because
they think that they're perhaps a little
too removed from the real product but I
think they're very useful so the other
thing is it's really important to get
stuff on the walls I think it's this
idea of an information radiator in agile
kind of translates really well across to
user experience having somewhere that
people can in the team can see all the
latest designs you're working on kind of
you know go up and sort of say oh what's
this thing about over here and you can
have a discussion around that it's the
idea of that getting that shared
understanding of what it is you're
trying to build or design so the next
stage is experimentation and this is
really where you've done some designs
you've maybe built some kind of code
prototype and you're going to do an
experiment to see if it it validates
some of your assumptions and there's a
really nice kind of template for this if
you visit a Luxor co this is something
that i got from janice fraser it's a
really useful thing so it's basically at
the top it's stating your assumption we
believe that and then you describe your
assumption we will do or make so that
might be a prototype it might be code
and then we'll know that this hypothesis
is valid because we'll get this kind of
signal from our user base so an example
of that is a very simple simply
expressed example if the call-to-action
button is red then the number of people
registering will go up so this is a very
small thing that you can test and I
think the important thing is when you're
going out validating things that you
have to make sure that they're they're
kind of small enough that you can test
them so make sure the thing that you're
testing is easy to test so the stage
where you're doing testing there's some
different techniques you can use one of
them we've talked about which is
usability testing
and who has anyone here actually sat in
a usability test before one person two
three okay I would really recommend you
try some of these so basically if you
stay for Jana Jana stalk you'll hear a
lot more about this but it's really a
case of just observing someone using
your product your software your website
whatever you're building and you just
ask them to do some simple tasks you
know realistic scenarios that they would
do on your website like you know sign up
as a new user or purchase something off
the website and you'll be amazed what
you learn from watching someone it's
quite scary but definitely that's one
route things like a bee testing if
you've got a large number of people
using a website a be testing is a great
way to understand if one design works
better than another and also things like
click tests analytics these are all
different ways that you can get
validation for designs that you're
working on so just to finish off we've
gone through an awful lot there's a lot
to take in there but my top tips around
this kind of approach to designing
products is firstly don't get lazy and
I'm guilty of this in my most recent
project we did lots and lots of user
research right at the beginning and then
we spent several weeks in the office
you've got to make an effort to get out
there and keep doing research keep kind
of going and observing people and
interviewing them really important get
the whole team to own the user
experience of the product everybody can
be designer everybody can have input to
that it leads to a much better product
and thirdly don't compromise quality
remember that the MVP this minimum
viable product is kind of perfect slice
it doesn't have to be something that
sort of below par below you know sort of
poor quality that you're putting out
there your customers will notice and
it's not it doesn't look good so just to
summarize
some of the key points treat your
requirements as assumptions get out of
the building the whole team and build a
shared understanding of the kind of
problems that your customers are having
go through these kind of rapid cycles so
it's about just making sure that you're
kind of learning and validating things
quicker so you're you know it still
might take the same amount of time to
develop a product you just go through
more iterations so those are my kind of
key takeaways from today I like this
quote by Peter Drucker because I think
he's a bit of a management guru but I
think this quote kind of sums it up that
efficiency is about doing things right
but effectiveness is doing the right
thing and I think that's kind of what we
all have to aim for when we're designing
and developing digital products so
that's everything for me I think we have
maybe five minutes for questions or so
it's just two of us making a product
right now yeah one of the things that we
decided to do was to try to make
something that didn't quite exist yet
women so our first sort of market
testing was that we agreed to
s100 iphone apps across the remark
that's it one day and then come back
with what people were buying essentially
and try to make something that it was an
agglomeration of the three or something
that was unique would you consider that
sort of a legitimate form of getting out
of a building testing its I guess that's
more of a kind of competitor analysis
approach that is a that is one way that
yeah a user experience person competitor
analysis is something that we do what I
would say is you still really need to
get out and see if there's a problem
that people have that isn't being solved
by these other things if there's 100
other apps out there that are all doing
something then you'd figure that there
there's a problem that's already being
solved there whether people are solving
it well or not how are you going to know
that from your kind of just looking at
the apps yourself you might have an idea
but you really need to go out and
interview two people two of us likely to
have a rather small sample is there
what's the sort of like two people is a
big danger and a large marking of error
we're not going to get 2000 we're not
you see the number and being this a good
yeah safe so qualitative research if
you're if you're doing this continuously
I think as an initial if you want to go
out and get a really you know do some
interviews and get some really good
insights you could probably go and talk
to about 20 people and maybe you know
talk to them for about an hour each
you'll get some really good insights
from that as long as you're continually
learning more to different routes in ish
alee that will give you pretty good
supper was the thing with qualitative
research is you know you're not
necessarily looking for a huge sample
but you're looking for kind of lots and
lots of in-depth insights and I think
that's probably at the start
yeah I think as long as you're as long
as you remember that you've got to kind
of continuously gather more feedback so
but at least that would give you a kind
of head start thank you everybody I will
be around this afternoon so if you have
any other questions be come and have a
chat
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
