wait I haven't started yet and now it's
working so I started school in 1995 now
you can guess my age and I actually
recreated the haircut for you
so I started school in 1995 and this is
me on my first day of school and there
is a German tradition where kids receive
a true tutor which kind of translate to
school Cohn on their first day of school
and it contains all the stuff that they
need for their first days of school and
usually they only get one but I got
really lucky because my parents were
separated so I got two and you can see
here the pink one that's the one that I
got from my dad and it contained all
things candy and then the other one that
was self-made was from my mom and it
contained things like a pencil sharpener
and an eraser so apparently they had
very different ideas of what you need
for your education and I'm glad they did
have different ideas about this because
when it was time to learn the correct
spelling and the correct grammar I
really needed that eraser but I also
really needed the candy in order to get
through that time so this perspective
that difference opinions about stuff are
can be equally valuable and kind of
stuck with me and so this is what I want
to talk to you about it's going to be
about differences and how those relate
to diversity and we're going to look at
one model that's called the margin and
Center model and then I want to talk to
you about how we can actually make
diversity sustainable and there's going
to be in conclusion like there has to be
so I want to take this to a workplace
setting you're a workplace setting
preferably I want you to imagine that
you have an idea for a feature that goes
to the app that your company's building
now I want to see a show of hands
who would take that idea and go to
someone from IT in order to discuss it
okay that's not so many
who would take that idea and go to
someone from say marketing in order to
discuss the idea that's also not so many
interesting so I assume that you would
talk to someone from your company would
you maybe rather see if you could build
some form of prototype and give it to a
user and see how they react okay that's
a few more awesome now I would like to
see two more questions and I would like
to know who here could maybe tell me the
technical complexity of the feature that
you're thinking of one two three four
okay
that's a few and who could tell me the
probable financial cost to implement
that feature okay so these are not
random questions of course I asked them
because I wanted to point out this was a
few specific differences and the first
or actually the last question that I
asked you about is about what kind of
information do you hold do you know
about technical difficulty or do you
more know about the financial cost of
something that's different information
that we hold and funnily enough people
who are very similar think that they
hold the same information so when they
need to solve a problem together they
don't communicate that much they kind of
think that okay so we know all the same
things we're probably going to agree on
the same things and there's not going to
be any tough decisions where a studies
show when you have teams with diverse
people on the team they don't think that
they know the same things that the other
people know so they talk a lot more they
communicate more they share more of
their information also they think that
different opinions are going to happen
and they think that they will need to
work hard to get a consensus within the
team so they prepare better for meetings
and I think that's really the approach
you want to take for a team if they need
to decide on something they should
decide on and together but
before they need to talk about how they
and why they want to decide on something
so that's the one about information then
the first question I asked you about was
about perspectives whether you ask a
person from IT or whether you ask a
person for marketing perspectives inform
us about like what we think is next to
each other how we draw metaphors between
the problems that we want yourself and
if you go to the IT person they will
probably give you a very different input
from going to the marketing person they
will give you some very other input and
you'll have two different or even more
different solutions to choose from in
the end and then finally the question in
the method in the middle was about
methods or about so-called heuristics
and I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing this
correctly in English in German it's
holistic but anyways so heuristics don't
create solutions right away they are the
methods we use in order to solve a
problem so when you go ask an expert
about their opinion that's one way to
solve a problem but doing the trial and
error thing building something seeing
how our user reacts would be another way
to solve the problem and ideally we
would combine these two and we do an a/b
test and see which one works better but
first we ask experts what they think we
should start off with right so in the
keynote yesterday just in in the morning
keynote yesterday
Jessica Kerr showed us a lot of great
images and one of them was how you need
an open mind in order to have better
problem-solving and in order to get
towards that creativity part when you
want to get there and Scottie page
actually created a mathematical model on
how the combination of perspectives and
information in the end generate even
more creativity and innovation now I've
told you about my school experiences a
little bit and I've had a few of really
bad experiences with standing in front
of an audience and explaining math
formulas so I'm not going to recreate
this
but I have put up some references here
so you can check out the research
yourself the gist of Scottie pages work
is that if you combine different
information perspectives and heuristics
you will get an effect that's called
super additive 'ti and you'll get a lot
more creativity and innovation out of
teams now so far I've only spoken about
differences I have not spoken about
diversity differences simply mean that
one thing is not the same as the other
diversity however relates to very
specific categories so that what
direction works good
so differences relate diversity relates
to differences in socially constructed
categories but they feel and appear very
real such as race gender identity class
disability gender expression sexual
orientation religion and ethnicity you
might have differences already within
socially homogeneous teams but you'll
create a larger variety when you have
socially diverse teams because what
these categories do is they shape
different realities of life people from
different social categories grow up
differently whether we want to or not so
I've talked a little bit and I've
struggled a little bit with the tech and
I promise that this is going to be an
interactive talk I'm not going to make
you talk to the person right next to you
what I will usually ask people at this
point is to take out a piece of paper
and a pen how many people brought this
okay awesome that's a few everyone else
can also participate because I was
expecting this this is a tech conference
and you probably have some other tool to
take all of your notes or you have the
brain that sometimes works um so if you
have pen and paper take a pen and paper
if you don't have pen and paper
just take your palm
and take a finger and I'm gonna ask you
to draw something so you're gonna have
to be very attentive to what you're
drawing onto your palm okay I'm asking
you to draw a cat because this is the
kitten kitten check I'm asking you to
draw a cat it doesn't need to be very
accurate it also like if it's just some
animal with four legs that's totally
fine I'm not big in drawing either I'm
going to show that to you in a minute
and we're all going to draw a cat I will
also do it on there and when I'm done
I'm gonna check in with you and after
that we'll continue so I'm gonna go to
the drawing board you go to your palms
and draw a cat are you drawing
okay so my drawing is not the best I
will share it with you in a minute um I
brought a few other cats that I also
drew and like I said I'm not the best
drawing person you're definitely allowed
to mock them and to laugh about them
what I'm gonna do now is I'm going to
show you one cat after the other and if
you feel like that cat is similar to the
one that you drew just stand up if
you're able okay and then after I switch
to the next cat you can sit down again
so who drew a cat from the top who drew
a cat from the bottom nobody who drew
the cat from the back
one person okay that's easy right who
drew the cat from the front and I
actually mean the entire body not just
the face that's a few people okay that's
quite a few people who drew the cat
looking to the right also a few and who
drew it looking to the left yeah that's
me too so I'm gonna share this very
beautiful kitten there you go I put a
little bit more work into those but I
also had something that I could draw
through so anyways the cat exists in
three dimensions and most of you have
seen it from many angles I would say
maybe not from all of these but I've
asked you to put it into two dimensions
and most of you have chosen a specific
perspective and I do these exercises
quite a lot and usually most people draw
looking to the left but like yeah you're
a bit more creative I like that so why
do we draw cats and perspectives and
specific perspectives we've learned to
see and we've learned to recreate things
from certain angle and this goes for
cats but it also goes for other things
most importantly we've learned to view
some things as the norm some
perspectives as the norm like usually
it's the cat looking to the left and we
tend to forget that forget that there
are other perspectives too I'd like to
introduce you now to a model that I
first learned from reading bell hooks
and graddic lumba they're also in the
references if you want to look them up
and this is a model about margin and
center but it's not about cats it's
about real humans so I want you to
imagine a group of people in this circle
they live in good neighborhoods they
have good jobs their kids receive the
best education or at least an OK
education to them their life is just a
life they love it it's the default they
don't think that they're privileged or
that they have a better life and other
people it's just the life that one lives
their life is also represented in books
in movies in politics their life is not
their reality is not a reality it's just
reality it's the position in which you
draw back at looking to the left without
even thinking about the fact that it
could be drawn any other way now I want
you to imagine a different group of
people in the second circle now they
mostly read the same books than the
center people they live in the same
political system then the center people
and they received the same education in
the center people however their life
realities are a little bit different but
those are not represented in books media
or politics
maybe it's the position in which you
have usually you usually have your cat
sitting on your lap so it'd be much
easier to draw it from the top but you
still draw it looking to the left
because that's what's expected
but this was not supposed to be about
cats it was supposed to be about humans
so the center margin theorem it kind of
manifests itself in our society and it
manifests itself in different levels of
society and I'm going to talk about
three different levels now it's going to
be about culture institutions and
individuals and we can't dig very deeply
into each of them so only brought small
examples for each of these um and I
would like to start with the culture
part I need you to all stand up if
you're able please thank you I'm gonna
tell you a few names and if you feel
that you know who that person is you
keep standing and if you feel you don't
know who that person is you have a seat
and you stay seated okay Ada Lovelace
Grace Hopper Dorothy Vaughan
Evelyn Boyd Granville Audrey Tang okay
that's a few people still standing
everyone else is also awesome but this
is very awesome thank you you may have a
seat the first computer programmer the
inventor of the compiler the person the
the human computer who taught NASA how
to code with Fortran the expert on
digital stuff for the Apollo space
mission and a Perl programmer who's now
advising your Taiwanese government on
digital issues that's the names of the
people and that's their faces margin and
center in our cultural level matter
because it's about the stories that we
tell and the stories that we know and
who gets to tell their stories and who
listens when those stories are told and
it's not just about real humans it's
also
about fictional stories this is a film
stole from hackers the movie and the
other one is easy because it says read
their matrix so these stories they're
not about nakhon or more voice they're
not about Kate or Trinity they're side
characters they exist they move the
story along but the story ultimately is
not theirs we can also see that in how
they are positioned in the pictures and
how the lighting is set so that they can
actually be visible right and then of
course it's also about what stories does
the media highlight in order to show who
the tech heroes are there's also a cover
of Sheryl Sandberg but that's basically
all I could find one white woman so
culture is about the stories that we
tell now we're gonna move on to another
level to the institutional level in
society so institutions are about rules
about laws and about how we do things
usually and I hope this is an example
that you don't already know um so in the
1950s and 60s it was very unfocused
someone was fit for a job and how
companies did that was by personality
profiles and after two tests so IBM
developed one for filling their
programming positions and they thought
they figured out that people who were
programmers should be good at math
they're kind of the lone genius type and
they're a little bit antisocial because
apparently that's what makes you build
great software software for other humans
right so in 1957 there was already
scientific criticism about this
perspective there was a scientific paper
that showed that there's no
statistically significant correlation
between how people do on this test and
how their job performance reviews turn
out but the industry didn't care so by
1960
estimated 80% of all businesses used
aptitude testing and half of them used
the IBM programming aptitude test
because hey who needs science so this is
a very old test but do you recognize the
stereotype about who belongs into the
center of IT and who belongs to the
margins so for the last one I'm going to
talk about the individual level and the
individual level is what people
experience in their day-to-day
interactions um who here show of hands
has ever heard about the stereotype that
women talk too much who here actually
believes it ok so there's an interesting
Australian study that showed that men
think a conversation is equal if women
talk 15 that's 1/5 15 percent of the
time if women talk 30 percent of the
time they believe women are dominating
the conversation it's an unconscious
bias it's not your fault
but it's something that you can look at
again and again when you notice that
what behavior does this introduce into
people well men tend to interrupt women
a lot more than they interrupt each
other men's opinion become the center
whereas women's opinion and voices are
pushed towards the margins
so these were just a few examples of how
the margin Center theorem works and why
does it matter it matters because the
Center shapes everyone's view of reality
as a woman I know what it feels like to
have my opinion pushed towards the
margins but as a white person I all also
know that another part of my entity and
identity has always been in the center
so the word for that by the way is
intersectionality I encourage you to
look that one up too there's no time for
it unfortunately now um so what does it
do when we have one perspective that
shapes everyone's reality well we make
really shitty decisions like we have in
2015 there was Apple that forgot to
introduce a period tracking option in
their health care right in 2016 the
algorithm that determined where to
implement amazon's same-day delivery
service largely excluded black
neighborhoods and then there was
microsoft's twitter bought a which i
don't probably don't need to remind you
of that's shitty decisions but other
things happen to potentially really
harmful things happen I'm gonna go back
a little bit in time when the first
airbags came out a disproportional
amount of women and children died from
the airbags because the crash test dummy
was engineered to the size and weight of
the man on the team of the men in the
engineering team but women and children
are usually smaller and they can't
handle the same impact so they died
voice recognition software still
performs worse on women and people who
have accents yet we continue to build
tools that are voice-activated and even
more security stuff that needs to be
able to listen to humans voices right
and then
risk assessment algorithms for the u.s.
judicial system that are supposed to
help judges to see who should be
incarcerated for how long helped
incarcerate black men even with even
harder sentencing and that contributes
to the continuation of racism in the
judicial system so that's the harmful
decisions here so how do we change the
manifestation of a system that
systematically hurts marginalized people
I'm going to go back a little bit to my
own story so I took this different
perspectives thing really seriously and
I have a BA in anthropology and I also
have a batterer in science in computer
science and that happened because when I
studied anthropology I worked in QA in
different IT startups and when I wanted
to write my thesis I didn't want to
write about those other people in those
other countries and the other things
that they do I wanted to study a culture
that I'm part of so I studied IT culture
and I studied specifically how women
create their own spaces in IT and during
my research I stumbled upon a study
program that was computer science but
for women only now I know that in the
United States there is a tradition of
women-owned ecologists and of black
colleges and of black women colleges but
in Germany that really doesn't exist we
have five programs on in the entire
country
that are for women only um so I was
really intrigued by this I was like why
are they doing this well I can tell you
that in the questions if you're
interested but I had always done stuff
with my computer I would find music on
the Internet and build my own playlists
and burn the CDs and designed the covers
and have Loras hits one through 52 I
guess
I would build my own Harry Potter fan
website and I would always do stuff on
the computer I called it computering I
was not afraid of the computer but I did
not see that this could be a potential
thing that I could study because I was
so afraid of the math hello math teacher
so when I saw that program I was like I
should really give myself the chance to
do this so I applied and I got in and I
studied computer science only with
swimming but just to see if there really
was a difference between my program and
the normal co-educational program
I also took a class in the
co-educational program we were actually
encouraged to do so if we wanted to wow
there was a difference so in the
co-educational class that I took it was
about algorithms and data structures and
I think there were about five women in
the class and 30 men and on the first
day the professor talked about stuff um
and there was one thing where I wasn't
entirely sure if I really understood so
I raised my hand and he picked me and I
asked my question and before I could
actually like draw my breath everyone
faces were turning towards me in there
like a person is speaking and then
they're like it's a woman nobody jumped
but they were everyone was staring at me
and luckily it was a smart question
because I had understood correctly I
just wasn't entirely sure so but in that
moment I kind of got this weird gut
feeling that I could not ask the stupid
questions I had that feeling that I
could not fail this class because all
eyes were already on me I did not have
that feeling in the women's only classes
and that's not because women are more
social or you know the classes were
easier or whatever it's just because I
was not singled out because of my gender
so what else did I want to tell you oh
yes you probably oh yeah you probably
know that coming right
xkcd they put it to the point this one's
about tokenism so that weird got feeling
that I had in my stomach there's
actually social and psychological
sciences that back me up here diversity
is not about like adding one diverse
face to the team
that's called tokenism and tokenism is
also a psychological effect where people
will generalize a part of someone's
identity if it makes up less than 1/3 of
the group so going back to my example I
was one out of five women and thirty
other men so we the the gender part was
definitely underrepresented so whatever
I would do would not be perceived as
that's what Laura does it would be
perceived as that's what women do
whenever I would fail or ask the stupid
question it would not be the stupid
question that Laura asked it would be
the questions that women ask and I knew
that subconsciously and everyone in that
class only realized that subconsciously
so they didn't really realize it and
imagine learning programming with that
kind of weight on your shoulders it just
makes it really hard
so I plot all the people who went
through the co-educational classes
why am I telling you the story because
having only a small amount of
marginalized people on the team no
matter the motivation behind it will not
change the power dynamics within the
team diversity needs to be more than
tokenism it needs to be about inclusion
that's how we call it today or if I'm
quoting Martin Luther King he used the
term integration back then when I speak
of integration I don't mean a romantic
mixing of colors I mean real sharing of
power and responsibility so you might
feel that you don't actually have any
power because that's a weird concept to
most of us but you do have influence and
most of all you have influence on your
own actions so this is where you could
start I'm going to give you a few
suggestions some of the stuff that I've
done some of the stuff that I wish other
people had done so you can start with
the self with your actions and your
influence on your own actions you could
for example ya know self first you could
for example start reading only books by
women of color for an entire year I only
read books by women and people of color
for an entire year and I learned about
so many different realities of life it
was amazing and there's also science
fiction by women of color by the way if
you're into the sci-fi um what else
could you do you could educate yourself
about microaggressions does everyone
know what microaggressions are a few
people so microaggressions are the small
day-to-day interactions that kind of
manifest who's in center and who's
expected to be on the margins
you also have influence within your
family or within the circle closer
circle of your friends so what could you
do there one of the hardest parts is
pointing out when someone that you love
is manifesting their own center position
this goes for dinner conversations also
and it's really hard but if you don't do
it who else is supposed to tell them and
to whom are they supposed to listen if
not the person loves them
you could also choose to take over the
unloved tasks in the household like
remembering what's in the fridge and
what needs to be shopped for or taking
your kid to that dentist appointment and
also making the dentist appointment
because care work is what marginalised
people do so much more of now we're
taking it a little broader even and
we're going to look at the workplace
context what can you do there well you
can help and suggest or even implement a
proper hiring process and not one like
the IBM Pat implement one that sets
smart standards and sets them before you
actually judge CVS and so on there's a
lot of literature about how to do proper
diversity hiring or let's just say human
hiring okay what you could also do is
you pass on that speaker request to a
colleague but don't just leave it there
help them prepare the slides help them
prepare help them try the presentation
in front of you but most of all help
them find some kind of compensation for
their work because marginalized people
don't get paid for all the extra work
that they have to do finally this one's
the public sphere you I think that's the
one where most of us believe we don't
have any influence because we're all so
disappointed with politics but you do
have influence in the public sphere -
let's take Twitter
once whenever you want to retreat
something by a straight white man go
look for something smart that a
marginalized person has said and retreat
that one instead or you know more
generally promote vote for and recommend
the people whose perspective has been
placed on the margins from way too long
so we're slowly coming to in conclusion
and I'm gonna drink some more water
make us self care I've talked to you
about differences and the positive
effects that difference can have and how
much more differences we can have when
we actually have different social
categories the variety that all of us
bring in I've shown you how the center
margin still continues to manifest
itself in our society we've looked at
different levels right and I've shown
you a little bit where your influence is
in which you can change that system and
personally it's been really hard for me
to tell you that diversity is a business
business advantage not because of the
data because the data shows that diverse
teams perform better financially they
are so much more creative they have so
much more innovation bla bla bla bla bla
but for me
people are not resources to be exploited
by capitalism so for me it's much easier
to tell you that diversity is simply the
right thing to do it's what we need to
do in order to create a more just
society however either of these
approaches are absolutely useless if we
don't learn to see and understand the
margin and center dynamics within
diverse teams diversity alone does not
remove power dynamics we have to move
towards a sustainable version of
diversity that's aware of the margin and
center perspectives and then only then
can diversity also be
a tool for empowerment Thanks thank you
so much Laura there was just a question
flying in here while I stepped on the
stage so I will bring it do you think
the move to introduce programming and
elementary schools will have an effect
on the number of women programmers why
or why not that's a good question
I think it can help and I think we need
a lot of different strategies in order
to create a larger pipeline of women and
programming um but it's not so much
about teaching programming in general
it's about how you teach it and there's
a lot of great teachers and there's also
teachers who don't really know how to
explain programming so there is a few
studies that show even if you teach
programming the teachers will spend more
time with the boys so that the boys get
more get to try out more and they get
all the tips first and girls tend to go
back that starts like in the teenage
years earlier there's more equality in
the learning part so yes teaching does
help but it's not the only way we can
fix the problem so we need to approach
it from many different angles thank you
questions from the audience
okay so I come from Colombia and I'm a
bachelor
so for engineer can you move okay yes
yeah okay yeah okay I come from Colombia
and I have a bachelor's as a software
engineer there and then I took my
masters and also suffer engineering in
Denmark right in Colombia we were 60% we
man men and 40% women so it was quite
50/50 right then it was quite shocking
for me when I come to a class and we
were only two women yeah which two of us
we I'm from was me from Colombia and my
friend from Argentina I actually a
little thing it's about an education I
think it's a bit more of a cultural
thing
yes and it's more about the openness and
how and what do you need to be because
in our countries at that time for this
has been a software engineer is a was a
an income and then that's a matter if
you're made of your men and women you
have to because you wanna get some money
so how the question is how cool you for
instance see this case that come from
from America put it here in Europe
because I guess I see Europe is more
like being more clothes more more more
men
alrighty so this is definitely about
culture so there's studies that show
that in India for example and also in
Turkey women are much more likely to
simply go into IT and do very well there
and thank you for that example too and
yes it's a European / US American
problem definitely but also in those
cultures it hasn't always been the same
and I think we've heard this at that
conference already that programming used
to be a woman's job but it also used to
be secretarial work
it used to receive be perceived as
something that's not so valuable and
that changed ones computers were no
longer built for only universities and
the military but the personal computer
came along and there was actually money
in the industry and once there's money
in the industry men are more likely to
also go there and that's when the women
were pushed out so that was in the 80s
and we can we can see that cultural
change here in Europe and in the United
States and so I forgot your question
what's that answering your question
what the hell is happening yes yeah so
it's a lot about whom do we perceive as
biologically technically capable and
that's men and that's a terrible
stereotype and I showed you one day I
showed you the IBM programming test and
that's one of this those cases that kind
of shaped who is supposed to be a
programmer and who isn't and there are
many other examples and we kind of
reproduce this and I think we need to
solve it on different levels too because
it's being recreated on different levels
so having more role models and talking
about those stereotypes and so on that's
all we need to do ok you go ahead
hey so I want to apologize from the
beginning because I think I'm gonna be
the devil's advocate here you're not I'm
gonna be the devil's advocate here oh
yes first of all yes I think diversity
really does create or inspires more
creativity but we shouldn't forget that
both this divide and conquer sentence
and I think this divide and conquer the
origin of that is why can we I mean you
said something like capitalism and
defending people from capitalism I think
you can be powerful if you're a knighted
and what unites us is what we have
common if we are very different from
each other I think we will be very
divided from each other so that's one
thing and I I'm just saying maybe that's
more about how we think then just how we
are
I mean color and whatever so divide and
conquer as in colonialism or what's your
perspective there but I mean divide and
conquer this is like it so I think I
think like going somewhere and making
that your own is not something that
works well for the people who've already
been there I don't understand yeah
divide and conquer it's like so I'm
going to make sure these people are
gonna start fighting against each other
so that
I can create a better position on top of
there correct this is what I'm saying
did they start fighting each other
because they're different because
they're all the same and someone's
exploiting the fact that they're
different see that's so you think it's a
it's a good strategy to point out
differences between yes I think pointing
out differences oh okay oh now I get to
your point so you think pointing out
that people have different income and
people have different realities of life
and people have different access to
power and influence creates more divide
because I actually think once I stop
pointing out the problem we can solve it
if we don't even talk about the problem
and the problem is that people have very
different chances in our society when we
don't talk about that we can't solve it
the ideal is that we all have the same
access and the same political influence
that's the ideal that we might want to
achieve but we're not there yet
so we need to look at the situation now
and we need to discuss it and there are
different there are differences there
also a lot of stuff that unites us and
that's important to point out but if we
don't see the differences in what I'm
not saying that I'm just saying that if
you take 100 different people and put
them all together in one I think they're
not going to be very United in in
fighting a common goal because they
don't actually have a common goal they
all have they want different things yeah
yeah but if we have a team that wants to
solve one specific problem that's the
thing that's you know unites them they
together
want to solve a problem that's what
unites them they have different they
have different approaches to doing so
and they need to understand that all of
them are equally valuable but the thing
that unites them is not their skin color
or whatever it's that they want to solve
a problem I think you can discuss this
over coffee I think that's that's a very
passionate topic so you can discuss
this over coffee or another beverage is
there another question question question
you said during your speech that we
could ask in the end why you had this
girl's only class in computer science
why I chose it or why it exists why it
exists so it exists because the German
numbers say or show that women who start
studying computer science drop out
really quickly and the reason is not
that they are not capable it's that they
don't feel comfortable studying there
and I don't believe that we need to
segregate society into different
sections so that each can be all on
their own
but what we need to create is an
environment where people can focus on
the learning and don't need to focus on
all of the stereotypes that are raining
down on them so the solution for that in
this case was we're gonna separate no
actually they didn't separate the
existing classes they offered an extra
program where women could apply and
funnily enough in the old program it was
still the same amount of women that
applied but a lot of people who would
not have applied before applied for that
women's program and what they can see
now so it's only a bachelor's program
what they can see now is that a lot more
women are applying for the master's
program and they do really well in the
master's program so it was a good
strategy in order to create a learning
environment that actually helps people
to just learn and I apologize for using
a lot of examples with women that's
because I am one but there are a lot of
different social categories that we need
to consider too right I have actually
one question go ahead
I was asked yesterday and I have my
answer to that but I want to have your
answer where do I start
if my company is not diverse at all
don't just hire one diverse face that's
what I can tell you to not do I think it
actually makes sense to not go straight
into the hiring process
but to help people learn about their own
positions first and there's a lot of
anti bias trainings and I don't mean
diversity trainees because they're
usually a bit weird I mean real either
social justice or anti bias trainings
where people learn about what's their
position in society and how it profits
them and how also it fails them
sometimes and like I also said in the
talk we got to start with ourselves
before we can try to you know fix the
rest okay then thank you very much for
joining this talk and have a nice break</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
