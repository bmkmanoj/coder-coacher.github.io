boo from tri fork and went to go to
Copenhagen 2012 conference welcome done
and thank you very much for being here
it's an honor I'm glad to be here and of
course we have some questions for you
especially related to to your book and
your work in general the first one being
your book principles octave up and flow
is by many considered the most important
book in the edge of space in the last 10
years and yet I dolls barely mentioned
have this product market fit come as a
surprise to you I didn't come as a big
surprise to me in that i can remember
talking back many years ago at a hopi
conference where i was talking about the
lean DNA of agile methods and so i sort
of recognized the presence of there's
some shared DNA in both of those spaces
so i would have had a hypothesis that
some people in agile would be interested
in some of the things i was saying i
guess it it's probably it was a stronger
response than i would have expected and
i think it more reflects the fact that
in the agile space a lot of the methods
are empirical and faith-based and i
think there were probably people hungry
for a little more scientific approach to
doing it and i think it just it filled a
little niche
within the agile space okay and it seems
that though many books like yours have
dealt with the topic and maybe not in
such a scientific way but still we've
got fixed price contracts we've got
batch budgeting and we've got face gate
models and big bang releases all over
the place why is this still such a big
problem when so much theory states
differently yeah that's an interesting
question and one that I've had to deal
with for about 25-30 years now I think
there is still a lot of belief in the
idea of large batch sizes and processes
if you look at the a lot of the
traditional doctrine for how do you do
envelopment is very much anchored in
these stage-gate process ideas the idea
that if I if I I don't do something
until I have all of the information
necessary I don't start something till I
have all the information necessary to
complete it you know you just see for
example a traditional perch shark will
be based on any precedence diagram that
uses the concept of strict precedence
says I don't start an activity until I
have all the information or the stuff
ready to complete that activity and that
has so permeated management thinking
that it seems quite natural that I
should not start design until I have
identified one hundred percent of the
requirements because I will need a
hundred percent of requirements to
finish the design do you think this is
an intuition we're boiling or is it our
schools or educational
system how do we get no I i think it is
actually we get educated into thinking
the wrong way is that I I don't think
it's it's it's intuitive because if you
look at for example most people most
engineers who either start tinkering
with hardware or tinkering with software
and things like that if they have no
training at all their natural tendency
is going to be work in small batches
with fast feedback that is that you know
anytime you've tried otherwise where you
you try to bite off too much work and
you discover it doesn't work and then
you have to find out why it doesn't work
you you instantly get feedback from the
universe that large batch sizes are bad
you have to be educated to start
thinking that large batch sizes are good
so it's a useful story with the small
team that rediscovers that you can make
groups with our organization and they
stopped doing all the common sense yeah
well if you look at the you know the
original where the term hacker came from
in terms of the hackers at MIT that the
hacker club at MIT and things like that
is that you know the the basic
traditions of engineering sort of go
back to making a small change at a time
and looking at what the consequences
aren't and building on that so that
small batch size approach is very
natural it's just you need to also make
it permissible in an organization but
other things that are less common sense
like for example what we are usually
struggling with this the fact that not
loading people to 100% seems to go
almost against intuition or content yeah
no I think you're absolutely right there
there there are certain things that make
a lot of sense for people to use small
batch sizes that you don't really have
to change minds
for there are some other issues that are
extremely alien to a lot of managers and
one of them for example being the notion
that if I load to a hundred percent
utilization I will actually get worse
outcomes than if I load to a lower level
of utilization you know because peoples
peoples natural intuition is the busier
my people are the more more output I
will get and they tend to think that if
engineers are busy a hundred percent of
the time that will raise the output of
the organization and what they ignore in
that calculation is that when people are
busy a hundred percent of times accuse
get very large in the process the queues
delay feedback and delayed feedback
hurts efficiency and so well while
you're under the illusion you have an
efficient process running a hundred
percent utilization is that you don't
have an efficient process at all and and
one of the other intuitions that people
are very bad with is the idea that a lot
of people start more stuff than they
should and have too much working process
and it's because again there's sort of a
natural feeling that the sooner I start
the sooner I'll finish so therefore if I
have any spare time at all if an
engineer becomes free for 15 minutes I
ought to put them to work on doing
something but how do we change this it's
taken like the manufacturing come 6 30
years to realize that and then you've
they're dealing with repetitive
processes where they can see the
physical stock yeah houses and even they
have taken this long to acceptance no no
no you're absolutely right is that you
know in you know the key to the solution
is to eliminate in
tori in the process not having too much
work in process inventory in as you say
in manufacturing the whip is physical
objects you can see when you have too
much inventory and the whip is carried
on the balance sheet as you know because
we can capitalize work in process
inventory in manufacturing so when you
reduce inventory and manufacturing
management says this is great I just got
two million dollars of free cash in this
process in development where whip is
Kerry that's a zero value and things you
can't show the benefit of reducing
inventory financially you can't
physically see it so I sad to say i
think it's going to be a more difficult
problem making people conscious of whip
in development than it has been in
manufacturing so we're talking 60 years
yeah why you know I don't want it to be
60 years but you know hopefully we can
build on the experiences that they had
in manufacture so along those lines I
guess we agree that a product
development context is it's a context
where there's a lot more of variability
that we deal with them in manufacturing
the fact that we have this uncertainty
all around us is that really the heart
of agile and maybe also the reason why
your book has penetrated the agile space
in the in the way it has yeah it might
be because I was just observing last
week at a conference that I believe
people in the agile software space are
doing a better job at using lean in
product development than companies that
have four years of experience with lean
manufacturing and that's because most of
the lean manufacturing people have this
toxic idea that variability is always
bad
and that it is feasible to eliminate
variability and in highly repetitive
manufacturing processes there's some
truth to that and in manufacturing
processes you don't need to innovate in
product development you need to innovate
in order to add value and things and as
a result if you try to drive out all of
the variability you drive out all the
innovation and so I I tend to feel that
you know you go back to the original
agile manifesto and things and there was
an acceptance of the idea that you have
to respond to change you have to deal
with variability and people in the agile
software space are not in denial on that
issue whereas the people in lean
manufacturing have tended to believe it
worked so well in manufacturing it
should also work well in product
development and they're just beginning
to discover that it doesn't work well in
product development I saying that Toyota
was which is used as a model for good
pro development processes that they're
really behind some of the things going
on in the software I'd say toyota is way
behind what's going on in the software
space and you know i often the people
will tell me toyota is an innovative
company and i'll ask them i'll say well
identify three innovations that have
come out of toyota and they'll say well
there's the prius and there's the prius
and there's the prius that really they
can't come up with examples occasionally
they will mention the lexus maybe
without realizing that the honda was
introducing the acura in the united
states years before toyota did honda was
really the first company to rebrand the
you know
they're their brand is a high-end brand
most people are not really aware that
the lex the prius was not the first
introduction of a hybrid car but there's
a very limited amount of innovation that
is present in Toyotas process because of
this huge focus on reducing variability
and you often see it actually in how
innovative their cars are in terms of do
they get share within the market when
they're competing against cars that have
you know more advanced designs so you
know I think one of the I was talking
with some folks about the penetration of
the Lexus in Europe and and the Lexus
hasn't done nearly as well in Europe
against Mercedes and BMW as it did in
the United States so the fact that
people almost treating Toyota because of
the success with the lean manufacturing
approach as has someone to copy in the
probe development space is that a real
challenge we have to face because we
know we all know that there is a lot of
book out there stating how brilliant
toyota is doing product development and
how they use multiple development of the
same item to try to make sure that
variability yeah a little cousins
eliminated yeah I I think that problem
is going to go away because eventually
the people who read about Toyotas the
best company in the world are going to
end up getting a toyota financial
statement and looking what their actual
performances and then they will end up
discovering that Toyota's performance is
below average when compared to large
population like the sp500 is I mean it's
not even a question of being in the top
30% or the top 20% about ten percent
it's that it's in the bottom half okay
so you know people will eventually
do a little reality testing with data
and and then they'll start whispering as
Hans Christian Andersen did the emperor
has no clothes right but but we haven't
reached that point yet so debate the
sooner you and Jeff we like it with the
sooner or later somebody's going to
mention that the emperor has no clothes
okay for me personally and I've been
through your book at least two x plus
all the times I've just looked good it
seems incredibly dense and before I
started you warned me but this was not
supposed to be in an easy meal and
though very valuable it definitely
wasn't how come by but why was that
purposely meant to beneath me well I'll
just tell you that I mean the practical
consideration which is that the if you
ended up writing a 600-page book people
would not read you know 300 pages is
about the maximum that people are going
to pick up as being i'm going to
undertake this book on speculation i
basically the book was coming out 12
years after i wrote the previous books
so there was a lot of accumulated stuff
to cover and and i didn't really believe
in the strategy of writing to 300 page
books you know part 1 and part 2 i'm not
sure that that works so what I opted for
is I just said look let me just increase
the density in the book there's there
will be some readers who value that and
you know it I wanted to write a book
that people would open more than once
okay so we won't see principles proud of
and flow for dummies coming out anything
well actually I think there's a need for
that but but you know I sort of someday
what I want to do is just right a
hundred fifty page version for non
engineers and just covering a couple of
the ideas
that will save time for people who have
read the whole book not having to
explain personally every idea in the
book to the other people in their
organization so that that's on the
agenda but there's no forecast date for
when I'll have that speaking to David
Anderson you get very much the
impression that he that you are
responsible for convincing him to try
out implementing can vent systems in
software how do you see your work in
David's work fitting together on it on a
larger scale going forward um I think
I've got an enormous respect for David's
work I am in the one reason why I wrote
the foreword for his book Combine is I
really did feel it was that worthwhile
that I wanted to invest my effort in it
I think he's his thinking is constantly
evolving and progressing if you if you'd
asked me about David you know like 10
years ago I'd say oh he's really done a
great job with Kim would have flow
diagrams of things is that you know he's
he's gone beyond theory of constraints
and now moved to keeling the flow
diagrams and uh and you know now I'd say
he's he's recognized the the value of
some of the con bond the wit
constraining ideas that are present in
lean manufacturing and and massively
went when I first visited him and I
explaining he was using a combat system
i pointed out to him I said you know
you've gone way beyond what a toyota
combat system is because a toyota
convent system will basically have a
whip constraint that ends up blocking
work when you hit a certain level and it
will process work in a first in first
out basis and that was what the time
when he was starting to injured
classes of service in in the combine and
you know there's no classes of service
being used in manufacturing cotton loans
and manufacturing hasn't really dealt
with the issue of non-homogeneous delay
costs where some jobs have higher delay
costs and others and that will cause you
to want to use sequences different than
50 sequences first-in first-out so so I
think he's done a great job of taking
those ideas and transforming them into
something useful in product development
and I absolutely think he's going to
continue to develop a lot of great new
ideas I think we haven't heard the last
from David Anderson could you just very
quickly elaborate on the difference
between toc and and the Kanban system I
think that there's a bit of confusion in
that area where some see GOC as maybe
just another version of the Kanban
system well you know and and there's
probably a reason for that because toc
is also a whip constraining system you
can view conv and toc as both being in
the family of whip constraining systems
they're not the only systems in the
family but they are certainly the most
prominent ones the TOC system you know
because goldratt says you want to let
work enter the system at the operating
rate of the bottleneck the whip
constraint in toc is the global whip
pool ahead of the bottleneck the whip
constraint in a combine system is the
local whip pool between two adjacent
work centers and so what con bond does
is it constrains all the local whip
pools and if you constrain all local
wood poles you've got a global
constraining right and the TOC is
constraining the pool ahead of the
bottleneck as one big pool and those
that choice of being alone
versus a global web constraint is what
produces the performance differences in
in those two systems the TOC system
turns out to be quite good when you have
a relatively persistent bottleneck that
is in mobile it stays in the same place
and things and so there are classes of
product development problems for which
that works quite well the combine system
is a very elegant solution to the
problem of temporary bottlenecks where
the bottlenecks develop and then they
they go away or mobile bottle next where
a lot of times you can describe product
development as being like the bowling
ball traveling through the boa
constrictor is that you know where you
progressively overload different stages
of the process and the nice thing about
a classic combine system is it makes no
assumption about where the bottleneck is
it intrinsically responds to emerging
overloads of hitting upper limits it
then down regulates upstream processes
when you regain capacity it up regulates
them again so it's very adaptive to
variable bottlenecks so you can easily
say that the Kanban system is much more
effective in a concept like product
development where yes the difference
would be less in manufacturing which is
probably also wide the goal now is
mandatory reading it at geodis and see
translated into Japanese I yeah yeah no
that would make makes sense to me and
yeah the I mean I would have to go just
empirically if i look at the companies i
work with i'd say i would probably see
you know 15 or 20 instantiations of a
conv on system being used in product
development for every instantiation of a
toc system it GRC system is still out
there and it's still working for a lot
of people but i think the conv
systems are actually flourishing much
faster than the TOC systems okay I think
we are reaching the end of the hour 20
minutes any last questions topics you
think we need to cover before we close
up no I don't think so it's been an
enjoyable conference here so far good
thank you very much for participating
