this meeting of the the senior digital
enterprise architecture board what I
want to take this opportunity as your as
you're considering coming on board as a
consultant for the student loans company
is that we want to take the opportunity
to stress on you the responsibility that
we have for producing systems that will
that will last the test of time so here
at the student loans company we we give
loans to students and we do that because
they need to go to university that's a
really important responsibility that we
have so what we don't want to do is we
don't want to mess around with that I
mean certainly like you know we've all
been to conferences I guess not as much
these days we don't have as much time
and you know we have people coming back
from like you know q con or go to and
they're saying that if only we use you
know dr. jay s mega services on the
cloud then then everything would be fine
and everything would be just fixed
instantly we know that we know that
that's not true we know that enterprise
architecture is hard long term
stewardship is hard and so we have this
system that we urgently need built and
that's why we're looking for help from
consultants just like yourself Gary a
bit um we do need to make sure it's done
in a responsible manner that is going to
really help us work in the long term and
frankly when when you brought up the
idea of using closure to build this new
kind of a system for tracking courses in
student loans I was I was a bit
surprised because I know we have a lot
of problems I know there's a lot of
things that we should be working on
that's the same with any system that's
valuable and is existed for some time
but I didn't know that we were using the
wrong programming language and that that
was one of our problems so we're really
keen to hear you explain why that's
something we should be considering chris
is great to see you again I think as you
know my my business card says something
about being our technology consultant or
IT consultant but in the reality and i
just love technology and I love what
technology can do for people people like
the students who depend on the system's
at you bill to get money for their study
I also love for technology can do for
society a society is much better for
educated people but in addition Allah
put technology can do for people like
you who do want to be responsible
stewards for the organization now I'd
like to call it just know that I think
you have a really tough job you have a
really tough job and an enterprise
environment and that job in the
enterprise environment means that you
need to deliver business as usual
capability while delivering brand new
systems you need to look at the
stability of your platform ermentine
consistency across all your systems
while at the same time considering new
technology and you have to be able to
look at evolving your systems while
simultaneously working within the
constraints of previous decisions and
that is absolutely not an easy thing to
do so let me just summarize where I
think we are at the moment you have a
new capability that you have to build
for student loans company you don't have
enough time to build that capability and
student loans company party yukia gov
have have determined that we want to
move towards being a technology center
of excellence so there is going to be
some transformation involved as well now
that's one of the reasons why I
suggested closer to you it really does
draw a line in the sand off of moving on
to pastures new and really focus in on
bleeding-edge technology as a tough
deadline and enterprise environment the
right thing to look at that is it the
right thing for a first foray into
functional programming I don't know
about like to discuss it with you in
more detail alright thanks everyone so I
am Chris and this is Gary but we as it
happens of both consultants so the
structure that we're going to use for
this talk is to recreate a series of
conversations that we've had on a client
gig a while back which was as
consultants for the student loans
company so we did have to build a new
system there wasn't much time and there
were genuine and reasonable concerns
from the client about what it would mean
to use closure so what we want to do
today is we want to actually give a fair
representation for the other side here
at conferences
very easy to talk about the coolness of
the new but we also have to think
carefully as engineers in industry about
about what the impact our decisions and
the things we adopt might have on other
people and the interest of protecting
everyone's identity we're going to be
taking part as crescent gari but
needless to say these conversations have
happened and the enterprise environment
so they really are pull together pieces
of many different conversations with
many different people to try and outline
some of the things that we've found are
very important and we're challenging and
it sometimes were really really good and
beneficial no I just like to give you a
reef flavor if I were going to do this
so we're going to try and be a wee bit
theatrical and we're going to break this
up into scenes we have seven sins which
we feel and punctuate different key
points about closure in the enterprise
and adopt in a functional languages and
what we're going to do for each of those
stages is will give you a brief
conversation and then we'll progress on
to something like this now rather than
keep all less about Chris and eyes
opinions we are clearly biased and what
we've tried to do is a get in contact
with people who were involved with the
project at technology level so
developers architects technologists and
we've surveyed them to see what their
feedback was on how successful it was
and all the key points and we're going
to present to you today so hopefully
this is going to be a bit more Watson
all rather than the cannoneer filia that
Chris suggested and there's some people
experience perhaps for me for me attend
conferences so here we have this as a
bit of an example to questions so I'd
like to really gauge everybody's
perspective at the start of the talk and
then we can see where we've got to at
the end so these are our two questions
that we put to put to our previous
colleagues closures advantages make it
worth introducing and such additional
java environment or closure has some
nice features but it's a little too much
to introduce into the shuttle java
environment so it's a pre-lunch session
i like to get everybody moving a wee bit
and what it will only ask you to do this
once can ask everybody to stand up just
now and I just like to get a bit of a
gauge on exactly where everybody in the
in the room today stands on this
question so everyone if you could take
your face
noma thank you I'm so the structure of
the survey that we gave to our
ex-colleagues both from the student
loans company and thought works the
consultancy architects and other kinds
of technologists is we present them with
two alternative statement and ask them
which of the two they agreed with the
most so we're going to do the same with
you to start with so everyone's standing
so for people who agree with the
statement more than the other one that
closures advantages make it worth
introducing into a traditional Java
environment if that's already your
impression could you please sit down now
wow that's good I like a lot of honest
people in the audience that's good too
willington so so for the people who sat
down there something hopefully we can do
for you today is perhaps present some of
our approaches and some of the
challenging questions you'll have to
help you progress closer into their the
environments are you working so
hopefully I something you can take away
from today also now is the second step
wait people are standing stay saying
sending to move no longer could people
who who are actively agree with the
second statement the closure has some
nice features but it's a little too much
to introduce into a Java environment a
traditional jerilyn moment could you sit
down now and leave only kind of the
people who are on the fence oh that's
good well I have to say I'm I think you
two are the winners of this right
because this is a complex situation
things like technology adoption you know
take a a long time to actually
understand the implication so thanks for
being 4 being honestly how you can sit
down sit down now as well so people who
sat down thinking that this was perhaps
a little too much hopefully we can
convince you otherwise by the end of the
talk and as crises yet for the people
still standing maybe we can give you a
few extra tools and to allow yourself to
come to a bit more of a conclusion so
enough of the amateur dramatics this is
a kind of thing you see after each
section will present back to the
percentage of who swayed in each
direction and of course we're going to
keep this as a cliffhanger for just
before the end of the talk sure and one
final piece of housekeeping please do
engage it's very important for us as
well as for the conference to make sure
that we're getting feedback the whole
time seem too into design right now Gary
I've worked with Java for a long time
and I know it has what's better than
better than anywhere else right I've
lived with them day in and day out for a
long time but the thing that reassures
me about Java is a technology choices we
know what those warts are we've had a
long time to discover it many many books
have been written about how to deal with
those kind of circumstances you've got
the Gang of Four design patterns you've
got you know Martin Fowler's books
you've got Eric Devin's on domain-driven
design there's a whole literature on how
to deal with things that are wrong with
Java right and while I guess to someone
who's really interested in like the
latest and greatest that might seem like
an annoying thing right but to me as
someone who's trying to responsibly take
care of our systems that's very
reassuring because I know that we're
unlikely to come across problems with
Java that haven't happened before that
haven't got a way a a best practice I
know I'm not supposed to say best
backers but I best practice around them
right I'm closure however I don't I
don't feel like I yet have the same
confidence up I don't know what best
practice or design patterns are in there
a closure i know that you know there
might be things that we come across that
that haven't got existing solutions so
that's something that I'm kind of
worried about when it for picking it for
for a project that's that's on our
critical path like this and I just I
just worry as well that like I'm going
to have teams of engineers who are
sitting around reinventing really basic
stuff like you know MVC and HTTP servers
and things like that when when all I
really want is to get to the business
problem and solve the business need that
have right now so have you got anything
to say about that and how you know what
would ease best practice enclosure how
do we get across that it is funny you
mentioned the gang of forsberg Chris I
remember I spent much of my career with
that book under my pillow and I slept at
night and I spent a significant amount
of time investing in design patterns and
understanding them and see where they
could really benefit the organization's
i'm working for and peter norvig
director of research at google actually
raised something fairly interesting that
16 of the original 23 patterns that were
raised in the Gang of Four boo
and can be removed with language level
features when you look at languages such
as Lesseps now if you imagine in terms
of accidental complexity within your
organization and within your code base
if you could remove a loss of those
design patterns which quite often to be
fair i find that incorrect we use the
many occasions then you can massively
reduce the complexity and perhaps you
can progress on to something that's a
bit faster to x-ray so on and a bit
easier to to remove bugs from now on
your point about closure and closure as
a functional language and functional
languages are based on lambda calculus
it's been around since the 1930s they're
not new functional languages I am lisps
as well they're closure as well as in
both categories they've been around
since the 1950s so although the uptick
perhaps hasn't been as great as object
oriented programming there is a wealth
of knowledge and information that is
already out there on the domain you're
right closure itself is a new language I
think the first release was around 2007
red tackies come up with a fantastic
language and has his intention was to
produce something that would really work
anywhere that Java would work but just
to be a little bit more concise there
will be a learning curve I can't deny
that and but perhaps we need to consider
what is simple what will produce simple
solutions as opposed to what is easy
because you already understand it okay
so this is something that we asked our
colleagues about so on the survey that
we sent out to both thought workers and
student loans developers we asked them
whether they most agreed with a
statement that closures flexibility
allows teams to design a solution that
meets their specific needs or on the
flip side whether they more agreed with
the statement that closures flexibility
draws teams into wasting time
redesigning solve problems so here's a
first big drumroll woman but first
actual survey data this come from people
who worked on the database project and
it's a bit of a landslide right so you
can definitely see that ninety percent
of the people we surveyed who had worked
on this project so had actual contact
with a felt that the flexibility was
actually the win but you can see it
wasn't unanimous so there were
reasonable people who work in the
team have actually felt that the design
flexibility of closure and the fact that
it was moving into a new and maybe a
little bit less recently trodden path
that did actually make a difference and
I think probably also the people who did
in the end vote in favor of flexibility
being valuable probably did have some
some misgivings and some thoughts about
the flip side as well well no we can
meet number see anything so what we'd
like to do is pull out one or two key
quotes that we felt some adopt people's
opinions it's a small libraries allow us
to design cord Arang the domain and not
shoehorn the domain enter the framework
that's quite important for me because
closure as many of you will know has a
big focus on small reusable composable
libraries that's quite a significant
shift from the monolith java application
i think it's fair to save from from that
quote that people were feeling the
benefits of really take advantage of the
smallness in there yeah I guess it's not
just about composing functions about
yeah posing libraries as well the second
quote I think is also telling I guess
from the flip side which is with a
smallish team of skilled practitioners
you can produce really high quality code
pretty fast so there are few qualifies
in there that are actually I guess the
key to to the kicker in this which is
that it talks about a smallish team so
in our experience the benefits of having
a small team who really know what
they're doing who really understand each
other and a working well together a
magnified by a language such as closure
because it does have that flexibility
and allows you to to shape the language
and the design around the domain on the
other hand I think the effects of having
a large team do a road that power if
what you're trying to do with your
program is is be able to to mold it then
having ownership that is weak or
distributed across many ppl makes it
hard for any one person to feel like
they can take control and and crank out
that really innovative but suitable for
that context design and the past a bit
skilled practitioners are things quite
important as well and we did have a
really strong team of developers and
they were really effective and I they
really made this work and the reality is
perhaps that group of people could have
made pretty much anything work maybe
they could have called you that next
cell I don't know
ahem but they were a really strong team
that that's important to bear in mind
although over a period of time there was
more and more people getting involved
from way that areas of student loans
company and it was interesting to see
their interaction and the outcomes from
your experience cool all right scene 3
hiring so I understand Gary that you've
explained some of the technical merits
of closure and these these make sense to
me as someone who's study design for a
long period of time but as someone who's
worried about the long-term health of
the system I can't afford to just
concentrate on the technology right so
for this to continue to live and grow
and and face the new modifications that
will come in when government changes
policy on education what we need is we
need people and we need them frankly at
affordable prices so what I'm worried
about is that I know that there's many
many Java developers out there I know
that the all the universities in Glasgow
where were as you know we're based crank
out people who know Java it's taught at
undergrad so I just need to go to you
know careers fair identify people who
are motivated and smart and want to want
to make a difference in government and
hire them put them in see it's give them
what they need and suddenly they'll be
able to contribute to the assistant what
I'm concerned about on the flip side is
i don't i don't really see how i can do
the same thing with closure this you
know i looked online for surveys of
language usage and so on and there's
many many many more java developers and
closure developers and for me that
presents a risk because i don't want is
I don't want a system that is really
really maintainable and elegant in
theory but in practice unmaintained all
because no one with the skills needed is
available so I don't know what kind of
strategies should be adopt to hire for
closure so I think there's two things
here and you you have internal Haley and
you have external hailing and really
what we need to embark on the
transformational journey and you've said
you want to embark on is you need to
bring people within the organization
along in that John me as well as pull
and external expertise whatever possible
though you have a fantastic team
internally and I'm really pleased to see
that you've you been spending time and
bringing people on that Johnny who are
entered
see they're not just being a top down a
drop of new information and new tools
that they really weren't interested them
in terms of the transformational change
and you're right no one would deny there
are many more Java developers out there
and Java developers range from fantastic
and credible developers write down to
people at the very opposite end of that
market unfortunately so it is quite a
wide range and it can be challenging
some things even with Java to find the
right people and especially it can come
up to speed with the design patterns and
so on that are already in your code base
and you look at closure as a language
there are many fewer closure developers
out there however they tend to be people
who want to keep on top of the latest
changes and developments there's the
really quite self motivated people
that's not to say they're all good
developers we can't ever promise that
but I think you'll find these types of
people by going along to the local
meetups and by publicizing port student
loans company are doing and the
technology you're adopting and that will
naturally attract albeit fewer people
and some really good people and that you
want to you want to get within your
organization and remember just because
those few developers there's also fewer
people recruiting foreclosure developers
so perhaps you can there you can take
advantage of that all right so let's
let's see what I colleagues sort of this
so we asked them whether they agreed
more with a statement that using closure
makes it easier to hire a good team
because as a language it attracts
programmers who are motivated and
engaged on the flip side we offer them
the alternative that using closure makes
it harder to hire good developers or
good teams because there are less
closure programmers and Java programmers
and we have much more of a dissenting
voice than this this question but still
the majority believe that using closure
makes it easier to hire a good team now
in retrospect there is a little bit of a
structural bias here because the people
we asked are those closure developers so
it seems that seventy percent of people
agree that they are awesome perhaps
actually the question is about the the
the honesty or the or the feelings of
the thirty percent of people who who
didn't who didn't go with that but I
think it is a genuine concern right this
is not this
not something made up it's not something
that that people who are custodians of
large systems are being unduly paranoid
about they do need to worry about this
in the long term but based on the
opinions of the people who were close to
this project and who have been able to
see over the long term as new people
have been hired for student loans and
seen people inside student loans grow
and flourish adopting a new technology
that are that on the balance it was
something that that was good not not
something that was bad some key close to
come out hiding closer developers is not
easy an OPS killing your existing devs
to rate closure is risky and yeah i
think the upscaling point is something
with perhaps not spoken about yet but it
is very important that are significant
anyone can rate close your code not
everyone can rate good clothes record as
a very different thing and there is a
bit of upscale and a su cuenta moving
from the object-oriented paradigm to the
functional programming part of thing and
another thing that someone said that i
thought was quite fairies that's hard of
a slc to recruit programmers who are
motivated engaged because they're not
well known for using a new tech stack
this is where we get a chicken and the
egg problem so we have an agency and
government is doing really vital work
and they're not known for being as
adventurous as other businesses in in
the city and that's probably not that
surprising but to use the fact that
you're not known for being modern at the
cutting edge of technology to not go to
the cutting edge of technology actually
possibly in the long term as a trap and
I know there was a quote in this
morning's keynote about about about NASA
I was actually taken from Sarah Jong I
think which is that it the riskiest
thing is to do nothing right to take no
risk is in itself very risky itself so
the kind of is no easy way to in the
long run play conservative because
conservative strategy of technologies in
itself risky in its own way it seemed
for syntax so this is the real the real
drama in any any talk about this okay so
so Gary and we talked a lot about the
tech and the people and that's that's
that's really useful I think I think
you've given us some some food for
thought certainly but
as part of the due diligence which I
it's my responsibility to exercise my
how to look some code actually um and it
seems a bit weird so Java C++ C
JavaScript even they all use the same
tried and tested way of writing code
right you have the curly braces you have
the semicolons so anyone who knows one
of those languages can look at another
one and they can find those semicolons
and those curly braces and that tells
them what's going on Lisp on the other
hand everything is just the same it's
like parentheses and like at the bottom
of some functions I saw like you know
five or six close parentheses in a row
and it seemed just a bit odd to me so
I'm worried as someone who has to think
about the organization as a whole and
people moving around from project to
project and we will continue to have
Java and JavaScript work for some time
regardless of the decision here I'm just
thinking about what this might mean for
my ability to move resources sorry
people resources around from one project
to another if the syntax just makes it a
real barrier for them to get going why
should we go with a technology that just
puts this kind of gratuitous blocker in
the way of people becoming productive on
a new project it is different cressie
yeah it's add the closure syntax is
different and some people take it really
easily and some people find it more
challenging it's a personal thing and
this is why it's exceptionally important
to take people from your organization on
a journey with you over transformation
and not to force it on them for some
people sin tax would be the camel that
breaks up the straw that breaks the
camel's back and the reality here is not
a particularly difficult thing and
closure gives you many of the tools to
work with us so for example enclosure we
work for it regularly with what we call
a rebel a read eval print loop it's
essentially an interactive command line
where you can execute code and get
immediate feedback on what you're doing
it's a fantastic place that you can go
to try a language and explore libraries
and see how they work without having to
worry a bit compiling your code you get
really fast feedback in terms of tooling
and for your Java developers and if any
of them are using IntelliJ or similar
types of ID's
intelligent called kossoff which is
fantastic support for closure and it
helps you with all the structural
editing that may initially be a
challenge to go over and many other
ideas have great supports as well you
look at Emacs you look at them and I
don't think there's any shot if options
to help people but you do need to ensure
people are engaged alright so we put
this question to our colleagues as well
so we asked them whether they felt that
closures lisp syntax makes it easier
feed newcomers because it's consistent
there's not many different things to
learn it's just open paren close paren
on the other hand we offer them the
option that closures lisp syntax makes
it harder for newcomers to learn because
it's so different to Java and at least
in the context we were in a lot of the
people coming to the closure were coming
from Java some from JavaScript as well
so the results as you might expect from
something that is a notorious bike
shedding topic were split 50-50 so some
people did really like the Lisp syntax
and I've grown to to see code in that
way and I really enjoy working with that
other people just felt that it wasn't
really what they wanted to do so I guess
there's a couple of things you could
take away from this or two
interpretations one is that it's
actually a matter of intense
argumentation but on the other hand I
think actually in the context that we
were in it it wasn't a killer thing one
way or the other so the syntax feels
like a really big barrier to enclosure
and Lisp at first but in our experience
it wasn't that big a deal either
positive or negative frankly but then
other people may have a slightly
different feeling on that mi so if you
consider newcomers to also include those
new to programming all together so
that's an important point who is coming
to closure have they never done any
programming at all this will probably be
quite easy for them because we tend to
forget how I ceremony object oriented
languages are you know it does take
years to build up the knowledge in the
depth of knowledge to be able to
effectively use all the design patterns
and all the scaffolding and there's
required to make Java effective you
simply don't need much of that
foreclosure which is why the solutions
are you build with it tend to be many
more sorry many less lines of code and
we all know that less lines of code
means less bugs
but you can see that you know some
people for example said I just don't
like Lisp syntax despite its advantages
so the intellectual argument was made to
them but just in the end it wasn't
something that was to their taste which
is unarguable and someone made the
subtle point that the syntax is quick to
pick up quicker than your standard i/o
languages that was their perspective so
I guess there's the fact that there's
less of it might mean there's less to
learn and I think for me as an advocate
all the Lisp syntax one of the nice
things is that many of the things in the
closure language are actually built in
closure itself so the for-loop enclosure
or the for comprehension is a macro so
it's built out of closure so if you want
to know kind of how it works or how its
put together in a closure environment
you can dig down and see what that
actually means you can't do that with
Javas for loop all right scene 5
immutability um so Gary thanks for
thanks for catching up with something a
question I have it might be a stupid
question because what my understanding
that doesn't really make sense but it's
something i really hope isn't a blocker
so closures data structures don't change
as i understand it so you make something
for example like a record of a of a
course or student record and then the
language itself prevents you from
changing it unless you jump through
these hoops so I know there's
workarounds with like a no recursion or
a weird stuff but it seems like this is
an unnecessary barrier so here at
student loans a lot of what we do is not
its we're not we're not making platform
as a service or anything like that what
we've got is we've got stuff in a
database that's record of data that's
important data we lift it out of the
database we put it on a form then people
edit it and then we put it back in the
database so basically our whole business
is taking a data structure changing it a
bit so I just not sure whether a
language that apparently is built around
the idea that you can't change your data
structures suits our use case so what
why should we pick a language that
appears to be against changing data I
guess I just don't really get it so
object-oriented programming has been
around for a you're not a number of
years like when people started focusing
math in the latest and greatest thing
probably off the back of one of the
conference's you mentioned em
when many users offer system as a single
time and they won't do multiple things
concurrency know as massive you know
every system you have a work on well
have many many users than many things at
the same thing another example of that
and where that becomes important is when
you consider Moore's law so most law has
been telling us far for many years that
the number of transistors on a chip is
going to double approximately every two
years however we're gradually
approaching the limits of physics we can
continue to double at that same rate so
what that means is if we want to
continue skilling and one of the one of
the obvious obvious solutions is to put
more chips on on our hardware and that
means we have to get good at concurrency
now immutability is one of the things
that makes this very easy because shared
mutable state and the state that you
commonly find in your object-oriented
software are one of the core areas where
your fame bugs I mean how many times
have you probably shouldn't instant ones
alone and find a say for example race
conditions and heaven forbid this a race
condition that happens once every
fortnight and a production environment
you can't replicate it in an a
development environment that anybody
else actually troubleshoot what's going
on often these types of bugs contain to
data that is changing under your feet
now core two functional programming as
immutability and that concept of
immutability does take away many of
those challenges and but it does require
a different way of thinking and that is
going to be a learning curve and a ramp
up time for anybody that wants to come
from the objective object-oriented
paradigm across to embrace the
mutability but I would also argue that
immutability is also an important
concept in Java and it's been more and
more recognize all the time so perhaps
with your developers get involved with
closure they'll actually become base or
Java developers all right say
immutability one of the big trumpeted
features of closure so to be clear if
anyone isn't familiar enough with
closure for this all the closures data
structures are you know all the
different fields are like their final in
Java so unless you jump through some
very specific language hoops the way to
alter a piece of data is to write a
function that
in one version of it and produces a new
copy which is the new version so no
setters so in the case of a the survey
we we asked our colleagues do closures
immutable data structures reduce the
number of bugs or do they instead more
agree with the statement that closes
immutable data structures force us to
write a code in weird ways unnecessary
here's a big drumroll moment alright so
immutability for the big win according
to our pseudo scientific data ah so
people definitely overwhelmingly but not
too unanimous levels thought that the
immutable data structures reduce the
number of bugs they like that it wasn't
even people who were maybe otherwise
skeptical of functional programming
quite heavily came down on the side of
immutability as being being a good thing
not something that was was awkward or a
disadvantage at all I think actually one
of the interesting things when we're
putting this taught together was how
often the things that we discussed as
being the advantages to closure were
also things that some people were
conservative about so a lot of the thing
people don't really disagree about what
closure stands for is a strongly
opinionated designed language it's
actually the value systems and their
perspective on it that changes as to
whether they like it or not and the
immutability is something that I mean
I'd Boston sit for a long time but the
thing that really drove this home for me
was it was at one point we're working on
the project there's a big flurry of
activity from from senior people they
were panicked because they heard that
there were three bugs that need he
considered in the system that we were
building and I i I've unfortunately not
proudly been in projects where there
have been bike logs to handle the bugs
and it was quite fantastic to be in the
position of you know they're being quite
a loss of ferroli because there were
some bugs there I would highlight with
it as a sale already have a very strong
team you know how much of that comes
down to just the skill individuals that
we had there I don't know and I'd also
point out the the three bugs that were
arraigned at the time I i I'm not under
percent sure they actually get down to
cool dishes and could just have been
requirements
requirements gathering the salon and but
the reality is we went through that
project we went from a kickoff to first
deployment to production and use by
users within six months I believe that
was yeah and we really had bugs I have
to also say maybe you're not aware of
this Gary that the fact that we had
three production issues actually caused
a little bit of a storm within people
whose trouble was to track the bugs
because they felt that we must be
concealing them so compared to some of
the comparable launchers they'd made
with different technologies this was
actually quite like you know maybe two
orders of magnitude different than what
they were expecting based on the
existing context of other things that
hadn't gone so well and so it was felt
that there must be more it's just that
we were we were we weren't really
recording them properly fortunately we
were able to demonstrate that that
wasn't the case we never recorded bugs
affair my name against the cow exactly
okay some comments are coming the
hardest thing is to try and get java
devs to stop thinking or and go through
the paradigm shift to think functionally
i'm not for me as an important point and
i think it's also a good reason to pay
closure over some other options such as
scour because you can easily just start
racing java and scour whereas there is a
very clear shift towards closure that
doesn't break the mindset but it does
put a real lane in the sun and so yeah i
think that is one advantage of closure
is significantly different from java and
that can be beneficial and and we should
emphasize the second quote as well which
is which is I thought very fair which is
that despite the benefits of
immutability you can still produce an
unholy mess enclosure so none of these
features get you out of the
responsibility of designing in fact
maybe actually closure puts more
responsibility on you to to design
what's going on so no free lunch no
civil board so we have to cease to go
since sex interop all right so one of
the things that I know I'm going to be
asked about Gary if we adopt closure is
what about the existing investment we've
made another technology so we've we've
got a lot of Java code I know probably a
little bit too much but it does valuable
things it's you know millions and
millions of pounds of flow
through the system jobs got done we've
paid for it we've paid wages we've got
all that investment sitting there and
I'm quite nervous frankly to go before
the CTO and say that we just don't want
to that investment we're just we're just
kind of like writing it off when we're
not looking at it we're going to go to a
completely new language and and Java is
no longer something that we care about
and that deploys by the way not only to
the code we've written but all the good
code that has been written in products
and open source libraries and so on
that's in Java I'm just really I don't
really understand how I can defend this
to the business when I say that we're
going to get rid of that investment
we're just going to move to a new stack
and leave the old behind have you got
any pointers for me frankly naturally
from a business perspective previous
investment has to be core and you look
at closure it runs on the gvm or your
previous infrastructure investment
you're an investment in tooling your
pool fail tooling and all those
different practices you have there but
that doesn't go to Los and the same is
said of a of court level dependencies
and Java libraries at the interlock
between closure and Java is actually
really good you absolutely can call into
any Java calls from from closure I would
HIGHLY that possibly it's not always the
best way to do things you can reuse
those libraries but sometimes there are
there are more closure e ways of doing
things that will perhaps you'll find
less resistance with for example when
you look at configuration and you know
there can be quite significant
differences between how you return your
configuration in Java Pharisees how you
would do that enclosure and however the
interop is fantastic and you're not
going to have to throw away any of the
investment and it also outlined that
line again the bell tool for closure
allows you to manage dependencies and
ultimately as maven under the hood and
so any java dependses any java jars that
you have dependencies on you can make
sure are in there and you can just
consume from within your code all right
so we did use interrupt and are quite a
few occasions on this project so did our
colleagues think that using Java
libraries from closure is convenient and
saves a lot of time what did they
instead think that using Java libraries
from closure is convenient but suffers
from impedance mismatch in the long
between the two kinds of language this
is actually a little bit split so when I
first learned about closure I thought
the interop was just such a massive win
and it is really convenient to be able
to call you know a Java logging library
rather than writing your own but you can
see from this that it wasn't as big a
win or isn't as important in the long
run as as you might have imagined yeah
absolutely and it just chased me just
now looking at the numbers there we
don't have we haven't done any
comparison of who's come from the Java
background and was worried about this
and therefore fits in the category of
wanting to reuse those libraries or who
is it comes perhaps from what if I a
functional closure background where the
quaint Keene to rewrite things and do
things and are more a more closure way I
mean to be clear it is useful because it
means that you're never going to be
trapped but in the long run we often
found ourselves preferring versions of
libraries that have been written
enclosure natively with closure design
expectations in mind in particular ones
that involve interacting with the
outside world so Java libraries that
could kind of be seen as pure functions
generally fine ones that involve
configuration or i/o that started to get
a little bit more hairy in the long run
because they were written with different
kinds of design priorities in mind so
this is an accidental empty slate nada
past any comment whatsoever the answer
there was a split vote will do really
add anything to see I don't know how
significant that is it might be may not
be maybe you just interrupt it's not
it's not everyone's passion it's not too
sexy all right so this is the final the
final thing so okay Gary you've done the
due diligence I understand you if you've
made this argument I I think I think we
are ready to try closure but one of the
things i do want to stress is this isn't
just an open the floodgates moment like
you've got a lot of arguments and so on
but as part of the risk management that
i need to do on this project and with
this architecture in general is that we
need to try something out before we
commit fully so we are clear to let you
use closure for this instance and then
after that what we want is we
want to come back and have a look at how
it went and what we should do in the
future I'm absolutely over the moon that
you want to take that approach and I
think it's a sense laprade you mentioned
at the start you want to be a good
steward I would never advocate a
wholesale replacement and but to take
something to try own a small isolated
location and they start to grow that
organically within the organization I
think we'll give you a lot of the tools
for motivating teams new learning and
really moving towards that position of
fair of reputation that you want to have
all right so this is the the question we
promised you at the start so do closures
advantages in the totality make it worth
introducing into a traditional Java
environment or on the flip side did our
respondents more agree with the
statement that closure does have some
nice features but it's a little bit too
much to introduce into a traditional job
environment so we're not going to ask
you to stand again or go through area
for the drama there and what we just did
will show you the numbers it'd be great
to know maybe assure fans after this if
anybody has been influenced in any way
and if you have been it would be great
to talk to you afterwards but here we go
the big punch line moment okay so of the
people who worked on the project a large
majority did feel that using jerk
closure in this Java environment the
benefits of it did outweigh the
negatives but that's not unanimous and I
think you know there was there was a
decent proportion of people who even
though they've been exposed to closure
for a decent period of time and they'd
seen what it can do still had a little
bit of a kind of a negative feeling
towards it in the inner totality so
certainly something to think about when
you are adopting something like closure
environment is make sure that you do
your duty to the skeptics make sure that
you do think through all the decisions
that you're making and make sure that
you address the kind of valid concerns
of people who are who are not maybe yet
bought into closure because if you don't
you are going to end up with resentment
and if things go wrong which they do on
every project then you're going to find
yourself kind of defending the language
and it's going to get a little bit messy
so some final cause success is dependent
on the main set
for people the environment in the
culturally wrkn you can throw a new
language and you set of tools or
anything and people and expected just to
magically work like the Silver Bullet we
you open with Chris and this is a
journey and it's a generally for
everyone it's a technologist since the
organization it's a business and you
have to be aware of light you have to
make sure that the right people are
included and that they really want to be
included and on the flip side someone
did comment that higher order functions
i guess the kind of thing that closure
excels that requires a leveling up in
abstract thinking that some will find
hard so certainly if you've been working
in java for a long time and had that way
of working objects switching to another
paradigm is tricky so certainly even if
if you like me I convinced the closure
is a great thing to try and environments
like this it's not a matter of just
instantly flicking on the closure switch
and everything everything's kind of
different in okay you do have to think
about the people who are coming across
with you and giving them the right
support and actually just also i think
quite importantly capturing their
imagination to do something like closure
which is a new technology that's a new
way of thinking involves a lot of
learning and that's pleasurable to a lot
of developers and probably a lot of
people like yourselves who come to
conferences but it also is a demand on
people and if they're not engaged and I
passionate about it then they probably
won't put in the effort understandably
to really master it final conclusions
Chris would you do it again yes though
there are things i would do differently
and that probably I would one of the
things big things i would do around the
kind of discussions that we talked about
is I would try to do a better job of
explaining to the client the full
implications of what it meant for
example for the kind of the training and
what also the advantage is in the long
run because I think at the time because
it was such a high priority project and
that was the key we talked about
deadlines a lot which we met but I would
probably try to do a better job of
engaging with you know the architects
like the people i was i was speaking in
and making sure that they were they were
fully aware and fully bought into all
the long-term effects of what we might
do and i would be an exactly simcard
absolutely would do again i would push
for foreclosure anywhere i go assuming i
felt it was a rachel at the time and you
know
lot of a lot of occasions is I think
something to bear in mind is I think
it's Fred George said yesterday that for
for many CEOs it would rather stick with
the cookie cookie cutter shape of how
things are done because if it fails then
they don't get the blame for breaking
the mold this is risky and you have to
be really confident and strong because
it might feel you know it could go wrong
it could blow up in your face and you
have to be able to live with the
consequences of that so you have to be
really strong and confident and
approachable that open mindset but if
you do so I think it's fantastic a final
comment please do rate the session and
they thank you for all for attending
cheers so I have a quick few questions
from the audience for you one that I
wonder about myself was what was the
size and type of developers of that
particular team was I've tried to figure
it out from the percentages but I was
too dumb to do sir was it like and what
type was the senior junior season Java
developers I think all that we depending
on the stage and the project had between
three and five pairs of developers
working would that be fair yeah there
was one point I think where this goes
back a little bit to our thoughts of
closure small teams you gain from and
big teams you didn't is at one point
there was a tough deadline and
unfortunately there were some powerful
precious to add more ppl so it did grow
I think considerably bigger at that
point yeah but that causes problems but
it would cause any any vitamin problem I
think the mate in terms of the maker we
had a relatively JUnit junior team I
would say so people who'd been working
for maybe three or four years as
developers mostly of them thought works
combined with some people had been doing
it longer and that actually was
something that played both well and
badly so it played well in the sense
that he were people who were really
interested in learning new stuff so they
would come with suggestions they would
you know he's best to get stuff in their
own time they would really they would
really get into it on the other hand
that meant that when we were talking
about design in this new context we had
to work harder to support the people who
had less experienced in incoming
with really strong designs yeah and one
final thing I think is worth noting that
we did start with predominantly thought
work stuff and then over a period of
time we switched over to be in
predominantly a student once so it was
it was a blend that wasn't that we took
the client into the deep end and
expected them to sink or swim you know
we did have a lot of experience people
with some functional bike grains and
then we we gradually tapered that
through time another question was do you
think it's easier to take a postgraduate
student have them learn closure will it
be easier for them to train them in the
close your way of doing things or is it
easier to do it with a season-low
developer that's interesting question so
I certainly I remembered teaching Ruby
to people who were very smart new never
learnt programming before and there was
one person who got stuck for the whole
lesson and was only at the end I
realized it was because they were
confused about how plus worked because
most of the methods in Ruby followed the
pattern that everything else did you do
object dot method and in this case plus
just goes in the middle for no apparent
reason so to me as a programmer I knew
that plus in the middle was something
that we expect by convention nothing
about the universe so I think had that
person who was kind of a smart graduate
been shown Lisp they wouldn't have hit
that because there would have been that
consistency so I actually think from
someone starting from zero I think it's
easier to learn closure than than Java
yeah yeah it's something else related
colleague from from that question and
maybe this isn't intended but the use of
postgraduate there I'm not convinced we
always benefit massively from looking at
graduates you know there are a lot of
really smart people to leave school I
think you could sit down with our
language like closure where you get to
really focus on the logic I really get
some fantastic things from them so yeah
I don't know how much a person intended
the postgraduate part of that question
but you know maybe we don't need that at
all and there is actually a third group
that I'd like to mention which is
JavaScript programmers so there is a I
don't know to what extent this is true
but apparently the original version of
java script was a lisp and then they
dressed it up with the syntax of the
semicolons and the curly braces to make
it more marketable but I whether or not
that's true there is actually a lot of
true
the idea that the way of doing things
with callbacks and first class functions
in JavaScript actually helps you a lot
with closure so in some sense it might
actually be easier to move from
javascript to closure than from Java to
closure maybe a final 1 i'll actually
have make it easy for me to merge about
three or four questions into one hello
what if would things have been easier if
you picked a statically typed language
on some occasions and it possibly pains
me to say this yes so one of the big
things we ended up using and it's quite
ambiguous in the closure community is
something called prismatic schema which
is a framework for defining schemas of
data structures so closure uses Jason
kinda as its data structure so overall I
definitely think that the type decision
on closure was the right one but there
were points where in terms of fitting
our design together at the big level
because we didn't have static types we
ended up using contracts instead so
there is something you can easily fall
back on as we did but definitely that
the kind of the the sprawl of data
structures when you can do anything with
them at all and you can just put
together a JSON representation of a
course or a student or a term that was
something that we should have kept more
of a lid on and in retrospect I wish
we'd followed like Alan Perlis advice
about having you know one data structure
and 100 functions because the thing that
we did wrong i think was we had a lot of
different variations of data structures
representing the same kind of data so as
we started to build like a course record
from basic parts and do different things
to normalize dates and invalidate that
meant that across the flow but the kind
of a function pipeline we had different
points where there were different things
present and missing and that i think was
actually a bit of a tricky thing for us
so had we been more disciplined about
thinking about our data formats first
which is kind of the closure way and
thinking about exactly what that meant
and making large numbers of functions
depend on those few and well-understood
data formats then I think that would
have gone really well as it happens we
had to occasionally kind of do some
cleaning up because of those
proliferation of data formats I think
another thing that possibly muddied the
water there as well is we also chose a
MongoDB as
as a repository really so you had
obviously i canna schema-less database
and then you've got a lack of tapes in
your code and I think that probably
further influence there the prismatic
schema stuff being smarter at one point
across the code base so really you've
taken something that database is good
and you've distributed through your core
base which i'm personally i'm still out
in terms of i like some of the
flexibility but then the prismatic both
night maybe it could have been done
differently or maybe we maybe there
wasn't a good selection somewhere along
the line I don't know his hard to see
