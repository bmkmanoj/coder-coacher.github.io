information about me that's my email
please take that down if you have
questions while we're talking and you
want to ask them please be my guest I'm
happy to answer them but if you feel
like you want recourse you want some way
of getting an answer maybe you leave
this room more confused than when you
came in that's not uncommon my talks so
you know take that my email a little bit
about me wrote what is it now for books
working on my fifth book I'm
springsource guy you know but I'm
working these days a lot with Cloud
Foundry as well so the book I'm work on
is cloud foundry in action I also put
together a round up every Tuesday and
springsource touareg with sorts of like
content you can follow if you're
interested in spring and that kind of
stuff i'm also the single largest
contributor and committer too many of
the bugs and these fine projects for
example spring integration and spring
batch and spring and do open so and so
on um alright so quick show of hands how
many of you have heard of cloud foundry
okay you're in right room welcome we're
going to kind of take a walking tour of
cloud foundry today very quickly we have
so very little time and so much to talk
about first things first if you want to
get started with cloud foundry and if
you have a laptop in the items you want
to follow along at home please be my
guest this is the register page you go
to clad finder com force I've sign up
and then just put your email information
in there and eventually you'll get an
email saying you're welcome if you put
in that code to CF open tour 2012 it
will expedite the processing so if you
enter your information and sign up and
you want to get started really quickly
this will put you at the front of the
line right because we have some sort of
a little bit of queuing involved okay
once you have cloud foundry there's lots
of ways to consume it we're going to
look at today are the vmc command-line
tool which is the command line client
that you're going to use to actually
talk to the cloud you can use maybe if
you like there's a maven plugin there's
a grails add-on plugin there's a spring
source tool suite integration for
eclipse basically which is what we can
look at as well today
and there's also spring roo which you
can use if you want there's an ad on
there so lots of different ways to get
the job done one thing that typically
I'm not going to say scares but it make
me make cymbal woozy is vmc itself the
command line tools written in Ruby and
in order to get Ruby installed you need
to you need to do a little bit of
sorcery witchcraft I don't know just
awful stuff so on Windows it looks like
this you just get the Ruby installer
download it and install it i recommend
192 p 290 specifically don't don't get
the 193 if you can help it and
definitely definitely don't get 1.87 get
the 1n too once you've got that
installed just do gym space install
space vmc this is going to give you the
vmc command line client it's using the
package manager built into Ruby to
achieve that once you have that you can
move forward on o is 10 and by the way I
every time I say this it bothers me but
it's true i knows 10 is more difficult
to set up Ruby then on windows so you
need to use what's called RV m and r vm
is basically like isolation its
environments for your Ruby installations
so you can run concurrent Ruby
installations on the same operating
system you can just switch between
profiles so here's that script I'm not
going to reiterate it and you you
needn't bother taking it down just go to
begin rescue in calm and you can get the
script there once you've got that just
do our vm install 192 and then our vm
use 192 and then gym install vm z and
then of course on linux it just works
which again things I thought I'd never
say but yeah totally I'm okay we've got
the basic bits out of the way we
understand how to get it installed I
just want to get that of the way just
make sure we're on the same page let's
actually take a look at what Cloud
Foundry is let me talk about Clyde found
early we typically talk about three
different pieces we talk about the
triangle here we've talked about need
choices of frameworks the choices of
clouds and the choices of services
available to the average developer let's
focus first if you will on frameworks
when we talk about cloud fine remember
it's it's a platform as a service for
running applications right
the idea is that it brings the the level
of work the unit of currency in the in
the application development process to
use the developers it's not about
operations so of course the concept of
supported application types is a very
important concept right so out of the
box to support java which in turn brings
you everything that you can deploy
inside of a war file and tomcat right so
spring is a natural there scala support
lift and play for example are well
supported in Cloud Foundry Ruby Ruby a
can imagine there's not a lot of Ruby
developers in the room but you never
know sometimes you go to conferences and
you talk about Ruby and people throw
their underwear in stage you know they
love it I don't know nodejs there are
those people out there as well and of
course if you don't like what we've got
out of the box in the source code then
you can use the supported frameworks and
supported to run times provided by
ecosystem partners and we'll look a bit
at that in a minute but we have good
support actually we have two good
implementations of dotnet support on
contractor two different companies
working to support dotnet with Python
support from both app fog and staccato
staccato of course being the platform as
a service from active state the company
that makes the popular Perl Python you
know TCL IDEs and tooling and we have
PHP support from at fog we also got a
admittedly more niche enthusiast ports
of support for example for Haskell and
Erlang so yeah lots of choices and if
you don't see what you want on there
this probably and all likelihood an
implementation available for you out
there somewhere when we talk about the
clouds we also talked about choice of
runtimes right so for example very
important part of what we're talking
about when we talk about Cloud Foundry
is avoiding lock in right this is the
only song from the Eagles I think that
everybody in the whole world knows i'm
pretty sure whenever i go every country
i go to worldwide asia europe north
america south america etc they get this
song Hotel California do you guys know
that song
see proves a point makes it very so
former VMware CEO Palmer its likes to
talk about the Hotel California syndrome
right he doesn't he talks about
proprietary clouds as being hotels into
which you can check in but you can never
leave right we don't want that we want
this cloud to be something you can check
out of you know it's a lovely place
after all and to drive home the point I
like to talk about this particular
example this my friends is a google apps
ticket you know and a bug tracking
ticket for google app engine that was
lodged a you know april eighth 2008 and
3,000 3,000 people 3,000 people visited
this ticket over the course of the years
and said i would like PHP support plus
one man or before plus 1 what did they
do before plus one they had some other
thing worth it was probably plus one
that's probably what happened they had a
way of saying i wanna i want PHP support
i would pay money for PHP support i
would pay money that costs lots and lots
of money for PHP support if you just
please add it and this went on for 44
years until finally in January of last
year a Googler came to the ticket and
basically did the the bug ticket
equivalent of shut up they closed all
the all the requests just said no nine
no you know not going to do it so it
took almost four years for them to say
no right and you know that's that's fine
it's their prerogative i guess but what
really kind of bugs me about that whole
thing was look what they added an
interim right i mean added python
support out of the box that's fine i'm a
fan and then they added this kind of
mutant zombie wonky version of of Java
which doesn't actually behave like Java
for most applications fine but then but
then but then they added go support is
there a deluge of people using go that I
don't know about is this a new thing
have our people going home and
programming go applications in their
spare time because it's the new hot
sexiness I mean let it go there's a
they had to go instead of PHP guys this
is a problem I mean how many just by
show of hands how many of you guys know
somebody who knew somebody who once fell
over and tripped and fell and hit
somebody who knew PHP somebody they're
out there right you can't escape them
they're probably more than than go
developers at least I don't know you
know it just bugs me um erstwhile last
year Cloud Foundry the open source
platform as a service from VMware mm got
that in was released last year of April
last year march maybe and about a week
or two later a pull request somebody
voting with her feet yes a pull request
for PHP support was created against the
project so here it is right we've got
the initial seed of PHP support within
two weeks of the project becoming
available that then that same that very
same seed is now actually the foundation
of a whole business right I was telling
you about excuse me I was talking about
app fog this company that has PHP
support that's them that's their you
know business right there is a pull
request and so now you actually have a
very good reliable option based on this
stuff um so yeah app fog good stuff lots
of PHP support we have a joint which is
the community supports and sponsors
nodejs they're actively supporting
nodejs on Cloud Foundry active state I
mean you know other this slide gets
progressively more out of date as time
continues right because we're actually
actually adding new ecosystem partners
all the time so check your local
listings um another important bit about
cloud portability what we talked about
is the ability to run your cloud you
know on a micro cloud right we have this
virtual machine you can get it's a
complete working replication of
production so it's a virtual machine you
can download for free from my code
finder com you can run it you know you
the official way is to run it on VMware
VMware's a player TM but I've heard tell
that it's possible to do it without it
if you're you know not so inclined i
don't know vmware player itself is free
on linux and windows and
Fusion has a available for a nominal fee
on OS 10 if you really have a problem
with the nominal fee bit please just
feel free to feel free to reach out to
me Josh that long get springsource calm
and I'll do my best to hook it up
alright um okay so that's the micro
Cloud Foundry complete working instance
of the cloud planetary environment you
can deploy applications to it and
understand and you know have no fear
that what you've deployed there will
behave identically in production by it's
very convenient you can develop offline
you can bend train a plane an automobile
and develop against it or problem we
also have again because the code is open
source a huge part of what we're talking
about a huge part of what a lot of
people love about Cloud Foundry is that
they can run it in their own environment
their own data center right this is a
very very this has a lot of powerful
implications a lot of people would love
the elasticity the dynamis ism of a
platform as a service they just don't
want to have to you know host it on
somebody else's cloud for regulatory
reasons perhaps it's very typical in
North America and in Europe of course to
have government sanctions and so on
government regulations that require you
to conform certain audits and security
measures so for example in North America
we in the u.s. in particular we have
sarbanes-oxley which requires that all
data relating to publicly traded money
be audible and this makes it a tenuous
to host applications and a publicly
hosted cloud for example so being able
to run it your own data center is a big
deal and there's a project we have
called Bosch which I'm not gonna lie to
you it's not for the faint of heart but
it is open source and it's available on
github com for / cloud foundry and you
use Bosch to deploy cloud foundry in
your own data center so if you want to
run this thing you know locally and be
able to take advantage of it behind the
firewall and your own data center that's
fine okay and finally services right
this is my favorite part this is the the
sort of the creme de la creme of most
applications very existential question
if you write an application and it does
not write to any database or to any
other output format did it really get
written really do
really write an application deep
philosophy question so yeah we have lots
of services out of the box services are
generally with the it's the Appalachian
we use for you know infrastructure bits
middleware right so databases and
message queues and such right and of
course the ones we had at the ball have
out of the box RabbitMQ MongoDB post
quiz redice my sequel etc those are very
very powerful in of themselves but if
you use a different community ecosystem
partners version of the services you'll
see that they have support specific to
to their ecosystem implementation so for
example on the net guys's versions of
the cloud foundry you'll find support
for sequel server and so on right makes
a lot of sense now the nice thing about
a cloud and the nice thing about these
particular services is that they give
you the ability to experiment right to
take a little take some risks because
you have really very little to risk they
give you the ability to you know try
stuff out go ahead and what you want to
add a fast of you know key value store
to your to your application or maybe a
cache just start up rytas and use it you
don't have to worry about installing it
and getting it secured and teaching
operations how to manage it and deploy
it all this stuff just go just go how
many of you have heard of Redis or are
using it Oh guys there are some amazing
I mean there's some I'm not gonna you
know i'm not going to toot its own horn
or anything but but there's some small
organizations out there that are using
it really successfully some fine mom and
pop type establishments maybe you've
heard of stack overflow few hundred
million requests per day they're using
Redis to cash small small kind of stuff
you know you can do a lot I think what
the something like that and in random q
again the most widely used most widely
deployed message queue in all kind of
our mints not just pawed foundry and of
course MongoDB my sequel and post scorer
post go ahead and so on very very
powerful technologies and it's just nice
to be able to pull them down at a
moment's notice and get started with him
right makes like shopping you just say I
need this this business and just throw
the shopping cart and go um and then
find that we have something called oh
and this part bugs me too this is called
Caldecott
this is a tunnel see because that tunnel
it's a tunnel get it because of the
tunnel in San Francisco which i'm sure
you guys all knew about it's called
caldecott it's a tunnel that lets you
punch a hole from your local machine to
your services deploy in the cloud so for
example if you want to log into my
sequel or two postcards and actually add
information into it how you can do that
right well you use our tunnel or proxy
it's called caldecott and that's great
it answers a very very important
question which is you know fine you that
you and I as developers we've got our
application deployed but what about the
operations people man what about them
you and I once we're done with the code
in the test pass we get to go home and
sleep and hug our children and all that
stuff but those poor bums have to take
that beeper home with them and sleep
with it under their pillow like like a
gun you know they have to have to keep
it it's very important they get nervous
and they twitch and stuff they need they
need security and peace of mind knowing
that things aren't going to go down at
night and two in the morning you know
things can't go bump in the night so the
caldecott tunnel is a very good way for
you to run your offline analytics
scripts and your backup processes and
you're auditing and all that stuff to
make sure that those guys can sleep
that's that's the main piece let them
sleep they need their sleep okay well
that was the whistle stop tour so right
now it's during it's in beta the project
is cloud foundry com I remember cloud
foundry com is a hosted platform as a
service that uses the code from github
com for such cloud foundry right there
are many projects running Cloud Foundry
some of them are already in production
with GA supported indemnified releases
we are moving a little slower over here
at cloud foundry com one of the things
that we're going to be having when
things that the code will have when we
release it SC oh boy there's a there's a
blog on here I'm struggling to find it
but basically we support something
called teams in the Indus new release
coming up so you'll have support for
that in the GA released by the entity
end of the
right that that gives you the ability to
say I've got an organization the
organization has developers and they
have access to the shared resources and
so on so that specifically speaks to it
looking for the blog hop I the blog was
in here mark lukowski put it up just in
a it feels like a minute ago it was like
a minute ago or maybe a month ago if I
get the days tend to blur together it
was very very reason that guy it's very
recently and it supports exactly what
you're looking for sir right now yes you
would share credentials that's not the
ideal solution so once but by the time
we're out of GA out of beta I mean
you'll have a real sort of legitimate
solution for that specific
organizational question okay okay yeah
yes yeah that's I believe hope oh please
please I hope that I mentioned that yeah
there we are there's a there's a maven
plugin a grails plugin a spring roo add
on an eclipse integration and a vm see
come online tool so yes and they all do
most of the things we've looked at and
of course by its very definition by the
very definition of having multiple
clients you have some sort of you have a
little bit of a disconnect between
supported features as we add new
features to the core but they tend to
evolve pretty quickly since most of them
are driven by VMware so for example it's
interesting to know all of these things
are actually just in fact clients to a
restful api that you can use yourself if
you want to drive and control Cloud
Foundry right so if you want to program
your cloud programmatically to implement
things like auto scaling to implement
things like smart clustering and so on
in load balancing you can it's just a
restful api in fact there's a java api
that you can use for half of that if you
just want to ask it questions we have a
java driver that talks to this restful
api that gives you information about
like how many how many services do i
have and all that stuff so all these are
just clients are just talking a rest
over over that over that service
okay yeah the nice thing about the
portability promise is you build an
application on Cloud Foundry and you may
be deployed to cloud foundry com you
decide tomorrow you want to deploy
locally and your own data center and you
want to be able to manage it from there
fine no problem same code same
everything if you decide that you know
client finder com is you just you just
hate us we're just not doing a good job
for you and you think you can get
something better from some of the other
ecosystem providers that's fine too
right so that's a huge part of the open
sort the open story right because it's
open source also if you want to run your
own data center and add support for
things you can so I you know I don't
expect a lot of people are moving to
Amazon we do see some people who have
cloud foundry applications handling the
the ninety percent cases and then maybe
amazon workloads for you know like I
can't even think of something but but
like s3 for example maybe you want to
use s3 for some use cases that's fine
right connect to it from a cloud foundry
okay oh I think that is it guys that was
it let me see hold on yeah please take
down my you know email and information
there i'm actually on twitter at let's
see this was totally not the same deck
that I used in China I have no idea what
you guys are talking about totally okay
yeah so please feel free to reach out to
me that's my those are my email
coordinates in my twitter handle i'm
more than happy to answer questions and
i'll be around the conference of course
if you have questions feel free to reach
me and you know be happy to talk thank
you so much and enjoy the rest of the
show
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
