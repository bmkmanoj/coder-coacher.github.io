with jess humble principle of thought
works and co-author of continuous
delivery hi hi how you doing good thanks
Howie pretty good so it's a nice
Thursday looking forward to some Sun was
till summer yeah so one of the first
things I want to ask you about is there
seems to be a critical skills shortage
affecting dev ops teams around the world
what are your thoughts on that well this
is something that I've been thinking
about a lot recently I don't actually
believe that that there is a skill
shortage or rather let me put it like
this I think there's always a skills
shortage and I think this is this is
nothing new I mean we work in the IT
industry the IT industry is is new and
constantly evolving and from the very
earliest days there's there's been a
skill shortage and certainly my
experience for X's we've we've always
found people coming out of college they
know things that are very important for
commercial software development such as
how to understand how process tables
work and how to do cooperative
multitasking and things like this I mean
it's but but they don't necessarily know
things like object-oriented programming
and so forth so it's always been the
case that we we've had a shortage of a
of practical experience in the industry
an industry is changing really really
fast and so the current thing that we
have a skill shortage in is DevOps but I
really think that it's not the job of
colleges and universities to reduce
people who know all these skills is the
job of companies to grow these skills by
giving people the opportunity to learn
and get better of what they do and
unfortunately we've fallen into this
trap where companies see people as you
know you want we want to hire the purple
squirrel who's exactly right for this
job and plot them in there and have them
be very hyper productive from day one
and that that's just ludicrous I mean
it's never going to work the industry
needs to take responsibility to grow
the people it needs and to make it part
of the job to teach people and giving
equal opportunities to learn as part of
what they're doing Andrew Schaefer
recently at DevOps tanunda did a
fabulous presentation called there's no
skills shortage where he essentially
makes this point and I mean he has a
pretty sophisticated mathematical
analysis that deals with Nash
equilibriums and Pareto efficiency which
is fascinating and worth looking into
but fundamentally I think you know our
companies just keep people run companies
like what's that word kind of like meat
meat grinders right where you throw the
people at the problem and turn the
handle and software comes out the other
end and we can't work like that it's it
the industry is never going to survive
if we do that companies that one of the
things I knew Schaefer says is that the
output of the software development
process is knowledge and part of that is
the knowledge and the heads of people
who are doing it and you know both you
and I have worked in very high intensity
environments where we didn't get any
time to do anything and that's you know
certainly for me that's where I learned
a bunch of stuff and then you know I got
older and didn't want to work 20 hours
in the day anymore and you know I now
I'm very strict about having some kind
of work-life balance and and but I have
a load of knowledge that people find
important and so I think you know yeah
we can throw people at the problem when
they're very young but that's not that's
not going to scale either and we need to
have some balance and the industry needs
to take responsibility for parsing it on
and growing the knowledge in the people
who are doing the work and making time
for that and providing capacity for that
and providing resources for that so
basically my messages stop whining learn
to actually grow the people who you need
to do the work as part of the job of
doing the work you know that's the only
advantage that enterprises have at this
point / startups is the capacity to do
that I believe it's interesting I think
back to discussions on on this topic
like a university education etc
and for me I found that one of the most
important things that I learned in
university was how to learn it was the
idea that I could have a variety of
things on going at once I could become
an expert in a subject in three months
such like a pass of detailed exam on
that and I could probably forget it and
the thing is that if we think that the
point of university is like more like a
technical college or like a
certification course where you come out
and you have this knowledge well you're
going to be useful for a very very short
period of time in this industry given
how much it changes and so the most
important thing you can learn is how to
learn how to find new information how to
tackle new problems and there are
fundamental underlying concepts like how
to work with people on teams how to
solve problems as a team and these are
good things to learn like how to learn
that these kind of basic things but as
far as specific skills like how to
automate the deployment of my VMS to AWS
using chef and doing this using for
instance chef solo versus what are these
kinds of extremely temporal and
Technology specific things will be so
relevant in a year or two years because
of how much things change that we look
at any developers bookshelf you've got a
big stack of books on there and
ninety-eight percent of them are not
good for anything any longer except for
holding up your monitor or holding open
your door like look all those borland
box borland c++ builder i'm going to
pull that off the shelf and i'm going to
use yeah sure you are so yeah it's it's
interesting because that focus on the
specific technologies it's it's almost
like you think that having that specific
technology is what's going to cause you
to solve the problem not actually you
know solving the problem but
problem-solving skills like boats has to
be more important in fact exactly i mean
i'm sitting in a house you're probably
sitting in the house too and that house
is made of wood and screws and knowing
every fine detail about the pressure
trading process of the wood that was in
use and knowing exactly how many curves
are on the screw is going to tell you
how to build a house because you need to
figure out how to work with the team to
get that thing together to get you know
though
drywall on the walls and a bit all these
things together is the materials the
specific things are not as relevant as
the completed product which is a
creative work and so even if you have
those checkboxes I stink I think you'd
still be screwed as far as domain
expertise yes it's rude and I think I
think I mean that you're absolutely
right and I think your points about
University of spaten I think there's
kind of two so you can have wider points
that I think are important firstly and
there's a book which i've been reading
by a guy called pal afraid who's a
brazilian educationalist he wrote I
think in the 60s in fact and then
promptly had to leave Brazil because the
comments he made was so revolutionary
and he basically he wrote this book
called pedagogy of the oppressed which
is about how to improve education for
you know the common people and the point
he makes is that the education system
treats people like empty bank accounts
to be filled up with knowledge and the
critique he makes of this you know this
idea of rote learning and learning for
the exam and a critique he makes of this
is this is a process designed to control
the way people think and to preserve
existing power structures whereas in
fact what you want to do is exactly what
you said which is to teach people to
think for themselves but the problem is
that's dangerous when you teach people
to think for themselves they might
develop their own opinions and then they
might not like what they see and decide
to you know organized and cycle so I
think you know in as much as that is
still true for a lot of people that the
education system treats and there's
empty bank accounts you know our
corporations treat people as full bank
accounts to be you know have knowledge
siphoned out of their heads basically
rather than as you know people who are
there to solve problems and you know
this comes into the management
philosophy as well in as much as
management in a lot of places about
telling people what to do you know
you're not you're treating people as
bank accounts and you know the job of
management one of my favorite books that
came out in the last couple of years is
this but Toyota kata and it talks about
how people learn to manage a Toyota and
it's written by this guy my brother
who's studied Toyota for a number of
years and the observation he made was
that you know he would ask managers how
do you learn to be a manager tighter and
they would say
we don't know that there's no there's no
course that you have to pass or anything
like that you learn to be a manager of
Toyota by having done the work first and
what you learn implicitly is that the
way you do the work is we know we need
to get from A to B we don't know how to
get from A to B so we set you know
target condition we say we here's what
we want to be in two years in a month
here are the measurable things that we
want to have achieved you work out how
to get there and the job of the managers
is to enable the people doing the work
to run a series of experiments and try
things out in order to work out how to
get there you can't plan how you're
going to get from A to B because you
don't know how you're going to get from
A to B and that's how it is in knowledge
work and this idea that drama
management's to tell people what to do
and then you will follow orders I mean
it you can't innovate in this way and so
you know all comes back to this thing
that you pointed out which is that you
know the value of knowledge workers is
knowing how to experiment and how to try
things and and and how to learn how to
get better and that's really what we
should be designing our systems around
and then you know the flip side of this
is you know I go and talk to a lot of
organizations and and people say well
you know developers don't want to learn
about systems administration sis admins
don't want to learn about coding and you
know again I'm sympathetic to that
because you know you've got something
that you love doing and that's what you
love doing but on the other hand you
join the IT industry it's gonna change
all the time you've joined the most
quickly changing industry in the world
the idea that you're not gonna have to
gain new skills all the time is
ludicrous you know if you're you have a
problem with that you're in the wrong
industry then government my answer you
should have been a plumber right hmm
there was one of the things which
mentioned it reminded me of we were
talking about the Toyota manager and how
they facilitate the team and I was
thinking I thought immediately to the
idea of removing impediments and the
ideal of the scrum master kind of seems
like a similar idea whether you know the
scrum master supposed to remove
impediments to the team doing what they
need to do at least that's the ideal
now how do you how do you think that
ends up working out the ideal of scrum
in the scrum master vs the cargo cult of
scrum in the scrum master yeah
unfortunately I see a lot of the cargo
cult and so I you know although there's
a lot of good stuff in scrum I just
always see the horrible bit where people
want to go agile and they hire a ton of
scrum masters and everyone takes the two
day course and then you know everyone's
taking orders standing up rather than
sitting down and you know demonstrating
functionality of their workstations once
a month in order to get their story
points and it's you know nothing really
changes and that's that's often be my
experience of it because i think you
know scrum is a valuable framework but
then what happens is in order to make
any of this agile and lean stuff work
it's about a cultural mindset an
organizational mindset and some of the
things that we just spoke about the
importance of the people doing the work
actually deciding how they're going to
do it and unless you move away from this
command and control mindset it doesn't
make any difference there's another
really entertaining book oddly by a guy
called the RT bugs ness who is a CFO of
Statoil which is the norwegian state oil
companies today in imagine a CFO of a
oil company in norway not to be
necessarily very humorous but he's
hilarious and he's written this fabulous
book called implementing me on budgeting
which is all about you know budgeting in
a way that doesn't involve an annual
budgeting cycle and where you actually
trust people and you know give them
money to try new things and he has this
great line he says you cannot change
command and control through commanding
control and that's the conundrum a lot
of organizations find themselves in you
know they realize that you can't
innovate in this way but how do you
change it you can't say stopped stop
giving people orders and two other
people doing about stop taking orders I
mean there's a set of paradox there
obviously and then that's the problem is
scrum right you know you've got these
practices but unless people change the
organizational mindset you know it's
going to be cargo column necessarily
it's interesting because I know how many
times I've seen that ok well now we met
now we talked what we're doing for 15
minutes every morning so now we can go
twice as fast um huh sorry what IIIi
think that's maybe your missed step two
three and everything else right inside
the underpant names right step one take
the certified scrum master course step 3
cut costs and do everything faster yeah
step 2 right okay and and I mean the
problem is the step 3 right where people
are focused on how do we how do we get
more with less and how we're going to do
it by cutting costs and and and by using
the you know the magic scrum fairy and
part of the problem is you know people
think about cutting costs in terms of
you know reducing spend on expensive
things like people so how do we solve
that problem we're going to outsource
people were gonna hire less kind of
experience people and high more kind of
young people out of college and and then
you wonder why you know scrum isn't
going to fix that problem for you and
you know one of the most important
misconceptions about lean is this idea
that you know lean means cutting costs
well no that's not what it means lean
means reducing waste in the valley
stream and by relentlessly and
continuously doing that then costs go
down I mean one of my favorite case
studies I haven't had these books here I
haven't planned this in advance oddly
enough I just have them Higgs I read
them all the time there's this book by
Gary griever he worked at
hewlett-packard on their LaserJet
firmware team and and they cut costs and
move faster by implement re architecting
their software so they could have it all
work of trunk implementing this
incredibly sophisticated suite of
automated tests and they basically were
able to deliver much more frequently and
add that much faster and and cut a lot
of cost in the process but they did it
by investing significantly in the
engineering work and the engineering
effort and you know building all this
sophisticated technology which then
enable them to cut costs down the line
but you know
you start off with we're going to fire a
bunch of people and reduce costs that
actually turns out not to reduce costs
in the long term that increases costs in
the long term and it kind of sounds like
the idea of so I'm I weigh 250 pounds I
need to drop some weight I could either
change my diet change my exercise
regimen and slowly work the way to offer
i could go get the chainsaw cut off my
legs now on your lighter the target
number that i am trying to change has
now decreased therefore i have hit my
goal all right oh there might be a
problem here yeah it's sad but it really
is I mean people people aren't thinking
so switching to a different topic and
you said you were the co-author of
continuous delivery now continuous
delivery containers to plum same thing
right there's no difference no
difference at all well this is this is
one of the areas where my thinking is
kind of evolved and continuous
deployment came out from this blog entry
by Tim Fitz who was working I'm view
right about doing many deployments today
envy and so I read that and it was I
think 2009 actually so the year before I
but came out and I thought well that's
fabulous and you know what we talked
about it in a bit and then we were
trying to work out what the title of the
book should be and I didn't want to you
know steal Tim Fitz's funder and I also
read the first principle of the agile
manifesto which was you know the the job
of software developer a phrase because
it's early in the morning I can't
remember exactly but the job of software
development is to deliver value early
and often to customers and so you know
I'm actually going to quickly
because I'm just going to do a horrible
job otherwise so the first principle
that agile manifesto is our highest
priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery of
value remember that by now so that
that's all you'll get up in the morning
and do what we do and and so that's what
we called the book continuous delivery
the distinction that we made between
them at the time was that continuous
delivery was about making sure your
software was always in a deployable
state so this actually is is an idea
which I've discovered recently is
actually there in lean thinking and it's
this is the concept called judoka which
which comes from actually when Toyota
was Toyota and building looms so they
would build looms and their big
innovation was that if the Loom found a
problem so thread was broken or there
was some other the problem and the Loon
couldn't work it would stop and so he
wouldn't try they wouldn't try and
automate their way out the problem it's
just that if they were discarded from
that the system would stop and it's it's
a concept that in in Japanese I mean it
translates as kind of automation but
with a human face so what tight Gio know
who invented the concept did is he took
the characters for automation and he
added the radical which is written in
Chinese a human and he added that that
character to the radical so he literally
took the character for human and stuck
it into the characters for automation so
it's kind of human automations it's
pretty interesting you can find this on
wikipedia and but the idea is that it's
not just automation it's not just kind
of blindly automating things it's it's
finding a way for automation to help
humans so humans are the people doing
the work and the automations job is to
serve the humans not the other way
around which is which is really
important I think and and so that's what
continuous delivery is about it's about
saying your software is always
releasable and we have systems in place
such as the deployment pipeline
continuous integration where the moment
we discover a problem the system stops
and then you have to fix it and you
prioritize fixing it over trying to do
an
thing else so really it's just that that
concept you know that dates back I guess
eighty years or maybe even 100 years
continuous deployment is about always
getting new changes into production so
you're always deploying any good bill
that you have into production and I
guess the the evolution that I made I
mean continuous delivery you don't
always have to but you can so if you're
doing judoka if you have the capability
to keep the system in a working state
all the time that's what enables you to
then do continuous deployment and I
guess the realization i've had is that
those two concepts are complementary and
that actually forcing yourself to in
fact deploy all the time is what enables
you to what creates a pressure to enable
you to practice judoka really well and
so that the two things are very
complimentary with each other and kind
of inseparable in some ways I think but
they're both emphasizing a different
part of the system it's not all like the
idea of pulling the rope to stop the
chain like that idea that you know it
like on the terror supply chain you
you're when you're building something
usually pull the rope you stop and you
address the problem same kind of idea
kind of sounds like yes yes so this is
one of the implementations of judoka in
manufacturing is the idea of this this
called the end on court i think it's
called because you can't talk about lean
without using the proper japanese words
obviously otherwise you know you're you
don't come across as a massive sued and
and so that that i think it exactly
right me in the implementation of that
idea on the production line so
at what point do you think is the right
point to implement continuous delivery
so I've got this brand new project I got
this great idea I started coding away or
just too beautiful aunty my when when
should that come in when it's kind of
the right time yeah that's a great
question because I think the temptation
is engineer's is too you know you want a
gold plate it so you're like right I am
doing a play pipeline I'm going to the
automated tests and so I'm going to
spend all this time building this stuff
and I actually deliver any software and
of course that that can be quite
unpopular and I think you know it's easy
to do big upfront design for the tools
we build in the same way that it's
possible to do too much up front design
for the software we build and so I think
that the first thing you've got to start
with is doing you know walking skeleton
basically of your deliveries tools and
so have some way oh so you're building a
java app yeah have a box which has tom
cat running on it or jetty or whatever
and you can press a button and deploy
you ok so firstly when you check into
version control you're going to build a
deployable package you know a jar or
ever or a war file you're going to run a
single unit test and then you're going
to have a button that deploys that to
your jet ebooks and then runs a single
acceptance test to prove that the box
has come up and maybe you have a single
page with the version number that that
particular bill came from in version
control and you check that that page is
present and then it has some text in it
and that's the automated test and just
something really simple like that and
then keep on delivering functionality
and then build out that deployment
pipeline as your software grows and you
need it and I think it's important to
pay attention to the life cycle so one
of the nice things that the Lean Startup
talks about is this idea of validation
that we have a business idea and we
validate it and we don't build the whole
thing in order to validate the idea so
with new products you want to validate
there's a demand for them that you have
a repeatable customer development
process before you actually build the
whole product and it's the same with
feet you know with features anytime you
come up with an idea for a new feature
you want to test that feature is
valuable to your customers before you
actually go and build it out so you know
you need to build out a sufficiently
comprehensive deployment pipeline to
validate your your product idea and then
is once you validated it then you can
grow out and become more complex and the
same thing with features you know you
don't want to immediately start out
writing a very comprehensive automated
test suite for the features you want to
validate the features valuable and then
once you've shown that customers
actually want it then you can start
building out the automated test
framework around it so you know as the
products and the features within them
grow and evolve you need to add more and
more protection for those things but you
don't want to start out that way you
want to think about what's appropriate
to that product or feature based on
whether or not it's been validated and
how valuable and important it is to
users as well you know feature which is
not very valuable you don't put a ton of
automated tests around it where is your
your core feature the thing that is most
important to your users you probably
want a lot of protection around that
arguably we should be building features
at all unless they're valuable but even
so you know that there's you will always
be thinking about what's appropriate
because automated test Suites a painful
and expensive to maintain and their form
of technical debt I guess in some sense
I mean any code is a form of technical
debt any software we write is a
liability because you need to maintain
it and that exerts a cost over its life
cycle so an interesting Haley touched
upon which i think is actually very very
hard for most projects most web apps
most software period to answer is which
features of my software are the most
valuable usually it's there's a lot of
navigation by lower intestine going on
there and how do you get an actual
quantitative measure on what's valuable
so that you know like I mean you can
think oh I've got this great idea mcrypt
again this big thing it's really
valuable because it's
it's in the mind of the product manager
as being the most important thing right
now is we direct the whole team towards
it but what concrete ways can you get
that value late what's the approach
there so that I mean that's another
really interesting question Josh carrier
ski actually did a talk at key concern
Francisco a couple of years ago where he
you know he was talking about this exact
thing he's like if only I could assign a
dollar amount to every line of code in
my code base know so that I could so
that I could delete the Knights a code
to work delivering any value to my
customers and I kind of think it's like
performance testing in a sense where you
you only really you don't have absolute
performance you know it's not that
absolute performance numbers that are
necessarily important as the system
evolves it's what's the Delta and so
that you can test because you can do a
split testing for that you know you can
you can try adding some new feature and
you can see what's the Delta in in you
know some business metric like revenue
per unit time or revenue per customer or
whatever and this is what companies like
Amazon and Etsy and so forth are doing
they actually you know that the split
test is not about how many people go
through which part it's about you know
what's the ultimate impact on their
behavior or on their spending patterns
or on you know some other business level
enter and metric and so that you can do
but actually working on absolute number
for every line of code that that's
that's really hard and I think you know
this is something that we we talked
about offline is this idea that you have
to look at production logs and see what
people are really doing in real life in
order to make effective acceptance tests
and performance test Suites but you know
if your performance tests we don't
reflect what people are actually doing
then they're not actually testing the
performance of your system reliably well
you can use that information to work out
what people are really doing with your
with your system so the things that
you're hitting a lot with performance
tests are the things you're doing it
right that people actually care about
and those are the things that are
delivering the most line of code that
sorry the most value to your customers
those are the lines of code that
the most important the only problem is
that there is kind of you know humans
are not rational agents and part of it
is the marketing effect so you know I
own an SUV I learned California says a
hybrid SUV and one of the marketing
things about it is you know the ability
to off-road and blah blah blah yeah I'm
never going to offer aid my SUV I'm not
and actually no that's not the reason I
bought it but there's plenty of people
who bought it because of that tagline
even though they're going to never never
use that bit of functionality so you
know this is a cancer arguing to the
people who complain about Microsoft Word
being massively bloated is you know well
yes most eighty percent of people use
twenty percent of the features but
twenty percent of those people really
care about those tiny little features
which are all adding up to the enormous
blow and and that's what differentiates
that's why they're not using openoffice
so it's really hard to do that you know
that those lines of codes that people
aren't using that your poor performance
tests aren't touching you know for a
small percentage of perhaps your most
vocal early adopting customers that are
spreading the word on social networks
those might be the most important
features so that that's why it's really
hard to do that analysis but the Delta
you know what what what is going to what
war should we spend money on as we
increase the system that you can measure
and that is one of the really important
reasons for going to market early is
that you can start with the basic core
functionality and you know maybe do it
to a beta test group get your early
adopters in there and then everything
you build out subsequently is based on
AV testing and making sure that the next
Delta is going to deliver value but then
when your system gets really big
actually working out how to start
simplifying and cutting back that stuff
and not turning into blood where if I
had an answer to that problem I would be
on my Hawaiian Islands not hot on a
google hangout now you'd be buying a bag
from Ariel's and right yeah
it's definitely interesting i actually
saw some discussion about something like
this on Twitter earlier this week I was
talking about how the most important
thing you can do is listen to your users
rather than talking and the idea that
you know I'll and telling this is the
future you want this if you want get
that feedback and see what they use and
they'd be testing like a great way to do
that you get quantitative metrics saying
you know this is this is what they
actually do they might tell you one
thing but they do another there's a book
by am steve bell and my cousin called
lenity and there's a fabulous quite a
name where they say and users don't know
what they want users know what they
don't want once you've built it for them
and i think you know this is the problem
we face you say would you like this and
they're like sure we'd love that and you
build it for them and they're like
actually not using it I kind of sucks
and you know baby you don't want to tap
into people's conscious minds because
they're conscious mind to the
fabrication they make up after the event
and so that's useless guides to actually
understanding what people need because
yes a much deeper level of consciousness
so that's why I really like the Lean
Startup focus on experimentation we're
going to experiment on people and tap
directly into their subconscious by
measuring their behavior because your
conscious mind is actually very useless
as a guides to what you actually care
about because your conscious mind is all
post-hoc it's interesting a lot of what
we've been talking about like with with
continuous delivery and getting feedback
there's it reminds me of the lean idea
of flow how you basically you have this
thing and ideas flow through now there's
a tangent for you so there's a thing
coming up called flow con and what does
this provide that the other ten thousand
comptes that currently exist don't
provide excellent question and yeah
thanks for giving me the opportunity to
talk about that so flow con is a
conference that trifle consol works are
going to be running on first in november
in san francisco
and the idea behind it is actually a
number of different things so firstly
all the comments is that we go to tend
to be domain-specific so you go to
engineering conferences or testing
conferences is sometimes there's
conferences where there's a testing part
of the conference in an engineering part
then the UX people go to their
conferences and then the business people
go to their conferences and so part of
the problem we have is the silos where
you create in our organizations and you
know this is what DevOps obviously is is
trying to fight and so in as much as
we're all trying to focus on actually
the systemic problem which is what we
talked about in the first principle of
the agile manifesto our highest priority
is to satisfy the customer through early
continuously very valuable software
that's about getting people to
collaborate and to understand each
others worlds and you know the the
problem of skill acquisition is as John
Vincent very eloquently said recently
you know we actually have to not occupy
space next to each other but try and
collaborate with each other and
understand each others worlds I mean he
had this fabulous blog entry on DevOps
recently which he wrote in a drunken
rage on an aeroplane where he swears
very liberally but it's fabulous and I
put it in my presentations because it's
just brilliant and so flow con is is is
saying well let's put our money where
our mouth is and let's create a
conference which is designed around how
to actually achieve our business goal
which is rapid delivery of new
functionality experimentation how that
changes UX engineering testing
operations and how we enable people to
collaborate together effectively to
enable this higher high goal around
continuous delivery deployment lean
product development insightful so it's a
small conference that the first you've
run it's kind of an expert but it's we
have we I think the program's just gone
online flow con dog not all the sessions
are up but almost all of them are and
we've got you know Roy wrap
who runs the monitoring team Netflix
talking about cloud operations at
Netflix we've got Jeff gotthelf who
wrote the lean UX book talking about
product validation activities to support
continuous delivery we've got Katrina
Owen talking about refactoring Gary
groover who wrote this book I was
talking about is talking about what he
did he's now vp of ops and release and
testing at macys.com so he's going to
talk about his experiences colleague of
mine from full works as a type of talk
called from mainframes to continuous
delivery in a thousand easy steps which
is one of my favorite titles I think and
we have Linda rising talking about
organizational change and how you do
that so it really is I mean we've been
very lucky that you've got some really
fabulous people talking about every
aspect of how you actually enable this
these fast feedback cycles and what
everyone needs to do and how you can
write together so that that was the idea
of the conference let's put our money
where our mouth isn't actually focus on
the high level goal and how we all work
together to enable that I think it's
pretty unique yeah a silent Western and
one of things I want to ask about it is
you've mentioned DevOps has been kind of
one of the big examples of this silo
breaking down now how could devil's
break down the slaughter when you get
that third developed in between the dev
in the obstacle yeah so this is a rent
that I blogged about I guess otay over
last year I guess or something I needed
to hang out with the John alspaugh where
you talking about this topic as well
write and say yeah it's unfortunate and
I think you know that the people
involved in the early days of the DevOps
movement knew that there was going to be
semantic diffusion and people with
whatever however you define this term
the tool vendors are going to take it
and slap it on things organizations are
going to adopt it and use it as a way to
pretend they're doing something new
while carrying on doing your things and
they were always doing now it's going to
go cargo cult in the same way that scrum
and cargo cult and so this is just one
particular cargo cult phenomenon which
is that you know in order to solve a
silo problem we're going to create a new
silo and call it DevOps
and so yeah I mean that's obviously DPR
owning have you been certified on the
DevOps cloud you know it's gonna happen
you know sale and that's proof so yeah
and you know partly my place was a bait
and switch because I do think there's a
place for a dev ops team there was and
what but but the crucial thing is
they're not on the hook for release
management you know rebranding your
release management team who gets you
know the developers hate the release
team because the release team can never
get the stuff release and the operations
people hate them because they're
releasing too often and so you know they
get it from both sides and and you know
we're not going to rebrand that as
DevOps and return we're doing DevOps
that that's not the case what there is a
place for is a team which builds the
tools but you know Devon ops use in
order to get more efficient at doing
their job and to help with capability
development to help the people doing the
work learn how to get better at it so
that that is a real thing one of the
things again that in Toyota cutter they
talked about is how you know the people
doing the work a responsible for
improving but they're not going to be
going and creating new machines or
reconfiguring the machines in order to
do that there's an engineering team
whose job it is to actually build this
stuff to help the people do the work
more effectively there is also a talk
velocity this year I'm just going to
quickly see if I can get it up and about
post mortems yeah so this is talk that
was by a guy called Dan milstein from
ha8 called how to run a post-mortem with
humans not robots and he makes this
really important distinct automation and
tools your makers dropping your chest oh
sorry so this is this is an unfortunate
feature of google hangouts is that the
moment you when utopia yeah so sorry dan
milstein at velocity do there really
interesting talk called how how to solve
your problems in humans not robots and
he has its distinction between
automation and tools so automation is
humans cause your problems and we're
going to solve it with automation and
tooling is human solve your problems and
the tools help you to do that and so
this is going to what we talked about
earlier with judoka and so the job of
the tools team it is to build a product
and you're doing product development the
same way that you're doing product
development when you build software and
the consumers of the product are your
internal people your developers your
engineers your operations people and so
what you're what you're doing is is is
treating them as your customers and
producing something which will help them
do their job but you're not trying to do
their job for them you're not trying to
automate them as a good job none of
those things you're just helping
providing tools to help them get better
at what they do and that I think is
about if you want to call that DevOps
sure you know I don't really have a
problem with that I mean it's not really
the essence of develops the essence of
delp's is collaboration but if you're
producing tools to help people
collaborate and make it more easier for
people to collaborate that that's part
of the job and the skill and again if
you've works in Prague of element if you
sold products to people you know that
you kind of selling the product you have
to help them understand how to use it
and so that's the other job right
helping skills people develop skills and
capabilities help them understand how to
get better of what they're doing and
both of those things are complementary
so that I'm that I'm okay with it seems
entirely pragmatic there is something
wrong Activia point well you know this
is par the reason I go to love going to
velocity and in these things that I
always see really hey I get see
interesting talks and then be I get to
hang out with interesting people and
that's great what paying for my chose
good talking with you uh absolute
pleasure and thanks very much have a
good day you see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
