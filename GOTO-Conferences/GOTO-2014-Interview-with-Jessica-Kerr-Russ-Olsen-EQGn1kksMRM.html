it's my pleasure to be spending a few
minutes interviewing rustles and Jessica
Kerr Jessica's just given it to giving a
talk on the functional programming for
those of us that were stateful sinners
at russ's corsican detects been working
on you know moving from Ruby to probably
closure there's a rumor that in fact
yeah right so I thought maybe we could
just you just share a little of your
experience about the the transitions and
what it's been like and so on and now of
course I can see more in your talk in
particular but perhaps you just give us
a quick synopsis of what do you think
the key steps are to transition from
object oriented to functional purpose
well first I'll say that object oriented
programming totally has its place in
Reed's talk today he talked about a
remote procedure calls and the
boundaries of where functional where
function calls and procedure calls
become become not realistic and so
object oriented totally has its place
message passing is awesome but I think
as we've gotten more and more into
objects we've forgotten that while we
are in the same process functional
composition is really useful and the
good part is that we don't have to
switch languages in order to use the
style of functional programming
especially with Java 8 coming out that's
very exciting and c-sharp already has
lambdas so in my talk crisp resuming
there's a good implementation oh of
course it's going to be great they've
been working on it long enough in my tux
tomorrow i really emphasize how it's not
about the language as much as it is
about a way of thinking some languages
make that easier than others I just
switch to closure in my day job oh there
yeah
um but we can think about reducing our
mutable state and and increasing our use
of data and data out functions to
improve all of our code even when we're
sticking with our object-oriented
paradigm because there is great value in
that paradigm anyway one of the things
that I think about when I think about
people moving from object-oriented
programming to functional programming is
it's sort of a process of disassembly
I'm kind of really interested in how
people look at these things and I think
traditional object-oriented programming
is kind of this package of solutions you
know there's objects and there's data
encapsulation and there's methods and
when you move the functional programming
what you're really doing is you're
pulling those things apart so that you
can have polymorphism without the
objects or you can hide the data or not
hide the data and it it really
disassembles the pieces of better sort
of traditionally together in
object-oriented programming I think it's
it's for me it's really interesting to
watch people get that and realize they
can use these tools separately instead
of all sort of packaged stuff that we
can pass verbs as well as now yeah
exactly yeah um that come takes the
position it's a little different from
the haskell school of thinking where
basically you know that you know really
you know there should be no mutable
state except except then company things
except in the Mona yeah yeah that is
that is a position yeah at least for me
I guess I do see this through closure
color of the eyes I see that you can
build a lot of your program with
immutable
data and functions but in the end there
are things changing in the world then
you should just admit there are things
changing in the world and model it that
way right but isolate that and call it
out yeah I don't have to do that with
the mana and the other part and with a
mutable state in Java it's really
painful to make everything immutable in
a way that's enforced by the compiler
but we can choose not to mutate it and I
suppose that's the difference between
Java and closure for example is it's
really a question of the faults we're in
Java of the state's beautiful like fault
and you can work hard to make it in
beautiful enclosure it's all immutable
by default and the special cases the
mutable state so the has been joked and
I think it's actually a fact that
basically design patterns no oh are just
idioms in a reasonable programming
language design patterns are language
smell and some of them just go away and
functional in a functional language I
well maybe we're talking about
definitions here but as the guy who
wrote the book on repeat design patterns
but let me disagree okay I think it's so
maybe this is a definitional thing but I
think that design patterns really are
the idioms and a programming language
and the idioms can be more complicated
or less complicated so I always smile
when i get to the end of a 600-page
closure book which is full of this is
how we do it enclosure do it this way
this is the way it's done enclosure and
then in the last few pages they'll say
and there's no design patterns and
closure well it's 600 pages of design
package there just there's a simple easy
takes a really not design patterns the
problem is a really a teeth lenguage
idioms yeah the problems are just not
available
oh good so you have they become a
pattern or style yeah yeah one thing
I've learned from the Ruby community is
that they have really strong idioms and
the rubyists use discipline to not do a
lot of the crazy stuff that Ruby will
totally let them do and they've
developed this as a community and I
really love that about Ruby yeah I think
I i think the Ruby people got a few
things right I think they got lots of
things right and one of the things that
I like is just the they settled on like
code conventions very early on and so
there's not the interminable arguments
about what the code should look like
there's a little bit of that but not a
whole bunch I think that's a real value
I think that's carrying over and licking
but in the closure world where you don't
have these you know enormous arguments
about where the quantities goes people
particularly around yeah it's all right
yeah they go around yes ya know one of
the main approaches to using functional
programming is to use the types to help
you do the design this is really
something that's very strong in the
haskell school and skala since is based
on haskell an f-sharp which is really
based on o camel but itself related you
know how does that fit with your you
know how important is it to see the type
system and sort of thinking types do you
think the functional programming or is
that just something extra on top so i
just switched from scala to closure and
I already missed the type system however
I found that just yesterday I had a
fairly complicated problem and to see
how it fits together I wrote the types
down in my notebook recognized and plug
it a functor googled that found the
right function to to UM did the
transposition enclosure and so the types
looking at them helped me recognize the
problem but I didn't have to look at
them in the language I just looked at
them on a piece of paper and that was
sufficient
so just because your language is
enforcing the types doesn't mean you
can't think that right look abused core
duck type is o uh I have not I am so I
am a longtime rubios so the types just
sort of look to me like a lot of baggage
and extra ceremony yeah and and you know
I could be wrong it could be just the
you know the background the baggage that
I'm carry them into the language but
type systems just always seemed to me to
be either trivial and in the way say the
jaw the one where it's not really
helping me and it's just all ceremony or
if they're really going to help me
they're so complicated that they're not
helping me anymore if you follow me but
if they're complicated or strong enough
that they're actually do some good
they're really hard to manipulate so we
just did lambda jam in in Australia will
do it here again in chicago in july so
want to see some great functional
programmers in chicago yeah july tonight
so i think one of the discussions we had
is the approach that I'm familiar with
for learning scheme and also used in
teaching old lorae languages languages
like Jay and APL and so on was you eat
what you did is you learned that kind of
the kata or the idioms of the language
by doing lots of small exercise and
expressions alright so just as you're
doing karate you become you know it
becomes reflex to do these things that
put together the idioms and you sort of
learn how to work with collections right
essentially you saw you you know you
don't actually think about okay do I
need a flat map or whatever it is and
that's the way in the old days you know
the books like the little schemer and so
on things that really got you into doing
lots and lots of exercises and after
that you were kind of comfortable kind
of speaking in the language and then you
could actually sort of start designing
programs have you seen anything like
that and they approaches they we use is
that something I know there are similar
kinds of things
close or they sort of you know
progressive exercises well close your
duck yeah yeah that kind of thing okay I
think it really depends on your learning
style right I'm so that they would give
me a big project person but take over
for a big one yeah sir give me a big
problem and i'll i'll do it 14 times and
you're out how to do it right on that
15th cried John I've read that so we do
things the way our brain works and our
brain works the way we do things and
that the what surprised me was when i
read that the best way to train your
brain in a new way of thinking is just
to do it do it with your hands and then
your neurons will conform and then
you'll be able to do it faster and that
part of the effort will fall away so I i
mean i agree with you i think that just
doing it is the best way and i think a
lot of i wish a lot more work places
would give developers time to experiment
because frankly if you don't give me
time to experiment on something of my
choosing i'm going to experiment in your
business cuts you're gonna get the
experiments anybody going to get them in
there going dinner right question is for
the production a lot either that you're
not learning anything in this also
terrible oh we're out of time i want to
thank you both for sharing your thoughts
i think this is a very interesting for
those of you particularly transitioning
from ruby and looking at languages like
probably more like closure than scowler
or haskell but our F sharp but we know
so I think it we good you know two great
speakers you that clearly demonstrate
that the journey is not so difficult and
as usual there may still be some place
for objects and messages along with your
functions so thanks very much
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
