first speed talk my name is Walter de
Weldon I work on the backend systems
over at the true caller I'm not quite
sure what a speed talk is probably it'll
be over very quickly and your you want
to remember anything but I'll try to
give you at least a few takeaways I'm
going to be talking about event logging
so what I mean when I use that term is
the process of collecting processing
storing information that's going on in
your systems whether it's in your mobile
clients whether it's on the web in your
platform services in third parties all
of the data collection and data storage
that we do and there's it's quite sad
that there's actually no real good name
for this some people talk about data
integration used to be a thing called
ETL but still there doesn't seem to be a
good like industry-wide term for this
like very important thing that's present
that practically every company in every
stack driving you know all of the
benefits that people always talk about
when it comes to big data when it comes
to you know the benefits of having
analytics and so forth all of that is
predicated on being able to collect the
data reliably storage reliably so this
talk is is is like just a small Marshall
Marshall reminding you first of the the
importance of that and also sharing a
few learnings from true color when we
basically redid our our system that
collects and stores this type of
information before I dive in on that
just a few words about true color so
we're aware startup based right here in
Stockholm found in 2009 we also have
offices in India in San Francisco we're
currently just shy of shy of 90
employees I'm sure you know we're
familiar to to lots of people in this
room what we do I have a few use cases
here but they're all basically based on
same idea which is that if you have a
phone number and you need to find out
which which person which contact that
phone number is associated with that's
that's the basis of everything we do so
like the first example on the left is
caller ID you receive a phone call the
person who's calling you their phone
number is not in your contact book true
color makes a search into our back-end
and finds out who that person is who
that company is that's calling you um
similarly we have like a dialer
experience within the true color up so
when you have a dialer that's not just
reliant on the phone numbers in your
contact book but can actually go to
infectious actually find out any person
that you've called or is called you or
that you potentially want to call we can
make lots of nice features available
there as well and finally of course the
block spam and unwanted calls we keep
lots of Records and about spam colors
and we also have a huge community of
people who report spam that helps us to
identify calls that people are probably
aren't going to want to receive in terms
of reach we're extremely cross platform
on all the major up stores of course and
also localized in to over 40 languages
which has been really nice for us as
we've gone into new markets in numbers
were about 200 million users worldwide
about half of those are in india and i
mentioned spam calls we detect and block
about 400 million spam calls per month
which is which is number we're extremely
proud of considering how intrusive and
obnoxious most people consider I'm spam
calls okay moving on to event logging
without a reliable and complete data
flow a Hadoop cluster is little more
than a very expensive and difficult to
assemble space heater so this is
basically the idea behind when I what I
want to impart to you today which is
that if you don't have a reliable set of
components that that gathers data from
your system and and and stores it then
basically everything else you build on
top of that all the fancy data analysis
tools
all the stuff about big data gets
compromised so this is a event logging
or data integration is an extremely
important part of the stack but it's
often not discussed at all really so the
idea is basically to collect and store
everything who's doing what in your
application what transactions are going
on in your back-end why are those things
happening if you do a/b tests everything
that's going on in your system you
probably want to track and this also
usually scales in multiple directions so
you have lots of things that you want to
track right because your app is scaling
in terms of its users you're adding more
features and complexity all the time as
your app matures you realize new things
you need to track so you have kind of
multiplicative factors which lead to a
situation where you're going to need to
track more and more things with larger
and larger scale and and ultimately the
point is to derive a good
decision-making force for a company like
us which is you know under 90 employees
we don't really have the resources to
not design this well and neither can we
afford to have a system that does not
that is not reliable that is not
scalable because that's going to lead to
there's two possible dangerous here one
is that you lose data which means it's
the data is completely unreliable and
you're basically flying in the dark and
the other possibilities you can't track
all the things that you would like to
track you have to prioritize or you have
to hold off on doing things many of
these things like data integration is
something that doesn't naturally always
scale in the same way that certain
service applications do where you can
just spawn more notes to to handle the
traffic so to this end I want to talk
about two things that we did when we
redesigned the event logging that were
super useful to us kind of two key ideas
that I can be delivered in such a short
speech first I want to talk about
schemas so schemas are basically how and
where you define and how you share
what types of things you're going to
track in the system now this needed
redesign on our end because a year ago
we had a situation where the things we
wanted to track were defined all across
the system they were defined in source
code in our mobile clients in our
backends sometimes also in places in
logging framework which of course not
only creates overhead because you need a
lot of person-to-person communication to
synchronize those things but also of
course you end up with communication
errors just bugs version mismatches
which means that's you either log store
data that's wrong or you might not store
anything at all of those mismatches are
bad enough so clearly leading to
substantially less reliable system so
what we decided to do with schemas is to
use a centralized repository for them so
the idea is that there is only one
version of a schema and and that gets
defined once and is immutable for all
eternity technology-wise we used
something called Apache over which is
quite well-known actually more well
known for its serialization properties
which which we also use the Avro binary
format is very nice but but more
importantly for us we we wanted this
centralized schema repository where we
would define immutable schemas once and
then we would use them everywhere so the
flow became to to type out event schemas
in averroes the main language you
publish that you generate library
objects that then can be used across
your stack across the programming
languages across technologies in all the
different places and so you eliminate
version mismatches you eliminate
problems with communication between
teams and so forth so you get a rid of a
lot of errors that you don't really need
to have moving quickly onward to
thinking about the incoming data the
incoming events as streams and how this
helped us make our system substantially
more reliable so before we had a system
of highly couple components
this is the old problem where you have a
fast sender and a slow receiver and one
of them gets overwhelmed and because
there's no way to propagate information
about failures upstream what ends up
happening is a component goes down
everything stops working failures
propagate extremely easily you have down
time you have lost information if you
instead model of the event data as flows
which what you have a system where you
can propagate failures we used our curse
streams which is an implementation of
the of the reactive streams interfaces
as laid out in the reactive manifesto to
achieve this and so instead of having
singular components where that only know
kind of their own inputs and outputs we
have a system where where each component
is aware that they're part of a stream
and and they're aware of strategies that
they can use to to to propagate failures
upstream they can buffer they can drop
certain types of things they can take
new resources in order to to to handle
that load and so on and this has been a
huge boon and actually we've seen this
in production save us from data loss
multiple times so these are the two
ideas I want to share with you today for
for for storing these types of events
centralized schema definition and load
aware components I am out of time thank
you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
