how to affect change in the
epistemological wasteland of
applications security that's like a
really weird title and the person who
wrote that should be you know extricated
right no uh rate the session so yes so
this is the this is the the talk and
you're like wow I didn't think I was
going to hear the word epistemology
today well you know there you go you can
get these slides right now I'm with the
conferences but if you want to go to a
bit ly / go to app sec you can download
them follow along in that way or if you
want to or you know save them off or
whatever you want to do i work at signal
sciences live in austin texas what I
landed here in London I get in the cab
and we make some small talking's like oh
you're from Texas and oh yeah from Texas
he's like do you have a gun I'm like
well like not on me you know like and
when you're in Texas sir you don't ask
people if they have a gun that's their
first rule there so and working on work
on gauntlet and the hands-on gamla book
work out with dev ops days and and last
on like a Josh mentioned a quick word
from from what would I do like for my
day job at signal sciences we work we're
an application security monitoring and
instrumentation product we like think of
it as application security you can use
an approach that integrates both well
into dev ops types and organizations and
a lot of the the core team there
previously came from etsy and we're
productized a lot of work that's going
on there and if you're interested in
that at all signal sciences calm and
i'll mention a little bit more about
that later on so i know it's the
afternoon i know it's like a little bit
rainy outside maybe you're feeling a
little sleepy let's just like get to the
summary upfront and then you can just
like kick back and take a nap or
whatever if you want so you know
software development has has been in a
constant experiment in how we know
anything
our application security we'vewe've
abdicated responsibility and effectively
advocated development responsibility
through incoherent philosophical
approaches in fostering organizational
silos but DevOps is here to stay and
security can choose to get on the boat
for that ops has found a way to add
value security cam 2 and there are some
ways we can add value a development at
deploy and run time will have some
practical ideas on how you can I can do
that going forward so so this is this
talk could also be titled like how do we
know anything in application security
and like this the spoilers like we don't
actually know anything so let's start
out with what were actually what I'm
actually trying to posit here is the
epistemological problem of a software
development and I know you're again a
press that I was able to pronounce that
word I practiced it a lot okay we we we
as humans like we optimized for the
probable and like we're trying trying to
solve problems we that's that's how we
we think like what's actually going to
happen we do so with things like unit
testing and integration testing and we
end up with like happy path engineering
like the optimal flow through our code
then we we also take that other thing we
say let's optimize for all the possible
scenarios and this often gets spoken up
it's like over engineering and it can
end up being that scaling algorithm that
you never that you spent like week
writing but you never actually used
because you know your product didn't
take off or whatever and there's
actually really too much to choose from
in the realm of the possible so we
really just optimize cool we see is the
perceived probable and and how do we
know how do we know what to create and
that's like our real problem that we
face and so we are continually kind of
going down that path or any experimental
way and that's the epistemological
problem of software development nailed
at second time so hopefully we'll sleep
and keep saying that all right and we
like together rhetoric to support our
support our Theory supporter ideas and
we've already too already talked about
agile and indefinite in just delivery
all through so i'm going to try to kind
of cruise through these slides real
quick but I think we can look at three
major arcs in software development
and you look at agile agile sort of
avoids the problem it's like we we have
no idea what we're building you know
it's like and that's okay because what
we're going to do is we're just going to
ship it you know every week every day
whatever it is and and we we have
behavior driven development which is you
know agile bus feedback and dan dan
really has a great quote here he
actually says you know we're building
software that matters and that's the
really big point behind all of this
we're trying to amplify the feedback
loop oh yeah oh there's also funny
pictures in here because it's like
dedicated to Sky Mall I was really sad
and they went out of business and so I
it's like one of those products that's
like you always just like you're in the
flight and you're like oh and somebody's
going to buy one of those someday you
know but i guess not enough people did
so therefore but I don't did anybody buy
one of these I don't know seems like
it'd be comfy all right well agile
emphasizes feedback to developers from
their overlord managers and sometimes
even their customers but you know really
the short end of it is that rapid
iterations win and we can never really
overstate the like how important a jewel
is kind of in the whole progression of
all this I mean these should have sold
right like I would have guessed like
this would be flying off the shelf okay
yeah but but you know the world has
changed even since then we don't sell
CDs anymore we talked about some of that
this morning but we have software as a
service is kind of a key factor here
we've we've really had a complete change
in the way we deliver software the way
we distribute it our revenue revenue
models and Along Came DevOps the ink
wore off after like a couple days so it
was really worth it okay no no I didn't
I didn't really I just run with the
internet um some people are like that
guy he wrote it on his hands all right
yeah so DevOps is the application of
agile methodology to system
administration and i think that's that's
really becoming kind of a pervasive view
of like as we're continuing to move
agile outwards like that's that's how
DevOps works you may also think this is
how DevOps
looks which i think is you know also
kind of a fair assessment people call it
agile infrastructure we've talked about
this earlier today but did the ten
deploys today thing was a really you
know pivotal point in the movement
focused on less work in progress less
technical debt customers actually using
the feature while the developer is
working on it all this sort of stuff is
really where you know this is some of
the stuff we've already talked about all
day long right so but we're producing
happier developers we're kind of
breaking down that wall confusion we are
kind of avoiding this that the
traditional DevOps you know a
relationship and DevOps realized that
the ops didn't know what what devs know
and vice versa to that and in most
organizations you know pre 2009-2010
when DevOps was like started started
moving a lot of dev tops ratios really
ten to one if that does that sound about
like right did you guys have like 10
developers 21 operations more or less
yeah okay so it was kind of it was a
breakthrough worse and now we're going
to join people maybe a different type
ratio different type team structure but
we're going to join around actually
solving a common problem instead of kind
of the organizational hierarchy we need
to think about how culture is is quite
important for us Patrick Dubois the guy
who coined the term DevOps and is like
the the godfather of DevOps is you know
culture is the most important aspect of
DevOps succeeding in the enterprise he
actually did a like a journal in the
cutter IT journal a couple maybe like
four years ago but it was like how you
can actually get all these DevOps
principles that at the time everybody
said was just for startups like to
actually invade in the enterprise like
work in the enterprise like here we are
today like we're seeing kind of the
fruit of that as we're going forward and
and it is really important for us to
think about how we actually shift our
culture and we've talked about that I
have a little three-year-old and and
she's really she's really into the moon
and like I think we have a moon culture
and our family has not like very
spiritual like that it's more like so
she sees it she wants to go outside and
see it you know we talked about it and
then like I've realigned my culture to
her right so I have a little app on my
phone and so I can back oh yeah it's a
waning crescent moon today and it's
forty seven percent illuminated you know
and like she's three what does she know
write it up and then I can tell her like
we're probably not going to see the moon
tonight you know or whatever right so i
think i can like make predictions about
it and I could start speaking her
language and we started sharing we have
like a mutual understanding oh and I
also found out like now I'm like visibly
excited when I see the moon I'm like
that's the moon that's so great and it's
like why because like that's that's like
it infected the way that I view the
world now right so we have a mutual
understanding we have shared language
shared views collaborative tooling this
doesn't mean like you know we have beer
Fridays or whatever like your fridays
are great but that's not what a culture
change really is indicative of so Tom
limb and Shelley wrote this in his in
his recent book that DevOps is
inevitable result of need to do
efficient operations a distributed
computing and cloud environment I think
this is right on like the cloud is kind
of a forcing function as we're moving
forward with dev ops and you know Nicole
is here had already already kind of said
this but you know basically I mean you
can just like read the the big points
are like orders of magnitude better is
where DevOps is taking us we think about
culture automation measurement sharing
baci baci gloop and damen Edward said
that and we've we've already started
like identify patterns in organizations
where like you know how you how you
don't do this and like your your next
steps like shouldn't be this approach
and just like one last thing I culture
because I always feel like we we we get
really stuck in the tooling and really
get stuck in like our deploy pipelines
and all that stuff and we don't really
think back to like really how important
like the cultural piece really really is
to us so I don't know some people would
maybe say that this isn't a third our
core it's a continuation I don't know
this is all just like kind of hand
waving and the way I view it but I'd say
continuous delivery is sort of the next
wave you see a lot of people speak speak
about it differently like you've seen
the conversation shift around this
around this topic
it's not really how often you deliver
but how little you can deliver at a time
we start thinking through the idea of
lean like small batch sizes and we have
this with these delivery pipelines and
we have a small batch size and a lot of
people will not like this because it's
starting giving control to the
developers to push code and you know
separation of duties is no good I think
we should start a go to you know go to
is considered harmful right so
separation of duties is considered
harmful is I think the new thing we need
to go to go to market with there's all
the all the actual like compliance
documentation doesn't really necessitate
separation of duties the way that we've
interpreted and interpreted them in most
organizations and that's kind of been a
major a major failure so really you need
to give developers power to do their own
deploy reduce code latency increase
velocity okay so we have three arcs but
like I really see like the next piece
that's like coming in over the next five
years like that's coming in the fold is
security or really rugged so all right
so this is a poll have you guys ever
heard a security person ever say those
those stupid developers okay all right
has anybody had anybody said anything
like this to them like security prefers
a system powered off and unplugged have
you guys ever said that to a yeah yeah
and you know like both are really
demeaning statements right like I
remember whenever I joined a team and
and this somebody told this to me and I
was like I'm not like an idiot right
like yeah I like security but like we
gotta like make money you can't just
like unplug everything right and and I
think both sides kind of like kind of
our speaking language that is sort of
you know rude to each other right and so
this this creates a cultural unrest in
the organization we have a compliance
driven culture I'd like to read this
quote here so risk assessment introduces
a dangerous fallacy that structured
inadequacy is almost as good as adequacy
and then underfunded security efforts
plus risk management are about as good
as properly funded security work does
that does that bother anybody nobody
and doesn't it make you a little bit
depressed like they people want to
replace actual security engineering work
with you know risk management and cut it
and basically actuarial approaches to
doing that does that bother you now that
now that I say it in that way is that ok
yeah like because it's no good you're
like that's ridiculous and in this book
it's a it's a book about securing modern
web applications but the first chapter
is worth the the whole thing the whole
price of the book because he walks
through security engineering all the way
back to the sixth from the 60s all the
way to today and like how in the 60s in
the 70s there's a lot of like crypto lot
of work going on in that that space and
then engineering kind of took a dive and
actuarial method sort of like
skyrocketed in the 90s and and its
really really quite interesting well I
think the security is where ops was five
years ago and unlike the coal my stats
are like completely made up but I think
they're completely real in the in the
world of orders of magnitude right does
anybody say like hasn't seen this
pattern in organizations yeah I mean
maybe you got the one right i mean but
usually you have about like 100 or so
developers two to ten operations to like
you know one security or half or the
place between one of the summer place
that i work before it's like 300
developers to attend to one or so it
sounds like orders of magnitude type
thinking but you can see there's
definitely an inequitable distribution
there and I think that it's because the
understaffing thinks that means a no one
thinks that the security can help with
the business win you know dev dev ops
change that for operations for the ten
to one bit and but I think that that's
like we know that people actually do
care about resiliency Netflix showed
that I live in Texas and and you when
you go to the aisle in the grocery store
to buy a little plastic bags there's
like zip lock and all the stuff and
there's like this house brand for the
grocery store and it's called Texas
tough and you're like I want the Texas
tough bags because like if I don't get
them like it's just going to leak all
over the floor
or whatever it is right it's like I
can't pack my kids lunch in it in a non
Texas tough bag I'll something Texans
are a little crazy right because like
yeah oh no yes you could probably it's
that tough you could use it for pants if
you want to do right all right and and
it starts speaking to like those those
innate desires that we all have and I
think that's what the rugged software
movement really speaks to and and what
rugged DevOps is really speaking to as
well there's a couple videos in here
that if you click on the links you'll
get it there's a talk by Twitter a tap
psych USA a few years ago that was
really great on how they did a lot of
integration here Zane Lackey over etsy
at velocity securities ways forward is
to help developers and operations and I
think that's where we need to start so
let's let's review security approach
thus far okay here's what here's what
security is done right here's a first
bad idea okay applications can to be
defended because we had this big
movement of like web application
firewall suck so let's do developer
training so we taught people about like
the little gray pop-ups and sequel
injection and and then we we had
awareness campaigns to help developers
you know understand how to write code
more securely but we actually abandoned
knowing anything useful about what was
actually going on on the wire with your
application instead we need to take your
poetry add defense based on behaviors
okay bad bad idea number two developers
can't figure it out so let's scan for
vulnerabilities instead and so we you
know a lot of times a pen tester will
come to you and like here's this 400
page PDF you know and you're like oh
what am I going to do with this like how
do I it's like it's completely
overwhelming and it doesn't actually fit
into kind of the flow that people are
used to handling and you with the
symphysis ah knapsack training in
practice we made it a really a dark art
I mean like 400 page PDF basically means
like no one's going to read that I've
had people telling me before like 400
pages you're lucky because I've gotten a
two thousand page one before I'm like
wow like that
yeah I don't know I thought you should
fire that pin tester all right but you
know integrated rugged testing should
sit inside your build pipeline and I'll
show you a way to do that here in a
second we need to about any bad idea
number three is with the new alignment
to vulnerability scanning there's a
tendency to fix the low-hanging fruit
you can wonder about this but the
problem with this like it's good to fix
stuff but like we still actually don't
have any idea what's going on we don't
have any idea what they're attacking and
real threats are going unknown to us so
developers can only fix what like the
attack tooling is actually you know
detecting it at one certain point in
time and if that's like separated apart
from your actual build system and that's
no good but if you can add application
security telemetry and things to help
clue people in what's traditionally seen
is like operational type data but also
like feeding that back to your
development side like that's really
helpful okay and then putting tooling
and no one outside of security can
understand usually a name of compliance
so we have that whole like get a web app
firewall as is what pci tells us to to
do and this is how web app firewalls
generally work and it ends up being like
and usually the trick behind what about
firewalls you can choose your own
eventual adventure here you can choose a
possible solution smallest possible
possible solution you can consider a
laugh so you just have a CDN and you
like adding the modsecurity rule set
huzzah you're good or you can get an
application that blocks all the things
and then you're like but no one hangs
out with me why why and and like just
from a couple years back there's a white
paper that was released on this and it
said every aspect of managing laughs is
an ongoing process this is the
antithesis of set and forget it
technology there's a real point of this
research to maximize value from your
wife you need to go in with everyone's
eyes open to the effect required to get
you effort required to get and keep the
wife running productive liam is you like
falling asleep for that you're like what
is this like and it's like that's just
completely crazy like we cannot do that
you know that's
good so we have to change and security
has to add value so okay how do we
actually do that let's stop with all
like the bad problems and let's actually
offer some solution two ways we need to
add value to the devs need add value to
the operations and we need hope you like
someone in the organization actually
cares about it okay here's tip 1
automate security tooling to run it run
and testing so we're talking about
gauntlet earlier so you can start with
one test for cross-site scripting on
just a few pages of your app the
gauntlet tool will help you do that and
help you automate that and let's see so
just a quick thing about ghalin it's MIT
license comes with pre scanned steps
that hook into your security testing
tools it doesn't do any installation of
tools it's not like a package manager or
anything like that but it wants to be
part of the continuous integration and
continuous delivery pipeline and it's a
good citizen of standard air standard
out it's built on top of cucumber so it
kind of works like this you put your
code in right and like different
security tools that you've rigged in
will attack it and if it comes out the
other end then it works then it passes
the test gauntlet is pretty simple it
works with just plain text files there
are attack files in it when you say run
galit it just looks at its directory and
all the sub directories and tries to
find anything that's called attack and
runs that what does an attack file look
like so let's read through this real
quick this is a this is not the best
example I think who have a cross-site
scripting one in a second but this is a
in map example which is not as relevant
application side but the feature is like
in map attacks for example com given we
have in map installed at that that that
that kind of data point would I launch
it in map attack with this command and
then the output should contain port 80 s
open and then it should contain that
port 25 is not open the given runs if
you're familiar with cucumbers like the
given runs then the wind then and then
the next time on the next scenario it
kind of runs clean so each one functions
independently of each other so here's a
cross-site scripting example look for
cross-site scripting using Arachne
against a URL you feed
the URL again so if you're on a Jenkins
box or wherever where you stand up your
app and you do your integration testing
you could just plug whatever that is
there and then run Arachne and then this
is that like knowledge inside of the
security person's head that's like you
know we've built up over over years
that's maybe like inside of a bash
script or just you know they have it in
some sort of attacks that they they
normally run but now it's outs in a way
that anybody new organization developers
operations security can pick this up and
you don't I really have to know what
this means like you just know like it's
going to attack the attack my stuff and
it's going to look for cross-site
scripting and everything else in the
document sort of confirms like what it's
actually going to do and then this is
the expected output the nice thing about
it is like as Arachne changes and gets
updated any of your codes not changing
its able to like do some some extra
testing of your of your of your
application even like this stuff you
wouldn't expect for it to find you can
just sort of write that affirmation of
like I don't want cross-site scripting
ever to be available on this part of my
app yeah so there is a there's a hole
right up and a slide deck with labs it's
like a two-and-a-half-hour thing we did
it south by southwest and if you got the
slides from the beginning or at the end
you can grab it but we walked through
like how to do how do you cross site
scripting sequel injection how did you
like regex matching with your output how
to like if you maybe want to set it up
with the inside of your build system you
want to like set up environment
variables so gala knows how to work with
all that stuff anyways I didn't want to
like take up the whole time the workshop
going through all the gauntlet switches
and knobs there but if you want to grab
this like that's a really helpful
resource this gauntlet demo is what's
actually used in those those labs so if
you go to that on github under the
gauntlet project gauntlet demo and has
all the labs broken up step by step and
then if you're if you're really
interested in getting started with it we
have a book that's like not super well
fleshed out yet but I'm actually adding
in all those labs from those all the
labs from from South by Southwest stuff
and putting it into the book
and if you email book at gauntlet org
I'll get you a copy and put on the
review the review team so you can take a
look at it as riding in all those labs
if you just want to run through that all
right all right so you can the other
thing that's pretty cool about gauntlet
is it's really good about working inside
of a continuous integration system so if
you look at the gauntlet demo project
you'll notice that there's like a Travis
badge on there and we already already
already sitting in a CI system inside of
itself and so all the labs that we run
inside of the this the that previous
deck that I showed they're all already
integrated integrated test see I tested
and run through here all right let's see
okay and then here's another talk I did
with Gareth and as we also put together
a repo all right I guess a github
organization is secure pipeline project
we have examples using gauntlet using
Jenkins using Travis using Python app
using a ruby on rails app you can check
it out and there's a lot of different
ways you can hook all sorts of security
testing in your build pipeline all right
add application security telemetry to
devs and operations you can do simple
things like convert your app security
logs into metrics in this like that the
dev and operations use so take your log
stash stuff and turn them into stats the
metrics you can do run time correlation
between the biz operations development
and security stuff like sequel injection
attempts and HTTP 500 it's like I want
to know I want to learn off where those
things are happening or are we seeing a
login spike and transaction decrease a
lot of the stuff is like our our company
is actually working on a lot of this but
you can get a pretty good way with like
going log stash and stats d okay another
thing that I think is pretty cool that
the people are turning onto getting them
giving this hooked into their their CI
or in their config management stuff is
get hugs from the auditors and add
hardening an audit using config
management I think it's really useful to
know like DevOps isn't antithetical to
see I or two to audit and compliance
it's just they don't know like they
haven't seen systems built like that but
if you're like oh we're we're testing
our hardening artist
every time we run config management you
know that I think that's pretty helpful
there is a there's a project I think
it's leaked down on the bottom here but
you can run chef in audit mode just to
assert that you are actually hardened to
the right standards there's companies
are doing some of this already like
threat stack which is OS and config
management all right so you know we just
need to reverse the trend we need to add
value to ops we need to add value to dev
I think we walk through that the summary
but we'll go through all more time just
to make sure we felt like we covered it
all software development has been a
constant experiment in how we know
anything we abdicated hour runtime
responsibility and our development
responsibility through incoherent
philosophical approaches and fostering
organizational silos but DevOps is here
security can actually be a part of it it
can actually be the next step in it and
ops found a way to add value security
needs to find a way to to follow that
same path and there's three ways we can
add value a development and deploy in a
run time and I think through some of the
different approaches that we talked
about I think that's pretty helpful so
