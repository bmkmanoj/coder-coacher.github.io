myself for this specific session on the
Honda track that's the benefit of being
the track host they'll need to consult
anyone else and I've been working with
lean and agile for the last ten years in
possibly every thinkable context
everything will roll product owner
mentor scrum master developer whatever
you want to call it in everything from
small startup with five people just want
some process to get their product to
market to big corporate organizations
with a thousand people where you want to
try to change what how they work and how
they deliver value and arguably what you
can do in a couple of days for the small
startup might take days years months for
the for the large organizations I've
worked for try Fork I've worked for a
company called Kona a digital agency and
right now I am independent while I
worked at try four go had a chance to
ride a couple of mini books priming
camping and real-life scrum they're both
available for free download at heading 4
q should you be interested when I
started leave things back in 2006 it was
all about scrum so basically you just
had to be scrum master product owner
certified scrum petitioner and you off
to go and I just remember that in my
case this proof that I've been able to
sit in a room for two times two days and
spend roughly half a day filling out a
form on the Internet
so when people use these things labels
on their LinkedIn profiles it's your
ability to actually take it out and use
it in practice and create some results
that matters it's pretty easy to sit in
a room for for two days I know there's a
chest now but 99% passes so I'll give
you that's not a good indicator either
okay good being a bit nerdy about agile
and lean of course the team's an
organization of work we have big visual
BOTS try to coordinate stuff in there
with the least amount of effort
necessary again being a bit more nerdy
of of course I have my own personable
port where makes sure that I'm not
overloading myself with more stuff than
proving to be able to finish and being
really nerdy about this I thought it
would be a great idea to take these
principles back home and to make sure
that my better half at home does not
overload me with more work than I've
been proven to be able to finish and
that's a brilliant idea for you guys out
there just to question recognize ok so
which idea do you want to remove from
this bucket to be able to place your new
great idea in there fantastic
conversation during the weekend good in
terms of the context for this talk
though arguably heavily inspired by Jeff
patents work I'm not going to deliver a
description of story mapping as he
perceived it so this is my own version
this is how I've been working with it
doing last six years and what I found to
work and arguably all the people have
found other stuff to work this is my
version just roughly and the agenda a
bit about creating high quality waste
overview about what store mapping is but
just in short about getting started on
the right foot
and then we'll diving Susie actual
details of it I should notify you that
you are guinea pigs so once and why you
get to do a presentation for the first
time and this is one of those times so
if you have any feedback in terms of how
it could be structured better key points
things that you were missing then I'll
just use the go-to up and until me I'll
be happy to adjust it for the upcoming
versions of it
just a quick rating put your hands up if
you consider yourself a novice this is
the first time you've ever heard of
start mapping quite a lot of you I can
pretty much convince you anything and
informed read a blog conference
presentations put your hand up yeah
practicing you've tried it a few times
okay
quite a few master you may even have
facilitated a couple of times down to a
couple of hands now you should actually
be teaching or presenting right now that
would have been easy could've just
switched okay just so you don't start by
getting it all wrong the concept of this
talk is trying to bring a new product to
market trying to do a new project
or you're working on products or
projects that are under gun there are
undergoing heavy development so we're
not talking about support and
maintenance things yeah it probably it
might make sense I haven't tried it but
just to get up from the right foot first
I'd like to talk a bit about what's
often done wrong at least in my
perception when we're doing agile so
often when I visit organizations we have
teams that have turned into what I call
story point machines so this is when
people are starting to pay much more
attention in terms of how much is coming
out in terms of what is the axial effect
why are we doing this so everybody is
running around my team is so stable we
can do this many story points we have a
predictability that's within plus minus
20 percent over two three months arisin
or whatever and nobody cares about
what's coming out of that machine and I
want to change that because this is not
why we're here
we're not here to produce stuff we're
here to produce effects and this is also
where things that star mapping is a
great tool - so these get started on
going down the right track any of you
have experience with these long
fragmented lists of great ideas this is
what backlogs in real organizations
often turn into everybody in the
organization have tons as ideas and
since somebody told us that we have to
contain have backlogs to contain them
they're just all thrown in there and
then you've tried to find out what what
is the most important one you put it on
the top and sometimes it makes sense and
a lot of times it doesn't
it's just features it's just stuff in
there and then this great agile coach
came along and he told you all you have
to do is just apply a score so rate your
things in terms of business value on a
score from 1 to 5 and assign and if for
estimate and out of this excel sheet
comes approach pro ties list that you
can work from great idea and my god
agile coaching stuff becomes an easy
task to do right this is actually what I
used to do ten years ago so I'm partly
to blame for for this mindset I didn't
know any better at that time so you
excused and then there's a thought that
if we just do enough iterations
by magic we were arrived at the right
place we do not even have to know where
we're going because just iterating
inspecting adapting we'll find something
that makes sense
that's simply not true sorry you can
iterate as much as one if it's without a
direction it's not guaranteed to get you
anywhere good have you ever tried
looking back six months from you for a
brilliant product or your project and
just thought about what have we really
achieved in these six month and if your
only answer is we've developed all these
features then probably needs to go a
step back and think about what did we
actually achieve why did we implement
all these features back from the talk
from Gabrielle and her team we've done
all this we've celebrated that we fixed
these one hundred and ninety six bucks
and we implemented these twenty-seven
new features but what did we achieve by
doing this agile without direction
it's just iterating yourself to death we
can celebrate doing that by all means
it's great to finish a lot of stuff
right we can move posters son of all and
it's a good feeling moving something to
done let's not say it's not but it's not
gonna get us necessarily gonna get us
anywhere in terms of our business so
really we are back to a good old fence
on sue Tex a cloud strategy is just to
notice before defeat and don't get me
wrong
backlogs are great they're just not
great for strategy and high level
planning they're good for daily
groomings they're good for keeping in
check what we're working on making sure
that we are actually not trying to groom
or place in detail a hundred user
stories at the same time but therefore
the daily coordination stuff they're not
good for planning they're not good for
strategy they're not good for talking
about where we want to go as a business
and why we're even building this product
in the first place so if you say one
thing away from today I hope it's this
protestation it's not about what you can
do to fulfill a business need it's about
what you should do to create a desired
effect
there's a big difference between those
two so back in 2008 I was struggling
I've had quite a lot of success building
agile teams quite a lot of success
making sure that we could have a
self-organizing team product owner scrum
masters put in place even some
first-hand knowledge but Kanban again
the production machine was starting to
work but I couldn't really get the grasp
of how to return this into something
that's overall giving us a desired
effect we want as a business we can get
a lot of stuff out there but often it's
without an overall direction we're not
able to mention where we're going we're
not I mean nobody can really tell us if
we're a success or not and from an agile
perspective that's a problem because
that's really the only thing you're
trying to do all the rest of just means
to an end
so I read Jeff Patton's block and I
thought this is great this provides a
nice framework for talking about what
real users want and taking outside in
perspective an agile development instead
of just talking about this project list
of features and then it has a nice title
as well it's called the new backlog as a
map that sounds nice sounds refreshing
and I've had some chance to try it out
back in 2008 and actually worked really
really well and before we dive into the
details I just like to give you guys a
quick overview in terms of what story
mapping is just in short so basically
what we do is that we find a vision why
are we here what are we trying to build
you can use any format you like I prefer
this one where you write in this
structure but basically it doesn't
matter find out where we want to go for
this specific project the example is is
a telecom company they found out that a
lot of people are running around with
business Mobile's paid by the company
but they run out of data around the
vacation and they want to chop up dates
with their own personal credit card and
it turns out to be an incredible
complicated process because you have to
you have to engage with internal IT it's
really hot just to get the permission to
have an extra gigabyte of data around
you're on your vacation they want to
explore that opportunity see if they can
sell more data by by doing this what you
do is then you identify your backbone so
you're back backbone is simply
but just touchpoints the themes that
your customers or users go through from
engaging with the product for the first
time and until they use they are at the
their life cycle and once you've mapped
your overall themes your overall story
back down you find out who are we going
to support in here what are our main
targets who are interfacing with what
what is our most important set of user
set we want to prioritize when building
this product and when we're done with
that we've walked these people through
our themes and we talked about what do
you do in this what are you getting out
of this what are you from a user
perspective actually going to get out of
using this product and that turns into a
lot of stuff a lot of business needs
that we can choose to fulfill that we
can choose to spend time and energy
working on or we can choose not to and
probably not all of them are equally
good and that's why we start to
prioritize and this is a physical
exercise going on on a real whiteboard
where we start to move things up and
down and for now we're just trying to
find out what is the most important
thing to deliver and then once we start
to find out what the most important
stuff to deliver is it seems that a sort
of a goal is starting to form and this
is an iterative process as we find out
what the most important things are for
inducers then we get more information
simply step reaching a goal and when
once we establish a go we find out we
might need more and while other things
have become less relevant this is just
to kick off the discussion about where I
was trying to go but at the end we
should end up with the strategy stating
the most important thing right now is to
deliver on these business needs we're
deferring the solution to these business
needs but once you fulfill these
business need from an end-user point and
we're gonna measure our success in this
way how will we actually measure our
success and I'll go into the details in
a minute about this but it was just to
give you a framework for understanding
the rest of the talk sometimes it's
difficult if you start just by the
individual steps and you don't really
know where this is going for 30 minutes
and so all wraps up in the end and at
the end we have what we in started
mapping gems call a walking skeleton so
many people relate to the Minimum Viable
Product
minimum or was it we used in the last
talk meaning lovable product it's also
same I've come across lately there are
in terms of story mapping some important
aspect in terms of getting started on
the right foot when you're doing this
exercise you need to include the right
people I don't know who the right people
are going to be in your specific
situation but make sure that you have
the different stakeholders there because
people are going to come from this to
this from different perspectives and for
example people that have been sitting in
support listening to real users
complaining about the existing services
can be a great source of inspiration
when you're trying to plan something new
end user south course also important but
maybe it's even a very good idea to
include your CEO if he's going to
overrule your decisions anyway if he's
not present so make sure that you find
out that in your villain you're giving
contact who are your key stakeholders
who can provide the most valuable
information in terms of laying out the
strategy for what you're going to build
next it will differ a lot from
production product research it's not bad
sorry to say so many people now IV we're
starting with that young this agile
stuff we're just building something
we're testing it on real users and
they're going to put the thumbs up and
down and that is going to decide how we
go further research is not bad it's just
a matter the amount of research that
should be fitted to the domain we're
trying to but understanding the
organization understanding use of
segments doing some magazine analysis
trying to map up your customer journey
that's a good thing because it makes you
understand what you're trying to engage
with and it makes you possible for you
to define a better strategy going
forward that doesn't mean we should dive
into the individual details at that
point and trying to define what a
specific feature or what specific
solution should we build to fulfill this
business need it's not at that level
but overall investing a week two weeks
three weeks trying to lay out the
strategy for the things you're going to
put potentially millions of Cronos into
over the next half a year or a year
that's a good thing and before you go
into a session where you're inviting a
lot of people that are going to spend
your time in this session
right down just on index cards the
already known business needs you haven't
decided whether you're going to execute
these anyway so it's just a title for
now but it's just a source of
inspiration and if you already know that
you're going to prod Sassy's anyway or
if you're going to work or potentially
prioritize them anyway then just put
them down on index card before the
session because then you don't have to
spend eight people's time writing things
down on an index card so it's just to
get started on the right foot good so
let's talk about what story mapping
really is what once we get down to the
details how many people in here have a
written vision for the product or
project you're working right now that
potentially everybody engaging in this
being part of this can explain in twenty
seconds in the elevator about a tenth
maybe it's because the rest of you are
not working in the product or project
space so you're your excuse but it also
could be the fact that often people
simply do not realize where they're
going again it's a bunch of features
it's a list and those lists can very
very turn into occupying all the mental
space you have and all the capacity so
all you're focusing on is to get again
these fragmented lists of ideas so
visions are important this is telling
you overall where do we want to go again
I like this format there's lots of other
formats out there you can use vision can
Mensa's those lean canvas roman
Pickler's got one as well but try to
find a form that accurately frames where
are you and where you're going to go and
why are you doing this in the first
place if there's already compared out
there is launch something that you're
never going to compete with why are you
why do you think you can provide a
better service oh it's because I'm
already the owner of this giant silicon
company so we don't you need to be the
best because we can just push this on to
customers anyway that's fine that's just
what's been going to make your product
the main differentiator
so reasons can be many but just make
sure that there's an excellent argument
for starting this in the first place and
then my personal opinion is that
customer journeys Rock in terms of
understanding where you're going this is
not a session on customer journeys so
I'm not going to dive into it easy
but basically a customer journey mapping
session forces you to do an outside-in
prospective on your situation how our
users interfacing with what you're
trying to build what are the main themes
they're going through what are the main
touch points they're touching your
product this is going to tell us a lot
about where do we want to put our energy
other touch points right there that
we're not even focusing on right now
touch points where people are just left
to themselves could be could be we're
supporting all of them but we're only
supporting them in a mediocre way this
is going to be a very valuable once we
trust when once we want to start to try
to prioritize anything because again if
which is prioritizing from a
1-dimensional list it's a very very hard
thing to have a discussion about so what
we do when we star in map is that we do
this upfront research again it's not non
agile to do some research it's just that
we don't want this to turn into a
three-months analysis session for
spending a week or two it's fine and
from this we can start to evaluate what
are we actually working with you what
are the main themes that users are going
through and basically it's just putting
them up on a wall or a whiteboard or
whatever and it doesn't even have to be
accurate because we can change them
during a session it's just a post-it or
some whiteboard marker ink up there so
if you find out on while we're doing
this session that we want to describe
something in different way we can just
change it but we can start to have a
conversation about what we're trying to
support and this is going to tell us
something about where we're putting our
energy and this is the key in terms of
also just alignment in an organizational
perspective so if you're bringing
multiple stakeholders in there chances
are they're not going to agree and the
goal is not necessarily to get everybody
to agree but we want an alignment to
occur early on so that we're not going
to have a constant fight in terms of
direction going weeks and month into the
project because again I'm sure you've
all discovered that changing direction
like big direction every two weeks is
not going to get you into a good space
so it's it's about alignment it's about
focusing on where do we want to put our
energy another example so we can easily
tell from just
this picture right now we've prioritized
what's up here for a minimal Viable
Product walking skeleton where ever want
to call it and immediacy that we're
leaving some touch points untouched
could be that we're very brave in this
situation that we're going to launch a
product without being able to build our
customers that's our decision we want to
get to market quickly we want to get
some feedback early so we've all agreed
that billing is actually not a priority
for the first vision I've had several
customers using that strategy it's fine
if you can get something out if you know
if you're billing on a monthly cycle and
you're giving away the first month for
free anyway then you can defer that
month because you can still go on board
your customers you still get the
feedback before you implement the
functionality to actually build them
that's fine and this is just telling us
what what decisions have we made so it's
not the point that we're going to follow
this as a strict plan and implement all
this stuff and no in this order but it's
about having a conversation about where
do we want to put our energy where do we
think we're going to achieve the biggest
benefit and business effect so once
you've decided on your touch points how
you're going to map then you need to
focus on who are you going to do this
for and it's quite crucial I had I've
had previously the chance to work with
organizations where a stakeholder
analysis included the word can who can
possibly be affected it's like saying we
want everybody to have an opinion about
what we're going to build and imagine
your life as a product owner if you have
to include every single person's opinion
going forward that's necessarily a good
strategy so you really have to focus
because if you're going to interface
with 25 different user segments every
time you do a release and try to get
feedback based on that you're going to
spend all your time trying to get
feedback and you probably have no child
left actually using that feedback for
anything relevant so prioritization once
we talk about user groups user needs
that's the key thing and you should not
try to please everybody it's fine that
by focusing on your main
you segments of Saget groups did you're
going to please somebody else but be
very very clear in your strategy who are
our most valuable assets here who are we
going to get the biggest benefit out of
policing in the first place because you
cannot please and you everybody and
trying to do so will probably just make
sure that you're not pleasing anybody at
all
great so once we're at that point we're
going to start to just throw the cards
that we've written down beforehand on
the wall and the basic rule is just
that's usually what I do just put them
in a pile or just print them out over a
table and just ask anyone to just grab
any card and put it in the touch point
but you think it makes sense just a
totally messy exercise where we're just
trying to get things up there and things
are moved around and people are arguing
whether it should be in that point a
touch point or not we're just trying to
have a conversation about it and trying
to get things up there and then the
crucial point is that we start to walk
the map as it's called so this is where
we are starting to sell real stories
about real users what are we actually
going to do in each touch point for
these guys how are we going to fulfill
your business needs by doing this
specific what user need are we going to
work on here and this is where we're
telling our stories from an outside-in
perspective walking each user segment
through our map talking about how are
you going to benefit from what in what
touch point this is a great exercise and
this is where you will find out how much
people really disagree about something
we're not even starting the protestation
yet we're just talking about users and
how we can generate some effect that's
going to benefit them and us in the long
run and we do it one target group at the
time and this is a guy called Henrik and
he's really engaged he's the former user
experience designer and now he's turning
to more of a business development role
and at this point this is right before
he gets really disappointed because at
this point he's really engaged and he's
talking about how he's going to please
least use this all the way through and
how this is going to be a great thing
and so Michael who's sitting right here
is going to tell him in about two
minutes that he thinks he's got it all
wrong
but this is great because this is
creating early alignment because we're
talking about real users engaging men
and we're talking about it from a user
perspective if we're not talking about
how we're going to implement this
specific business need yet that's the
important thing it's all this agile
stuff gets so easy if you just have to
come the comfort to defer solutions to
specific problems we have great user
experience designers we have great
technical teams we have great graphical
designers that can find perfectly
accurate solutions to business problems
you don't need to worry about all that
stuff up front all you need to do is
focus on where do we want to put our
energy to create the largest business
effect how you're going to implement
that you can defer that solutions later
and of course if you're working in a
waterfall environment you can use
exactly the same strategy just instead
of tying then starting to try to build
something you'll just write it all down
in the last requirement spec afterwards
same thing works you'll still get the
chance to focus on the essentials and
you'll still get the chance to talk
about what really matters you just do a
very boring crutch process afterwards
and it's essential to keep this talk
about an inducer perspective and it's
really hard in reality because really
quickly we're diving down into features
really quickly I was starting to talk
about specific solutions to stuff and
constantly when I'm facilitating these
sessions I have to ask people to take a
step back and say it's good and fine
we're going to have that discussion at
some point in time but this is not the
time because we're not even aligned on
the high level yet we've not even
decided what overall business needs we
want to focus on and right now you're
jumping into the solution mode we can do
that later we'll have plenty of time for
that and no doubt we have to turn this
into working functionality at some point
if we have to have the chance to
generate some business outcome but we
don't need to do that in right now and
then the whole process ation exercise
starts and at some point we start to
draw some lines across this whiteboard a
wall or whatever and whatever goes above
that line is included in the very first
version and whatever is below that line
is not and we can draw several
lines here if we want to do release
planning one and a half years from now
probably not the most beneficial way to
use your time but you're free to do that
but anyway the really good discussion
about how little do we actually have to
build to get the next release to market
that's an important discussion because
whenever you take something from here
and put it up here you're going to
invest more time more budget and you're
gonna add more complexity and that's the
kind of discussion you want to have and
that's especially relevant if you're a
small start-up like these guys and this
is a girl called Kim Yuna they're
building what they called Spotify for
students so that you have access to your
books and material through a
subscription fee instead of actually
buying the books that's the product
they're trying to build and originally
she's thought that for the first version
she wanted everything like any startup
owner would think right and she could
just see very clearly that for each
ticket she would take from this line and
put it above the other she would be
adding complexity she would be adding
budget she would need to get more
funding and that's a very great exercise
and if that's a very good conversation
to have and it really really really
reveals how easy it is to stop to just
build more innovation into a product
that is truly necessary and again
keeping is it physical is absolutely
crucial at some point we have to start
doing the hot stuff so until now it's
easy yes we had some alignment problems
yes people didn't agree yes the CEO
decided to make a decision that
everybody disagreed with but he was the
CEO so he was entitled to do that but at
some point we have to start discussing
release goals and actual KPIs
so that is what we discussed in Gabby's
session on the Mobius loop what business
effect are we trying to achieve here and
that's not easy and people argue that
multiple factors will influence the KPIs
we're trying to measure but it's much
more dangerous to ignore this and just
continue in some given direction then
this we actually tried to do this and
get it wrong so try to get it as close
as you possibly can
and yes you're not going to be the only
thing in the entire world is going to
affect the success of your product yes
you're going to have marketing campaigns
there's also going to generate some
activity on your side yes
maybe you should include them maybe you
shouldn't depends on your context but
you need to have this discussion and you
need to put it down I love this quote
from Dan Radison the principles of
product development flow basically just
States one of the most dangerous of all
bad size problems the tendency to pack
more innovation into a single project
then it's truly necessary remember that
that's what we're all doing and we're
doing it all the time
because we're so afraid that we're not
going to get a second chance to process
anything but what is the real risk here
it's probably not the chances we're not
going to be asked again but if we're
looking at Amazon when they're doing
that dates in mind it turns out that 60
to 90 percent of what they're putting
out there is removed again because it
does not optimize the metric they
thought it would and arguably yes Amazon
is experimenting more than the average
company but arguably they're not the
least mature in terms of establishing
those experiments there actually are
quite mature agile organizations and if
they get 60 to 90 percent wrong I'm
assuming that the rest of metals are not
doing a whole lot better and I can't
remember the exact figures but it's
something like 80% of all cost in IT
it's maintaining features after they're
deployed it's not actually building them
so again what risk are we trying to
address it's not a budget it's not only
a budget time and scope risk it's also a
business effect risk and we tend to
ignore that so when you're doing this
when you're starting to move too much
above that very visible physical line on
your board just remember that if you're
adding 50 percent in scope you're adding
complexity by at least 50%
I'm guessing these are very pessimistic
numbers actually at least 50% effort at
least 50% budget and at least 50% time
and often the only reason why you're
doing this is your culture and your
budgeting cycles and they move might be
valid excuses because you're not gonna
be asked in another year again so you
really only get this one chance but
think hard about how you can change that
mindset because you're really optimizing
for addressing the wrong risk so these
are difficult but important questions to
ask yourself do we truly need to deliver
all that to reach the release goal we've
set up could we afford to defer
something like billing to the next cycle
because really we do not need it yet do
we really need to be able to mine all
the dates at this point or can we defer
that decision so later what are the core
release goals we're trying to deliver on
and even harder but even more important
how we're going to measure whether we're
a success or not and it's going to take
time and effort and that's what's
typically disregarded numbers they don't
just come out of anything they come out
of putting real effort into finding out
where is our baseline right now how
we're going to measure if we're
improving or not how we're going to
follow up on that data and actually make
real decisions paid on based on that
decision so ask yourself what will we do
if numbers do not match because when
you're sitting in these situations I'll
guarantee you that you're all going to
think you are we going to do better than
that we're gonna beat those numbers it's
going to be great and then it turns out
that you really not remember releasing a
feature once where we had set up a
number that it should increase
engagement by at least 10% and we wanted
to see at least 2,000 clicks on that
feature every day for these 5,000 users
and at the end of the first week we had
20 clicks people had celebrated that we
launched this feature but the
celebration in terms of the business
effect achieved was let's just say
mediocre our weaves but what are we
going to do in that situation I was just
gonna ignore it because at least metrics
are just they just nice if they show the
right thing right and when they it turns
out that metrics are wrong then would
rather ignore them but if you're not
gonna make any decisions based on this
anyway
change your attitude then you can forget
about measuring anything and I'm sorry I
know that there's a lot of agile coaches
out there telling you all you need to do
is just measure the smile on your
customers face that sounds great doesn't
it just put out the ruler and you can
measure the amount of success I'd like
us to set the bar a bit lower so a bit
higher so if we're consultants yeah that
came out really wrong right they
shouldn't be happy they should just pay
the bills that could be a way of setting
the bar lower I'd actually like us to
talk about how can we generate
successful customers and that's a
difference because don't get me wrong
it's not that easy to please customers
but it's not that hard either you can
actually come out as a consultant
company delivering some crap piece of
software that works exactly like the
customers want and they'll be happy and
they'll give you a ten out of ten on
every single score you can throw at them
but that doesn't mean that they're
successful and I'd like us to set the
bar higher and say we're not just
talking about making you guys happy I'm
not just talking about your willingness
to spend more money in the short term
we're talking about making you
successful or not enough so that as a
consulting company we can engage with
you on the long term as well and that is
a different difference so basically feel
free to be as creative as you want but
keep it visual so however you want to
approach this I would really really
recommend that you do not throw this
into an electronic tool because having
the physical exercise of moving taking a
ticket and moving it with your hands on
top of some line acknowledging that this
is going to increase the budget time
scope whatever that's a very good
exercise and it's a lot easier to have
conversation about a physical thing on
the board then there's an electronic
tool and you can really get away with
very very simple tools so in this
particular session all we had was just a
wall and a number of post-its we didn't
have any tape and just by having some
different colored post-its you can
create a starting map looking like this
so instead of drawing a line we just use
the pink post-it
folded that folded them and that is now
our line so if you're on top of this
pink line here you're within the first
version you can use a door if that's the
only free space you've got these Pacific
guys are you think as you can see the
lean canvas approach to defining the
vision also a great way of communicating
where you want to go in general glass
walls are really great because typically
at least you can race whatever you
choose to ride on those glass walls even
a dinner table can do so can really be
very low-tech one thing to remember it's
just the direction with the knowledge
you've got right now it's just that
direction at least if you're working in
agile context if you're working into
more traditional context it's the plan
you're going to follow no matter the
input you get from there on onwards my
rule of thumb is that if you find
yourself in a domain where you know a
lot about your customers maybe you've
even built a product like this before
maybe you're just extending an existing
solutions then even in that situation
you're only going to get at 80% right in
terms of the best things to focus on and
things will change once you're once you
start going if you choose to dive a
little deeper and actually that
sometimes a good idea also in terms of
communication because just showing that
you're heading in a specific direction
even though you're changing that
underway will sometimes common
organization down CEOs stakeholders
people with budgets planning they will
just be comp Matt down by the fact that
there's a roadmap whether you choose to
follow it or not whether it changes
after first I'd leave long as long as
you've got good reasons to do those
changes they're fine with that but it'll
just calm them down stop screaming for
water for plants and going one and a
half years into the future just by
showing that there's actually a roadmap
laid out in terms of how you want to
approach this so 80% for the things that
you're going to do at the very very
first things 50% for what you're
planning in released to and of course if
you use some continuous deployment
there's nothing keeping you from that
will
these one at the time so it's more
communication aspect than there's a
release planning aspect and once you get
beyond the first two concepts they're
the first to release goals then you're
probably down to 30% of this ever
becoming something that you're going to
prioritize and put energy and effort
into because you're going to learn so
much from these firsts from the feedback
from the first two here that whatever
you thought was the most important thing
it's almost kind of I guarantee not
going to be once you're three four
months into the future and again keep it
physical a really important aspect and
update it so what I typically do is that
when we start the first session we're
all ready they're going to book the
following sessions and whether it's
something they do once a month or
something you do once every three months
that's totally up to you do usually my
experience is that doing it more than
once a month it just doesn't work it's
high-level planning it's not trying to
plan the details of what you're going to
try to do in the next sprint on the next
iteration its high-level planning so
doing it more than once a month
typically just doesn't work people just
show up and not enough have changed and
you just feel like you're wasting your
time doing it more than three months
apart it also starts to Jenny haven't
had the effect that too much have
happened so you're not simply you're not
feeling that this live ongoing thing if
you're doing once in every half a year
the feedback loop is simply too slow
sews my experience is that having a
story mapping session where you plan we
do the high level planning somewhere
between one and three months apart that
typically works very well and I'll have
to acknowledge that sometimes it's not
so important that you use the exact
structure I've showed you right here
it's really about getting it onto a wall
and having a two dimensional thing to
work at so I remember and that's
probably that's probably more than six
years back probably seven where we had a
product that was split into two software
teams working on very different kinds of
software a hardware team and a sales
team and you could argue that's not
across from team and all that stuff but
that was a situation
we found herself in but we use this to
be used the story map kind of structure
to just divide into those four aspects
of what we were trying to deliver and
just mapping that onto a board and
having the two-dimensional thoughts of
where gun made it a lot easier to align
these four teams against each other it
was not story mapping in the sense that
I've presented to you right now but just
getting it on a wall and not keeping us
a one-dimensional list will often often
help just by itself so at least to me
and tell me I'm wrong if you feel so but
to me story mapping has for the last
five six years provided a way to focus
on the essentials and that's by far the
most important thing really story
mapping is essentially just a way of
capturing the conversations you've had
about your users about your product
about what you're trying to do and it's
about aligning stakeholders so typically
you can just get your you're already ten
steps ahead if you leave that room and
people disagreed and they might still
disagree but at least now they're
aligned and they're agree on that this
is what we've tried this is what we
decided to focus on and you'll just get
rid of all the noise and all the
political discussions and all the stuff
that was just I was not included and and
you can go forward from then deliver on
what you thought would you hypothesis in
terms of what we're going to generate
business value might turn out that you
were wrong and you can do another role
if it turns out that you should go in a
different direction how many of you can
answer the simple questions what are you
building for whom and why come on must
be more okay that seems like two-thirds
of you that's a good thing that's not a
given in all organizations sadly I've
been in a lot of organizations where the
first thing I asked was this simple
question and people like I'm building a
feature yes
we're building it for I don't know but I
was told to build it okay why are you
building it what is going to do I'm
guessing that people have some use for
it what
and that is the situation especially in
large organization you have hundreds of
people sitting there developing software
to use as they've ever ever never met if
not seen them use a software a single
time I remember back many years ago
where we were building a system and we
simply couldn't find out why people
thought this was not an intuitive user
interface until we found out that all
the users like the super users we were
working closely with they had 23 inch
screens but all the others in the
company they had 19 inch screens and yes
how Q ibly that was not a very intuitive
user interface once you got to see how
it worked in a 19 inch screen but that
was not the kind of knowledge we had at
that point I remember another case where
we couldn't find out why people got
confused when handling a lot of cases
and to us a lot of kid cases had been
handle at the same time was between 3 &amp;amp;
7 and then when we got out to the real
users we found out that they were
sitting with something like 25 or 50 and
our user interface was in no way
designed to support that kind of
structure
so again just getting it out into real
users and having that those close
conversations would get you a long way
okay so some basic takeaways and I'm not
going to go through and read all those
but hopefully that was some of the
things you got out of this this session
it's more so that when you get the
slides you can just browse directly to
that slide if you just want to have the
capture and then we have some some time
for for questions before we get that far
I'd like to brag a lot and the reason
why I would like to do that is that on
the 15th of October then I'm leaving for
a six and a half months trip around the
world with my family so have a nice
winter everybody and at the end here
I've got some some contact information
as well so you'll get that through the
slides and that will sit in terms of the
presentation and since I am the trek
host and I just need to find out the
questions you've asked in on the trek
host pace myself
let's see if they did yeah
okay so I'll pick the question that is
easiest to answer for me okay
so one good question actually should the
story map be visual that's accessible in
between sessions so definitely so if
you've got the chance to just put this
on the wall where the people working
with the product is just keep it on the
wall and keep it in the team room it's a
great way to have the continuous
discussion keep your vision highlighted
at all times and that you continue
talking about what you're trying to do
for real uses in real life not all
people are in that space and what
happens at hatred I have to admit is
that they end up in a backlog so
basically what you do is that you take
what you've prioritized for the first
release you discuss what is the most key
thing to deliver right now on in terms
of technical risk business risk what
you're trying to do and then you start
implementing for that and then once
you've changed direction a bit you might
update your story map or you might not
but then one or three months later you
do a second role and that turns into
another set of prize backlog items so
that is what typically happens in real
life I've worked with companies that
stuck to the story map as a backlog as
well
that worked kind of okay but they had to
make some trade-offs in terms of pride
cessation it's not as clear when you're
using stock so you have to put numbers
on the individual tickets because it's
like a slice and you cannot see which is
the highest if you do it all the way
through so it's a trade-off but I would
say 85% at a time it ends up in a
traditional back.look anyway and I'm
fine with that it's for high-level
planning is for laying out your strategy
so making sure that you focus on the
right kpi's
ok so now 1 how much do you prepare
before the storymap workshop and that
differs a lot I have a mindset of
maximum 4 weeks of work so if you cannot
bats it into a four to four weeks
maximum then go back and rethink whether
you could do something in a more
effective way whether you really need to
engage with 15 different users and
interview them all or well you could get
80% of the information by just talking
to five of them or seven of them so
working at digital agency as I did with
Kona that's a really hot job because you
the room is like filled with people
where all they want to do sometimes is
just do a lot of research so trying to
get them into the mindset of doing just
enough to get that and trying to start
to validate some of your hypothesis and
assumption and the fact that it's
actually a hypothesis and an assumption
and it's not just going to turn into
real business value just because you you
thought you're a great user experience
designer that's a hard thing to to do so
there is no answer and some of that but
I would say between one and four weeks
and I'd like to keep it shorter rather
than longer okay another question reads
all touch points and that's actually a
very good question because if you look
at how users interface with a company as
a whole then there will be lots and lots
and lots of touch points if you look
across the entire user journey so
building a product what you often end up
doing is saying okay we're going to
focus on this part of the customer
journey and we're going to elaborate on
the touch points that that's within this
specific segment because that is where
our product has market value that is
where we're going to achieve some
business
benefit so you do not necessarily have
to cover the entire company's user
journey and how to users interface with
companies in all touch points to do an
effective start mapping all that would
leave you with this maybe 25 touch
points and you'll conclude before you
even get started that you're just going
to use 210 let's n touch points in the
middle anyway so that's a lot of wasted
wall space that you could probably use
for for something else
you talk about products but we talk
about projects epics and stories can we
employ the same techniques at those
levels so basically and again this is
where words often get people confused to
me what we're putting in those touch
points is basically just agile epics
it's just high level descriptions of
business need that we have that we want
to fulfill but with where we've yet
deferred the solution to that specific
business need and that is at least how I
interpret and epic and I know that there
are probably as many definitions of an
epic as there are people in there in
this room so it's a different it's a
difficult conversation so that but this
Maps directly into how I've not always
been doing a job or at least how I
perceived to be an effective way of
doing at all right now we're what would
what we can do is that we can prioritize
a set of high-level epics and then once
we get closer to actually wanting to
spend time and energy on those we can
break them into use in so user stories
and then should the team want to they
can break it into some tasks but we
really do not care because that is just
their way of coordinating their work
it's not something we want to spend time
estimating time coordinating and stuff
like that so that is just the basics
let's take some question
yeah
yeah
yeah and all I can say is that it works
better if you're all physically present
and yes have we had people joining
through a laptop where we've seen them
on a Skype connection and they've just
used the web came to see the board yes
we have did it work
yes it worked did it work as good as it
would have had if they had been in the
room with the rest no yeah and again
I've tried it but I must also admit that
the only tool I've tried in was rally
and my without passing rally too much it
really did not fulfill what we needed to
do an online real-time story mapping
session is this tool simply couldn't
support the things going on so it turned
out to be quite quite a first
frustrating exercise and I'm not sure
which we achieved something really
valuable doing that session because it
became very much a tool problem session
and less of a process ation and business
direction session okay we are out of
time so thank you very much for joining
remember to rate this session in the go
to lap and I'll stay up here if some of
you have more questions and would like
to have discussed me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
