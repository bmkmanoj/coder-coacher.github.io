and talk about or what I will present
today
so my name is Marathi I have been in the
technology field for about 26 27 years
so and for the majority of that time
I've called myself an architect and I've
always kind of cringed when I said that
because it seems to have a bad
connotation at least and lots of the
organizations I I worked at called again
mind called PR is there we last November
we published a book and we call the
continuous architecture and that's what
I want to talk about today the reason we
wrote the book was we both and I work at
Deutsche Bank though full disclosure
anything I'm talking here today has good
or bad nothing to do with my current
employer nor is it relates to Pierre's
current employer who is PR works for
travellers in the United States he and I
worked many many years ago together as
architects as consultants and I had a
lot of good ideas or we think good ideas
and we wanted to collect them in in his
architecture as we know it or we used to
know it's you know a long time ago still
relevant in today's world of technology
and an IT so I'll talk a little bit
about that and it's really not a
prescriptive approach it's just really a
collection of ideas and principles etc
which we hope you'll understand today
before that I just want to get a
understanding of the audience and I'll
do something I usually don't like
presenters doing because ask the
audience a few questions but I promise I
won't pick on anyone and you know ask
them to fall over with that but it's
just if I could get a show of hands on a
few questions so how many in the
audience would call themselves an
architect so rough hands I'm the getting
at I guess one sixth or one of the
audience how many would call themselves
the developer
okay that's everyone so there so you're
the ones that normally don't you know I
guess disagree with architects or have
kind of challenges with them maybe maybe
not how many would call themselves a
manager project manager or in management
layer etc okay so about the same number
of architects overwhelmed by the
developers that's good how many of you
play a musical instrument I'm sorry
about more than half how many on a pet
okay more people play musical
instruments and on pets and how many of
you vote regularly in elections okay
that's actually very good so it's it's
better so that was just to understand
audience a little bit so let me start
the talk so first a few slides on
context
you know before introducing the concept
of continuous architecture I mean what
is architecture you know it's it's
there's lots of and in the book we try
to give some definitions but it really
taught it's really about looking at the
software you develop you know the system
you're developing and dealing it at a
level of abstraction right you want to
and you make certain decisions how the
system should be structured you know
that's a very loose definition but
that's the way most people understand
architecture in their current world
architects just basically because of the
name we always love to refer to real
architects the ones that actually built
buildings it's and I put something of
Frank Gehry out there which is a
building he and someone else which I
can't remember his name but I give a lot
of my lineage built and Prague which is
the dancing house that's supposed to be
fresh Astaire and Fred Astaire and
Ginger Rogers is what that was
influenced by I mean that building
itself is very interesting there have
been some it's been removed from the
internet since but if you googled that
about five years ago or something there
are lots of debates over how well the
building functions because of the air
circulation so it gives a very
well-known architect and it gives
interesting thoughts about difference
between form and function
but I think software architecture is
more especially today when we're looking
at continues to deliver an agile it's
always referring to building
architectures probably incorrect it's
probably better to think of growing
organisms or how things grow and that's
a better way of thinking about
architecture but another thing is saying
that basically the basic tenants of good
architecture hasn't changed you know
there's always you know if you read a
the mythical man-month from Frederick
Brooks which is written years ago on his
experience of building the IBM systems
everything he says is actually still
valid today I think what has changed
though is the technology landscape
basically we deal in a environment as IT
groups actually I'll ask one more
question how many people work in what
you might call the medium to large
organization so you're in the IT
division of a medium to large
organization so that's about half of the
audience so the pressure you get is to
to deliver quickly is much more than it
was before you know you can't just say
I'll you know release every six months
all every survey you know you know wait
for the next release next year etc so we
have quicker timelines and then because
of the expectations and everyone has
their app ever and as their mobile phone
so the business or the people who you
know use the software that you're
developing have a bit much higher
expectation they expect you to operate
in their level of the Internet in a
larger scale and distributed manner and
that especially in large organizations
or appear and I come from is quite a
challenge I think what has not changed
in the world of architecture it's
there's a huge impact of organizational
structure on the on the architecture of
the system and I'll talk more about that
but that hasn't changed a little bit
more on context so and this is difficult
to read but I kind of drew this once
kind of looking at technology and
developed approach an architecture of
how things have evolved if you look at
it you know we have the mainframes the
PCs client-server the web and now you
might call it cloud so we have four or
five different levels of Technology and
I randomly threw some things out there
of when things came out the first Oracle
apparently client-server
was in 1985 interesting you know soap
came out in 1998 it's not totally
obsolete
you know Amazon Web Services is this
2006 you look at that and then you look
at you know people what what do you do
with the development approach and how
you deal with architecture some
interesting things
I mean structured programming is 1966
the first layered architecture at least
that I'm aware of the OSI model OSI
model which was around networks the
seven layer model so that was in in 84
and then what actually happened was
there's like the mid nineties a huge
amount of things happened you know
that's one object oriented analysis and
design was very fashionable use-cases
design patterns the fourth force one
model the CMM maturity model they all
came out in the 90s so it's just
interesting to think about that and and
then we had a j'l and continuous
delivery and things like safe so that's
just the I just liked it I found it very
interesting to think about it when we
seem to start to think about this
concept of how technology and
architecture and approach to
architecture you know develop and
support each other hopefully so what is
I mean continuous architecture are just
a few words out there but when we went
to we were talking to publishers about
about the book and this came out this
very 1990s diagram came out from that
conversation with the publisher of what
is the book about and it's really about
bridging the gap we think if you need to
build a cathedral if you characterize it
to a level you could say that the agile
developers basically saying where's the
shovel and your traditional architects
saying where's the five year plan and
and it's really to try to balance that a
few key words out there is I'll put I
think the real world is very important
what we say is that it's a huge debate
of what what is the architecture how do
you physically hold the architecture in
your hands is it you know some people
love to draw these huge diagrams and
paste it on the wall with lots of
complex
arrows between them other people might
give here UML model that they've
developed in in a tool other people
might give you a word document I mean my
premises the architecture is actually
the codes that's running in production
the architecture is actually what's
there I mean the role of the architect
is to influence that it's not to create
these diagrams documents or things like
that so real world is an important
concept actionable sustainable all those
things come out testable evolve Oh
driven by feedback is also an important
thing of the constant feedback loops of
getting just like you would be doing in
continuous delivery etc to just have
constant feedback loops into your
architecture so I'll come to again busy
slide but I'll talk about each one of
these but what we decided we basically
have if you look at continuous
architecture we have six principles and
a bunch of tools which we define in more
detail and all that this is a way of
thinking about architecture which we
think is valid in today's you know
landscape and I'll quickly read each one
of them and there's some graphics that
go along with it but you can ignore
those and then what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna talk about a little bit about each
one of them the first one is we should
architect products not just solutions
for projects the second one is when you
architect you focus on the quality
attributes not on functional
requirements so that's basically quality
attributes ie non-functional
requirements the third one almost
straight from the agile world is you
should delay design decisions until they
are absolutely necessary I think that's
a quite key one fourth one architects
were changed leverage the power of small
micro services and so you know all over
I think there were workshops yesterday
about building marker services and you
know I think it's it's a very hot topic
and a very debated topic exactly what
they are but regardless the concept of
small loosely coupled components you
know state the services etc has been
around for a long time architect for
build test and deploy which basically
means again going to lots of
organizations are
Dierks basically worried about the
structure of the system they don't
architect the test environment or the
deployments they're not really worried
about how that is structures and that
what this is saying is that they should
be you know the architects role doesn't
just stop of saying here guys here's a
bunch of diagrams or is just a bunch of
design decisions good luck in your tests
and deployment cycles you know and give
me a call if you have any problems the
last one is model the organization after
design after the design of the system
this again relates to the what I
mentioned earlier is the impact
organization has on the architecture and
technology is quite huge and I'll talk
more about that but it really is about
you know leverage in structuring your
organization and your teams in a way
that you that help you with your
architecture rather than hinder you so
again architect products not solutions
for projects how many people here have a
product manager that they deal with day
to day or regularly it's actually it's
about 40% of the audience or things like
that especially in medium to large
organizations people don't think of the
solutions they build so if you're a
commercially you know facing
organization building software you
naturally have product managers or
anyone who's worked in a software
development organization like I had at
the beginning of my career the concept
of a project manager is very accepted if
you go into most organizations though
you just have a bunch of projects a
bunch of systems a bunch of things that
you and the architect is really either
aligned to a division or just collection
of systems the whole thing here is that
we should treat bring that commercial
view of product management into the
enterprise and and really treat
everything we're developing as a product
there's lots of benefits to that I'll
give an example I try to do this in
everything I'm accountable for in my day
to day job and some time ago
ago I was you know given a workflow
system that said okay Marat you're
responsible for this workflow system
then I asked the people that manage the
system saying okay who are our clients
and they said okay we'll get back to you
and and you know a week later I got a
spreadsheet what a list of you know a
number of applications that were used in
the in the bank and that obviously that
is not a list of clients it's really
like who will you know if this doesn't
work who will you know which business
area will call us well you know since I
worked for a bank will it be the front
office will it be risk will it be
finance and who and that area really
cares about what we're developing and
delivering so applying that approach is
very important so and another thing
about the role of the architecture
architecture is always about balancing
and making decisions within within
certain constraints so it is really a
balancing act like we talked about form
and function before when we should I saw
the building in Prague
again you have a product manager and
delivery manager and the architect's
role is to make sure that they listen to
both of them and the person defining the
product or person accountable for
delivering the product and create a
coherent vision out of that that's I
think a key aspect of the architects
role if you want to do project
management properly you have to treat it
as a first-class citizen and
organizations not just lip service which
implies you should govern it and get the
commercials right I can this is a topic
dear to my heart I can talk a lot about
it but I think I don't want to be in the
same position as the keynote speaker so
I'll move on to the next principle and
by the way the singularity what he was
talking about is it's quite exciting
it's quite an exciting topic and I felt
after listening to that it's like coming
back into the world of architecture that
you know unfortunately I can't show
videos of Stephen Hawking or things like
that so the second one is really focused
on quality attributes and the key
premise here is it's it's very obvious
but even today most people when you say
you go to a business user and you say
what is you know my NFR is the famous
three-letter acronym you guys like it
should be fast you know
we out you know and you can and no one
is very excited about documenting them
and then you just end up with architects
and just based on the functionality you
have to deal with the challenge with
that is for your functional requirements
you probably have three or four
architectural options for your quality
attributes or non-functional
requirements you only have one or two
options
and that's why so if you that's really
important to think about and here we
just just put out and I think a tool as
we talked about tools the architecture
trade-off analysis method to a time
utility tree which is an sei software
engineering Institute generated thought
is quite useful and it's it's a very
simple way of articulating your non
functional without you know having to
create you know huge amounts of
documents and again it talks about
stimulus response and measurement it's a
very simple way you can talk to your
end-users and say instead of it's
running fast you can just say oh okay
tell me what's the stimulus is what do
you expect the response and how I should
measure it again a tool that's quite
useful but even if you don't use the
tool really focused on your
non-functional this is delay design
decisions until they are absolutely
necessary this is our third principle so
I did my master's thesis years ago on
something called simulated annealing and
that taught me probably a very important
thing and annealing is as you might know
is the process you used to cool steel
down simulated annealing is a way that
you it's you know mathematically define
the optimal nodes so that you don't get
stuck in a local if you want to find a
high point or low point you don't get
stuck in a local valley you can actually
go all the way and find the real local
point you need to go in your I guess in
this space that you're trying to solve
so you just run lots of probabilistic
algorithms but the interesting thing
about the what was an eye-opener for me
is that if you cool steel too quickly it
cracks right that's what they do that's
the process of annealing of cooling
steel and then when I did my simulated
anything if I let the algorithm try to
may come to conclusion too quickly I
would get cracked images and every day
over not every day hopefully not every
day but quite often in my day to day
career I find people making design
decisions too early on which immediately
makes me jump to those vision of those
cracked images because I think you'll
end up with a brittle architecture if
you end up making your design decisions
too early on it doesn't mean don't make
them or don't make any decisions which
is which is also another you know this
analysis paralysis mode but it's really
important that we I need to make
respected minimum viable product or
minimum viable architecture really are
you know I do and almost that takes a
step back to the non-functional like we
say oh it should be a very configurable
system then we need a rules engine you
know there's lots of decisions we jump
to because we haven't understood or
non-functional and we haven't really you
know we jumped a lot of decisions early
on because we feel the pressure to make
decisions and the thing is keep your
systems simple and only make it more
complex when you have to an important
related topic is on the bottom
right-hand side is we have a blog which
we very rarely updated and once in a
while though someone reads it and gives
us feedback and one one we presented
some of these ideas very early on
someone asked the question what is the
unit of work of an architect like you
can measure a developer you could you
know you can measure lots of things or a
tester or and they go here's my I ran
six test cases out of 22 and blah blah
blah and they can draw metrics and all
that type of stuff what is the unit of
work of an architect after thinking
about it the architects the unit of work
is really an architectural decision you
know if they don't if you don't do
anything else as an architect you should
make sure that the correct decisions and
we have a more full-fledged
two definition but architects role is to
make sure that the decisions are the
right decisions are made for the project
so it has a coherent vision and that I
thought was a quite an eye-opener for me
because that's quite important and you
know we talk a lot about architectural
decisions and how you can relate it to
your backlog etc etc and
but the key thing I message from this
one is you know don't overcomplicate
your architecture too soon and also
really the unit of work is an
architectural decision which is
including myself quite appalling that
how little effort we put in really
understanding them and documenting them
and making them in in a clear manner
another little sidetrack people when I
talked about this I've asked you know do
you apply everything you've talked about
here in your day-to-day work and I guess
my best answer is I try but I'm not sure
I'm always successful so again these are
just ideas and principles that we
strongly believe in it takes quite a lot
of day-to-day focus to try to apply them
again architect for change leverage the
power is small this is the
micro-services world I think or it
doesn't have to be but that's what
everyone understands these days and I'm
probably not the most qualified person
to talk about microservices but I tried
it I mean I drew a little thing there
that's the there's anyone recognized
that's the monolith and yeah in space
odyssey' then that was the 70s that was
the world of Earth the 1990s that bubble
of activity I I put the so from the
monolith we live to object oriented
analysis and design world in that way
and the clouds for those who were around
at that time I know Rebecca is here
those are greatly Boutrous clouds I
wanted to put them up there as that and
now I couldn't think of a picture for
microservices what I thought was all
night so again the concept as I said
before of loosely coupled components I
mean small loosely coupled components
has been around for a long time
but exactly what is microservices you
know then that's a huge debate which we
probably don't have time to go into but
is it just the rest API again you know I
was talking to someone else the other
day and they basically say you know we
were we're doing micro services but all
they do is they for the REST API and
it's just a spaghetti behind a REST API
you know and it might be a smaller
spaghetti or distills a spaghetti so how
far
do you you know do you take it this is
just that is it based on the codebase
size you know it's this is it you know
there's this balance of velocity versus
complexity anyway a huge topic but you
know do leverage the power of small and
do architect in in having smaller
components that can pull in and pull out
whenever you need to this I talked about
before nothing earth-shattering and what
you see on the slide except for the fact
that the architect should be accountable
obvious depends of course within the
constraints of the organization not only
for the architecture of the product but
how the product is built so they have to
have accountability for managing the you
know house testing done house continuous
delivery done etc etc so that is you
know so continuous delivery or DevOps is
not something that's just some other
groups doing architectures focuses on
how the product is structured they are a
key part of that feedback loops is quite
key there that's I mean continuously
getting feedback on anything you're
doing and doing it without making it
very complex is very very important
so if you know obviously people do that
one day to test out you know consumer
faces applications on the web you try
out something or you might throw an A
and a B products see which one works get
the feedback quickly it's the same thing
for your architecture you have to make
sure that you get feedback from your
architecture as quickly as you can so
that just goes that supports the you
know minimal viable architecture I
talked about before continuous delivery
and I'm feeding those things and and we
have quite a lot of ideas on how to
implement that in the continuous
delivery cycle last principle but not
least I guess I don't know why we I have
no idea why we ordered the principles in
this manner so I think it was just the
first time we wrote them so there's no
inherent logic in the in the structure
because everyone has talked about
Conway's law which is quite interesting
and it basically says you know
organisations which design systems are
constrained to produce designs which are
copies are the communication structures
of the organization
very powerful statement though because
it he has a very interesting if you read
his paper which was with in 1968 and he
was focused not on just software you I
mean his paper was really about just
systems right man and and this is 1968
but at that time one example he gives in
that paper is they had two teams to
write I think it was a ADA compiler but
I might be with my team I dunno six but
it was a compiler and he had two teams
that wanted to comply to groups to write
a compiler for the same language one was
in two teams the other one was set up in
three teams the first group ended up
their compiler with two components and
other one with three components and that
was basically it so the way he set up
the teams or he or whoever decided those
teams were ended up with how the the
compiler was architected how many
components are here so it's a very
powerful oh so two things on this is is
basically one I think there's at the
macro level and not at the micro level
so if you look at the micro level all
this is saying is make sure that you
have you know what we call or I like to
call them feature teams or coherent
teams that have you know your team
should consist of all these roles or any
other roles so don't have a separate
testing team don't have a separate
deployment team you know your team is
structured if you're gonna build a
component you know you basically have a
backlog and you have a team that can
take items off that backlog do that
analysis do the testing do any database
or whatever technology reading all those
changes are one cohesive unit
the more you have separate teams doing
different things the more difficult it
is to develop so that's I guess the
micro review of this thing the macro
thing is just be aware of your
organizational constraints and if you
can't change change them at least don't
fight them unnecessarily because the
organization will impose constraints on
you and the larger the organization is
and I work in quite a large one the more
those constraints are and you know I'm
talking about political currents
and how things are related so be
cognizant of them and try to take
advantage of them where you can and
don't fight them or where you can't
because going back to an architect an
architect is there to make decisions
within the constraints that they're
aware of and the organization
constraints or some of them so that was
quickly run through of the six
principles and if we we have a case
study we put in the book which is it's
actually from what PR is PRS experience
so and not the best diagram in the world
but I'll just quickly use that as an
example to tie up and talk about each of
the principles one more time and
basically this was a mobile shopping
system that they needed to develop and
some conceptual architecture pretty you
know again going back to what is an
architecture is it really this diagram
now but how how did we they apply the
principles while doing this so the
principle one was products you know
think of our products you know the team
when they were asked to build this
mobile shopping system realized there's
a already of web-based product in the in
the organization that allows people to
get quotes so instead of building a new
system they basically got together with
that team looked at their product
roadmap and enhanced their product
roadmap so that was basically you know a
huge win already there again principle
two they identified performance as a top
quality attributes there's more details
about exactly how that was constructed
but what they did is then they could do
a basic prototype in a week and they
thought the the base architecture they
had for the system was was was working
fine so again it's look at at at the
quality attribute and trying to see and
going back to this continuous feedback
loops etc just create a prototype run it
see how it is and move on principle
three delay design decisions basically
they did not introduce caching
capabilities because they thought that
quality attribute was not fine in their
current out
architecture because they're getting in
and they did not use a rules engine so
again it's very tempting to throw in
lots of additional components because
you see a lot of non functionals that
you might at some day meet actually
another example I have is there was a
huge pressure from a group to build
basically introduced a new web server
technology into the organization is
working out and the guy said it's going
to be huge because everyone is going to
use it and and you know thousands of
users and they're going to hit it at
this rate this rate what the service is
you guys have aren't sufficient so we
need to introduce XYZ and we all got
excited we introduced XY z-- that I
visited the team two years later I said
how's the curry that's fine but the
users never showed up you know so we
just you know we actually didn't need to
introduce that technology if we had you
know thought about it properly but it's
very easy to get excited about
everything's going to explore to make
decisions early on I mean the principal
phone principal for they didn't use any
vendor specific extension so that they
could swap in their database in and out
and they wherever they could in the
business service layer and this they had
some existing services they actually
built new services that existed next to
them so hew microservices principal
fivers and this is a few years ago they
went for a container based approach I
guess containers or you know quite
popular there's but that was the
architects decision is to actually use
years one of the containers technologies
out there to deliver and deploy the
application and then principle six in
summer is basically they said there were
the three capabilities they had obtain
quotes place an order and order
fulfillment and they actually structured
their teams around those three
components and that's that's how that's
just kind of I think helps to bring back
these principles and how they could be
applied in I guess a case study so
that's really it on the I think I'm
within my 30 minutes I try to pursue so
well I mean we have our book we have our
blog
there's our emails for both of us
our Twitter things but it's somewhere on
the continues architecture just to wrap
