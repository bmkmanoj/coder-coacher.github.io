awesome because i was afraid that the
inferiority of the java track would be
too loud so like didn't mentioned i'm
now sell for say i was previously at
linkedin way working on the economic
graph that i will just describe what it
is but it's great timing because kind of
the first time i gave this talk we only
announced the computation for the
accountant graph and yesterday we
linkedin just announced the winners
there was a competition for people and
linkedin for the first time exposed
basically all of its data for research
teams around the world to suggest ideas
what to do with it yesterday they just
announced so you can look it up on the
LinkedIn side but this stock is kind of
a it's a great timing for it so what are
we going to talk about first I'll
introduce myself and kind of more of the
topic I'll describe a little bit what's
linkedin vision because it's important
or senate in the context of kind of
waffling linkedin tries to optimize for
i will talk about well the subject at
hand which is what is professional
identity and how do we a compute it or
what it actually means the computer so
this is a project that i'm kind of i led
part of it and but many many people have
worked on it and 50 minutes is really
not enough time and to describe all of
it so i'll touch and select the topics
that I think are primarily a mostly
interesting from this project and if you
make it this far then you'll know I'm
close to finish so this is a summary so
a little bit about me I did my computer
science a undergrad in Israel I went to
grad school at technion even though I
not mention it to time so please keep it
a secret my graduate degrees in business
not computer science or physics or you
know I work a briefly for a company
called live person that based on New
York it does chat maybe you encounter it
kind of by chatting with you can I
representative online i moved to
linkedin and now like I mention I at
sulfur's this are my twitter handle and
my linkedin in case you're one a 505 me
quickly so the way i like to start talk
is given you know a TL DR version of
what i hope a you will get from the talk
there was the recently great wit by a
martin clapman who also used to be at
length in that every time and i'm sure
then you have this kind of same feeling
you as well that every time you start to
work on the talk you you think Oh point
guard like no one hears me no one wants
to hear me talk about the stuff and you
know as the talk develops is becomes
better but I II also want to kind of
give you just a preview of a kind of
what at least I hope that you will get
from it so the first thing is you will
get a better understanding of what data
scientist does because it it's a
question I am keep getting asked and
there are many many flavors of it and
the term data signs it is vague enough
and there's a lot of flavors and just
keep in mind i will represent only one
of these flavors but i think it's
actually kind of a pretty interesting
use case that shows that it's very
different from what most people think
that data sciences actually is i'll talk
a lot about what i think a lot of people
understand that you know data science is
like mostly I know ninety ninety-five
percent whatever the number is is about
cleaning data and I will just explain
why is it so hard and why do we spend so
much time on it and I will also touch on
linkedin endorsements and what is the
reason why linkedin actually has this
feature besides you know letting your
mom and dorsey of her stuff she knows
nothing about and of course you know i
came all this way to give the stalks of
what
a kind of i'm new to it so please tweet
or use the app to kind of ask questions
for something like that another thing i
forgot to mention but i'll mention l
that a kind of based on previous
feedback there is a word more usually
more questions than i usually leave time
for so i actually cut it a little bit
choice on to leave time for more
questions and actually the questions
part i think is probably the best part
in most of talks because you know here I
talk about what I think you want to hear
but the question part is you really tell
me what you want to hear more about so I
left more room so if you guys by the end
of it don't have any questions will have
an awkward situation okay so let's avoid
it so let's start so what is linkedin
vision and probably if the linkedin
brass was here that wouldn't be happy
because they never remember whether it's
the vision the mission statement or the
whatever like I not good at this like
terminology of how to run a big company
so let's call it a vision is to create a
Konami opportunity for every a
professional in the world that is kind
of the big mission statement of
Watlington a believes in and what's a
what it tries to accomplish and one of
the ways to do it is this idea about hey
what is kind of the bigger problem
besides I think the way most people
think about a about LinkedIn which is
you know hey it's a kind of online
resume website that I you know put my
resume and then when I look for a job I
go in update my resume and stuff like
that is a concept that is co the
economic graph it's you know obviously
you can see that probably a the people
who came when came away with this
concepts are from the marketing
department not the data science I
definitely would not do that's great of
a job you know very aspirational
inspirational
but what does it mean and here is a
picture that kind of tries to capture
what we talk so Linden has different
entities in our data set so we have
obviously professionals but we also have
companies we have positions we have jobs
in all these things you can think in
your mind that are somewhat connected
can again it doesn't capture the kind of
the whole thing and the old idea but I
think it's it's a pretty good place to
start from for uterus and what is the
graph component that I key I keep
referring to and this I just say really
a really exists because you know all of
you work at your current company your
previous company that creates some
connection companies are connected to
each other through my different edges by
for example having the same employees
now and before or having some business
or being in the same industry and things
like that and jobs company post them so
we can build a very very elaborate graph
and here is where the kind of the data
data science begins because the picture
and this picture is also obviously made
by the marketing department it's not a
real representation of what the LinkedIn
data really looks like so let's take one
node and try to focus on it and this is
the note i took the CEO and this is just
really it's very very small portion of
how people that are you know in the CEO
position in the kind of the main person
at the company tend to describe them
because if you recall a linkedin is not
a very curated even it's not like
wikipedia we don't have editors right
you are free to write whatever you want
on your profile and some people do right
CEO some people you know a lot like they
think maybe the longer version is fans
here right the chief executive officer
some people yes especially where I come
from the west coasts are really proud of
their you know founding position or some
people do not like to you know take all
the credit so they're not the founders
they're the co-founders some people also
our president and for you know if we
kind of take it out of the enterprise
world and more look more small
businesses mums and pop shops we're in
slightly larger people can call
themselves owners and not the CEO of you
know and it ten people a hardware store
so this is kind of one of the examples
and of course we can find the many more
of them let's look at the second
examples you know company that is I
think the probably the largest company
on linkedin today I think they have
almost half a million employees so can
anyone guess how many different ways
these half a million employees found the
way to describe the company that they
work working tens hundreds thousands
millions any guess 17,000 so and here
are seven of them but yeah you can
clearly kind of see the problem here and
here really I I pick them more
reasonable ones there are some that for
example the IBM TJ what's in the
research center some people are amid the
IBM part because the one thing to keep
in mind about LinkedIn it's kind of the
first time in history were you would
share a kind of your resume or your
title or you know your previous history
with the rest of the world because
usually we are as professionals we
operate within a certain context within
our company so our titles is mainly for
people in our company to understand what
they what we do and I also mean you know
possibly for external facing so maybe to
understand what your position you know
at
or companies but still is probably kind
of limited to industry whenever the
people here when they write that they
work in the teacher and Watson Research
Center in their mindset is pretty much
everyone in inner space will immediately
understand what this they don't need to
specify the IBM it's just redundant but
it turns out not to be again their
optimization function is probably not to
make my life as a data scientist easier
right they just want to convey some
information not very example is how do
we treat title anyone here works at
finance work at finance before I see
some hands so again a for example we
kind of the most common a levels at the
finance industry is a sorry I forgot one
but it sorry i forgot the bottom one but
then it becomes associate vice president
director managing director right so when
a person writes vice president everyone
in their surrounding understand exactly
it's probably means that this person is
an investment banking and that is a his
title and probably you know at a certain
level but for me as it inside that i now
just look at this profile it's actually
very hard to understand that this person
is an investment banker it's just people
do not a kind of it do not forward this
information because for them and for
most recruiters if you look at the
linkedin use case where a probably why
most people have a link in my profile in
the first place it's kind of obvious so
that's why it's not mr. but it makes the
problem sterilization is kind of a way
harder and our kind of last example is
also we have it with schools which is
another and northern our graph at the
school so UCLA and you know the Anderson
School of Management which again there
is many ways to write it is you know it
takes quite some kind of data jujitsu to
actually understand that people that
went to the Anderson School of
Management have something
in common with people that went to UCLA
so I guess like I said you know this is
also just not to mention the people who
examples of people who are actually
writing the truth on linkedin like for
example on linkedin e if you look for
CEO of Google you will find 300 people
some of them are legitimate CEOs of
company that google acquired not all of
them which brings me to the next picture
why my life as a data sign in with
user-generated content is hard honesty
on the internet and again to be fair
some of it is just not honestly it's
just the different contexts and really a
your your job as you know people were
users of LinkedIn is not to make my life
easier so let's say kind of now get to
the main subject of how my team and I
try to overcome these challenges so the
first thing like why why is it
challenged why do we actually care like
people can write whatever they want and
you know we'll just have to deal with it
but I have an example here from a
linkedin guide this is an actual guide
that LinkedIn gives to its customers
coral the lincoln essentials the modern
recruiters guide and this is you know a
copy of one of the pages only thin so
it's basically teaches you to use the or
at when you use the linkedin search and
one of the examples is if you're looking
for a vice president then please add or
vp or v dot p dot or SVP or EVP and you
can see you know some java and you can
see one of the things that is also kind
of a you know domain expertise that
account executives and you know cells
representative are actually kind of the
same the same thing so as you know every
tech conference change should have a
picture of asset kitty so in
here while you know I was trying to draw
a lot it's it's really sad as a you know
as a provider of a product and a user
experience I really would want to do a
much better job and back to the speaker
then you know telling my customers or my
users to start using you know they're a
or statements because honestly we do
have enough data to solve not solve
every single problem in the world or
every every person that decides to come
up with a wacky title to really
understand what they do in life but I'm
saying for the best majority of the
LinkedIn users we can actually do much
better job than say hey for customer use
or statements and instead of a include
your domain expertise into the product
so one kind of slightly naive way but
like actually it's something that has
been implemented at LinkedIn as the
first pass and actually this is somewhat
a somewhat decent job is you know do
some simple tech stuff like for example
we have very common acronyms like VP is
not you know uncommon at LinkedIn so
every time we see if we pls expanded to
vice president right makes sense
abbreviations less SR dot let's expand
it to senior and then we can take the
most common titles i think the number
which has a think it was about twenty
four thousand of them of the like just
literally sort by after by doing these
two transformations sorry something here
okay sort them and then like just kind
of a also do some clever breaking into
it then it's just the kind of
classification part so we out of this
24,000 let's say two of them are
suffering genere and tech lead then we
if we now someone calls themselves
software engineer and tech lead in
search having searches not in one of the
most common one and say oh this person
is probably a software engineer
and the tech lead and now everyone that
will use the link to website and search
for a software engineer or a tech lead
will find that person as well again it
sounds extremely but I just hear the
point is it's actually not bad like it
solves the you know large percentage is
the problem and it's it was way way
easier to implement than the solution I
will start to describe so it was
actually a pretty good solution the
service and pretty well but there are
some problems with it the one example is
suffering junior and senior software
engineer so you know there are many many
people are a linkedin that the their
title search engines are many people
that their tile is senior suffering and
we now using that method summarize them
to two different entities right but for
the vast majority of practical reasons
probably especially we were faking in
the mindset of a recruiter we they don't
really want that differentiation right
it's more of a you know seniority aside
it's probably should be a different
filter but these people do exactly the
same job especially considering the you
know the company cultures some company
it would call senior software engineer
what another company will call software
engineer and then we kind of go back
into this or statement that recruiters
have to have to use is like even after
implementing implementing that solution
when we mind the search logs we still
found that everyone that was looking for
a senior software engineer soft engine
we're also adding an or statement for a
software engineer which is a kind of a
common problem of course you might think
hey there is a very easy solution let's
remove the board senior it's kind of a
stop or blah blah blah but it gets kind
of a little bit more complicated when
you go to like more fancy titles like
staff softened your principal and then
if you like say oh well you know let's
say have a principal also as a as a kind
of stopped were then a lot of
the people that you know work for
schools might not have a job or
something like that so I'm saying it
basically the one of the problems that
there is a a I'm ambiguity with the
language that this text based approach
it does not solve extremely well this is
the other problem is basically you know
the synonyms problem right we have a oh
we don't see it very well but it says
software engineer software developer and
programmer are you know just free of the
ways you know software engineers call
themselves and become more completely
you know Microsoft and Amazon or other
seattle-based company like the term
software development engineer and we
have very very innovative Bay Area
companies like for example yahoo at
yahoo the engineers called themselves
technical Yahoo's at Google a lot of
people like to refer to themselves as
Googlers just hey you know i'm a Googler
and it's up to you to figure out you
know what it is I do at my day job so
again maybe it's like something to get
you know at back at LinkedIn data
scientist or something that they make
our lives hard for no reason but I'm
saying it's not even and again we're
back to the or problem for probably any
recruiter that will it will look for a
you know software engineers will still
have to have this giant or statement
that has even more and really it was
kind of funny that we actually got to
witness the level of sophistication of
recruiters by how long their query
strings are and there was a direct
relation between you know how long their
query strings are in our search product
to you know how well they're doing in
actually a contacting candidates and
that's again not the experience say we
would like to have our first problem is
this person architects which also was
mentioned on the previous talk notice
one thing about this person
he does not write software and there are
a lot of angry people that I got emails
from that asked me please please please
don't send me more software architect
jobs I build houses but so the language
term here is homonyms is just the firm
architect was borrowed but which caused
a problem and it doesn't matter how
sophisticated your NLP is even if you
you know bring the best NLP people they
will not solve the homonym problem
because again it's something that is
ambiguous say in language and one of my
favorite example from LinkedIn is when I
used to get jobs for mining engineer
which refers to actual you know physical
coal mines or something like that in
Australia which is again not very
relevant but unfortunately happens so we
need a better idea we need the better
way to solve this problem then you know
just doing the strain classification and
some of that so one of the ways is just
to understand that if we look at my
LinkedIn profile I i actually have much
much more information about me than just
my title there is you know the companies
that work with and you know they the
schools i went to the degrees i got got
in these schools and all the other you
know we have certifications now patterns
or whatever there's a very large a
corpus of data that we can use in all in
actually understanding better what these
people do in the a life the problem is
with this corpus of data or any kind of
this heterogeneous corpus of data that
it's kind of hard to work with is like
I'm saying okay if the word Java appears
some you know on a company and a
certification or it appears in one of
the classes I took ever what is the kind
of weight of this how should I compare a
word that appears in my education
section to a word that computer copy
appears on my summary
so instead of solving this problem we
actually said hey you know it's too hard
so let's do something much simpler so
this is one particular section of my
profile and these are the upper
mentioned endorsements and if you look
at them so these are my endorsements up
to some time point it's actually a
pretty good representation of what I do
it's I have this thing that when I come
to people's houses for the first time
well the people that still have a you
know library or bookshelf in their house
is the one that they not the transfer
older books Aquino I like to look at it
because it gives me like a very good
understanding of what type of person
this is I think that's kind of the
LinkedIn equivalent if you look at it
honestly you don't need any other part
of my profile to understand what I do
you know at my profession it's kind of
pretty clear and we found we found this
kind of repeating again and again for
pretty much most people that the know
the n one of the kind of a things that
endorsement became so viral and kind of
such as a successful product to you know
almost a Lincoln's fault which is it
kind of became a lot of noise but one of
the things we could get from it is the
better understanding of what people do
here is another example of a person that
it was my manager at LinkedIn and he's
the head of search quality at LinkedIn
and kind of the karaoke aside and will
touch upon that skill in particular you
again can rescind that the searcher
first who is not like you know search
rescue these does not train you know son
Bernard dogs and Swiss Alps okay it's
probably refers to information retrieval
the web search kind of things so we can
again without understanding em we
definitely had our share of a
interesting titles like for example one
of my teammates has decided to refer to
himself as mumble mumble scientists
really the word mu
ble and scientists and again if we look
at the title is well the scientists
might be tells us something or the work
you know the fact that they used the
word mumble in this title but I'm saying
just looking at the endorsements and
this is what a what we're going to use
talking forest so the process is kind of
a certain so we have our profile with
all the profiles sections that you all
probably familiar with what we do with
this profile we in first scale basically
we say hey if you work at Google then
you know you are this likely if you have
all these skills if you when you know
study CS you are likely to have the
skills if you part of the scholar group
at LinkedIn you likely to have skul as a
skill and basically take every part of
your profile and try to infer what
skills you may have and then this part
the one problem that skills is you know
it can be extremely aspirational right i
can write about myself that I'm amazing
public speaker but as you see I have
like no endorsements for it so what
makes it actually better is a
endorsements which is more what other
people think of you of course obviously
you all witness there are problems with
that mechanism as well but I'm saying a
the one there is some cost about someone
giving you some endorsement which is the
cost that does not exist when people
write about themselves and again I'm
saying like if you look for words like
guru or ninja or words like that there
are far more common than probably they
should be on linkedin profiles and this
is kind of a again goes to the point of
fame endorsements are what we found our
a better mechanism in print predicting
what people are likely are then being
first skill mechanism and then we could
create a skill vectors so just the kind
of graphic representing you can take my
skills and you know after some
normalization can say hey this is the
kind of new
Eric representation of Batali Gordon
okay which is what zero point 25 a
data-mining 0.2 a dupe or you know you
know whatever and what's really really
nice about this so now I basically
transition my work from this very
difficult a true genius space of text
and different entities and different
objects to a really homogeneous space
where I have just skills you think about
whe I don't remember what number of top
skill we took a things like three
thousand ten thousand and now I have
everyone are represented in the same
dimensional space and we basically have
and again the way we came up is not just
sheer endorsement counts because again
counts from your mom is not exactly like
you know being in the worst for Java
from james gosling so this is different
so we made some modification to it but
without going too much into details
about what what these numbers are the
important thing is now we have a new
miracle vector that we can represent
every single person and once we have
this numeric representation you know
what my life becomes much much easier
because they're you know already a lot a
lot of solve problems dealing with
numeric vectors which does not
necessarily exist with fair dealing with
a you know heterogeneous text corpuses
if you want to know more rather talk by
SEBI I pits come rock Aloha you'll have
the slides later so you can just you
don't have to memorize it and that is
more about the in first skills mechanism
and kind of way what we did so after we
have all these scale vectors now the
first part is to create the apology what
are kind of the standardized units of
skill we cannot refer to them internally
as skill sets right because it's not a
particular skill as engineers we have
many many we have many many skills and
now we kind of want to perform a
hierarchical cluster to get this this
clusters of skill so the question is
also why a
why do we want it to be hierarchical
because it's actually four different
products it makes a difference for Jess
representation like for example take the
question software engineers and hardware
engineers are they the same or not well
the answer is it depends right so it
depends probably if you're a recruiter
looking for software engineers you don't
want to see other hardware engineers
this is completely irrelevant but if you
have some annoying like engineers
certification problem you can think
about a four-hour ads product think
about use cases were like even for
recruiters some of them and I will show
it in a letter say is we also separate
our engineers because engineers society
such an overwhelming majority on
linkedin in terms of representation is
you know we separate them from you know
dotnet stack engineers to JVM stack
engineers right because some recruiters
actually care about this even if they
have the same exact title software
engineer so based on their skills they
want a hard one and not the other but
for let's say you know some ads that
kind of level of granularity might not
be that interesting so this is why we
have this hierarchical structure if you
don't know this things that you see here
is coldest like this tree called the
dendogram and the way and there's like
two ways to come up with a it's either
bottom-up you kind of take the two more
similar ones and you kind of combine it
together and then you find the next two
similar ones and combine it or there is
a top-down where you start with
everything as one giant cluster and
start splitting it in half but
eventually the important part is then
you draw a line and say hey everything
below that line these would be a my new
cluster and everything above this line
is where you break it so after
performing this that we have this
ontology of different levels is you can
see at the like very bottom leaf nodes
it can be you know a very specialized
you know Java engineer that specializes
in JVM tuning or you know something like
that
and as we go up it kind of you know it
goes down to Java engineer software
engineer engineer and just in a linkedin
member or something like that or tech
worker IT and things like that but now
after we create this ontology we need to
go through all of all linked in member
base and try to classify them ok so now
vitally after we created this ontology
you know where should we classify me as
persons so here we chose a kind of very
simple classification method that's
called k-nearest neighbors in case
you're not familiar k-nearest neighbors
is basically we want to say hey what is
the what how should we classify the
green circle in here well again the
answer is depends on what is the K if we
choose K as one is hey take the one
closest neighbor and classified then
this circle would be classified as a
triangle a red triangle if we chose to
the answer would be the same if we
choose free as our k then it will be
classified as this a Blue Square and
again we it's kind of a more art than
science about how to choose the right
key but the one of the reason why we
actually chose the nearest neighbors
which is in kind of a unsupervised
classification algorithm because I we
didn't have a corpus of the real answers
we actually don't know whether to
classify me you know as a data scientist
or as an engineer or as a public speaker
or whatever because there is no label
data set of saying hey you know vitaliy
is this and we can train a train on top
of it if you didn't get that point it's
not that important you feel free to ask
me later but I'm saying it's say it's
not important the import part is the
processes first let's create the
ontology and the second part is let's
classify everyone to the ontology we
just created so let's move to selected
topics and here is to bring back
the prowl some of the problems we
occurred the by using a kind of using
the skill based approach so the first
one you can see I have more endorsements
for java and then data signs and without
bragging about my data science chops I
would just say I'm really bad at Java so
the question is like why do I have more
in Norse and for java than data signs
and there is a liquid can I intricate a
answer to this it's more about that we
need to understand that most of the
Olympian endorses actually come from the
recommendation engine the recommendation
engine has some biases in it so it tends
to suggest the more common skills like
we don't want to suggest you knows
endorse your friend for binge eating
just because you know it's not not that
common it's a far safer choice to ask to
endorse your friend for java so more
people get this recommendation some more
people click on the button hey Norse
Vitaly because you know they like me and
just endorse me for whatever and if you
see the if you look at the links and
data that by far the top Muslim and most
of our skills is Microsoft Office which
by itself unless you were actually like
I know a developer of microsoft office
maybe tells absolutely nothing about
what you do because the this tool is so
common now in the world so if you ever
did like most basic stuff and data
science you can probably guess the
answer oh sorry that shouldn't have
happened by the way obviously some
someone should not be endorsed for
microsoft office let's see sorry about
that
on the show okay back awesome so tf-idf
is this thing that basically we take
every term that we encounter we
normalize it by how frequent this term
is so in our case the document is the
person the term is the skills so we say
hey if every single person on the
profile has endorsements for microsoft
office when we probably should not give
a lot of weight for microsoft office
it's pretty simple again that is one i
guess one of the important slides of the
show that like a lot of what data
scientists do are not really fancy PG
level machine learning so you know it's
just I guess I would classify it as
common sense with maybe some log in it
so let's go to the second problem is as
you can see i'm actually endorse
separately for data mining machine
learning algorithms and data science
which you know we can you know probably
if we had a lot of data science
scientists in the room they would start
arguing about the same or not but for
most practical purposes in case of
wreckers they don't care right we
probably should not have if we take this
level to extreme is let's say I was a
nurse only for data mining and someone
else was only nurse for machine learning
then it doesn't matter which similarity
function you would use no mathematical
similarity function would come up with
these two people are similar they would
say hey this to people because again our
machine does not really understand
remember these are like just Becker's in
some space and if we do any cross
product or anything else we will just
you know yet hey these people are not
similar and it gets like really
ridiculous level by the way guys as my
fellow engineers have to say we after
working on this project we're pretty
ridiculous and the skills like there are
people who differentiate between Python
2.7 Python 3 as their skills as their
core competencies okay if you think
about it in any other industry at any
other profession it's like you know a
construction
worker is like you know like taking two
different hammers and you know getting
endorsements for you know a hammer of
one company and not a hammer Funaro or
something like that it's pretty
ridiculous how we like like to describe
ourselves in the look very finer details
it's like a kind of a after spending a
lot of time data set its kind of brought
me to this realization but back to our
conversation we need to somehow perform
some sort of clustering towards end hey
probably data mining machinery and you
know stuff like Ruby or Python me if
your recruiter a lot of case you know
you would take Python as a replacement
for Ruby will take java's replacement to
C++ or C sharp and stuff like that so
here one of the one of the ways to
performance clustering is to is using a
technique that call a tender Ashley a
location short lda this is a kind of
again a text technique that what it does
it gets a lot of different a lot of
different documents and if it and tries
to come up with topic which is just a
distribution of words if the same words
kind of appear in similar documents and
says hey this words together are a topic
it doesn't matter what the label of the
topic is it's more like you can see here
an example that jean de DNA in genetics
somehow occur together and braid you are
in the nerve and data number and
computer were clustered together as
saying hey these are words that belong
to the same topic and then our actually
skill vector becomes even smaller from
the top ten thousand skills that we have
we have on linkedin we we actually are
now reduce it to like 200 topics you
know you have your engineering topic
sales data science or whatever this I'm
actually need to pick up the pace a
little bit and my last example is the
anomaly detection as you can see head of
search quality he's really passionate
about his karaoke he went and asked
everyone to endorse him for karaoke and
if you see this is me here on the
picture who endorsed Daniel for karaoke
as well I never heard him saying I
no idea where is good if he's good but
he asked so nicely so endorsing for
karaoke and you see it's it's stopped
endorsement but obviously it's not part
of this professional a professional
identity so the question is how do we
realize that karaoke is kind of a a
different thing here compared to
everything else so the way to think
about is we can take any two skills and
kind of map there what other skills they
co-occur with create this graph that is
renee's and say hey information
retrieval is you know happens to be a
lot with machine learning so we can you
know think about the graph that they
should be close together karaoke does
not appear a lot and this is kind of a
way to visualize it and you can kind of
read what what it is unfortunately I
couldn't find the original skill
visualization that we did but it's very
similar and you can see now clusters
kind of form and we had them in on
contain something that we call the BS
cluster is like all about you know the
ability of work with others to lead and
like you know stuff are that people like
to using the resumes and say skills but
you can see now what was and now if we
go back to the kind of Daniel example of
we probably all the bottom ones will
have the same color will belong to the
same cluster couric it will not be thus
we actually will remove it from his a
his representation and will get a much
cleaner vector by the way if you again
want to hear more than sorry about the
specific and oil detection another great
act that was a strata it is about a
novel detection given by Ted Donny so to
wrap things up the user-generated
content for 300 million members creates
300 million problems user-generated
content is really hard the other thing i
hope you understand from the stock is
data cleaning and this is what really it
was about it was cleaning but do we the
other thing to understand here is that
this baseline is the cleaning is so
important because linkedin had so many
recommendation
engines that used to run on this data
and by performing that set of
civilization and kind of using it we we
got like really good improvements on you
know our job search algorithm and our
other algorithms that the basically kind
of use the unearthing that without
changing anything in the algorithm self
just yet well the famous world garbage
in garbage out and the first thing that
I would look at the tape I would like
everyone and full is try to be creative
and work around the language is hard
especially when you're trying to get it
and deeper and deeper meaning about the
world is language is pretty hard and if
you can find some way to work around
that is like for example if you are
building a review app instead of just
having the review also post some hey you
know like dislike or number of stars
some other metrics that is much easier
to work with than just you know trying
to mine the textual bit of course it is
very important for some applications
it's but you can find a much easier
solution by just adding another and
other data source and that's it for me
