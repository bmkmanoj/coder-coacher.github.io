for coming to this talk the idea for
this talk came from a general theme that
seems to be emerging throughout
engineering in general maybe maybe
software engineering is at a particular
that is particularly a cue in the the
amount of knowledge that is required for
an engineer to do his job these days is
just growing exponentially we've started
talking about full stack development now
and that requires such a breadth of
information and such a depth of
information that it's actually becoming
a bit hard to manage and taking that
that that question forward engineers I
think are actually starting to become
less engineers so traditional
engineering is taking a problem and
solving the problem with known you know
tools or policies I think engineering is
actually becoming more of a research
task but I don't think that most
engineers see themselves as researchers
they still see themselves as engineers
so this talk is going to be a little bit
about that
so my name's full window I've got a
small company in the UK window research
comm check it out it's split into three
parts really the first part is trying to
prove to you that in fact you're not
engineers anymore you really are
researchers and then going to take a
look some great researchers at one in
particular and I think that that might
help to bring traditional ideas of
researchers back to earth and then
finally I'm going to talk a little bit
about how you can actually use some
research methodologies in your job to do
more research if that's what you so wish
so first needed to find what research is
and the traditional ideas of research
involve a scientific notion of doing
some research and usually scientific
research is based upon trying to expand
knowledge
trying to catalog and quantify knowledge
as a thing just just for the sake of
gaining more knowledge I think it's a
little bit different in industrial
research in engineering mainly because
we usually have a goal and we live in a
you know the vast majority of projects
that we're talking about the goal is is
capitalistic in nature we are trying to
make money so I like to sort of reframe
research and more of a with the
definition of an attempt to improve or
advance something and that thing could
be a product an idea it could be a
process like a manual process and give
me anything but it's suitably vague to
both contain scientific definitions and
industrial definitions as well and the
first thing we need to learn is like why
would you do research in the first place
why is research even a thing
and for for science research is the
thing because there's a natural human
tendency to want to try and understand
and describe the world that we live in
so we'll look a little bit about what
academic research is doing a minute but
industrial research is generally done
for a reason and that reason is money so
if you ever go to your boss and you need
to say well well just on a general scale
why should we do research and the reason
why I should do research is because it
makes money this is an average over a
significant number of industries we've
got industries ranging from you know
tech all the way down to manufacturing
or on average all of those industries we
choose to return the investment between
ten to thirty percent and it's kind of
vague result in fact because it's so
it's so spread over so many industries
the statistics of that number I've
really really brought there's really
long tails on that so you know you've
got at any anything from zero percent
all the way up to you know the googles
and the Amazons of such but I think this
is like a secondary reason why people
would want to do research in a company
and I think that the reason is that it
breeds I think innovation within a
company makes that company more exciting
to work out if you're in a stale big
large enterprise you're very siloed into
a single job I personally I find that
quite boring I think I think that could
be true for most people I think if you
allow and you trust for engineers to
innovate then that breeds enthusiasm not
just within those people but without the
entire business as well I think there's
definitely implications for something
more than just making
so when we think about a researcher what
is a researcher your ideas about that oh
that by the way this is the first of
many fantastic drawings that you're
going to you're going to enjoy
throughout the presentation I hope you
like them and when you think of a
researcher you usually think of someone
who works in a university you know maybe
a scientist so that type of person the
qualities of that person you think of
them scientists being this grand genius
who six hundred trees and apples falls
on their heads and they'd come up with
these general theories about life itself
that's not true that is not what
research is and the problem with that
idea is that breeds these misconceptions
about research and it's basically around
this idea of not being smart enough like
I don't have a PhD I'm not smart enough
only academics have real time to do
research and that is absolute nonsense
this is some research done by Cambridge
University you probably can't quite make
out the text unfortunately but I'll talk
you through the idea of this research is
to try and document what an academic
researcher does on a day to day basis
I've got two slides this first slide is
for an early career researcher so this
is for a guy that's just finished his
PhD just started his postdoc may be
responsible for a couple of PhD students
and a little bit of lecturing we've got
different color codes in here we've got
blue for research red for training Green
for admin and grey for miscellaneous and
we'll just go through is day his day is
training from London marking supervision
journal Club and then he's reading out
and printing through and going through
grant proposals he's does more lectures
he has the Skype interview has some
lunch some admin more proposals more
proposals bit more supervision and then
more proposals so during that entire day
for this one day for this early early
career group research exactly zero
research all of the research that is
done has gone into that grant proposal
he's done technical pre-sales this is a
senior researcher so this guy is
probably responsible for you know five
to ten people maybe postdocs maybe phd's
does
primarily lecturing and let's have a
look at his day so he starts oh sorry he
starts off learning Chinese took tough
tough way to start your day he's dealing
with emails and then again editing a
proposal for for a volume that is a
director off he has a big drop in
satisfaction there so the y-axis is
satisfaction and is unsatisfied because
he's responding to an issue about his
course and then there's a few more
things supervision a bit more
preparation and finally he goes home for
dinner and the key difference between
him and the early group researcher is
basically what time he goes to bed if
you see at the end there there's three
dots starting at 8:00 p.m. going all the
way up to midnight and in those three
dots he's writing an article
the only time throughout the day that he
has had time to do any real work
anything productive he's on the
nighttime when he doesn't have any other
any other things to do so last little
bit of academic research really this is
a job posting that went up a couple of
weeks ago for a university in the UK and
I've highlighted some parts of that job
spec that required communication skills
interdisciplinary policy relevant the
focus of the research must be so this is
the university telling this prospective
lecturer and researcher you have to do
research in this particular subject you
must have a publishing track record
lecturing experience attracting research
funding knowledge and exchange these
guys you know they do have specialist
knowledge and they have spent a long
time learning their art but the vast
majority of their job is some form of
teaching or mentoring lots of admin lots
of sales an amazing amount of sales in
academia and finally just a little
little tiny bit of research I think that
this applies actually to software
engineers if you start thinking about
what you do on it
on a normal day you to have specialist
knowledge you spent years learning your
craft
you too are probably involved in some
sort of mentoring scheme and you too
have probably too many meetings that
you're he to minute yeah meetings that
you don't like and whether you like it
or not being part of the business you
know you also need to
part of this sales process and probably
to a lesser extent than an academic and
finally you do some delivery so the jobs
that an academic does and what you do
are actually very similar so going back
to this question of what is research
generally you could say that it's the
pursuit of knowledge to develop a new
understanding and then deliver or enact
upon that knowledge to to make something
better and on a day to day basis and
your software engineering life you
probably go to stack overflow quite a
lot and in the pursuit of knowledge you
are asking questions like why the
fuckity is HTML have a code a color
code called Chuck Norris like seriously
and then you find this out and you
develop a new understanding you sit
there with your head in your hands when
software engineers they think they're
funny not funny I don't think I know of
one software engineer that has become a
comedian so please don't be funny and
then we finally realized that Chuck
Norris really is a color and we really
can use it we need to enact how on your
new knowledge and we do that with our
old friend copy and paste so in a
nutshell you know that one minute thing
that you're doing every single day day
in day out that is a mini a mini
iteration of research so if we accept
that we are actually researchers not
just engineers can we do it better so
there was I'm going to talk now about
this guy called Francis Crick who was
British by a physicist he's most known
for his work on DNA and he discovered
DNA in about 1953 and he got a Nobel
Prize for it in 1962 he he found he did
this work with a guy called James Watson
and Maurice Wilkins
so James Watson is actually from Chicago
and was educated in Chicago so pick up
Chicago and the reason why I want to
talk about him is because it's
fascinating story he's thought of as one
of the most important most influential
scientists not just of like the last
century but of all time he's really up
there with a great but what I find so
interesting is that
his story is kind of so average it's so
normal and it and it's great to bring
these these people back down to it to
our level and understand where they are
so his story starts something like this
she was born in in 1916 and he went to
school he was lucky enough to be a
little bit wealthy so he was able to go
to school
and private school which wasn't which
wasn't common in those days and by the
time he left school he was expected to
go into university but he couldn't get
into university no University would have
him
it took him until he was 22 until he
managed to get bearing in mind that in
those days you're left school when you
were 14 it took him until he was 22 to
get into university he finally went to
university in London called the
university called UCL and he did an
undergraduate in physics he kind of it
was okay average student I think you got
a second class degree you know nothing
spectacular but you managed to persuade
someone to start on a PhD and this was
actually the beginning of a real
struggle for him because he really
didn't enjoy his PhD he didn't enjoy the
subject he thought it was very boring
and then world war ii broke out he did a
lot of work during world war ii and
gained a bit of a reputation for being a
good hard worker basically and finally
at the age of 32 he actually finished
his PhD so by the time he was 32 he
hadn't done anything basically he was
not known as a scientist nobody knew him
people thought it was quite annoying
actually they didn't like him at all
but then over the next preceding decades
he kind of refined his way of working
and learnt how to to to work to his
strengths in to his benefits and he you
know quite rightly changed the world
these are some quotes from his biography
he used to go home to his wife you know
I'm very often saying I found this new
amazing thing like you I'm sure you all
you you know you people go to your
spouse's to them they go home and this
new framework new JavaScript framework
it's amazing let's talk about your over
lunch and she said she was like you were
always saying things like that
you know so he obviously had far more
ideas that you could ever then he could
ever handle so much so that James Watson
actually soon began to worry about this
idea of DNA he didn't trust that it was
actually going to follow through
because they only had these ideas in
their head they couldn't find any
experimental proof that he existed they
thought it was all a pipe dream but they
took a step back and looked at all the
current research and found that they'd
actually made a lot of mistakes along
the way they needed to iterate on this
loop again they needed to repeat their
research and find that hypotheses and a
key thing that he said that he enjoyed
the Downs the bad pass as well as the
ups because it helped him in the future
to actually present this as a story the
ability to present your work as a story
really helps in their in the
dissemination of your your new
information whatever it may be John
Milton said the important thing is to be
there when the picture is painted and I
think that's true in software
engineering not just in life in general
but it takes a long time to learn from
your mistakes he said it was partly a
matter of luck partly good judgment
inspiration and persistent application
and that was the key thing about Francis
Crick there were two two main parts I
missed it there were two main things to
his character he was a big communicator
he would talk to everybody in everything
and a lot of people couldn't work with
him because he spoke too much but he
bounced ideas off of the people and it
needed other people in order to do his
work without these are the people
without these James Watson's and other
people throughout his life he wouldn't
have been able to do his work but the
key part was persistence he was insanely
productive he he could concentrate for
you know eight hours at a time he's
willpower was so strong that he could do
pretty much anything he put his mind to
so Francis Crick was was confident but
humble at the same time he was critical
but collaborative he was ambitious yet
realistic he was thorough but he also
knew when to stop so if you take lots of
their wrong slyd if you take all of the
ideas that he all of the qualities that
he had and munge them into a software
engineering perspective then when we're
doing research there's actually a whole
there's a huge list of qualities and
traits that we need to improve as
engineers to be better researchers I've
generated a little picture here and
expect you to read through all of them
but generally the fall into four camps
as technology business internal and
external qualities technologies
self-explanatory I'm not going to go
into that but it's key to always
remember the business in this because
the research that you're doing you're
doing it for a purpose and that purpose
is usually for a business if you have an
understanding of the business then that
makes your qualifications for doing
research much stronger but there's also
internal and external properties
qualities that you need to work on to be
a better researcher and the main one is
perseverance it is really really really
hard to to do some research thoroughly
and well without being persistent
obviously you have to be creative and
work with others really well and then
external qualities I've I've seen many
really great engineers that are
fantastic at doing their job but they
never externalize the work that they're
doing they never tell anyone about it
they never share their knowledge and I
think that's a key skill in becoming a
better engineer because if you try and
tell somebody else about what you're
doing I think it makes it more concrete
in your head I think everyone's
experience that so the idea of this list
we've got the the slides afterwards and
I might write a blog post about it but
the idea is that if you can take a good
look at that and score yourself on all
of these parts then you might find some
areas that you'd like to improve
yourself on and that will make you a
better researcher and that will make you
a better engineer okay so let's move
into some more practical steps now and I
call them research patterns and I'm kind
of this is a work in progress
I when I when I do my sort of day-to-day
engineering job I see I see it is more
of a process more than anything and the
way that I'm doing this development is
very it's very heavily influenced by
research so I'm thinking about this idea
of research driven development and it's
the the process of taking the scientific
discipline of research and applying it
to the jobs we do on a day to day basis
firstly to understand the science a
little bit more unfortunately I think
Brian Cantrell who did the keynote this
morning I bet he stole my slides so
there's a couple of a bit of duplication
here of regarding hypotheses and bugs
and stuff but I'll beat him up at the
end of the day because yeah plagiarism
and all that so a hypothesis is a
proposed explanation usually based on
prior experience and background
knowledge a hypothesis is something that
you generate every day every every
minute in your working life you are
expecting something to happen and when
you do something and that doesn't happen
is surprising and that's actually how
most science works they're generally
observing something else totally
unrelated and something unexpected
happens and hypothesis in order to
define what you're about to do the the
rest of the work is basically generating
results to support or do not support
that hypothesis the scientific method is
a formalized iterative loop of taking
hypothesis and then performing
observations or measurements and
creating the formulation and testing of
those of those ideas and then modifying
the hypothesis again at the end from
Wikipedia they they they show this chart
it's a little bit verbose but it's okay
it basically starts off at the top with
making observations once we've got an
observation then we think of interesting
questions and formulate hypotheses we
develop testable predictions to test
those hypotheses we gather data we've
run our software to test them
predictions and then we develop new
theories and keep repeating like that
and just to make that a little bit more
concrete I think it's worth looking at
our bug problem again so this is slide
38 at slide 38 and you could tell is an
engineer because number one has got an
app at the front of his name and the
twos got hair in the wrong place he's
got hair here instead of her here hair
should be here not not here and he has
he has a book this is his book he's got
this little tiny bit of code and when he
runs it it produces this output we've
got a simple flag at the top
if the flag is true then do some work
but we've set the flag to false and it's
still doing some work and as every
engineer knows it's probably his most
famous very famous phrase and so much so
that there's probably a lot of these in
your slack if actually should do it do
some some histroy and find some metrics
how many times the word what the
has been used in slack because he's like
what afar what the hell's going on so he
starts on this formal scientific method
loop he's thinking well what what
interesting questions I've had an
observation now the observation is my
code doesn't work and I need to figure
out some hypothesis some interesting
questions to ask about that now when you
write the start it's actually a little
bit hard to formulate that hypothesis so
you have to do a little bit of debugging
and that generally means that you have
like a vague hypothesis you know the
vague hypothesis in this sense is that
that bit in the middle doesn't really
work too well so I'm going to insert a
little print line just to help me out on
the debugging so I insert the print line
I rerun the code and now we get blank I
like what the hell's going on so I've
just added a print line it's not printed
the flag now seems to be working
hmm and then it's like all right
standing now it's ignored
ah Jesus so previously the flag was
ignored now the start the print line is
ignored it's because of that damn slash
on the end he's got that back slash it's
multi-line is commenting out that next
line so it's new hypothesis is that if I
take that slash out I generate another
testable prediction I repeat my tests
and then we can generate a general
theory and the general theory in this
case is I'm an idiot because I you know
made a typo on my code but you can see
that it's very happy about this and he's
doing it you know doing a better
software engineers actually have quite
strong biceps on them right because
they're doing this so often and like
even in this even in such a menial tasks
as like as bug fixing it's actually like
weirdly rewarding you know this process
of fixing a problem finding the problem
and understanding the problem
it's a real moment and that's why
engineering is quite enjoyable in
general there's lots of those moments so
this was this this type of process that
has got a formal name in the literature
it's called Eric experimental research
and it's performing controlled
experiments to verify hypothesis it
compares comparisons it has a comparison
between competing designs and it
requires a robust metrics about metric
in that case was does it work or does it
not work and depending on the nature of
the problem you may need lots of data so
we've all had like flaky tests that are
failing in like a CI system where they
only fail once every 100 times or
something you need a lot of repeats a
lot of data in order to test your
hypothesis and when we're doing the
research we need to develop this idea of
critical thinking as well we need to ask
the questions why am I doing this what
is it for Who am I doing for it's all
the words that you learn about in school
when you they give you the the
assignment of writing a story what where
when why and that critical thinking is
an important aspect here because that
that's what generates the new hypothesis
and the why is super important
especially in business because you need
to be able to justify this to other
people to your boss to your spouse why
on earth you doing this josh Greenman
part of this so we were in the u.s. I
thought bring some US related stuff in
it and he did a little test where he
would type why is insert state so and
then he would get the first hit from the
Google result the first autocorrect from
the Google and plotted it on the map and
you can see where are we now so we've
likewise Illinois so corrupt
come on guys seriously why is Wisconsin
so liberal yeah a bloody liberal ragtags
what's blur we've got some rather funny
ones in there why why is New Hampshire
so white good question good question
yeah that's a good good plot good good
look a good set of research they're very
fun but yeah more generally in industry
and in business generally you need to be
able to justify your research to your
boss and because we live in a capitalist
society always comes down and money can
you or should does your research make
money reduce costs or save time if you
can frame your research in such a way
then it's far more likely to get
accepted by everybody that's not always
true you can have not you know you can
there are other reasons why you might
want to do research but if you can
phrase it in such a way you've got a far
more you're far more likely to to get it
accepted and we're talking about
software research and development
specifically it doesn't necessarily
pertain to software itself so there's
another branch it's like experimental
research who's called action research
and action research focus is more on a
particular problem but it's not
necessarily a technical one it could be
a process it could be a people problem
and this this this starts to formulate
the research process into something or a
bit more familiar with so there's a
purpose the focus the relationship focus
of the research sorry the relations
between the things that you're trying to
research the method and the validation I
think that we can generalize that a
little bit more and this is basically
the the loop the the observe orient
decide act loop and when we're doing
research in a day to day basis or
whether we're doing a multi-year
research project it always forms a loop
like this we find a problem we
understand the problem we solve the
problem and then we'll review what we've
done
and each part of that loop is super
important and even more important is the
fact that it's iterative it keeps going
round and round and round you might find
that you know after you've found that
Chuck Norris is a color that might have
knock-on effects for the rest of your
sub system maybe you can replace all of
your colors with like crazy action names
instead of using normal HTML codes so
let's take a look at the bug example
again and try and fit that into that
framework normally which somebody finds
a bug it's usually a customer or a user
maybe it's yourself when you've been
doing some other code we need to
understand that bug so in this case this
is a this is a banking bug so we
definitely want to squash this because
we don't like bankers it's got a bowler
hat and a tie you can see that's why
it's a banker we understand that's
understanding the problem and then we
solve the problem usually with a hammer
brute-force just whack it until it works
and then crucial bit is the review at
the end we need to review the problem
because it might exist elsewhere there
might be other bugs there might be you
know similar bugs and similar systems or
during during the process of fixing the
bug you might have found another book
but to bring it back to reality a little
bit I think that one of the key the
coolest things about suffering
engineering in general is the scope for
research the amount of scope that doing
this job allows for research is
remarkable and you can think of probably
something that you're interested in I
think this is maybe quite a typical use
case for something like this is I'm
interested in learning a new JavaScript
framework or you know for an end
language or something like that if you'd
like to do that work that's great and
that's it's very fun and I enjoy doing
it myself but you need to you need to
spin what you're doing in such a way
then it makes sense for the business
otherwise you're not going to be able to
do it so rather than saying I want to
investigate Elm
you know maybe phrase it in a different
way I want to improve front-end
developer productivity and that suddenly
spins the question in a way that the
business can understand and it's far
more likely to be accepted
the key questions though is why why
would you do this how long would you how
long would it take how much is it going
to cost and you need to really start to
pin down some of the specifics about the
question you're setting there
so if said reduce the lead time on new
features but I mean what is the
definition of productive like how are we
going to measure productivity is it as
simple as like the number of new
features over time or is it something
more complex like the amount of time
people have spent on a particular
problem baselines are really important
so one of the critical tenants of doing
an experiment is this idea of being able
to having having something to compare it
with so this idea of a controlled
experiment where you you have a control
to the continues and your normal process
and then your new work that you can
compare against and if you can say at
the end that your methodology or your
language or whatever it is that you
found during your research is x times
more performant that's good if you can't
do that then you're not going to be
allowed to do research ever again
and then actually this is solving the
problem is it's kind of it's probably
it's not the simplest it's certainly
probably the the most fun part of the
process but it's it's a bit easier to do
because if you've asked the right
questions to begin with you generally
know exactly what you need to do so
solving it is actually probably one of
the simplest steps to be honest but then
once you've solved the problem you need
to review and the review in this case is
telling people about your results you
need to tell your bosses and your
managers how to save money you need to
tell the front-end that front end
engineers that reactors and Elmi is
good and based upon those actions if you
get punched in the face or if somebody
says you haven't tried X Y Zed you might
need to repeat this process again so the
final thing I want to talk about is
something that is is forming in my head
it's not completely it's not concrete at
the moment but I'll talk about it anyway
even in this conference in previous
conferences and books everywhere there's
been this idea of failing fast it's this
idea of being lean and when
you come across a failure make sure that
you fail early so that it doesn't cost
that much and I have a real problem with
that especially in engineering maybe
that works in business but I really am
not convinced that it works in
engineering and the reason is that
there's there's a like software
engineering is very seductive there's
almost like a siren quality to it like
you know when you get given a new task
or something the first thing that you
want to do is sit down on a computer and
start bashing it away the keyboard just
start writing code it's just it's so
alluring you don't sit back and think
about it and I think this applies to to
to development and research as well it's
very easy to stop at the wrong point
so rather than fail fast I I would
prefer to stop smart you know don't just
fail immediately because because you
feel like you're failing or somebody
says you're failing because that night
might not be the best choice there's
this idea that I have a flycam of
product perfection or perfection some
measure of perfection within your
business it could be it's basically a
rate but it could be like revenue per
year or number of features per week or
something like that and there is always
that some optimum where we could be
working out but I don't think we hardly
ever get there because if you if you
fail fast if you fail too fast you could
be quitting too early but you know the
flip side is if you keep hanging on and
you keep hanging on you could fail too
late so you know what is the goal of
this well the good the goal is like
throughout your career is to basically
do the best job you can and I feel like
that if you do that then it's satisfying
for you but it's also rewarding for the
business as well and if we can get to
this state where we're stopping at the
right time so we're not continuing on
products that are you know there's no
point developing more features but also
we're not stopping too early and missing
out on any potential gains and you'll
see that different projects over time
have a different potential as well so
this point where to stop it's actually
really really hard to define
but one of the things I'm most worried
about and the reason why I didn't like
this fell fast idea was because I think
engineers get bored very quickly they
get bored very very quickly and as soon
as they get bored they stop being
productive and they basically stop
working and they check out and go home
and that's something that everybody has
to be aware of and trying to avoid if
you can but sometimes it just does take
hard work to get things done persistence
it's a key quality and when I see
engineers - saying I'm bored I'm bored
on my particular project this is some
part of me that I don't like about it
but also this like the opposite and this
is this is most this is not an
engineering problem generally this is a
business problem and it's the the idea
of the sunk cost fallacy where you put
so much effort into a product that you
really don't want to throw it away but
you have to throw it away because no
matter what you do no matter what you do
from now on it's not effective you're
not improving the product in any way so
and this is the problem with the Vega
T's oh sorry about that
bit of a V issue but the the problem is
that I was wishing I could start to
formulate some real metrics here
and how do you measure when is the best
time to stop and I don't know what they
are because it's really vague when I've
been on projects that are starting to
sort of slow down and become a little
bit stale there's like lots of different
metrics there's like enjoyment factor
that is it enjoyable anymore
there's how much interest you getting
from the business do they care about
what you're doing there's other people
people getting bored in their job
communication how much communication is
going on between the team and they
talking to each other anymore and
they're discussing problems and future
ideas and yeah I wish I could that's not
the best I can do persist until we have
that sinking feeling I think it's quite
intuitive at the moment in time but
maybe with a bit more work and maybe
formalize that a little bit but you have
this sinking feeling that the project is
stalling
yeah stalling is a good word you're kind
of gliding along and you starting to
stall and maybe that is the perfect time
time to break
okay I think that's about it for me so
thank you very much check out the
website and talk to me more if you have
any interesting philosophical ideas
about engineering and research thanks a
lot all right so I think we have time
for a couple questions so please stick
around if you would like to hear the
answer
I spoke too fast all right that's good a
lot of sessions don't have time for that
so it's good to have time for some
questions here so one I have here it
says so scientific hypothesis involves
testing the null hypothesis and
rejecting them rather than just
supporting the hypothesis that you have
how do you how does that fit in to know
right so the idea is that if you're
trying to prove your own hypothesis
you're you're biased to trying to prove
that hypothesis and obviously if you're
set out to you know find a new
JavaScript framework the offerin end
developers you could probably find some
quite artificial reasons of why it's
better you might say it's prettier or
you know produce better UIs or something
so yeah the way that they tackle that is
they they try and evaluate the null
hypothesis which is like be the opposite
of that they basically try and come up
with ways to disprove your theory but
then make sure that that is not correct
so it's a bit of a double negative if
you if you understand that so yeah it's
the idea of trying to prove your theory
by proving that all of the alternative
theories are wrong and that's the
scientific and best way of doing it but
unfortunately that would require you to
evaluate every single JavaScript
framework and given the time restraints
that you have that might not be feasible
so yeah there's definitely a trade-off
that you have to do okay then I have
another question here what is one thing
to take away from this session should I
do research and prove my skill or apply
them and repeat whoa one thing I I think
the one thing that you should take away
is the idea of content
improvement all of the all of the greats
were prolific readers him it might not
you know might not come as a surprise
they were prolific readers and experts
and not in only one field they were
experts in many field and they did that
by continuously improving themselves so
irrespective of whether you think your
researcher or an engineer just the the
idea of continuously reading and
improving all of these soft qualities
that are maybe not related to technology
at all will make you better people and
better engineers have one more question
in here who drew the fantastic pictures
you have on your slide I did I think
you'll probably tell did you like them
yeah probably not
so that's all the questions I have for
now there's still a bit of time left
over so if you have any more questions
you can also just raise your hand we can
get to them or you can just come up to
the stage and talk to Phil I'm sure
he'll be happy to answer any questions
other than that feel free to head out
and enjoy the next break see you back in
here for the next session hopefully
thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
