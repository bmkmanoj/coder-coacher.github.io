to rape the talk and give me feedback
not on this brilliant technical start
when my button doesn't work anymore but
did anyone see the previous talk on the
microservices stuff and go so my
colleague who's sitting out there Karl's
got one of those cards we went around
Copenhagen on one of the e-bikes has
anyone been on an e-bike yeah I really
recommend yeah it's really cool isn't it
I mean it's like it weighs a ton but
it's got an electric motor in it and
it's got a little screen with sat-nav on
it and we typed in and we docked our
card part of credit card numbers in and
it came up at the end of the ride that's
50 deutsche crown at Danish kroner and I
was like what what's what's that in in
pounds because who knows you know pounds
crashing as the day goes by
and of course Karl's got the little app
and he just pulls out his phone in a gay
so it's five pounds 84 so that was
pretty impressive so I'm gonna go and
hunt down one of those cards say as I
say I'm you know I'm a really keen
cyclist and I was really lucky as all
right for this company which is a
consultancy but I got to cycle all over
London going to various clients telling
them how to do good software development
and that was that was really good sorry
I worked for six years just doing
consultancy dealing with lots of
different companies not just in London
in various places but now I work as the
head of technology and I'm responsible
for all of our internal systems so you
know that's basically what we use to run
thought works as a consultancy and when
I started three years ago thought Works
had a lip tech ops I had a little bit of
a reputation of what's called the
cobblers children and so this is
apparently this is a psychological
condition if you if you go to any of
these kind of pop psychology websites so
it must be a real one because I've seen
it on a pop psychology website and it
basically means that any you know kind
of organisation that's
now something as a business whether
that's a consultancy or a marketing
company like the cobbler who makes shoes
they tend to rather neglect their own
children you know their internal things
so while we were going around telling
companies how to write amazing brilliant
software because that's what you pay us
for and how to do continuous delivery
and how to do micro services and how to
do all this wonderful stuff inside it
was a bit of a different picture we had
what we called a stovepipe Enterprise
and so basically what was happening is
we had a very very tiny IT department
run mainly on latest notes anyone still
have to suffer Lotus Notes are you poor
people and what would happen is the
business as you know people like to
refer to it would go out and make
decisions and they were going buy stuff
whatever it was and then they and then
they would say here you go tech ops
we've gone out and we've bought this
solution and and now we want you to
installed and run it and that's pretty
much where we get engaged in the vendor
lifecycle so what we had was lots of
solutions that solved a very specific
problem with no real integration
strategy which was really interesting to
me as I kind of came in to tech ops
because that's what I'd been spending
the last six years going out to clients
to do so there I am it's like this is
interesting I've been going around to
clients for six years who've been really
badly integrating software and we've
been going in as thought workers going
soft you're terrible it's really easy
you just need to do this this this this
but when we were left to write our own
software we did exactly the same as what
we told the clients to do we also had
this great what I call mic drop
development which made the situation a
little bit worse so I call it my drop
development because basically what would
happen is is we'd get a team together to
solve a particular problem maybe an
integration problem or to write a
much-needed app and the team would come
in they would develop the app and then
they'd drop the mic
we're done it's in production by and
then the ops team would be left to look
after that mic and you know keep it
running so you know not not a great
pattern to have to make it worth we're
all over the world I mean this is our
current count 40 offices in 14 countries
it was probably a bit less three years
ago but this is what it is 4,000
employees about a hundred of 50 of those
in tech ops and so these my crop
development teams would spring up
basically where we had a few people
spare so might be in China because
there's been a graduate program and
we've just hired a load of graduates in
China and they're sitting around not
staffed at the moment so we think hey we
got a good idea why don't you why don't
you fix this this problem and develop
this this system over here and then the
next week it might be in India or it
might be in the UK or Chicago so there
wasn't really a strategy there it was
just wherever we could find people so
again that that makes the situation
worse so we had this kind of thing where
what we ended up with was the number of
permanent teams with these disappearing
and reappearing project teams but we
still needed it stuff to be supported so
the permanent teams ended up kind of
structured around but so we ended up
with vendor teams because the vendors
always stay around so if we're using
Salesforce someone's got to look after
Salesforce so you have a little team of
people specialists in Salesforce ended
up with an ops team because we got a
server farm and they've got to look
after all the servers and we ended up
with a DBA team because you know most of
the solutions run on Oracle and if
you're going to run Oracle you need a
DBA team right so add all of this
together and this was our architecture
now don't try and look at it it will
make you feel a bit ill it made me feel
a bit ill but the important things to
note is any of these colors is an
important two main concepts such as an
employee and what we did was smeared it
across our architecture as much as
possible
to make it much better we thought we'd
do a lot of direct database access you
know just to help get that data to
travel around so that's what we did we
thought we create like a nice monolithic
database in the middle to help this
because we thought we could solve it
that way and we called that the
middleware database to send you know a
chill through your spine and middleware
database so a monolithic middleware
database and just stuff everywhere no
systems of record a total mess say this
guy Conway's law if I'm sure you've
heard him talk about people keep
mentioning but if you look at Conway's
law and you look at that diagram go back
to that diagram and it's no surprise we
ended up with what we've got
so I distributed all over the world
temporary teams that pop up and you know
actually our architecture looks like
that you know it doesn't look like a
well for our long-running architecture
but there's another law that I think is
important which is Fairmont's principle
of least time so I I like this because
we always liked physics analogies don't
we in in software development because if
we can get it to a physics analogy it
must be true like Kelvin earlier used
the one about you know like the Jupiter
and the gravitational pull so this is
one of my favorites which is basically
you know the path between the least the
shortest path principle basically light
takes the shortest path so if you tape
that and this and Conway's principle
basically you get any feature will find
the development team that can implement
it in the least time so the shortest
path and that basically means you get a
lot of monoliths so what was happening
was is because we've got a team a DB a
team that is permanent and they're the
ones that can respond quicker because
they've got their hands on all the data
and we've got maybe a bit of a
development team over here well you know
what was going to happen if you want a
new feature
and you want to do something whether DBA
team are going to do the integration
because they are the one with the
permanent team and if you've got a bit
of a development team over here and you
want to do something in the UI well that
development team motor they is going to
do it so you end up creating these
monoliths just through these two
principles when you put Conway and least
time together so we were in our things
weren't good and so our CIO Dave Walley
said what do we tell our clients to do
and so we went back to our kind of you
know if it works
Martin Fowler famous for agile that's
what we do so we went back to our core
principles now I've chosen XP here cuz I
like XP that's my call right that was my
first agile book but we could choose any
scrum maybe but there was this kind of
principle of cross-functional teams that
was really critical and it was really I
think a very XP idea so we went back to
this and we said you know
cross-functional teams are really
important that's what we should be doing
we shouldn't have these kind of project
teams that are just springing up so many
family will want permanent
self-organized cross-functional teams
now there's two parts of
cross-functional team that I love that I
really really want to focus on and
that's I won't told these themes
throughout the rest of this talk and the
first one is that they're responsible
for their own success and you know
yesterday we had done kind of talking
about this when agile first came out and
the agile manifesto and this was a
really important change you know that a
team is responsible end-to-end for their
own success and that meant that they
could talk to the business they could
you know execute everything that it
wasn't like this kind of siloed
horizontal silos it was vertical and
then came the next bit which was all the
experts
is necessary to do so so you would have
testing you would have infrastructure in
there and and actually the first XP
teams were probably quite dev sector
Akande we didn't maybe infrastructure
came a bit later but it was more about
that business relationship but over time
we started putting more and more kind of
things into dev teams so they're
becoming you know reaching this ideal of
being all the expertise necessary to to
reach their own success and then we had
this guy who became the he was the den
head of technology when I joined so he
was kind of my boss I put boss in
inverted commas not because you know he
was like a WoW or anything you know but
because we have meant to be non
hierarchical so it was as close to a
boss as I had and at the time three
years ago he was writing the micro
services book so had quite a big
influence on what we're doing and we
were trading lots of ideas about micro
services and stuff so we got this idea
across functional teams and then all
Microsoft's this seemed to fit Said's so
let's try a bit of that so what did we
do we did the inverse Conway maneuver so
we used these two concepts to do the
inverse Conway Ramin maneuver and we're
a consultancy so you know basically you
can break a consultancy down into three
capabilities so going back to kind of
capability modeling which is rather than
looking at the things you you know like
the physical staff have a look at the
things the characteristics of your
business so if you look at oaken's not
any consultancy they all tend to have
three core capabilities which is sales
sell stuff sell people essentially
staffing staff people in the projects
that they've sold and the people
themselves which they're gonna sell
although we prefer to say people's time
because then it sounds a little bit less
like you're in slavery but so the other
thing we did when we did this reverse
Conway maneuver which is really
important is we made these cross fun
um and we made them cross-functional
though across everything so these teams
do everything it was support you know
you build it you run it you support it
vendor management so they got look after
their vendors they got do their own
stakeholder management their change
management they've got a look after
their infrastructure they're responsible
for their budgets they're responsible
for their travel they're responsible for
their staffing these teams are
responsible for everything from end to
end so they have product owners they
have business owners and they are
aligned with the business so there is a
head of sales there is a head of
staffing etc and those are their owner
and they work those business people and
the product owner worked together in a
team to define the direction for IT in
within their capability and this was a
massive change and it was really it was
really good and and that had a big
effect on how we started to approach
problems so before we've got you know
this is an example this is true this is
what we actually had we had the staffing
monolith the the system was called
jigsaw and going back to that firmance
principle what would happen is is any
feature that needed to be implemented
would get put in the staffing system it
started out as a staffing system
ironically it started out as a starting
system that was a rewrite of a system
before it which had become a giant
monolith that had become unwieldy so it
got separated out and then we separated
it out rewrote it as a staffing system
and then just started that cycle again
because it was the only development team
that could actually do anything so I
ended up with everything in it it ended
up with teams in it it ended up with
leave in it which you know doesn't
really have much to do with staffing
ended up with rates in it it was crazy
it was basically we got you know someone
would say I really need to do this
custom
thing it's really important I will put
it in jigsaw and it didn't matter
whether it was relevant to jigsaw or not
it mattered that the business needed to
execute this piece of functionality so
now we've changed this conversation so
now the conversation isn't can jigsaw
implemented the fastest or which team
can implement it the fastest it was
which business owner wants to own this
functionality which isn't which
capability team wants to own this
functionality and you changed that so
now new piece of functionality comes up
we're saying staffing is saying no this
doesn't belong in jigsaw because this
has got nothing to do with staffing it's
to do with people so we're having a
really really interesting discussion
about this this this this last couple of
weeks which is about people data you
know you've got certain characteristics
about people data a lot of people are
getting that data like name and stuff
like that and what office there is that
they work in and they're getting that
from the staffing system but it's not
really staffing information it's people
information so now we're having this
conversation which is actually you know
this isn't in this bounded context you
know this staff needs to live over there
in the people stuff and if anyone's
coming to staffing we need to stop them
we need to get them back to the system
of record and that and the staffing team
won't rid of that information and the
people team wants to own that
information so we're changing the
dynamic of that conversation by doing
this so how do how do Micra services
help in this well first if we can
identify these areas that are in the
monolith that kind of you know don't
really belong there the staffing system
can take that
so they've inherited this stuff you know
so they can have a look and they're like
leave doesn't make sense we don't think
leave belongs and staffing and we don't
really think rates belong in staffing
either you know they should they should
move somewhere else and and what we can
do is we can reflect that
and we can move leave to people and we
can move rates to sales now we're
microservices help here is that rather
than you know you've got now a kind of a
wide range of options of how you deliver
that whereas before you've just got mana
left and so you know we can either say
staffing system says well I'll tell you
what we've got later code here I know
it's Ruby on Rails and it's five years
old but what we do is we'll cut it out
we'll put it in a new repo and here we
go people team that's all the leaf stuff
it's all yours
all the people team can saved you know
what your implementation it's a really
bit sucky in a bit buggy we'll just
build something new and we rewrite it
from scratch or in one case one of the
services that we made we rewrote it from
scratch and and we rewrote it as a JSON
file it was that simple I think it's the
smallest service we had the service was
basically what is the hierarchy of the
company which is where offices relate to
countries we had a whole database in
Oracle with the Ruby on Rails front-end
a full crud up a full crud app just to
say what offices were in it what country
a fact that doesn't really change much
so you know so we could do that and we
change that to a JSON file stuck it on
s3 and we said there you go
put API gateway in front fit job done
the smallest micro service we have no
code so this is this is really great
this was fantastic except the good the
good story kind of you know ends there a
little bit because this caused a lot of
problems as well now these weren't these
were kind of problems that in a
centralized system were really easy to
solve and micro services actually
aggravate this or they introduced new
problems so yes the world is much better
the world was much much better within
our bounded context everything was going
much better
business people were much happier but as
soon as we started crossing any lines
between those bounded context things got
messy so this is we got make it up
fatigue this is one this is true
basically if anyone wanted to do off on
their api's they all decided a different
way of doing it so staffing thought I'll
go for an API you know a key pair
implementation over a basic you know
header people team just went oh well you
know what just sent you user name and
password of a system account over over
basic off because you know that's what
we've used and sales team were being a
little bit more you know let's use
oauth2 that's the new thing so we had no
kind of strategy there a kind of a I'm
going to say the word global though
Kelvin obviously say don't see the well
global and he gets scared I'm but we had
no strategy are a kind of global level
which meant that basically if you were
asked any of those teams now you've got
an M plus one problem so rather than
having to deal with one authentication
sit game to talk to all your micro
services inside your sales you've now
got you know your own ones plus
everybody else is to deal with so which
makes your code quite complicated and
you know is introducing a lot of
complexity and of course worse is this
it's waste right it's like food waste
it's the the moral it's horrible right
you know food waste has that moral thing
with it and so does wasting developers
time and this was entering Kelvin was
talking about economies of scale and how
we don't get economies of scale in
software development and but what we're
really really good at in software
development is creating waste and that's
what keeps your CIO up at night and
that's what makes managers you know
development managers and things come up
with really annoying rules and
architects really annoying wolves
because they're worrying about this
stuff they're really they're really
worrying that you know the teams are
doing the same thing and they're making
loads of waste
and what they want to do is reduce waste
make all everyone more efficient and of
course what you see is when we move to
this micro service Wow look at all this
waste everyone's repeating and solving
the exact same problem over and over
again so a logging is a great example
you know how many elk stacks can can can
your company create and let's think
about that how long does it create to
kind of build or announce that maybe you
know you've got a dev pair on that maybe
three or four weeks they get their elk
stack up and running three or four weeks
you know they've done it really well
though they've you know Phoenix it's on
AWS it's in a mutable server it's you
know really good else back and then
they've got to maintain it and then
every now and again they've got upgrade
it and then sometimes there's a bug and
sometimes it falls down and over about a
year or so of this kind of team which
has got six dev pairs you probably spent
a good month and a half two months just
on your Elks back which isn't really
where you want to spend your money if
you're repeating that across every
single development team in your
organization that that is food waste
right it's it's morally bad now the
other problem we ran into is specialisms
so I don't know if anyone went to the
talk yesterday morning I think it's
Diego was it
Diego's talk about deep learning right
within about five slides I was I was
lost I was this is seriously hard and as
we're moving through the decades of
software development life is getting
much much more complicated and we can't
all have someone like that in every
single team so we want cross-functional
teams we want them to be responsible for
their own success and all the expertise
required to do so but we can't have
someone with intimate knowledge of all
of those deep learning algorithms inside
every single one of our teams we can't
have someone with intimate and
College of data analytics inside or
statistics inside all of our teams or
infrastructure or security etc etc iOS
development Android development it's
going on and on and on they're just
adding more and more stuff for us to
learn it's crazy so how do we do that
you know how do we cope with this and
now actually infrastructure is a really
good point this was one of the things I
observed in our teams and that was that
we kind of put infrastructure and that's
pretty much you know who has a
development team that is responsible for
their own infrastructure here so a fair
few so this is kind of becoming a bit of
a mainstream idea right now we've got
ansible we just give the infrastructure
to the developers and we've got this
idea of cross-functional teams so the
developers are responsible for for
infrastructure so this is one of our you
know it's quite a big Micra service it's
quite a heavily active Micra service so
it had about a thousand commits in a
year and this was quite typical so I
looked and I did the stats on this this
is quite typical out of those 1,000
commits in a year on that micro service
for just four commits were on
infrastructure that in the ansible
directory right if I can make it move
come on move so three were to add
environment variables so this is real
heavy lifting now right adding an
environment variable and the other one
was to change the log format so in one
year this is all that changed on that
micro service at an infra level and
we're saying we've got to have
infrastructure specialism in every team
so what's the result of this when we say
this so this is a true story and this is
about six months ago I'm sitting in the
in the Manchester office where the
digital team are and they are
responsible for our website and for a
bow or I'd say maybe nine days they've
been suffer
from an issue to do with SSH key they
couldn't get an SSH key to authenticate
because Rackspace had changed the way
their SSH key worked for doing the
deployment so they couldn't deploy
luckily I'm sitting there and I'm
listening and then I'm thinking all this
bitrate so I start talking to them and
there's all this stuffing go going on
all this low-level stuff in go going on
and we're trying to debug the go code
cuz that's where we're happy right
developers we can debug the go code and
there's a guy on the beach who's who's
an ops guy and he's and he overhears as
well and he kind of goes over and he
gets out go and he goes to command
terminal type Singh a load of open SSL
stuff you know I don't know what he
typed it
I mean I'll write yeah it's you know is
this RSA key has this thing they've
changed it to this thing like that in
seconds his specialist knowledge solved
this problem that this team was never
gonna solve right it takes in them seven
nine days to solve it
so when we kind of moved these
specialists responsibilities into the
teams what we lost was that specialist
knowledge because when you have those
horizontal teams what's really good is
you got an ops guy who spends all of his
day you know shushing so he really knows
what's going on whereas when you go back
and you put that in the development
teams they're going to touch it four
times in a year and it's not going to be
that complicated what they're gonna
touch so the problem is is solving this
you don't want to fall back on those bad
patterns of creating these horizontal
teams we don't want to go back to an ops
team that is responsible for all the
servers and giving all that control to
centralization but as you know yesterday
one that I can't remember is there
Dondre s talk he was saying you know
it's much more complicated than
decentralized versus centralized when he
was talking about the drones and stuff
it's much more complicated than that
they are these lines but
queen and i think this is a great
example of there these are lines between
centralizing something and d
centralizing something and we really
wanted to avoid these these silos so we
looked at different ways of doing it so
the first one which everyone jumps to is
enforcement right this is okay I'm your
InfoSec guy or I'm your in for a guy you
go and write some code I'll do a code
review so what happens is the day before
you're going to production you put it in
front of the the infra guy and he he
just wants to go home
you know he's planned his weekend out he
looks at it and he goes I'm really sorry
you can't put this into production it's
got it's got this problem with this
problem with it and and then and then
the developer just goes don't look but I
know it's not meeting your standards and
you would have written better code and
everything and and if it's the security
a guy you like I know it opens a great
big security hole but come on I've got
both this in production tomorrow where
everyone's on my back so what happens
with the enforcement role is in the end
InfoSec or instead on your heads beer
nothing to do with me and then you just
get ignored and you end up with bad
security everywhere because delivery
pressures always win so you try the
consultancy model so we move to the
consultancy model and this was much
better this worked much much better so
this is the model where early on in the
life cycle the team reaches out to one
of these specialists and says you know
we're gonna we're going to be putting
this into production in you know we're
just writing the stories now we're just
writing the stories and it's going to go
into production in three months what
should we be considering from a security
angle about these stories so and then
and then the guy goes well this is a web
you are you know if you if you've gone
through I was top ten no no I haven't
gone through I was saying we're looking
at your app I think you need to go
through this one this one you know think
about cross-site scripting think about
this and the developers they not yeah
yeah that's really because I'll go and
read on that and then the day before
production you're going out to
production the InfoSec guy kind of sends
a nice friendly
search over slack or whatever and says
how did you get on with that I lost top
ten things oh yes I forgot about that
delivery pressures so the consultancy
model you know has its problems as well
so the partnership model so this one
works even better this is we take what
works from the consultancy model and we
try a partnership model and that is your
specialist from your you know your team
works with the cross-functional team and
they pair with them sit on the keyboard
pair with them walk through it and this
can be really really successful it can
sometimes fail sometimes people pay a
little bit of lip service to the person
that pairs it's a bit like I don't know
if anyone's seen that sketch you know
where someone does the washing up I'll
teach you to do the washing up and they
do the washing up and they go I didn't
quite get that show me again and then
they do the washing up and they go I
didn't get that show me again until all
the plates are done so you can have that
and it does happen but but sometimes it
is really successful and the team but
one there's two key problems with
partnership model is one you've got
resource constraints you know if you've
got one InfoSec specialist across ten
teams they all need that person at the
same time that's a really stressed
individual and the second thing is it
tends to be very based on relationships
like all good partnerships they're based
on relationships but you know we had a
case where we had a really good
partnership between two individuals and
they both move teams so great that was
great why that partnership lasted now
they've moved teams that's gone
everything they learnt went with them so
what's the solution
so
this if you go back to mid Victorian
nearer 19th century mid 19th century if
you wanted to take a photo if you wanted
to be a photographer that this this is
what you had to do and this is so
complicated but I can't even pronounce
it and and that's how you pronounce it
and I can't even read how you pronounce
it so that's how hard it is that's how
specialist it was well nowadays who can
take a photo you know like back then you
really needed a specialist just to take
a photo now we all walk around and I
tell you you know we're swamped with
photos my my four year old takes photos
everyone takes photos in fact I may
almost of the opinion that I don't need
to take photos anymore because someone
else would have taken a hundred photos
of where I am for me so what we've
managed to do over admittedly 150 years
is take a process that was incredibly
complicated in required specialist
knowledge but turn that into something
so simple and commoditize it so that
anyone can do it now the conversations
changing again right we're all expert
photographers I mean hands up who thinks
they're a good photographer in the room
you know see there's quite a few of us
and we're techies I think there are more
people who do photography and techie
than anywhere else there's always
someone bombarding me with their flickr
so what does this look like how do we
achieve this you know it sounds really
simple we just taken an incredibly
complicated process like making a camera
and turn it into a mobile well this guy
he got it right ten years ago he had got
his mandate out which basically said
everyone should create an API now
there's something grip that we all often
miss about this story so how many people
here use AWS in some form or another
right okay now keep your hands up if you
use AWS to do book store stuff
Oh nobody so but his business is a
bookstore right but what he solved is
this idea that there's this incredibly
complex horizontal specialized stuff
happening in his business which was
running a bookstore
but if he could somehow commoditize and
make that really simple and separate
that ownership from that control which
was you know goes back to that anecdote
that was that was yesterday that Scott
told where that guy went oh you're using
si SSDs and he said I don't care I rent
them you know when you've got to that
point you've you've solved this problem
and and besos got it right he understood
that I don't think it was deliberate we
can give him credit for it but what
emerged was the biggest server farm in
the world so what's that look like well
it's a return to Conway basically so
Conway let's think of the organization
we want and then that structure our
business around that so I call this the
fabric tech so that is if this isn't a
horizontal team again but it's a
horizontal capability and that fabric
tech has all those horrible jobs that
your team finds difficult API management
build source security all of that and
you put it in there and you try and
remove it from the teams now that
doesn't mean that the team's lose
everything they still have their own
capability Tech so there may be things
about their kind of vertical that are
special to them but your rib trying to
remove some of that stuff and how do you
do that you know like where you form
teams that look like this they just look
like the teams that we had
cross-functional teams with some
services with product owners with the
specialists in with the vendor
management in with the support in but
the difference is is rather than them in
the old centralized model being kind of
obsessed with having the control and the
ownership is there kind of giving up
that that
control par and they're just responsible
for the ownership so so you know these
are this is an actual example of we did
kind of look at our services and what we
needed this is quite high level and we
looked at what ones we had and who owns
them so this is our kind of fabric so
you've got things in there like logging
and monitoring synthetic monitoring user
analytics API is all said or then' and
the idea is now rather than kind of
having a centralized version of this
which is you know you do partnership or
whatever where it's like where these
teams provide the services to enable you
to the capability teams to accomplish
these things without having deep
specialist knowledge of them a really
really good example which was in Sam's
talk was let's encrypt I think that's a
great example of the sort of thing a
cross-functional team concern one of
these teams can solve for you now
generally this doesn't mean that you
build everything yourself it might be
that you use AWS if you're an
infrastructure team but that team will
be responsible for the vendor management
of that stuff will be responsible for
ensuring that you get up and running in
it you know hopefully it's put some
api's in front so you can you know you
just call an API and say create me an
AWS account and it's set up all the
billing and all the integration with
your your authorization systems and all
of that for you you know that's all done
you're not worrying about all of that
stuff is a cross-functional team same
with things like SSL you want SSL you
don't want to you know I I'm remembering
the times when I put a calendar notice
to say that my SSL certificate was going
to run out and then I'd forget how the
hell I did this convoluted process oh my
god I hope I'm I can't go on holiday the
SSL certificate and I'm the only one in
the team you know now we don't have that
we've we've got let's encrypt and so
that's for this team this fabric team to
kind of go we want to solve this problem
we either look to the market to solve it
or we build something else Oh
so this isn't gonna happen like
overnight right this is some of these
problems are really easy and some of
these problems really hard so there
isn't there is a maturity here and so
this is kind of like Wardley I don't
know if anyone's in the world diagram he
they talked about mapping this but they
talked about these four stages Genesis
custom build product and kind of
commodity or platform so inside an
organization I think this works like
this Genesis it's patterns generally a
custom build is you know something
solution specific that you've built
inside your team wrote the product
you've probably extracted a library or
framework and you know for the platform
it will be a real service so you know as
my example we could say patterns
continuous integration at some point was
a pattern you know there if you read
some of Martin Fowler stuff he'll talk
about the teams within that he worked on
that started talking about this and then
you know someone solutions specific they
came up the idea the pattern this sounds
like a good idea so they built a build
survive very specifically to test out
their theory on one or two or three
projects and after a while they did
cruise control which was the first CI
server and then you know that's great
you've got a product and everyone
downloads it and maintains it and looks
after it sells but eventually you get to
this you get a snap I have to say you
know Snap is the thought works version
of Jenkins CI so Jenkins here where it's
a hosted solution and you're not doing
any you know you're not looking after
anything it just works you got the AWS
version and so what that tends to look
like is I and the stuff that's in your
Genesis and your custom build stuff is
going to be your capability Tech where
your vertical teams are actually
probably doing something quite
experimental they're in a Genesis stage
they're learning about it let's say
they're thinking about events or saying
or something
or micro-services for that matter or
Phoenix service or whatever you know
they're playing with some patterns and
they're implementing them but then as
you move across what you want to do is
you want to start picking that stuff up
from your team so you want to start
moving it from the product to platform
lifecycle so hopefully you can skip
product because that would be great and
just move to services but that doesn't
always happen because sometimes it's a
bit more complicated than that but you
want that kind of handover where you say
let's get this out of the capability
teams let's move it to the fabric team
and let's make this of this part of our
fabric now some companies have different
ways of looking at this and this is this
balance between autumn eyes autonomy and
standardization so a while ago Etsy
caused a big storm in the software world
with a talk called why it's important to
have boring software or something like
that I don't know if anyone read that it
was a blog place whereas Etsy say you
know what you've got a stack this is the
language this is the stack this is what
you're going to use that's it whereas on
the other side people are more flexible
so in thought words were much more
flexible the fact we're distributed is a
reason for that if everyone was in the
same room and they weren't thought
workers because they have a lot of
opinions thought workers if everyone was
in the same room and they weren't for
workers I might be able to as head of
technology impose a tech stack on
everyone but actually we want that
flexibility so there's not a right or
wrong ways do you want the stability do
you want innovation you know how you
balance that up where are you on your
maturity curve and then you know with
great power these autonomous teams does
become the responsibility they have to
contribute back to the fabric so it's
kind of finish off you know remove the
Yaak from the teams to do that you need
to preserve the autonomy by preserving
control so they're responsible for their
own success
but you need to provide specialism via
you know micro services to keep all the
expertise necessary and that's it so
thank you and please as it says remember
to rate the session and there's one
question thinking on machine learning or
even UX design how can we commoditize
domain expert knowledge
what's the fabric check feeling for
machine learning or UX where this isn't
a clear product version version of
expertise so I think machine learning is
a really interesting one
and hopefully someone else will solve it
for us it's basically my where my bet is
going so for example it looks like
Google and Amazon and everyone are
getting in on this already and so
they're coming up with some good machine
learning stuff obviously if you can't do
that it come it becomes a constraint in
your business because you do have that
problem where you can't put the
specialists everywhere so UX is
different because UX is I think is
probably one of those cross functional
roles that does need to be in every team
because it is integral right like
building code is for developers UX is
for creating usable systems so I think
UX is a special ism that does belong in
a cross-functional team to a degree
that's that's my cop out there are there
any other questions someone okay that's
it thank you Peter
yes thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
