starting another business and you know
previously i have given a talk that some
of you may have heard about mistakes i
made last time i started and ran a
business i think there were some useful
lessons learned and some useful content
and that talk but this talks a little
bit more constructive in tomm terms of
talking about some of the things that
i'm actually going to do in the process
of starting a new business so
essentially we'll talk about you know
the who of creating a business what it
will be why you might want to start a
business and most importantly how so a
little little bit about me I you may
think of me as the person who originally
created spring but in fact I'm a
musicologist originally so I did a
thesis on piano music in Paris under the
July monarchy from 1832 1848 so the
photograph is there to indicate the fact
that I I think i can say i probably
almost certainly know more about Chopin
than anyone in the audience I discovered
that at University really I had two
loves I love music and I loved
programming and the order kind of
changed from time to time but I rapidly
realized that the ordering of doing
music as a career or particularly
academic musicology as a career and
computer programming as a hobby was
probably not the right ordering so I
decided that I would ray order and then
of course what happened was that I
literally didn't touch the piano for 12
years so the reordering became very very
extreme but so I gradually got into
being a developer and architect in C C++
and then Java actually from a fairly
early stage that gave me the the I came
to the conclusion that java at least for
that time was a pretty good
language but that Java EE or j2ee as it
was at that point was really pretty foul
and vile and suboptimal so that was the
genesis of spring trying to deal with
that complexity that of course led to
interface 21 which became spring sauce
which became part of VMware which became
part of pivotal so you know that really
led to me being on a business track by
the way I've because I know a lot of
people associate spring with XML and
beans I've just put that there to mess
with you because in case you haven't
checked lately spring really hasn't
required any XML for about five years
really beyond the stuff that you know
comes from things like web eczema so
what do I do now well after them where
bought spring sauce I was an executive
at VMware I was a senior vice president
for about two years I have to say
although there were some great people at
that company and they have some amazing
technology it was not a tremendously
positive experience because you know i
discovered that i really am an
entrepreneur rather than someone who can
be happy it in as an executive at a
large company so without realization in
mind since i left vmware i've been
involved in startups through a number of
boards and also various other
investments so I'm board member and
chair at neo4j the graph database
company I am a board member in the first
outside investor in elastic which of
course is the company behind
elasticsearch logstash and Cabana I'm
also a board member typesafe meteor and
hazel cast this has been very
interesting in terms of getting a
different perspective on you know the
challenges triumphs and dangers of the
startup world I think I've learnt more
about open source business about
financing rounds and actually I've got
financing twice they're having a now
financing is actually quite important in
in this startup startup world
so that's who I am the question of like
what my new company will do well I've
read the code of conduct and I'm not
quite sure what I can say here because
frankly I my first the first thing that
came into my mind is if I tell you I
need to kill you but I'm not sure that
the code of conduct is entirely
consistent with threatening to kill the
audience so I thought I'd get out of
that by building on the James Bond theme
and so you know this this currently is a
secret mission so I'm not going to be
talking at all about what my new company
will do and I'm certainly not going to
be trying to plug anything that it will
eventually do what I'm going to talk
about is how I'm going about it with the
lessons that I've learned and how
hopefully that can be beneficial to
anyone who's interested in startups
before we get into the how there is the
question of why now I would love to find
the person who authored the version of
this i saw on twitter and i spent about
half an hour today scouring the internet
to try to find that original so i could
give that person credit i didn't find it
what I discovered is I guess it's become
a meme it's kind of spread across the
internet and several people have copied
it without attribution so this was an
entreprenuer Who am I saw tweet about
his emotional cycle as an entrepreneur
and I think this does convey the fact
that this is a very intense life
experience can be a lot of fun it can be
very very bad over time you probably get
better at managing the inherent
bipolarity of this experience but it's
you know it is going to have a big
imprint on your life it's going to have
a big footprint on your time so for
anyone whose you know thinking of
starting a business or alternatively who
is thinking of joining an early stage
startup you really want to think about
you know do you really want this it will
have an impact on your family your
friends they may no longer be your
friends on your hobbies which you will
have kind of forgotten
I almost did with the piano and also
there is there is a pretty high
likelihood it will fail so the reason
that I include a slide like this is I do
sometimes think there's a little bit too
much glorification you know
entreprenuership is something that's
inherently more worthy than other things
or something that everyone should do it
really bugs me that there's this kind of
implicit glorification that it's more
worthy because for example if you look
at academic research you look at these
whole you know this whole edifice on
which entreprenuers build it's kind of a
little annoying when you know
entrepreneurs often get a lot more
credit than potentially they deserve and
secondly you know there's a lot about it
that's absolutely wonderful but there is
a lot about it that's quite tough so
having known all that why do I want to
do this this thing again I think it
comes down to a few things the biggest
is that I want to build something great
and having had that experience at a huge
corporation with VMware you know the
company when i was there had somewhere
between you know 1.5 billion and three
billion in cash it was still very
difficult to do something great to do
something great required dealing with
internal politics it does require
dealing with the degree of bureaucracy
it also required looking across the
product portfolio and thinking does this
compete with something that we have in
our portfolio there's a whole lot of
drags on the ability of large companies
to execute so you know if I think about
wanting to do something great there are
really two places I could think of doing
that one would be an open source and one
would be a start-up and in fact of
course in a start-up generally these
days you're going to play a big role in
open source you're going to contribute
to open source so that's not mutually
exclusive secondly and this is a very
powerful personal motivation to me I
just love working with great people and
I love working with them
every day so it's not just a
relationship where we have a weekly call
or go to a board meeting it's a
relationship you know where everyone is
part of the same team everyone wants to
fight the same battle everyone wants to
win in creating this something great and
finding people who use and but I've also
observed that I appear to be happier
when I work hard I obviously I wouldn't
need to be in a start-up to do that but
the points in my life where I think I've
been happiest there's been when I'm
working hard and I've realized that I
haven't been working hard enough lately
so essentially i miss playing the game
rather than coaching interestingly you
will note that money wasn't at the top
of the list and I'm certainly not going
to say that it's not a motivation but
it's nowhere near my primary motivation
and I think frankly that's true of the
repeat entrepreneurs that I've
encountered so now the bulk of the talk
will be about how so I do assume that
you have some interest in creating a
startup but even if you know that this
is something you are never personally
going to want to do I would hope that
there are some of the things that I'm
going to talk about that have value for
example if you are a technical person
and you get a job offer from a small
company that could be by far the best
thing that's ever happened in your
professional career or it could be a
really depressing way to waste six
months 12 months 18 months and go
backwards financially so you know
thinking about some of these things and
being aware of them I think really can
be quite valuable even if you're not
that interested in the business side for
its own sake you also may think that
some of the advice is a bit obvious to
which I would have to say that I find
that a lot of people maybe haven't heard
these kind of things enough because a
lot of people get some of the very basic
things wrong and I think it's kind of
important that we keep talking about
them until people more consistently
avoid those mistakes so a big part of
the presentation
going to share what I'm going to do
myself in the context of setting up a
new company so every time you see this
cheesy little graphic this kind of means
entreprenuers diary it means this is
something that I'm actually doing in the
process of the new business so firstly
when you set out you really should you
really should think you're going to be
successful right you should know
something that hopefully the rest of the
world doesn't know because if you don't
have something special in terms of your
vision everybody will do it well this
man on the right here is Paul moretz
Palmer it's was the number three
executive at Microsoft Donald 2000 he
was later CEO of them where he was
responsible for VMware's acquisition of
spring sauce Paul really was one of the
if not the greatest technology visionary
I've ever had the privilege to work with
and one of the key things I learnt from
Paul is the idea of being very explicit
about having a thesis so if you're going
to build something you don't want to
build necessarily to solve the problems
that everyone recognizes right now you
want to look at problems that are
emerging and you want to be ready for
when the next thing happens and have a
solution ahead of time there's other
ways obviously of expressing this one
other way of thinking about this is the
way I think most vc's thing these days
really look for genuine problems like if
you go and pitch to a VC one of the
things that's really important is are
you solving a real problem let's suppose
you have a great product but it does
something that doesn't actually solve a
real problem that's a big problem let's
suppose you've identified a big fat
hairy problem and your product isn't
quite right if you've got a good team
you can iterate
the same way that you can iterate with
code to make your tests pass or to fix
other kinds of bugs you can iterate with
product to solve that problem but you
are in a lot of trouble if you latched
on to something that turns out not to be
a real problem talking about iteration
and how we you know have the basis to
iterate for success in business the
fundamental foundation is a good team
how many people use slack it's looks
pretty great isn't it how many people
knew that slack started off as a game
company so slack is one of the fastest
companies ever to a 1 billion dollar
valuation and he used the lingo it
pivoted it started in something
completely different and pivoted to
something which the world loves so why
was it able to do that well obviously
there are some pretty great people at
slack and they were able to look at the
fact that their previous product wasn't
working they were able to look at the
assets that their company had and they
were able to pivot to something that has
been immensely successful this actually
brings in one of my favorite quotes from
Peter Drucker the management theorists
which is execution eats strategy for
breakfast so when you think about team
but when an investor thinks about team
they're really thinking can this team
execute because you can have brilliant
ideas and not actually be that great at
execution by the way in case anybody
thinks of god this is MBA drivel I would
encourage you to remember that although
technology has changed a whole lot
people haven't and a lot of you know
what you might dismiss his mba dribble
dribble is based on you know real
experience of people over many years and
people haven't just changed because
we've got a lot of cool technological
possibilities
so talking about team probably the first
thing that you're going to want to do is
assemble the team of founders the first
thing if you're going to do anything of
any scale complexity and ambition the
first thing you should do is have more
than one founder why because amongst
other things even the most brilliant
person is going to be wrong quite a bit
at the time and if they don't have
anyone within the company who can tell
them when they're wrong that isn't going
to go very well secondly nobody is
uniformly strong so for example take
paul maritza men he is possibly the
brightest person I know amazing
visionary he is not a strong on the
execution site I mean everybody has
strengths and weaknesses so the only way
to solve that is either find the you
know one perfect human being who has
ever existed or more likely go out and
find a bunch of people a small bunch of
people but who together are pretty
balanced and don't all think the same
way when you've done that you should
while you're doing that you should also
make sure that you understand what
everyone's values and goals are so let's
suppose you have a group of co-founders
and say two of them are intent on
working as hard as it possibly they can
possibly work to make this thing
successful and a third is really
interested in working nine to five and
taking out a big celery that really
isn't going to work the only way that
potentially might work is if they have a
completely open conversation and that
person for example owns less equity gets
the salary they want but you know it's a
different kind of role so you know it's
very important to be utterly transparent
about these kind of things and make sure
everybody's goals are aligned so what
are we actually doing in the new company
that i'm setting up which does something
that is very secret so we've got
currently five people on board at this
point we've got myself we've got three
strong
technologists I mean at this point in
time I'm kind of almost a fake
technologist but you know these free
people are actually still real
technologists but they're not all the
same they're all i would say technically
brilliant but they have specialized in
different things by the you know towards
the vision scientific end of the
spectrum or towards the management end
of the spectrum so you know that is a
guy in trying to build a group of people
that are mixed and have different
strengths and weaknesses and I've also
added an experienced executive who's
been at a number of startups a big
company and has been involved in both
corporate development and bigness of
business development roles when you're
assembling a team one of the things that
you really should do sooner rather than
later is allocate equity among founders
you could choose to do this quite early
or you can choose to delay it this is a
very difficult conversation right it's
not a conversation that you want to have
with people who might be your friends or
people that you hope would be your
friends it's yeah I mean this is the one
point in building a startup where your
ID your interests are not quite the same
they're certainly not utterly opposed
but there is going to be attention so
it's really difficult so what should you
do well if you delay talking about it it
will be like let's suppose that
conversation that you really want to
have with your neighbor about the dog
that your neighbor has that box and
keeps you awake is it easier to have
that conversation now or when you've
lost three months of sleep and a very
very very angry generally if you have a
difficult conversation I think in
virtually any field it's only going to
get more difficult so you know just
embrace the pain upfront and try to do
it in a way that is fair you know avoid
people getting upset with each other how
will you do that firstly should learn
about it there are some fantastic
resources
out there so if you just google
allocating equity among founders you'll
find some great articles there's even a
couple of calculators like the founders
calm startup elk equity calculator it's
not a perfect tool by any means but you
know if you look at these things these
resources that are available to you you
will actually have a basis for having a
conversation which is based on facts and
you know which can really smooth these
difficulties I mean one of Mike's
lessons that I've learnt from management
is that things that are inherently
sensitive are much easier if you
actually bring data in like do you
emotional eyes it make sure that you're
bringing in data points to ensure that
you can be fair so what have we done
we've been absolutely transparent in
this process so I think fundamentally
anyone is in the CEO role needs to
actually come up with a recommendation
but what do you base it on we've based
it on a number of data points and then
we've had a completely open discussion
about it so no back channels no
opportunity for you know any people to
get together behind other people's backs
and the result is it's been extremely
smooth and has avoided what could have
been a source of tension I talked about
startup resources in that particular
area there are quite a few but if you
look now it is a sea change in the last
ten years when we set out and founded
interface 21 I knew virtually nothing
about creating and running a software
startup and I learnt at least in the
early years through making mistakes
doing some things that appeared to work
and also through mentors basically these
days certainly you should still learn by
experience and you should still try to
find mentors but the web is your friend
Google is your friend it is amazing how
much is out there so for example
10 years ago vc funding was kind of at
least from an entrepreneur z perspective
was a bit of a dark mystery like exactly
what do these people want how does it
work what are good terms what a bad
terms just go google it and like any
term that you will see on a term sheet
will be discussed quite extensively on
line one of the things that you need to
do if you have an idea about which
you're excited as you should think about
what kind of opportunity this this is
amongst all the things you should think
about market sizing you know could this
be if you were really successful as this
company worth a billion dollars is it
worth more is it worth twenty million
dollars that is pretty fundamentally
important to be very clear about that
because you may well make a lot of money
by you know really nailing that 20
million dollar market but clearly that's
not something that you would want to
raise external capital for you would
pursue that business in a different way
you also need to consider how fast
should you run businesses often need by
the time or money they need well usually
they need both but often it's clear
which one they need more so for example
when we looked at interface 21 we really
needed time more than money early on we
needed to you know see if this kind of
wave of spring adoption was going to
continue to build and if we just tried
to add money we would have looked fake
in the developer community yummy not
only can you not magic up more developer
adoption you can't just magic up more
open source community but you also run
the risk of kind of almost perverting
something that was developing for my new
company I believe we actually need to
take more money up front because I think
we need to execute fast in a noisy
competitive environment another thing
that is important to think about is the
impact of your business model you can
have a SAS business that for example
grows without needing that much outside
funding take github get Harbor has
actually taken a lot of capital but they
got a surprisingly long way without
external financing and they did that
because their business where you know
people put in their credit card number
and you and I pay up seven bucks a month
or whatever it is that enabled them to
get cash flow very soon let's suppose
your business model is reliant on
selling to all the banks that are around
the city that means you can have a long
sale cycle so you know you're probably
are going to have a sales cycle of
anywhere between six or twelve months or
even longer it also means that they're
going to take a long time to pay you so
for example when github builds us they
presumably get the money fairly quickly
whereas if we bill any of these banks
the soonest we're going to see that
money as 90 days and that's if we have a
collections person who chases it up if
you are young and naive is an
entrepreneur you don't actually think
about that you find that they basically
don't highly prioritize paying you to
the point where you can actually
potentially get bad debts so you've got
to think that if that is the nature of
your business you know the actual cash
flow circumstance will really affect the
nature of your business you could have a
good business but it could take you too
long to get your money and that that can
be the difference between success and
failure so how do you decide whether you
want outside money you need to really
reflect on what you want to do if your
opportunity is a relatively small market
you may well build a good business but
you're not going to be that attractive
to venture investors the way venture
investors work is essentially at some
level they buy lottery tickets right if
your lottery ticket is for a lot if
there's imagine you've got a similar
number of tickets and some of them might
return a hundred thousand pounds and
some of them might return 50 million
pounds well you're probably going to buy
the tickets that have the higher return
other things being equal so you know
investors know that many if not most of
their investments will be failures and
therefore it they need to ensure that
the successes they have a so big that
they far more than make up for the
failures it depends on what you want to
do so for example if you're building a
product rather than say building a
services company it is pretty unusual to
be successful without taking some
external money if you're creating a
consultancy style business don't take
external money partly because investors
don't like that kind of business but
also because they're more cash efficient
businesses you can't actually get a long
way without needing external money
broadly speaking it will cost less than
it used to because of things like the
cloud and SAT the availability of SAS
platforms you can use but it will cost
more than you think when you look at
choice of sources of investment you've
got many types of investors so you've
got angels you've got visas a couple of
things I would say is be careful with
angels because very often you'll find
they don't engage in the business and
they can't actually you know complicate
your cap table without any real benefit
and secondly remember that VCS are not
created equal so consider the location
whether that's you know where you want
to have your company headquarters for
example brand and reputation and both
the firm and the partner I'm and report
like you should feel really comfortable
with the partner with whom you're doing
the deal if you you know find that an
uncomfortable process working with that
partner to deal with getting through to
the financing round it isn't going to
get better
in fact if anything goes wrong in your
company that relationship will probably
get a whole lot worse and remember that
valuation is an important metric but
it's also a bit of a vanity metric so
it's you know the one thing that a lot
of entrepreneurs will fixate on and
there are plenty of other terms in terms
eats that actually can be really really
important so don't just fixate on
valuation to personal observations I've
made ah that those who most hate VCS
most need what good VCS have to offer
and secondly virtually all the
successful entrepreneurs I know who
could self-financed to self-fund a new
venture don't do that they typically go
to their favorite VCS and establish that
relationship from the beginning why
would they do that I think the biggest
reason is desire to have the network as
well as the money and also desire to
have a partner because typically if you
know somebody has been successful
they're going to be pretty
self-confident and it's actually very
healthy too you know establish a
partnership where somebody even outside
the company has the ability to say well
you know this thing here isn't really
working is it so you know having that
ability to have a really honest
relationship with someone who
potentially is very experienced has seen
this movie many times before that is a
really valuable thing it's not just
about the money if you don't want to get
outside investors how would you go about
it so if you're thinking about a pitch
there's really three things that are
important the first I would say is the
problem and the market opportunity is it
a real problem that you solve and is it
worth solving that problem I mean is
this something that a lot of people are
going to pay you a lot of money foot
then there's the team that will go about
solving that problem in selling
the solution are they credible notice
I've got product in brackets product is
obviously incredibly important in the
end but product is one of those things
that you can either write on much more
easily than you can iterate on product
so if you think about these four things
here market opportunity can you iterate
on that no you cannot it is fixed so
there's either a real market there or
there's not problem can you iterate on
that not easily you would probably need
to do a pivot team prefer not to iterate
on that it is it is possible but you
know it's clearly not plan a where is
product you've got more chance of
iterating there what I would strongly
recommend is anything at all that you
want to do even if you don't want money
if you're not trying to raise money
create a pitch deck pretend that you're
trying to persuade someone while your
company is the most exciting thing ever
it's really good as a sanity check it
gives you a discipline and also it's
remarkable how when you try to distill
something down he sometimes discover
that it's finding you right you're
trying to create this 10 or 15 slide
deck explaining it and it's kind of the
narrative isn't gelling it's not a clear
story that's actually telling you
something really really important if you
can't distill it down if you can't for
example come up with an elevator pitch
or a mission statement that's actually a
really telling sign you need to think
about why that is so and see how you can
change it you also need when you're
pitching for investment to think about
what you do with this you're not going
to its most unlikely that you'll take
one run round of financing and never
need money ever again so what does it do
does it get you to Series B does it get
you to series a if it's a seed does it
get you to IPO you know there has to be
and why will your next financing round
be better what will you have achieve
will you have gained users will you have
proved that your product works will you
have gotten to the point where you just
need to
pay money expend money to build out the
sales and marketing machine so think
about what you're going to achieve of
course when you raise money you take
dilution so people give you money they
come and they take a share in your
company I think things are getting
better in this respect in that people
have a much better understanding now of
how this works but I do think that a lot
of entrepreneurs are still unduly
concerned about dilution and this
manifests itself in two ways one is that
they try to raise too little money or
alternatively they don't raise money
when they should have so they own all or
more of the company and then the company
you know potentially can get into
trouble it can have to use the lingo to
shorter runway so it's kind of good to
take off before you hit the end of the
runway secondly another way in which
hatred or fear of dilution manifests
itself is in terms of the option pool so
it's a good practice in just about any
company to have a pretty large option
pool that enables you to bring on really
good people and make sure they're
strongly incentive to come and work for
you and that they you know they feel
they've got real skin in the game if you
have too small an option pool you can't
do that so the founders don't get
diluted but the value of the company is
greatly reduced because you can't get
the right talent I have often say in the
situation we're in experienced
entrepreneurs will kind of fight with
vc's about this look sure there are
games that VC sometimes play in terms of
where the option at what point the
option pool goes in there's there are a
few games that you know both the
entrepreneurs and investors can play but
fundamentally the option pool should be
large and it's a good thing it's not a
win tube8 investors down and have a
small option pool because trust me
you're going to have to put in a big one
bigger one later so dilution is not the
enemy the enemy is failure
so you know just remember that anything
where you materially increased risk in
your business by avoiding dilution it's
probably not that smart corporate setup
remember I said that you need to
allocate equity amongst founders as soon
as possible you also need to set up a
company as soon as possible it seems
like very obvious advice but for example
I didn't follow that advice when I set
up interface 21 and we we had some
problems because of that now corporate
structure was kind of messed up we
really didn't kind of bite the bullet do
it properly at the beginning when you
set up your corporate structure you
really should keep it boring no your
company is not different there are a
whole bunch of things that are typically
used such as you know their standard
option pull a whole bunch of standard or
near standard agreements do what people
do do not try to be inventive one of the
best pieces of advice that I got fairly
early in my startup career was
innovating your technology don't
innovate and you know corporate
structure legals anything like that just
adds friction similarly don't you know
sometimes people try to set things up
that give a lower corporate tax rate you
know what most startups are going to
make a loss for years anyway so that's
not the most immediate problem and
secondly it's not going to you know
enhance your possibility of a trade sale
or IPO so you know it's probably an on
goal so what have we done with this
respect well firstly we just thought
about the opportunity and we think we
need to run fast so we're going to do a
friends-and-family seed round in a quick
series a we are going to practice what I
preach and iron my co-founders are
personally diluting more than as usual
to put in a large option pool to help
attract great talent we've decided we're
going to have the headquarters in San
Francisco and raised from Bay Area
investors however I would note that if I
lived in London today
I would raise in London so when i
founded interface 21 I lived in London
we ultimately raised money in palo alto
california at that time I think the
London ecosystem wasn't what it is now
London is now a pretty great place to
raise money and to run a startup so you
know I think if I lived here I think I'd
actually probably try to build the
headquarters here we have also decided
to have a distributed engineering team
from the outset I think to me that is a
no-brainer because you want to be able
to find great talent wherever it is and
also we've learnt through you know the
various process improvements in software
over the last few years through open
source and other collaboration we've
learned how to work together as
distributed teams let's let's embrace
that up front and be able to bring on
great people wherever they're found what
do we do with corporate setup we found
the most boring possible corporate setup
approach this by the way is a sign in
boring Oregon it's actually a real town
and it's paired with dull Scotland I
believe that Oregon actually has a
statewide boring and dull day to one of
those two towns so what is the most
boring thing you can possibly do well it
turns out it's a delaware topcoat so if
you're setting something up in the u.s.
it's just like imagine lawyers are
coming along and doing due diligence for
example for an investment round on your
company and they start looking at stuff
they say delaware topkapi up that's fun
let's suppose they say that your
company's in Florida or even California
or New York it just potentially add
somewhere between a tiny little bit and
a lot more attention so for example it
may well be that you're acquirer or
investors law firm sees an opportunity
here to spin up some Billings around
exploring this you just don't want that
keep it
simple so everything that we're doing is
based around being simple and
conventional to reduce friction at all
points in the future and sure there are
some things that we would have kind of
liked to do some more special things and
for the most part we've thought you know
what it's not worth it let's let's keep
it simple people guess what people are
important one of the things you should
consider in your company as you're going
to need good managers the second thing
is that you should model the behavior
you want to see I've seen a lot of
startups obsess around culture and they
explicitly discuss culture and they have
policy guidelines short that stuff is
important to a point but there is one
thing that is more powerful and that
thing is how the founders conduct
themselves so for example obviously you
will have a culture that's you know
respectful of diversity that absolutely
rules out sexual harassment etc and that
will be in your policies and it should
be clear but even more powerful than
that is the founders behaving in such a
way that everybody realizes that this is
just not on that this company is a
respectful company and it values
everybody so a good example of this is
Oracle Oracle is a particularly large
company Oracle is also a very successful
company and some of its products are
very good so you know it wouldn't be
wholly negative about Oracle how many
people here think Oracle is a nice
company I i would expect people
so you know Oracle is clearly a company
that's worthy of respect and it's a
great company but it has a very
particular way of operating which to
some degree reflects the personality of
Larry Ellison and you know I mean the
guy is a successful guy but my point is
that how the founders behave scales up
to an astonishing degree inside
companies so you know think about that
when you miss it also touches on that
point of how do you build that founding
team so a guy and if everybody is very
very similar that isn't going to be very
good either right because you as the
company is built out it'll feel
unwelcoming to people who are different
from that founder profile people another
part of people is networking so whenever
you're thinking of starting a business
or pursuing a business you should talk
to people a very large proportion of my
time of your time so for example when i
started with interface 21 probably the
first two years I would frequently get
to the end of a day and think I
accomplished nothing today this is so
frustrating because I was still you know
thinking of in terms of my productivity
by how much code I'd written or how many
problems technical problems that solved
and gradually that kind of declined to
the point where I really couldn't write
much code at all and over time I
realized that I actually was achieving
something it was just something very
very different and all that talking to
people actually was kind of important so
some specific things you might want to
do around networking you know talk to
everybody you know who may have a useful
perspective interview potential
customers to validate your ideas and
also hiring so I mean one thing I've
found particularly with engineering
hiring is technical recruiters have not
been useful to my portfolio companies
where is getting engineers who are
already at those company
is getting found is out talking to
people that's much more effective and
you also should maintain and build a
network of potential advisors and
investors there's a saying in the valley
this is I think so old that I've no idea
who first set it if you want money ask
for advice if you want advice ask for
money but you know the asking bid is
really important you should talk to
people constantly regardless of whether
you want anything from them that's
actually something that is pretty great
about the Silicon Valley culture that
very often in other cultures if you ask
somebody something for example I can
introduction it's viewed as you know
calling in a favor whereas I think
Silicon Valley people tend to take a
longer view where they're very happy to
you know help put people together and
there's no expectation of immediate
payback so you know another side of this
is that if you can help anybody else if
they ask you anything you know it's
really important to be as helpful as you
can and willing to help other people as
well I mentioned the change in my role
at interface 21 as you build a company
typically you'll find at least one
founder will change role from a
primarily technical role to a primarily
business role and you really do have to
recruit or grow business people I do
believe a lot of technical people tend
to be a bit arrogant in this respect
they believe that because you know for
example when they meet sales or
marketing people they think they're
smarter than those people are on average
they don't need domain expertise you
know the fact is that even if that
belief is true IQ isn't actually the
high-order bit and it is a different
skill set and I do think that a lot of
technical people think you can just kind
of learn about this stuff from first
principles and then obviously you'll be
better than the best market or best
salesperson out there it's not quite as
simple as that also you really
need to think not only about what your
market opportunity is and what you're
going to build but how you'll sell it
like will you sell like atlassian or
like Oracle for example you know very
very different one is very low touch
sales motion whereas the other uses a
traditional enterprise sales motion I
think the world is moving broadly
speaking to lower touch sales motions
but nevertheless the same approach is
not correct for every business and
finally as with respect to law firms and
the like pay for good advice or at least
pay for the best advice you can afford
at any point in time because it really
can save your problems down the trap so
I hope this has been useful to you I
would leave you with one final thought
which is it's about people not software
but then on the other hand when you
think about it it's software is about
people as well there really is nothing
in the technical domain that when you
try to scale it out build a team you
know execute anything complex it always
comes down to people rather than
technology in the end thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
