impression there's this really cool term
then digital natives and I made like a
word of play on that one because what we
really are going to talk about today is
tickets on the eaves and I'm gonna show
you why they're typically naive instead
of native but a bit about me some of you
might know me from the go-to night that
I host in Copenhagen but I'm actually a
master student in advanced computing
that's a computer science degree at the
ITC University I also did my bachelor's
there also in computer science but now I
specialize in cryptography and security
I've done previous research on privacy
in the current incident protocols so
somehow we ended up with this massive
incident that is completely broken and I
think it's quite fun to look at that for
instance if you search in the original
paper research paper for the Internet
Protocol and you search for security you
get no hits I think that's quite fun to
do get I teach high school students
about privacy and self-defense and we're
going to talk a lot about that just a
fun fact I occasionally block about Emma
out of you here that's a little
commercial and if you read the text
about me I really like DJing also
specializing in disco funk and what I
call baby makers so if you find that I'm
what I talk about here is really boring
you can go read the blog where you can
listen to my Spotify playlist alright
well well that settles I would like to
introduce this term for those of you who
hasn't heard about it before so this is
like an industry-wide really popular hip
term to use especially by the industry
we are catering to the digital natives
or foreign mobile islands and stuff like
that and I actually think it's quite
annoying that industry they present us
as these dumb teenagers and I want to
show you how and just a quick warning
this video is incredibly cringe but it
gets the point across that digital
natives may be naive instead
so let's heat it up
so I'm not a techie but if there's one
thing I know well it's serious and
liking and skyping and of course
personalizing I have a lot of friends
and I need them know what's up with me
yeah so you get it
it's like incredibly current and nobody
really talks that way I don't know how
this became a keynote at some conference
apparently it did they tried to make
some oh right there cool so digital
natives are really just quick at
adapting to new technology and they
trust technology they think they
technology is the answer for everything
it might be but they don't have any
critical sense of what technology can do
is there if they have a problem there's
an app for that so they they don't
question these media don't they don't
question for instance the term free
which we're also going to talk about and
the most important thing I think is that
we've actually perceived them as experts
and we perceived them there by their
parents and other adults they're expert
in using technology and I want to call
this the family affect so I want to read
this text to you to those of you who are
not a native dated Danish speaker so
this is a text from Grandma and it says
honey what was it the apps you told me
to download and she spelled apps like
that then she goes on oh it was
something about and that's Facebook and
that snapchats
became snapshots I can't remember I'm
sorry and then Indian was it Instagram
or something like Instagram so it's
clear here that grandma text her
granddaughter to see or it wasn't me
unfortunately but this could have been
me so can we really teach them anything
because we clearly perceive them as
experts but they're not
and lastly they are teenagers they're
born in the zeros I think that's the
correct term and there are different
characteristics that we usually just
used to describe teenagers that are
really good in this sense as well to
describe what is a digital naive and I
want to start by the first one
financially irresponsible that goes for
it tickets on the Eve's as well and I
want to tell you why because they
automatically think that everything is
free if you pay for an app you're a
moron if you pay for software you're
stupid if you have to remove a virus you
everybody knows you use a free virus
remover you can just click on that Mac
saver icon when you go to pages that's
totally cool and if you pay for software
you're basically just out and I I can
understand why do you think this so if
you look at the top eleven of popular
free apps in the App Store's
these are major companies Facebook
Instagram snapchat major companies
really valuable companies and they don't
question why these apps are free when
the companies is so valuable how come
that they're like oh max Zuckerberg is
just a nice guy and he made this really
cool app let's use it they don't
question how they make the money and
when you ask them how do you think
Facebook makes it money they say oh oh
yeah that's right there's an
advertisement out in the side I know
that they make money of that and then
you ask them okay that's correct but why
do you think so many people want to
advertise on Facebook
o or there's a lot of people there and
it's like yes I know but a lot of people
process a lot of data and that's the
data that you put in the platform that
actually makes Facebook and snapchat for
instance a really valuable company okay
so teenagers are perceive that's Lacey
and my example here may apply to all of
us because you know about the terms and
conditions nobody reads the terms and
conditions
let me just see a raise of hands how
many in here has snapchat cool all right
it's a good idea sometimes to read these
terms and conditions but I know the long
snap chin for instance have 52 pages of
like tiny tiny tiny font sized papers
nobody likes to read them we all just
click accept and then you try to solve
it for instance with the cookies in the
european union you try to solve it by
telling the users that they're in there
visiting a website with cookies employed
but you do it in a horrible way where
everybody just gets annoyed by that
pop-up instead and it solves like
nothing so after the European Union
introduced this pop-up and I asked out
in the high school students how many of
you know what a cookie is nobody knows
what a cookie is so that's awfully yeah
that's a solution that didn't work but
back to snapchat
in terms of conditions because I
actually think it's important that there
are a couple of you guys who use
snapchat and I want to read out loud
what you actually said yes to so for all
services you grant snapchat a world wide
roles if we supply sensible and
transferable license to hosts store use
display reproduce modify adapt edit
publish and distribute that content
because live local and any other
crowdsourcing services are inherently
public and critical matters of public
interest the license you grant us for
content submitted to the services is
brought up in addition to the rights you
grant us in connection with other
services you also grant us a paternal
license to create derivative works from
promote exhibit broadcast syndicate
publicly perform and publicly display
content and then they go on and then in
the end is like unrestricted worldwide
perpetual right to use your name your
likeness and your voice do you think
teenage high school students know this
no they don't and when you tell them
this they instantly panic I had one guy
who was like
jumping out the window it was on the
first floor so it was just for fun but
they were really scared that this that
this is actually what they said yes to
and I understand the problem nobody
wants to read these terms and conditions
so it's a fair question like why do we
as service providers keep writing these
long terms and conditions we'll get back
to that they're gullible they think the
world is beautiful everyone is a nice
guy as I said Mike Zuckerberg is still
just running Facebook on his one
computer from Howard
he still hasn't graduated well that's
true but the rest of it not so much and
my example here is these Facebook apps
so whenever you use Facebook to connect
your app for creating a user and that's
available you you probably know the API
to this one you can get access to data
points from different users profile for
instance profile picture or age and I
mean some sometimes it's really fair
what you asked uses for and whenever you
your app is being used this way that the
user has connected with Facebook the app
goes in their Facebook page under
settings 6 click in under settings on a
page for the page is white but the text
is gray and it's really hard to find but
I show them so now you know that maybe
some senior too will go in here and find
out what you did but I have one example
of how this works and I think this is a
really exciting I don't want to say too
much because I want to make a Chris of
it cool so I want to show you how this
works how I use the video editing tool I
a movie for instance to connect to my
facebook so is it like super simple just
to show you that this app is not on my
facebook to begin with I just show you
that there's no iMovie we agree to that
I have not cheated then I go back to
your iMovie I connect my facebook I read
she was share in Facebook and then
obviously it tells me please sign in I
will sign in now I will give you my
email address and you can guess how long
my password is that is great security
but it's for the sake of this talk so I
lock in no problem and then I was
actually smart enough or mainly just
sweet to tell me exactly which data
point from my profile they would like
that sounds reasonable
maybe email address is a little bit too
much but I mean profit for a while and
email at that sign that's sound fine I
want to ask you at this point how many
data points do you think that I move we
will get from my profile it's an easy
question you just saw it - yeah so we
all agreed the to my public profile and
email address that's what's the only
thing they asked for it so let's
continue this video we'll see if we
guessed right then it asked me would you
like to share nobody wants to share on
the Facebook it's like really annoying
so I'm like double checking only me and
then not now just in case that they
overwrite my decision
looks fine I go back to Facebook just to
show you that now the app is there and I
just want to make sure that it's only
the two data points that I actually gave
them that they now have access to and I
have slow internet at home I'm sorry so
now I click in the app and I can see
exactly which data points they actually
have from my profile and the list is
quite long especially more than two
points it's much more than my email
address in my public profile and I think
this it this must be illegal I think so
and I think it's like crazy that
Facebook is allowed to do this but just
to work you through what they actually
asked me about public profile
relationship relationships interest data
proof cat status notes work history
status updates education history events
groups hometown interest oh there's one
more photos religious and political
views videos website personal
description likes email address oh
that's why I gave them my email address
that's right that might be their friend
lipst my friends relationships my
friends relationships interests my
friends birthday my friends chat
statuses my friends note and your
friends work history that is insane oh
there's one more
your friend status updates your friends
education history your friends events
your friends groups your friends
hometowns your friends interests your
friends current cities your friends
photos your friends religious and
political views your friends videos your
friends website your friends personal
description your friends likes I promise
you it ends now but do you really wonder
why teenager might develop trust issues
I don't so I really believe that we can
teach them something and I really think
we should oh can I get the water so
after all this reading I'm like nope
this one that took a lot of reading is
like 52 points that's the long way from
to 252 alright so what can we teach them
well really we should just teach him
what we teach them every day if you're
not paying you may be the product that
is sold that was clear but from the
terms and condition from snapchat it was
also clear from the iMovie right so we
we may teach them a different definition
definition of free if something is free
you have to question why is this free am
I paying with something else just not
money we have to teach them that if
terms and conditions are super long you
should read them you should read them
because if something is really tedious
and so boring and stuff it's like
because they hide something for you
that's obvious right you can tell a
teenager everybody understands this if
you want something to be hidden you put
it somewhere really obscure I think
everyone can understand this never
believed for strangers on the Internet
tell you not even Apple they may be
lying or may be hiding something for you
and then lastly use protection that is
not just in real life also you also have
to teach them that but also on the
Internet
but how can we teach them I mean we're
software developers we're developing
software to these
digital natives do still believe they're
natives no me neither so to get back to
the second part of this talk I want to
talk about this privacy in software how
can we actually develop software that
helps these digital natives become
natives and help them develop a standard
of what is free should I Christian
software should I just instantly just
trust technology maybe not and I want to
start out by asking you a question do
you think security is the same as
privacy because I don't and I want to
give you an example so HTTP and just
HTTP sorry it's just a critical
reclaimer here that there may be a talk
in the afternoon where someone proves me
wrong what I'm about to say I just want
to disclaim that for anyone saying oh
she was lying but no right now you just
know that HTTPS is secure so I use my
phone use HTTPS to encrypt a message
from my device to Facebook servers and
that means sure it gets along quite
secure actually the Facebook always also
use something called certificate pinning
that means it's resistant to men in the
middle attacks pretty cool I tried to
hack it myself during my bachelor thesis
didn't work so that's how I know but
when my message is at Facebook server
it's not encrypted that means that
anyone with this access to the server
can go in and read my messages it's
basically just like a postcard so I
don't think that's private so this is an
example of something that's secure but
maybe we should find another definition
for private because when I stand here
and there's a dissing between you and me
I mean there's a reason why you didn't
sit right next to the guy who don't know
there's always like a seat in the middle
like Oh an oak away I don't know you
guys and that's that's because privacy
is like a social concept right we have
this fear that we want to be in and if I
really go close to your face and yell
you're like oh what a bitch because we
derive this from like social concepts so
I spent some time during my research to
look into concept from
Saoirse logic social social lot anyway
you get the point
and the first one is informational
inequality so we should think about
creating a balance between our software
and our users our users should be
allowed to know which data do we have on
them or what what data do we have on
them
that also means processed data so data
you're in procession of because you
process some other data that becomes
meta data I only think it's fair that
users know what you actually know about
them and that's understood as in
informational inequality or equality in
this case if you have an equal balance
and they can go in and say ok what data
do the X you have and can retrieve it
again then that's that's a fair balance
another one is informational injustice
so when I had to present this I was
doing it to my teacher who had like
supervised my project and and I thought
ok this guy is a professor in IT
security if there's someone who's really
cool at IT security and Facebook and all
the social media that must be him he was
on Facebook and his profile was not
closed so I went in and I thought cool
there's some pictures there that's also
my I may be able to use this at the exam
so what I did at the exam was actually
to bring up this slide and the next
slide and I won't show you here because
obviously that would be unfair I took
his vacation photos in the next slide
and he was like how how have you gotten
this and he was like really
professionals like no I'm just
explaining you informational injustice
because informational and justice is
about when you use something that was
created in a once fear in another one
that feels quite unfair because nobody
likes a snitch fortunately my professor
thought it was funny and didn't expel me
so that was good but it really gave him
the sense of what informational
injustice is and just show you do not
use information that you've created in
one sphere in another for instance
cookies when you tell these horrible
teenagers
about cookies they thought there there'd
be like oh I thought it was random and
that I just got the shoes that I was
just looking at ha ha ha and you're like
no that's not random it's technology
cool ok informational decay so this is
really important for me because I've
been a big it's only Eve
luckily Facebook only came around when I
was 15 and not 12 when I was like oh I
need to have a block and tell everyone
about it and upload photos of me and
gosh I'm so glad that doesn't exist
today but that wouldn't have happened
it was just born four years earlier
because we have a tendency to always
save data just because we can and I want
to ask you why do you save this and
someone says oh it was on sale because
this is the hard drive cause of memory
and I get that but it's not an excuse to
save data because I actually think that
we we really do owe it to our teenagers
to allow them and allow computers to
forget because when they grew up and
realize okay
maybe I I wasn't really affiliated with
the with this a political party that I
said I was and I want to change that and
then a future employee Google's them and
says oh gosh he's a communist we can't
use him as most teenagers are really
then then I think it's fair that we
allow computers to forget this and just
to sum up about this decay maybe or
current standards are really
privacy-preserving so right now the
stand us is to remember everything
everything and I think one way to
circumvent this is to let users actually
have a timeout so if I could upload a
photo to Facebook and say hey Facebook
I think this thought is really cool but
can you delete it like delete it and not
just tag it as delete in your database
can you delete this photo
in a month or I could post something on
my blog and be like oh I can't do that
if it's my blog if I ever want my server
I could just implement something where a
user could set a timeout like make this
go away for two years in two years time
maybe there is some photos that I would
like to use forever family photos so
let's keep them forever but actually
just giving the use of some control over
what data and how that data is being
stored I think is a great help also
because then you force uses to question
themselves well do I really think this
data is relevant in two years time maybe
not maybe it would be fine that the
drunk photos I put on Facebook Friday
night are not there Monday morning
because then I would be confronted with
it also about the terms and conditions
we need to do something about this so I
know that terms and conditions are often
long because you want to protect
yourself from those crazy Americans who
are going to sue you just because they
can I understand that and you need a
lawyer for that but again if you really
need a lawyer to make your terms and
conditions maybe they're already too
complicated
I haven't yet read some terms and
conditions who are like free bullet
points but I think that would be awesome
if you go back to snapchat
oh let's not go back but I really think
that if statue just was like hey you
know what we can do anything with your
data do you think that's okay I think
most of us would go back and be like no
I don't think that but it's like it's
obscured in this massive text document I
feel so sorry for the guy who had to
write it it's horrible it's like he must
have used the word like synonyms so much
yes
so another standards is ask for
forgiveness not permission so you saw it
in the iMovie example right they just
have all this data because it would be
so awkward to ask afterwards oh hey we
also need your friends photos and we
also need your friends relationships
interest
it's a video editing program I feel like
this is horrendous but they asked for a
forgiveness not permission what if it
was the other way around
that we would actually start asking for
permission first not forgiveness so
don't ask for data you don't need and
then like a side note because I'm into
cryptography if you really need to save
the data can you save it encrypt it so
these are the the points that I wanted
to get across and I totally lost track
of time
maybe I'm too early but actually that
was all I wanted to say for today thank
you
well we have a time for some questions I
have a few questions on the from the app
oh yeah I actually have a quite a few
question I really just working at
Facebook or really India I am really in
the app would you believe Facebook if
they let you set a timer no okay so no
it definitely not I don't know if you've
seen the documentary about this Austrian
guy camera members named Max reiber
something like that
so he asked data and he actually suit he
asked Facebook and he actually sued
Facebook in order to get all the data
that they have on him and what he
realized was that the photos that he had
deleted were still there they were just
tags as deleted in the Facebook database
I mean how can we ever trust something
again I think it's horrible so no
definitely not but I like if I were
developing an app and I asked you so you
you know there's this feature I couldn't
said timeout on the things that you
submit to my app I mean I would do it
it's just Facebook being a horrible
person do you think Facebook
yes I do so I base that on data that
I've collected from these high school
students I know that I really paint as
this caricatured picture of a teenager
is really dumb and annoying but most of
them I actually nice people so when you
when you ask them so we what we do is
that we divide the number of active
users that are currently on Facebook
that's around 2 billion and by active
Facebook mean active once a month I
don't know if that's active but they did
to find it like that and then you take
the cost of running Facebook and you
divide it out by these two billions uses
and they it Facebook actually only costs
seven and a half Kroners so that's one
euro a month if you do that and if you
ask them teenagers
you pay this they would be like yeah
that's cool and if you ask them would
you pay more I mean Spotify is what 20
20 years something I had a 100 Cronus
and they they gladly pay that so yeah I
definitely I definitely think that it's
just because they're getting so used to
the alternative that everything is free
and maybe you should teach them that
differently all right
that's another great question yeah so is
it so bad yes they have our data and
information but if it's giving you the
shoes I want ok yeah I mean it's up to
people I am a privacy fanatic and I've
totally closed down everything but I'm
still on Facebook and still your
snapchat but I I try to protect my
online presence but the problem is that
we don't actually give teenagers the
choice we don't present them with you
know what your data is actually being
saved we just do it and assume they're
ok with it again we just ask for
forgiveness when they found out but we
didn't ask for permission and I think
this is not fair that's not OK that we
just assume that everyone is fine with
the data laying everywhere because
teenager clearly aunt when I'm out
teaching them they clear like oh I have
to jump out the window
yeah all right just a quick follow-up on
that maybe haven't you experienced
someone just saying back to you when you
explain yeah that ok I have nothing to
hide yeah yeah they say that a lot but
then I asked for the Facebook password
and then they suddenly quiet so I find a
way around that okay cool so another
very interesting question what is the
stupidest question you ever heard from a
high school student I have ok no no III
think I have too so I know we have the
machine learning track on Tuesday but
this is kind of a machine learned oh so
there was this one guy we were summing
up and he was like oh this is
he was like one of the guys oh you can
have everything and then I was like
really annoyed at this guy
and then we were summing up and he said
oh I heard about this guy with a
computer in the u.s. called big data so
basically he thought that big data was
just one computer in the u.s. he didn't
get that was the concept of things he
was like oh it's like one computer in
the year as it's scary
so I mean yes it is a lot of computers
in the US but gosh I couldn't even go
into that discussion so I think that's
the what I can tag on the top of my mind
all right all right so another question
do you always read the terms and
conditions yourself never know now
that's a fair point I don't want to
spend a weekend just because I want to
download some cool app but what I want
to come across here and that's the point
I'm trying to make that US that is
making this software who are you writing
these terms and conditions research
think again if we're doing the right
thing if we're doing right by writing
terms and conditions that I mean one
metric you could do is like ask everyone
in the office to read the terms and
conditions over the weekend
then on Monday morning ask them how many
of you read it if no one or just one guy
hasn't there too long and they're too
complicated so that's the metric you can
use for instance but nobody wants to
read yeah so another question from the
app yeah there's a lot of questions how
do you think all the cool stuff like
machine learning can be applied without
useless data
yeah and and that's a constant
discussion I have heard my boyfriend
who's a data scientist and we like oh oh
that's the number one discussion we have
but I mean it's hard right but we could
ask herself but I mean that's also the
point right you should gather data that
is useful and don't I mean if I movie
tell me oh it's really useful for us to
know your friends relationship status I
would be like yeah no that's not
relevant for a video editing program but
of course if you're scanning photos
figuring out our teenagers
generally depressed or something else
you can do some beautiful research by
applying machine learning to big
datasets and of course it's also a gift
that we have this data because then we
can do things and we can learn things
that we're not able to before but
personally I think that the beauty of
machine learning lies in for instance
scanning brain scans to find tumors and
stuff so maybe not to scan for a
specific you preferences I mean is that
saving the world I don't know cool that
was it so do we have any questions in
the audience yeah one second get the mic
I know this guy I actually was the one
asking the machine learning thing
follow-up about the same thing do you
think the problem is in collecting data
or in putting a name on that data
because for me I don't think the problem
if it's machine doing the interpretation
because actually even if you make the
same analogy of our social life into
machines you actually also used some
data of that you gathered from your high
school students yeah to make this
awesome presentation so I think the
machine also can use some of the users
data to to create some content or to
give you some information or to ask yeah
so I yeah where is it putting the name
into the data that is wrong or
collecting the data it's right I would
say that the name is the trouble but
then I kinda know how easy it is to
break anonymous data so I don't know
yeah I think maybe we should just go
away from that that the default is
saving everything really I mean you you
could say something that you think is
relevant for the app you're building or
the company or work at or something that
you truly think can also enhance the
experience for the users right and not
just for you getting your money for
worth right so just think about it III
don't say I have the key to everything
but this is like my experience with
teenagers so far cool
any more questions in the audience yeah
and I don't know this guy
have you ever stopped using an
application just because of the terms
and conditions yes I stopped using
snapchat okay because we said you're on
the social media and stuff yeah I mean
I'm still on Facebook but now I never
ever ever ever ever ever connect an app
with Facebook I will always use my own
email address and just some random
password not a random password really
strong passwords so yeah I stopped using
snapchat because I'm not saying that
they do it they're just allowed to and
if you fall around stock modding
marketing market you know that stock
snapchat just came on the market they
just IP ode and they haven't made any
money so far anyone and this is what
they can't do with your data so if I
mean if I end up in a commercial for
chlamydia I think it's horrible but
that's what they're allowed to I don't
know who would make a commercial for
chlamydia but you never know you never
know the crazies uh the Internet is a
crazy place filled with crazy people all
right any more questions no I I actually
have a question what what's your take on
biometric authentication Apple just came
up with yes you know how I feel about
Apple now yeah it's cool it's cool
and I think it's fine if Apple can
promise me that the reckoning my face is
only going to be on my phone so I think
that's cool if you just promise uses and
you keep your promise and you do it to
keep the data on the phone then I think
it's cool but of course if the
government suddenly said Oh Emma you
know what just to get in the library you
have to show your thumb I would be like
what because then and I mean there's
again that's a whole other discussion is
it the government's or is just Facebook
or snapchat into social media and so I
mean it
the cool feature but as always be
careful and just think about it
I really think cool all right thank you
very much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
