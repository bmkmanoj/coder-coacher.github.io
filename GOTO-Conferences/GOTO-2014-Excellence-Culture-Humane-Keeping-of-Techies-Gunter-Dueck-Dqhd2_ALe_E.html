I'm afraid I have to I have improved the
talk from the experiences in London so
maybe I haven't done it the right way so
in the right direction okay I I was CEO
of IBM Germany some time and you I was
used to be one techie for 30 managers
say in the board so all the controllers
the others and they they just want to
make me the number so so they have
explicit goals their goal is plus 10%
and for a techie it's not the goal it's
kind of wish or something and I said
let's make serious objectives what we
need to achieve as a Content and they
there is always a struggle of between
form and content and all the managers
above me they they cared for the content
and if they talk about excellence they
do not really want me and know what they
mean
excellence means I think plus 12%
you know and so there's a kind of clash
of cultures and I want to talk about
that and maybe you can clarify a little
bit in which company you live and what
what people are thinking and it's
basically there is one thinking in in
forms of content for technical people
and form and methods and plans and
schedules and business cases and all
these things which is kind of enforced
lying for technical people you have to
surround the form to get the finally
result and I struggled with all of these
and I give you now the the psychological
foundation for these things and the
second thing in my talk is that you have
maybe to upgrade because everything is
upgrading so so so normal coding and all
these normal things can be done in India
for half the price and you feel that as
technical you if you are if you have if
you are technical people just having
responsibility for project and all this
kind of stuff then you have to have more
Skills than before so also 20 years ago
you just code it for months and then
showed the result now you have all these
projects and and international
connections and cause things you may
hate but but this is maybe half of your
job now and you have to be capable to be
kind of 10% manager 10% project either
10% some sellers and all these things
you hate and these are these other
things where you have methods and forums
and this is like management controlling
and all these
and we I think in the future what well
all the higher paid higher higher paid
people have to to get all these new
skills and I mean it very serious also I
am not telling you about you you should
have more empathy and the humans are
important so it's much more important
than then use is usually said it's about
upgrading ok I'm starting music do you
know this book one important guy Zoe I'm
not not really important so they the
important people know this book so it's
written for managers 80 pages lots of
pictures in it so you can understand
that it's very easy maybe you you you
know one one single word from this book
this is a favorite word for managers
this is called comfort zone do you know
that leave your comforter this this is
from this book probably your boss has
read that ok I tell you in the book so
it's 80 pages you I can tell you what
the content is in one minute so there
are two mice basically living from
Cheney's they eat cheese cheese cheese
there's a mountain of cheese and page
five the cheese is over gone ok a cheese
means it is it kind in a book for
manager cheese means business business
is God
and then they are discussing how to get
new cheese there are two mice the one
Mouse is more German it's in
psychological term obsessive-compulsive
it is sitting there and thinking Jesus
is coming somewhere we all the time
there was cheese and there will be
cheese in some time and let's just wait
and the other mouse is more American
it's hysterical his tunic and loves
change and then let go allow in other
countries somewhere with a watch fine
cheese and the main mainstream of the
book is 50 pages is about discussing
should we start looking for new cheese
or not and and then then they leave
their comfort zone of course this is the
message leave your comfort and then find
cheese on page 80 that's it
you see this is this is a really really
famous famous management book so and if
you are I was in the senior management
of ABM over 200 of us in main managers
in IBM Europe get this got this book and
okay I had to read that I was very angry
and gave it to the faretta
immediately I wrote it I made a new
version of
this is 100 half-page so it's not my
homepage if you and want to have the
full version online - the cheese was
over and my stories is one and a half
pages so Jesus gone and they disgust for
five or four lines I think into my story
if they should leave the comfort zone
and they decide to leave that's easy and
then they are gone for the whole world
looking for cheese looking for cheese
looking for cheese looking for cheese
becoming hungry looking for cheese
looking for cheese and then they die so
this is the new book so so it's a little
bit longer sorry I was looking for
cheese looking for cheese and then the
world becomes very sticky is it smelt
strange everything was fat and the world
was full of bacon and they asked people
they didn't found any people that were
very small mice tiny tiny small mice
they said they are digital natives and
they said they live from bacon and said
we hate bacon please where's cheese and
then nobody cares for cheese here and
then looked for cheese look for cheese
then they died so this is the full story
and you have to acknowledge that that
maybe also of what what I'm saying is
that kind of social skills for artistic
engineers and infamous computer science
people these all these human factors is
is bacon for you
it's very serious you comfort so on does
not mean that you are looking for new
coders and no no new technology and
something you are this is cheese and
maybe you're looking for cheese looking
for cheese new technology maybe there is
some cheese but
I tell you there's a lot of bacon in the
world you know and you can die and I
know a lot of guys in America and in
America so my my nephew is working with
so it is AP and the boss comes and then
thirty of you are fired next morning and
please fetch over the work to India or
China or something
let's this it's a real real case okay I
give you one one example before starting
technology of technology people what's
going on in the world so it's Indus in
in Germany we say industry 4.0 in
America they say cyber-physical systems
and everything is merging it's not about
the Internet of Things is it about it's
a different talk integration of
everything so this is one example the
final vision might set my vision is that
I've I would like to forbid cars in
Germany so completely forbidden you you
are not you are not allowed to own a car
and we just order some Google
self-driving cars that's it and we have
only taxes in Germany no own cars just
taxes the idea is like cloud computing
you know cloud computing means that you
are a server at home is now not working
so as utilization of two percent say or
your smartphone as a utilization of five
percent and giving it to in the cloud
means that you can raise the utilization
from 2 percent to say 50 this is the
idea so just increasing the utilization
if you have just Google self-driving
cars you can also raise the
innovation so my car is now on the
Frankfurt Airport I brought it there
because of the strike so I had to around
flight and and I end tomorrow and in
Frankfurt I should have a car there so I
went from Mannheim to Frankfurt brought
my car there and get went by train back
to my 9 where I live and then to Munich
so if you we have Google self-driving
cars no one is striking everything is
fine the government of Germany gives you
24 thousand kilometers flat rate that's
it
and and my car has a utilization rate I
computed that for of 7% and it's going
up then maybe 250 and this means that we
need only fit say 15% of the cars of
today is that fine we save 80% so next
idea would be that the problem is with
electrical car and all this energy stuff
the best one is fuel cells to have fuel
or certain in their cars the problem is
you have to exchange them so I I don't
like it my wife hates it or is not it
says she cannot do that this is not the
problem with Google cars or whatever it
is this is service
it comes with few although the taxi
that's easy and we can have a whole new
energy system in the world so I think 1%
of the area of Morocco will well suffice
to to convert Sun into fuel cells that's
it soft
when inserted yes I'm very very old
without teeth I'm living five kilometres
from Heidelberg in a small village and
you cannot buy anything there so it's
all you have to have a car so it's all
and if you have if you are 90 years old
and you don't have a car in the small
village my daughter has to capture me
and give me to a senior or something and
I'm kind of prisoner of with Google
self-driving cars no problem I said just
come bring me to the next supermarket
it's easy everything is solved okay and
this is the revolution so Google has
invested 500 million in the Parcel
Service in California
three months ago 500 million and they
are just delivering the founding a new
poet is just post service delivering
parcels that's it it's very old business
and I bet they gave also 300 million to
over the taxi service the Americans say
uber I think it is from from Nietzsche
this ubermensch you know this is the
uber taxi and you see this is the plan
if if Google is not dumped this is my
only assumption if Google is not dumped
then they will deliver the parcels in
some months or years with a self-driving
car in the next stage they bought also
robot firms there will come a artificial
human beings and giving you the peso
then you are accustomed to having
parcels by self-driving cars and the
next stage will that the taxi service
uber will exchange the drivers for
self-driving Google cars that's it this
is the new area
and you see the only disadvantage also
it saves the world basically you know a
lot of money the energy problems
everything the only problem is in
Germany that 30% of the jobs in Germany
depend on building cars manufacturing of
cars 30% and then of course you need no
tax a gas stations no taxi drivers no
parking slots no parking houses and
everything collapses also immense means
that 50% of the people have to change
their job you see this is only one
industry I can I can have a full talk on
all the others the banks implode into
the internet insurance go and ginger so
so there's a big big change and you have
to think about what what IT means in
this new world
so especially this means that there is a
big big business in in the car in the
car
area - for for technical people and you
have done not only to be a project
manager and leader and an accountant or
something like that but you are oh I
think I'm afraid you have to learn
engineering because this cars cars is
not that there's not impossible to have
a blue screen somewhere on the Autobahn
you know and what what we call security
within the connotation of NSA here is a
real security problem that's all so just
have have a broad broad view on the
coming change we have so I stole from
this book Mehta skills I stole a slide
so means that especially IT is working
to make dump every work down to robotics
also everything is automated like Google
self-driving cars everything is going
this curve so you start with creative
things
and then some people can do it too and
then Indian people can make it for us
one third of the money and then it's
autumn eyes so this curve describes the
mcdonaldization of work and your
personal problem is to stay on the top
else you are autumn eyes that our call
center is iced or something like that
and you see especially always see
there's an ell alliance between managers
accountants and the IT people to to
modernize the worlds also that know
everything is coming down so at least
the last stage is being in a call center
saying yes no I or I don't know and then
it's fully automated in the computer
this is the process of a lot of work is
going to be and upskilling means to stay
up I chose some some profession normal
professions my claim is that that normal
professions are in the middle and by IT
and automation and cloud computing you
are these the the middle column will
vanish and you can choose if you are you
this one or this one if you are a seller
say in your company IBM selling people
they have to choose either they
understand full solution for the
customer
empathy all the full stuff or the
customer buys it on the Internet normal
is not really allowed normal is too
expensive so the customer is willing to
pay for consulting but you then you have
to be the master else he copies slides
from the internet but but normal is
super sensitive that that's my main
message so you can choose
upgrade to the right or going to the
cloud okay this is in you you have to
Google for t-shape personalities you
know this some it has that arrived in
your company is also 15 years old I
think it needs 10 years like the word
comfort so on to penetrate through all
the companies is a t-shape so this is
this is one one imagination what what a
future person should be that means that
you are deep and broad deep means that
you are normal techie and means you can
you can see five kilometres down to the
earth but you were your range of your
mental capacities only some nanometers
you're just deep and you understand from
this from one one topic everything but
ten meters away is enough nothing so
it's like it it's University so there's
a professor is the grand grand grand
grand master of everything in his in his
profession and if he walks 20 meters
away there is a different professor and
they cannot communicate with each other
because they are deep in different areas
okay the other species is manager so
they they have always apologized that
they have no clue of everything because
they are generalists they say so they
know they are very broad they can talk
five minutes about everything but not
only five minutes do you know your boss
please give me some executive summary
that I can survive five minutes with the
customer and after five minutes they can
decide which technical person should
help
and then the peso the technical person
comes this is deep and he cannot explain
what it means you see the manager is
five minutes and then the technical
people one hour and the customer does
not understand the manager and then does
not understand the technician and and
wishful thinking would be to have people
who understand both this one and this
one and this means t-shape what really
teach it means is not it's really
unknown so there are different opinions
and on the web just browse through some
sample mean that technical people should
have some empathy or the soul managers
should like a little bit content so it
differs I have different ones I I
thought about what what the knowledge
for the next age would be I made a small
list first I think I have that what for
my mother if you are German in Germany
in Germany if you get your grades in
that school then above the grade there
are four that you are rated according to
far four base personality habits and in
Germany is flies autumn Petrak mamita
bite this is on mine you know and you
have to study hard
keep order behavioral and and the school
said if the school said you are a number
one and study hard number one and
keeping me number one then you were you
would be a little bit suspicious
so my mama my mum would like it but in
since you are suspicious person it's too
too good so you should have a great be
in everything so what fine but but you
see this is what my mother wanted to be
me to be and this is also an expression
that the society wants me to be this way
and the society wants me to be like a
like a worker in an automobile factory
in just in manufacturing work hard
keeping everything in order make this
modern times with Charlie Chaplin you
know and the these great topics or
issues like a 100 created 100 years ago
and you are educated according to these
skills and they love you if you are this
way and you have to change the
imagination what a human being should be
and I would like to change it from this
one to more complicated one this you see
this is a small list one is read this is
what Tech is not usually don't like to
be able to understand wishes and motives
of clients that if you have a lot of
talks in this you will attend that in
the afternoon
and you will retire from this conference
with maybe no change
you see because you have to leave the
comfort zone for selling competence
that's the problem you will will hear a
lot of talks to this afternoon you you
say yes I understand but you will not
move your obsessive-compulsive Mouse
German sitting there and waiting for
cheese and selling component is bacon
sorry
please go to my homepage or look for
autism quotient at 8aq at autism fortune
there is a test on the Internet take
this I have lots of statistic ten
percent of IBM made me the favor and
gave me their results and the result is
I know you can make 0 to 50 points
normal people normal human beings like
my wife of 15 exactly 50 GS she's
librarian is normal exactly 15 normal
controller manager has exactly 15 I have
statistics on people and computer
scientists have a mean sort of the
median is 23 for IT people 25 for
engineers 27 you have signs of a middle
autism spectrum like espera syndrome you
see and you see you are in danger from
27 up to 27 and the median for engineers
is 25 you know what I mean and this is
your culture and therefore is selling
component is red this is bacon okay and
you have basically you have to change
the in your inner thigh : psychology to
change this it's not easy you can easily
say managers should care for content yes
but for them it's the same problem they
have some other problems you have your
problems managers have their problems I
made a shorter lists also okay I'm
looking today my best example do you
know what what your company does if you
lost the 5 million bid so you were you
were in competition for a large bit and
you lost
for IBM say or reclamators and then we
are very angry really really angry and
the boss is even more angry because he
gets only 9 percent not 10 growth and
then there is kind of funeral so you
come together to a meeting and then you
look for the causes why did we lose this
bit and the session is called lessons
learned and then we are going to the
customers and ask them why did we fail
and the customer usually said the
cooperation was not really fine you did
and did not understand my wishes and you
have a lot of complications in there and
many come many from your companies came
and didn't really understand the problem
you don't have an empathy I felt a
little bit harsh like Asperger people
running around and the other company
didn't did care for me they just care
and then so we our selling guy came back
to us in the meeting until you don't
didn't care and then they go back to the
customer and ask him if our solution was
technically fine selling guy went back
and come came back from the custom and
said your your technical solution was
the best and then we said great we are
the best and then why did we fail and
then we I asked a customer again why did
we fail you didn't care I said but we
are the best and we could not believe
that and then we said so they say this
guy go back to the customer and ask him
maybe they decided on price because we
are the best maybe we are too expensive
and then they're selling like I know you
are maybe cheaper than those people who
were one and then what is the reason and
then also the customer says many many
times the social competence is lacking
the communication come everything is
lacking and you still behave like cheese
and bacon is this and then did you say
this is lessons learned and lessons
learned this is every time the same so
you have two of those sessions a month
title is lessons learned but you don't
leave the your cheese area so you have
to acknowledge that so it's okay
customers do like to be cared so I need
a my my favorite author in books this is
the only one so i admire him i would
like to have written those books is
David Meister with you a not a German
it's David Meister managing a
professional services firm and you can
learn all these things there made a
short list to make to make this point
very clear so so you know that you have
an IQ you know you know that you have no
emotional e.q so it's not there I prove
that because the customer wants to have
EQ the gives a lot of money for a cue
but you you don't have that creativity
is if you have software development in
waterfall model schemes
maybe you are creative talent for
attraction exactly no nothing you say
you hate that it is on one side of the
world is kind of technical people with
Asperger's syndrome and the other side
is Paris Hilton maybe you see Paris
Hilton just makes money
drinking Prosecco and she makes 100
million a year just drinking Prosecco
and saying some silly things and coming
too late you see and you say I hate
these guys and girls doing like that so
I and we have a manager always boasting
around and he earns triple money why is
it they have kind of a talent for
attraction III coined a new word this is
unknown this is entropy see it's to to
make feelings in in your opposite which
are not there so maybe you are this is
if you were younger than you tried it at
with girls of 15 years old that's a
different problem but but you can think
about customers that you seduce them
something but normally technical people
hate that and the most rare is a rarest
thing in in the world is willpower the
real victories with real powers or Steve
Jobs can do that Bill Gates can do that
or the Larry Ellison is really you see a
little bit ugly but very very successful
he has vital competencies so all these
really excellent so you can you can
study all these elephants and normal
autistic people have no willpower
because they know everything autistic
people say I know I know I know and then
the bosses
I don't believe I can honest I can't
understand and then the tech is just
okay I've said that and then you go I
going back to your monitor and working I
still I continue my work please decide
wrong pay through a company and and
willpower means that you shoot down your
boss you just go through all the walls
this is the this is a real real real
real competence you hate this competence
because you know so many people with
wrong willpower this has a reason so the
problem is that the normal company needs
10% willpower in the company 10%
managers say 10% should have the talent
of vital should have a vital
intelligence quotient and you need 10%
but I think there are only 5% there and
therefore they hire all these people who
have violence and they they they make no
difference between violence and vital
competence so and then you have a lot of
violent managers and you hate them but
you see basically you have all in this
room is a very healthy point of IQ in
Berlin today everything is fine but the
others are not there this is the problem
okay I give you better understanding I
explained it in with animals
um imagine a dog it's miniature you take
a stick so it bring it back top does it
the dog is very excited as they give me
a new job so this is manager David give
give give bring the stick it's very
excited give me a new job I want to have
a new responsibility for my career
bring it faster faster even faster i
sweating all the time bring me a new
yeah you understand and you have to to
award the dog so it's very very
important to avoid the dock you have
brave talk brave cooperative man
it gives me a new job see very excited
now a cat stick cat bring it here these
cats are just looking I'm a cat so
because I'm a cat I know what the cat
thinks get things idiot
but says kept bring the stick double in
in half the time a doc would try that
cat looks I am a cat so I know what the
cat thinks kept things it's it's
scientifically it's not possible to make
in a half time idiot so then you can
avoid the kettle ket braise Catherine
please not not not now sometimes cats
love to be but not it's not a ward but
just cheering cats do not like to be
awarded because you see if a manager
comes and say it tells you thank you I
teach super specialists thank you that
you did the project in time and in money
and the cat looks things idiot
you see you you you cannot say thank you
to a cat you could could say master yeah
see and this I mean she meant keeping
off technicians if I would be a manager
I can say master but they say thank you
that you did it in times that because
time and money is their domain and they
they are they thank you for being fine
in this domain they never look if you
have done excellent work so that's not
this is content that one and
they look on the form and then the
methods and she meant keeping of
technical people that would be at least
avoid to say thank you yet with that
many times in IBM let let us thank the
people and I said little please say
master the the problem is that that cats
do not like that the manager comes and
saying you are the master because the
technical people know that he has no
clue what the master is so so if it's a
normal manager comes and say master to
you them you cellulite because because
you don't know what it is so and and
please think a long time about the
difference between cats and dogs so if a
dogs or dogs make meeting so if if dogs
come together they immediately have a
meeting and managers all imagine you go
to a manager and say I have a problem
and you tell them the problem whatever
it is and say to the manager please
think then he looks in a special way
like a dog and says let's have a meeting
or a call or something else and then
they have a call and then they bark
together and and they hope that the
result is there in one hour but nobody
of them is thinking they come without
preparation to the meeting and then bark
bark bark bark and they go away and they
do not think in the meantime they have a
next meeting and then they come together
barking and then you see cat would if
you say to a cat think says okay sit
found things looking for the mouse hours
and hours and hours and feels that the
mouse is coming is hearing a little bit
the other stand is two hours in the
night all this dark complete
Island and then the door comes in could
you say when you are ready the customer
is waiting when did you what is the
expectation when the error is found in
your s AP and then you kill him so yeah
so the the most hatred Monument icky
life is that the manager comes in so
everything is relaxed so very fine
artistic people like that complete quiet
and then comes in what is the status and
you see them you are in the status you
cannot work anymore for hours because
you are yeah okay this is cat and dog I
have statistics on that you can make the
MBTI test on the internet this is the
result for managers oh it's a little bit
rearranged so so one one one I don't
know what it is at one point is one one
percent of this I give very short
explanation this is typical father law
and order this is why we're all the
managers are in the test this is typical
mother is caring this is this is law and
order this is caring this is looking for
the meaning of life and this is
technical content this is the
distribution of managers just law and
order method form command and control
okay and the next one I have made all
the IBM s the top special is a certified
I've ever has made me the test and this
is more than fifty percent are technical
some have a clue what meaning of life
means some are project managers they
have some small talent for that
and nobody is caring
you see this is the basic problem so so
many people are looking why are women so
rare in this field why are women so rare
in the field of management because if
you see the caring people are not there
so so 50% of the women are there but but
they are not needed because the
technicians and the managers feel that
caring is not really what economy is
about and therefore we are going for the
work against walls we have this
financial crisis because nobody cares
and in principle we would know but but
you see nobody is caring and this is the
reason that you lose all your bids you
are losing because you are even less
caring than the technical people from
the other company and nobody is caring
so and David Meister said a professional
is a technician who cares this is very
important both thing look at the
manifesto see if we have a session on
agile after my talk individuals and over
process and tools what does it mean that
means these people have a right not
these ones this is this is documentation
and tools and processes and and then
these people are is it I just keep keep
in mind these two statistics and then
individuals over processes and tools it
means tech is over management working
software over compressed documentation
means Tech is over management customer
collaboration contract new tech is over
these ugly sellers
responding change over following a plan
planners management and this is
basically the manifesto that you are
techies just not more and all the agile
is this comfort zone you feel
comfortable with agile but you are
completely without any success to
convince managers and message
Methodist's and all these kinds of
people to convince them that that they
are wrong human beings you see this is
for cats but most of the power is in
dogs and in meetings and calls and you
are you want to escape them and you have
to convince them that cats is superior
it's a hard task I tell you so please
please if you try to make agile please
know what it means and and I think you
can only have edge well if the cats can
deal with dogs so this is the task you
cannot just have a July cat's because
the power and the money is with dogs and
all the companies I showed you is you
can deal with agile yes but you have to
arrange rearrange that a little bit with
dogs and you should you should look that
the dogs are not doggies fire firing
don't you guys see where doggie fiying
agile also the agile is now first of all
this manifesto is fine the cat can
understand that no documentation no plan
is easy and and then the dogs come and
say at least you should have some rules
in it and then you make they then they
try to make rules and rules and
conferences and rules and after after
five years of agile you have doggy
all the walls and then you have other
rules but it's dark and you have to look
that you stay cat but you have to have
some empathy with dark sorry two
cultures I have read this book they are
some I have to stop there yes I you can
have the flight of course I made some
some cultures just to have a look on
that this is a book on cultures not on
human beings the cultures have some
colors this is color this is old
companies like General Electric Siemens
IBM's is old big big big organizations
in the 60s 70s 80s so everything is on
merit and honor so basically you are
promoted if you are old and you have to
make no errors no fault
you just work work work and then you are
promoted promoted prunes also this is
like dog ok this is a this is a sinking
of the dog this is more German the
Americans have win win at all cost and
the main thing is exploitation
innovation competition scientific
methods
science technology inventions innovation
all these kind of thing and you have to
just make money money money and the
winner takes all the money and the loser
has to say I lost and has to leave the
company in in Germany we have now my
theory is that Germany especially has
gone from well the old America America
was faster so American a 70s 80s was
blue
Germany is kind of blue and the whole
world is migrating to orange and
therefore we have share all
optimization all these kinds of things
the hire and fire losses out losers are
going without money leave them alone
they should work hard I work something
and there are different culture this is
not this is a struggle between kind of
dogs and sharks you know
and the technician people there two more
cultures the one is green this is like
Sweden our monastic monastery or John
Lennon give peace a chance this is we
are community you see it is this is
really worth so thing if you make an
International Studies then you see that
always Sweden Norway and maybe
Switzerland Finland they are winning
they are they are more near to this
models all the the government and the
parties and the people have more disease
mindset and they say all all people
should earn the same and you should try
to be loved by the other people and
maybe the lowest wage to the highest
wage should be one to two or something
like that not more not one to two
hundred words so this is the most
successful this is caring we don't have
caring in this room sorry
so you and and therefore the people say
please team please have a community
please love each other please have
empathy please please please be green
but you stay in something different
most technical people move me to a
yellow yellow means I'm just sitting in
front of my computer and I'm the master
of universe in this nanometer of the
world
and we say this is a new Germany we have
the pirate party and the original idea
of the pilot is being responsibly free
they converted a little bit although
this is too complicated for this party
they are not all not earn only free so
this gives a big mess if you everyone is
free
it means responsibly free and you are
the master and and and maybe the
technical people say if every everyone
is a cat if we have no dogs no sharks in
this world we are sitting on our
computers and make a new version of
Linux and everything is fine you see
this personally I like put this just
meditating and sitting there and this is
the only so if you have only meditate
meditating people sitting around and
looking for a better life then this is a
world of peace and freedom everything is
fine because they don't interact with
each other there if your people were
autistic the world is ideal you know the
problem is you have dogs in the world
and sharks and the others and you have
to work with them so and and they're all
these these these thoughts about agile
and psychology means that you can try to
make the culture of the world a little
bit more yellow plus but be aware you
should have to be you should look for
green and you have to develop some
weapons to to to stay in touch with his
orange people that's a problem so last
slide I found this in an internet for
techies it was originally written for
her giving good keynotes but it's a
different thing
this is complexity and elegance and
non-normal technology people like to be
on the peak of complexity because they
are understanding everything and
normally technical people stand like
here in this direction and they look on
the dumped part of the world because you
are the deep deep deepest of all the
ones in your complicated area and then
the customer comes or your manager and
say explain it to me and then you
explain it on the highest level of
complexity and then the manager or the
customer says please a little bit
simpler and then your brain says yet I
know I'm a cat cat things okay dumbing
down for you and he hates the dark a
little bit because it cannot understand
that and the technical people tend to
dump down so for just for dummies you
you know and what what I'm telling is
the the whatever the real solution of
the technical problem that the cats can
arrange with God is that you you make
real simplicity this means ingeniously
simple not not just dumping down dumb
simple but ingenious simple I think it
has only one guy in the world really is
able to understand that this is chief
job see Ted yeah
you see he made such an iPad this is
just simple as it's in simple a
technician where with full complexity
say you cannot make something with dust
in it you cannot you have no power about
you it's just okay and normal people say
I love it and I say but for technicians
it's too simple
you see you
people with windows their life love
windows it's very complicated my butt
but normal people think my pet is
ingenious my brother-in-law he always
complains he calls me there's a public
company they try to there are robbers a
lot of the internet they say what what's
the problem there's now that is popping
up a window and there's this company
they they I hate this company they I
have fear I said what has this company
the company is called Java they say
download Java 17
what should I do see is it and and for
normal people they have fear and I need
but normal people need not the dumbed
down version but the customer wants to
be is a really simple version and this
is the fine art so I close here I have
the I have it a little bit nicer in
German I this is a very expensive
graphic design problem a newspaper did
for me so I have this one only in German
but but you can understand it English
uses nearly the same means dumping down
this is a little bit just okay this is
perfect smart and ingenious and and
please has a technical person if you
combine all these cars and the dogs and
the Sharks in your life if you have some
empathy then you maybe end with smart
and maybe in some time engine genius but
say say smart okay thank you thank you
very much
so
a question
I hope you enjoyed the talk I hope you
were entertained you engaged with the
app I have two questions for you the
first one is do you know race against
the machine
and would you agree with its thesis Race
Against the Machine basically so so many
people understand that I saw that some
newspaper the world is divided in people
who can program the machines and the
other half of the human beings execute
what the machines say and you have to
stay on the top this is ever the same
team that you have not that the machines
mcdonaldís eyes the world all the work
and you have just to keep up and the
problem is that most of the people don't
like it to be educated or to learn so
basically this is bacon what I meant
good thank you very much then I have
another question so if you cannot say
thank you to a cat and you cannot say
master how do you reward a cat is that
even possible in my surrounding and I
know research is a really techie of
surrounding people and half of the
people didn't even know what what their
salary basis some were their class so we
had bands bent one tooth dead bitten and
they didn't know so I said I'm I'm okay
I'm okay with the money but they they
long for being having a conference in
San Francisco to go to Berlin and and I
would like to when one could avoid cats
with saying you have done fine master
and please select any conference I pay
for that
if the boss would say that it would be
fine you see and see it gives some
freedom and we did it also the same way
that
if you if you are going up as a
technical person you should have lower
utilization so I worked for the decision
in IBM the distinguished engineers the
highest rank has the utilization for the
customer 40% so is it going from 100 to
40 that that means that normal people
lower taken two people should just work
and if you become better and better than
you should work for the company and for
them for customers and for empathy and
for innovation and for the really in
Germany for the wheels for what we mean
with sustainability or not I decided for
for the eternal values and we basically
we try to give cats freedom so freedom
to act yes very good thank you very much
thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
