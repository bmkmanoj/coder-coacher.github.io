well first of all for one reason but
they are really two so the one reason is
that I'm just ending up at the moment
very often to deal more with the
coffered organizational level and trying
to establish the edge of value system
there so not so much anymore dealing
with what's happening inside the project
and that's why I I thought I really want
to share what I've learned there but
also i want to share all the puzzles i'm
still having so I don't provide a lot of
answers here it's also a lot of
questions and so we'll see if it's still
helpful for you to learn about these
questions now this is this is why I
brought this talk however what led me to
that topic these are two reasons so one
reason is that for a lot of projects
which has successfully implemented agile
I have seen several times that the
company all the departments different
levels on the organization around those
projects they said oh but y'all doing
there that's really cool and it seems
it's working we want to do that as well
so it's because it works so well they
want to scale it to the organizational
level at in different areas and the
other reason is maybe more than negative
reasons which is well the project's say
we could be much more beneficial if the
company around us wouldn't put so much
burden on us and so many constraints on
us and we cannot get the whole profit or
benefit from what we are doing because
the organization doesn't support the
values we are supporting so two reasons
why that I believe this is happening at
the moment that actually is going more
to the corporate level and again
I have to repeat that I'm not providing
a lot of answers maybe a few ideas and
experiences but also like puzzles ok so
and this yeah it is working so I have a
little agenda first of all a look into
different processes inside the
enterprise what they are doing how I see
them then the integration of the
organizational processes yeah trust and
transparency is a big one coffee and
then supporting individual development
and this is there every other way where
HR especially plays a bigger role so
just for you what's coming up looking at
the processes in the enterprise first of
all the organizational structure well
there's a reason why we have that the
idea was always well we want to combine
the forces and make and the knowledge of
course and the experience and make that
available to all others who might need
them no matter what it is it can be
operations controlling QA whatever it is
so having an organizational structure in
terms of departments linear or
departments typically has that idea to
assemble all the knowledge and wisdom
experience at one place and make it
available for others which is a good
idea I think however it seldom really
works out very often what I see is
what's happening is that the department
start to control each other instead of
supporting and serving each other so it
kind of turned into a something else and
into something different that it was
originally thought of or was what was
the original goal so then the way I am
dealing with it actually I had once they
experience and i will also refer to
learn
a few times once the experience very
really managed to are we still doing
that to turn the organization around so
creating different structures in the
organization and and maybe just for you
why this happened in that case was
because that company and ERP provider
well creator producer not the big one
not the German people no no no um they
just had this or they just have likely
they still have this one product the air
p system and this means the whole
company is shaved around this product
meaning if product development changes
which it has changing to a natural way
this just means the whole company has to
do something about that as well because
the company just has that one product
there's no other reason for the company
to be there and therefore it's kind of
naturally came that we had to change it
around however that's not my normal
situation my normal situation is that
there is a like a really large company
like yeah Germany would be like semen
Soren I don't know probably around here
not exactly here but Sweden it would be
more something like Ericsson also so
really the large ones and we just do in
one place establish a child development
but we still have to deal with all the
departments so what we are doing is we
try to bring them in and talk to them as
soon as possible so integrate them early
on and ensure that they still have their
position and place but also that we
demand the service and support from them
and we don't accept that they are
controlling us so it's more powerful
ship relationship but we are creating
right from the beginning which is often
different for them it very often I
experience that they say well this is
cool that you're talking to us that
early in the process because normally
all of those surrounding departments
they are only talked to at the very end
when the project is finished
and so this is a different thing meaning
and I will come back to that as well
probably several times meaning that
their stakeholders just like other
stakeholders around us yeah
misunderstanding matcha manifesto I'm
not sure if you have recognized the
mistake that's that I could on this
slide already you some time to recognize
it you saw it very good BF one who
recognized a mistake very good okay so
so the point is very often people think
that it's more important to have the
processes in place and ensure that the
process are really processes are really
working the way they should and so in
the really large organization stairs and
often even a separate department at your
own ones called them famously the
methodology police yeah we we have those
often called like methodologies and
approaches or something like that and
it's like oh yeah separate Department
the same thing is happening for all
different technologies tools and so on
so again remember what I said at the
beginning there's a good reason to have
that because you want to assemble all
the knowledge at one place and provide
that support to others but it turns out
to be more controlling thing than a
healthy thing and it's same with ya
tools technologies actually and i'm not
sure if you're happy to hear that but i
see this also happening with scrum so
that the company decides for scrum and
then well ok the methodology police is
now ensuring everyone is really
following that scrum process exactly how
we think it should be done this isn't
actually it's not at all and we really
have to remember that and ensure that
actual is about it has to fit to the
actual needs and
two leads as always well it's not that
we want people to be happy and and like
their job that's hopefully that the
taste but we want to provide business
value that's the reason you want to
maximize the business family and that's
why we need a process that helps us to
do that and typically if we are able to
do that then people like that job as
well better so that's kind of a second
thing to it okay that means everything
might differ and I give you a few
examples about how for example processes
can differ i had i think several times
the experience well we had a larger
project and within that project we had
like maybe ten teams or so some of them
quite big others quite small and small
you might even think maybe this isn't
really a team but for various reasons we
thought this is the right size and the
right size for something like two or
three people well with two or three
people sitting in one room I'm on one
hand uncertain why they would need a
scrum master it's just yeah okay the
other thing is when they start to run a
daily scrum I think something is wrong
something is completed wrong if they are
sitting in that same room they should
know what's going on this is a smell if
it's a team so small and now sitting
together and they're working together it
seems download working together so we
have a problem another example about
architecture framework platform services
i Chust head recently so a technical so
sometimes so there was a decision from
the enterprise which runs many many
different product developments so it's a
mix of software and hardware development
and they decided on a specific framework
so they say everyone has to build on
that framework so we
have a like a common platform which well
generally this could make sense right
however that was this one Roger weld
nuts that start in every way so it's a
medical product development and in
various ways not not the semen so I
didn't mention the name of that company
um and most of the devices were like
really huge machines laboratories by
themselves and and things like that so
and the framework was exactly for that
like this huge devices and there was
this project this out project which was
more the application where it analysis
where it is analyzing also different
values that get into the system and
until what it was maybe some blood
analysis whatever it was and they were
still forced to use this framework which
didn't make sense at all because it was
a completely different world that we're
living in but still they were forced to
do that so there's often like I don't
know stupid stuff happening and that's
also of conversational influence on the
different projects okay I want to talk a
little bit about the organizational
processes and how maybe to integrate
them and maybe he realize now already
that you don't give enough answers as
here are a few qm recommendations at
least so in the places i'm working in we
can never just get started and and work
on the system and then we'll sprint
after sprint deciding well maybe now the
business value is good enough and
therefore we ship we always before we
start have to say like this is when we
deliver the first release and this will
roughly be in that release and then a
lot of stuff around that is styling it
depends on the business
and so it might be that okay we align
that with a fair that's coming up or
something so we do have to provide some
kind of estimate early on and at that
point in time to be the team is not
there the team is busy doing some other
projects so it might even be it's long
before the actual project starts because
it's just bidding for our business
proposal also and we still have to
provide any kind of number now the
problem is always when then development
starts everyone is upset about those
numbers because well we haven't given
those numbers and they are not whatever
estimated correct i don't know but still
but the thing i believe we really should
do is using those estimates and i don't
really like to call them estimates
because they are not using those as the
budget so saying okay this is what we
promised in that first release and
therefore we can only develop that much
so that we are not running it over
budget and time so typically what's in
that release at the time where the
budget was created it doesn't say
clearly what exactly in detail in that
release it says roughly what's in it and
this is also how we should treat it I
can't imagine that it's not really used
to a lot of you that the thing is our
attitude to it so our attitude to it we
have that with our own estimates often
as we usher in the p.o to prioritize so
we know we discard more or less in order
to stay within the our own estimates but
the same should be true with the
estimates that somebody else has given
and this is that kind of maybe the
normal thing um so it's not nice man
it's a budget or it is like an
investment we want to take
or put into that part of the development
that's how do we should regard this very
much related to that as how to deal with
the legal department as you probably
know I'm not a lawyer so I don't know
much about that the first thing that
should be still clear with all the
contracts that I made is that we have to
accept these interdependencies between
times Cove the resources which is the
money and the people and technology tech
technical constraints and of course the
quality and whenever we make a change in
one of the variables it has effect on
one of the variables and that should be
clear for everyone and so it definitely
should go into the contract so if we say
we want that release be out earlier it
means there is less in it or if we want
to have more functionality well it will
either take longer the quality will go
down or we have to leave something else
out it has to be a conscious decision of
course agile decision again would be
these coping but the point is that has
to be clear for the legal department but
this is not the only thing what I find
even more important is that in the
contracts well maybe it's not directly
in the contracts at least that's not how
I did it again because I'm not a loyal
but what we did often was writing up an
addendum to the contract very as well
put in all the things we value what is
important for us well use have to be
there because they mark how we build
this side once we have to make a
decision and if we all agree on the same
values it's not so difficult to do that
really and maybe they're one one thing
here which is yeah including the optic
of the customer as you might know I
mentioned it briefly a few sentences
back and from Germany and in Germany we
have as the governmental official
process model process called the beam
model maybe some of you have heard about
that so this is like the official thingy
they had been ever mission a few years
back and part of that revision was that
for the first time they had an a
statement they're saying that the
customer is part of development in that
sense that the customer has to provide
feedback and help finding out what's
really required and this is really I
think create that finally something like
that is in a process like the official
process and where governments reliable
because before that it was always well
the gospel customer states at the
beginning this is what I want and then
let me leave me alone and just do do
stuff and come back to me and now we are
saying well definitely we need the
feedback because otherwise we cannot be
successful this means also if it's now
not a V model then even more so we have
to put in the contract that feedback
from the castro customers absolute
requirement so even if you let most of
the contract in place how it is already
so coming up with a few other things um
marketing and sales well one one thing
is that very often they just rule the
world it's really kind of what that
total development manager once said it's
just they dictate how much has to go in
the project in the product and what are
the coolest features and how can we sell
that in the best way and if we listen to
marketing and sales all the time it's
obvious then we had that one of the
false variable quality will go down
because
nobody wants to investigate in that
because that's nothing we can sell at
first sight but later on they will come
and say well but it doesn't really work
but they will not show up in marketing
and sales they will show up somewhere
else so that's why they don't care and
they still will dictate that so this is
probably again something which is not
really news to you but we have to ensure
that because of that reason that QA is
really part of the process right from
the beginning because we won't have time
later on and I want to point out what I
believe it was safe Thomas at maybe two
years back or three years back at the
edge of conference where he made a
statement that we should assure that
there are no nutty functional
requirements and the point is not that
there are really no non functional
requirements it's just if we call them
like that they sound like they don't
provide any functionality which is just
not true and they also sound like nobody
really wants that there's no stakeholder
who really wants those and that's also
not true and so what we need to do is to
bring those non functional requirements
into the well real requirements and the
way we did that in several broad chains
was well on the one hand it's part of
the definition of done and on the other
hand it's part of the except those
criterias for the different user stories
and I believe that's the only way how
they will get a dress and get the right
priority whenever you list them
separately somewhere they will never
make it well at the very end devil but
then it's probably too late and too
difficult to bring those in okay
operations well first of all operations
is chest as stakeholder as anybody else
and I don't want to really go into
details there's a lot of happening at
the moment about continuous
liberate their Bob's Charles talk about
lean startup later on so this is the
focus on that however even if you are
not changing radically to continuous
delivery you still should ensure that
operations is just a stakeholder and
treat them like a regular customer and
not only talking to them at the very end
so if things are changing so delivering
early regularly something has to happen
here as well and we cannot economic so
I've seen too many projects struggle
because of that so there was a regular
releasing but it never went out of the
door because of that yeah not an option
to make operations just part of your
team okay isn't it an option to make
operations part of the team actually
this is true for I believe all those
organizational or business processes and
talking about here you could also say
why isn't marketing and sales part of
your team and even if we move on later
on why isn't HR part of your team and
yeah it would be cool if we would it
would be really interdisciplinary and
cross-functional through all the
departments but point for me is that
most of the times I don't have the power
to turn the whole organization around so
like they tip like if at the beginning
like in Siemens I cannot tell them okay
now you have to provide operations
within our team they just there's their
me so I can do that with small company
so with the one with the ERP systems
also there this is just a single product
and therefore they have to shape around
that product what makes the most sense
and then they come up with something
like that so I guess what I'm saying is
it would be great to solve it this way I
can't because I don't have the power to
do that so basically if you can't make
someone part of you
sign em stay cool that's a very good
point if I can tell what is were saying
if I can't make somebody part of my team
I assign them the role of the
stakeholder and that's true in almost
all cases at the moment I'm not sure if
it's really true in all cases but maybe
it is so it's really kind of backing up
um but making the power stakeholder and
having more a relationship that's based
on providing a service often helps much
better into well improving their
collaboration we are having and going
away from this controlling structure or
throwing over ball approaches and things
like that and here we are a customer
orientation that's exactly the point so
all those business processes around us
actually s is the chest that should be
treated more as stakeholders customers
and therefore we provide a service
sometimes of course it should also be
the other way round via a customer for
the others so they should provide a
service for us so it can go either way
and therefore they should be as well
clear in the stories for example so
every feature or story isn't for an end
user only business value isn't marked by
end user value only there are a lot of
other people who have an interest in
that product and they are as important
as our people are and we have to
acknowledge that trust and transparency
and I wanna apologize at this moment
that I think probably the next two
slides are maybe growing because I I
want to go over something I find is too
important before i make point that one
of me and i'm sure you all know that
that's why hey I portlet chance you so h
OS based on trust that's at least what a
lot of people say it so we want to have
trusted relationship amongst the team
also to the customer and to all the
people around us who we are working with
well that's the first thing the other
thing is that well building up trust
always works that way that somebody has
to make the first step and trust
somebody else so it just doesn't emerge
naturally it always is created by
somebody is giving trust and then trust
is emerging and evolving and I have this
quote from Tom democracy shared the
story I think it was last last year at
the old p conference in germany where he
told this little story amateur if you
can relate to it but his daughter major
try major drivers license and of course
he was a proud father and talk about
well now she's gonna happen and this was
all fine so maybe they even celebrated
together and so on and then they came
this saturday evening where his daughter
came up to him and said well dick i want
to go out with my friends can i have
your new BMW to go there and i'm not a
really good actor but the way he
described it and showed it was it was so
obvious that he really really struggled
with the decision and then finally he
kind of biting tongue and put move the
keys over the tails and okay yeah you
can have it right but how can you ever
approve that she is trustworthy if if
not everyone is trusting her so and this
is to an as well of course in the
working relationship so it's always
somebody i used to make the first step
whatever this is interesting something
um but that's the one thing i want to
say the other thing about justice that
in my experience it's created by open
honest transparent communication so
these are the values that have to be in
place in order that a trusted will
trip is really emerging and if one of
them isn't really there it will not work
and I guess you all have experienced
that as well if the thing wrong things
are the Miss honest things are making
make transparent that doesn't help
anyone and often you can see if Trust is
not there if people try to formalize
things so they say well we have to make
a note that he said listen bed then
because later on he will otherwise say
he never said so and and things like
that so to make as put as much formalism
into whatever we are doing as possible
as a very good sign for a mr. ested
relationship and maybe we should then
work on something else and not on
providing more rules and formulas Lee um
that's a bit the next kind of a
repetition here like transparency why do
we want that you want to have shared
ownership shared knowledge we don't want
to have pet monopolies we want that
everyone can contribute to the same
thing we are working on right and well
what I see in sometimes is that if
things are made transparent but trust is
not there then this is regarded as
controlling and the example I had have
is something that just occurred to me
recently so I went to a customer and I
so I haven't been there much so I went
in and was showed around and so the head
everywhere those big screens where we
could see like JUnit tests pass and fail
and sprint burn balance from team x and
y so how are they doing in order to roll
down the tasks they have planned for the
sprint right so this was there you I see
a lot of people nodding so you know that
thing so and that well these were like
amateur like fall huge buildings in all
of the buildings you could see for all
the actual tea
not fully other teams you could see all
these information at first I thought oh
that's cool they making this really
transparent then so everyone can see and
I guess it's also a motivation and blah
blah the team's hated it I really hated
it and the reason was that management's
use those things like whenever they sell
well unit testing pass or sprint down
bailed on you will not make the spring
they ensure that they know that they
really have to do a better job well that
was a polite way to expressing what's
happened what happened there so it was
really obvious that the transparency
like the trust and therefore it didn't
fulfill in any kind that the need or the
intention of it and so my recommendation
in that case was really as long as it is
like that get rid of those streets just
they are not helpful hearing it's just
the opposite right so they are hindering
the progress and as well maybe you want
to think about that in general so
talking of scrum and also XP and most of
the other agile processes we have this
notion of the iteration and the
iteration as a means of protecting the
team to actually getting that job done
therefore we should also always trust
them to get that job done meaning
everything that's happening inside that
iteration is another self-organization
of that team and it's not something that
has to be reported wherever too so
whatever reporting is happening there
it's for all the team members and not
for anyone else because we rely on that
they are able to steal themselves if
they recognize that they are not on
track and it's not that somebody from
outside has to jump in there so that's
them conte productive otherwise
therefore only like the progress report
at the end of the sprints is that what
should be reported like
simple thoughts the hurricane okay
that's good tightening seems to be good
so Polly individual development that
side belief one with my favorite topics
and you will yes minute you will see why
I'm sure so first of all speaking of
agreement on objectives a good friend of
mine he always says with he's working
with teams and somebody makes something
really stupid so he just came to explain
himself why did he do that often it's
also like technical things so why did he
now use that library which we don't
really need when he always makes a
better and his bed is I bet that this is
in the agreements on objectives for that
person that he has to learn about that
library and really yeah real thing is
that you always wanted a bit it's always
like that which means well the way most
of the time objectives are handled they
are not helpful again it's something
that I understand why we would have that
where we want to have that it's
absolutely obvious and clear and it
should tell people to ya develop
themselves or personal development is
here the topic right so it absolutely
useful but the way we are using it it's
just stupid one thing and I jump to the
to the last point here one thing is why
it is stupid whenever something is
connected to bonus to money and people
just do things although they know that's
not a good decision at the moment but if
my photos depends on it of course I do
that and yeah I think that's human and
the other thing is that very often they
are just too long-term oriented so short
term objectives makes much more sense
and also
if the object is like other stories are
developed from the person who really
wants then that's the one who wants to
reach the objective so also asking the
people then to define the acceptance
criteria but I assume you're not the one
who can change that so I just want to do
my rent on that um and now we're coming
to my favorite slide is my favorite
actually I've been running out of space
because as you see I had the whole kind
bad stuff is left out here I'm sorry but
I didn't mean to leave them out I just
ran out of space okay well what to do
with that well first of all I want to
show you something else which relates to
that which is how agile Alliance puts
itself to these certifications and the
actual Alliance says more or less well
we don't believe in them the way they
are created at the moment and also that
we believe more in that it's important
that people are able to attest a depth
and keep learning so getting a snapshot
from what I don't they have rather in
terms of knowledge for a given moment
isn't really helpful so this is I think
a strong statement the engine Alliance
meet them and for the certification I
think I have to cook because I like that
slide so much so I go back to that right
we want to see that um I want to share
one thing that I'm still struggling so
of course I'm also certified I'm a
certified scuba dive master so I also
have the master in it right so cool and
i also bought what would it mean if my
education
scuba dive master would have been the
same ask let's pick the one that's
obvious the scrum master so the way that
this would have thought would be like
okay I'm going to in today's class we
know all that then there's somebody who
tells me about well buoyancy in the
water also some physical laws that take
place once you are in the water of what
to do with the pressure that's higher
than in the air right also some medical
stuff what can happen medical wise how
you can secure somebody else and of
course the technical equipment oh but
stuff really Brooks and so on so that's
I could learn all that that's wonderful
and of course I would make a test after
the two days where I should state well
did I really learn what that instructor
told me it's very cool it's still fine
but the pine is now after those two days
I would be allowed or people would treat
me as somebody who is enabled or capable
of leading a group of people under water
and ensuring the security for them and
the safety i think is right i'm not sure
if you recognize that yet but i haven't
been in the water yet right and that's
the real real dangerous play at least i
think okay okay so this is probably this
is today my reins over a lot of things
after you said okay um i had this whole
topic in individual development personal
development because it's part of that i
believe so we we all want to learn and
grow and get better improve in all of
that and HR can take a role there they
can take a role well of course also by
requiring that people are certified
something or they can let go of that and
and what they really can and maybe using
actually after I did that rent I had
really great experiences with my
certifications using them as an
incentive after somebody has been on a
project for a year or so so that's a
good way of motivating people um okay so
this is one thing i wanna i think i want
to share story about HR because i'm
still so impressed about that so it's a
customer of mine who approached me
saying well maybe your fruit things like
that that clients say they are not
releasing often enough and therefore but
their clients say they follow this
should turn into an actual company and
do actual development in order to be
flexible and faster and lockable and so
they read a little bit about agile and
once they called me there was one person
who was passionate but passionate about
hecho anyway for a while so actually
this phone call is probably four years
ago so it's not like the parent news
story but what's really amazing and it's
still the only story a half in that area
the other person who was on the phone
was somebody from a charm but the head
of HR because they said well we have
looked into what actual really is and
really recognize it has to do a lot with
personal development and therefore we
think we have to support it and that's
actually what they did so one thing that
I did was enabling different communities
in the company so so that they can have
an experience exchange who is working
with law than what's helping with
hindering and all that across different
projects and the other thing is helping
them really to become more self
responsible for example what they did as
well was everyone who wanted to help and
support other projects once you have
done your
project s whatever as a developer in the
natural team and you want to help others
so we call this a peer coaching concept
they sent the people to a training where
I learned what it means to be a coach
nothing to do with IT or anything right
but it's what does it mean to be a coach
and so they did a lot of things in that
area meaning of a big emphasis on soft
skills and so on and I still wonder why
is this to my knowledge the only company
where the introduction and the spreading
of agile has been supported by HR and
just put two ite only because that's not
the only thing we need here and of
course I also believe I have at least a
part of the answer and one answer i'm
having that in a lot of companies i'm in
i often don't see HR as well as let's
say being enabled may be tied my SATs
put it this way to really do personal
development they are too busy just
entering interviews and whatever doing
all the regulation stuff and so they
can't do them but i would think is their
real job and that's probably one of the
reasons but i guess the other reason is
as well that we don't bring it to the
attention of them that this could be a
great leverage to move on with that okay
and i come to my final thoughts and this
is really cool because i want to share a
last thing here which is we are talking
about at the co-operative level at the
organizational level and how hrs may be
working there or maybe not i really
believe there is a reason why actual is
still successful people are still
talking about it although it's not the
newest kid on the block anymore
know that as well right around for a
while but still it seems to be
successful and still people are doing it
it changes what they are doing is that
will XP at the beginning thence from now
maybe can bond and then maybe they start
from the beginning again and I might to
read it again experience a light it
doesn't really matter but that the
actual as an attitude as a culture is
something that's still spreading and I
believe there's a good reason for that
and the good reason now it might be
weird I know for you is that people say
at the moment we are at the beginning of
the third Industrial Revolution and
meaning that the whole way we are
working in our industry all over the
world will change and there are already
some signs and I'm not talking about the
signs that we heard in the keynote maybe
some of them are all related but well
first of all all industrial revolutions
have started based on energy so there
was energy available the way we got this
and that term play industrial
revolutions and what's happening at the
moment is that energy most likely will
be more decentralized which also has an
effect on how industries room so that we
are getting away from centralized
organizations more to networks and which
means also that we have to trust album
notes on the network so trust will get a
big one collaboration will get a big on
communication is because all of these
things I'm saying at the moment is not
that it's really me as Utah as the
actual coach is saying that that's what
people say who claimed about or talked
about the third Industrial Revolution
who don't know I believe anything about
a chore but ok but I think this is the
reason why actual is still spreading and
throwing because it fits exactly in that
movement that's happening at the moment
and may
not so positive thing about that that
they're saying well it probably takes
till 2015 50 till we are really there so
i'm not sure and probably not my choco
chip those days and still I think this
is a movement that's taking place and
there's probably a reason why people
talk about agile also on different
levels also on like the organizational
level the corporate level and why it is
important to talk about this right now
because these values are the ones that
are brought forward at the moment maybe
one one last note to that is that
another thing like people think the
third Industrial Revolution is happening
is that because then I think it's called
the Generation Y or even set already you
see they have been throwing up all they
are growing up without hierarchical
structures I would like people like me
where we at least believe people like me
we grew up in like sports club or maybe
in church communities all with a very
hierarchical structure organization
that's not the thing anymore people like
network and they get together and
collaborate and then they go it then
leave each other alone again and then
they come together again so it's more
like the only thing or so and this is
how they grew up and this is also the
reason why it's very likely that they
don't want to work in hierarchical
organizations and people recognize that
already and say it's difficult to really
get people who are willing to work in
these like departmental structure
organizations and therefore something
has to change okay I think I leave you
with these thoughts dreaming of the
third Industrial Revolution maybe that's
what I do
and I want to thank you very much and I
hope you will have a great conference a
lot of inspirations and good talks
networking thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
