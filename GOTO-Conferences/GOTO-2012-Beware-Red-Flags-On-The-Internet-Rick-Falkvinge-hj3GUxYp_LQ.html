start how many in here have heard of the
Swedish Pirate Party let's see a show of
hands I'd say that's about two thirds
which is pretty consistent across the
entire planet actual is I usually put it
in the slides no matter where I present
on the world this is consistent and just
for kicks now this is Denmark but still
how many in here have heard of any other
Swedish political party let's see a show
hands ok this is Denmark so most people
here are familiar with Scandinavian
politics otherwise it's usually just
scattered hands in the audience but a
brief introduction to those of you who
haven't heard of us we like the net we
like copying and sharing and we like
civil liberties for that some people
call us pirates probably in an attempt
to kind of make us feel shame and not
beat not talk as much about what we
think and how societies it should look
like as I want it didn't work we stood
tall instead and have two seats in the
European Parliament 50 seas in German
state Parliament's we have about 200
seats and local councils across Europe
and at last and we are in 56 countries
a brief introduction of where we stand
and we started out in Sweden today we're
going to talk about a bit about read on
the net this is not your symbolic
warning flag it's actually a very
tangible red flag that somebody was
waving that we gotta look out for and it
came from mid 1800s united kingdom but
first before we go there how many near
knew who the pioneers in digital
photography were very scattered hands so
they were
so tell you what I had officers training
in the military this should not be a
problem the two pioneers the tuner
pioneers in digital photography work
cook or Polaroid you know you remember
this camera that's all the rage now and
Instagram even took it as they're either
right encoder you remember these small
round black boxes that contain these
rolls of film that you weren't even a
lot of pink through scanners at airports
and which still have these please do not
take film through the standard it may be
damaged yeah like that happens Polaroid
120 in 2001 despite being an agent
digital photography and then again in
2008 coda went bankrupt this year in
January because despite the fact they
were pioneers in digital photography
they decided that this technology was
going to cannibalize their existing cash
cows their existing revenue trees so
they took out a couple of patents and
then did not develop the technology they
did not bring it to market they did not
innovate this was a typical for a
dominant industry for dominant player in
any industry the oh yes there to stock
two companies stocks here coding event
to the first digital camera in 1976 they
are the 25-year ling of the competition
and they went bankrupt this year because
that they didn't do anything about it
the other is candy I'll tell you kids
which is which this is a typical mostly
comment on it comes w no one who
acknowledged instead they try to kill it
they claim that their special interest
is the public interest and therefore
they should have laws that ban the new
technology okay maybe in the end thank
you sir ah look at that so that was a
quick introduction as today's
entertainment we're going to talk about
a little bit about who the pirate party
is and where we come from it's not going
to be a political lecture it's going to
be for background orientation as to
where do we come from when we're making
these observations we're going to talk
look about how incumbents typically
react they typically don't react it all
by just ignoring the technology and
going bankrupt 20 years later I'm going
to look at industries that have been
threatened by information by the net and
take a little bit bit look in a crystal
ball as to which industries could
possibly be next can we already see the
signs we can and depending on your
perspective it's either very very scary
or bring out your popcorn fun and after
that of course we're going to have a
coffee break being a speaker on Monday
morning and being the only thing that
stands before the or between the
audience and coffee is a bit it's always
a bit of a challenge
so who are we we we most often called a
protest party as in we're not that we
don't have valid ideas we're just
unhappy with the way things are but
there's a difference here in just saying
protest or mayor defiance if you're just
sticking it to the man that's one thing
but dissenting disagreeing with the
status quo is dissent by definition and
this has happened many many many times
over when 40 years ago you had the
Greens that protested pollution and went
to here to have a narrow platform a
regulating industry 40 years ago you had
a workers movement that came 80 years
ago and protested exploitation of
workers you you had liberals that
protested overarching rights of King and
the church 120 years ago so we can solve
that this goes in about 40 years 40
years cycles and 40 years ago you'll
remember that the rallying cries of the
youth at the time was 68 vietnam war
peace and love usually associated with
your joint peace and love man which then
sort of matured politically into
sustainability which has many many more
syllables and don't sound at all as good
in that context but works for having a
political platform we observed that 17
year olds of today have for the first
time ever a different priority than what
they had in the 70s surveys are done we
are done regularly on the values of 17
year olds because the values you have
when you're 17
tend to stick with you for the rest of
your life therefore the values of 17
year olds are a great predictor of what
politics and discussion in society will
look like in the following three decades
and it's no longer sustainability that's
on top of 17 year olds minds it's free
speech and openness and this is where
politicians go absolutely question on +
as in completely not understanding the
issue what do you mean free speech we
had that for hundreds of years yeah we
did we had but now you're selling it to
the highest corporate bidder we have a
problem with that easiest expressed as
leave the net alone and if you want to
see what this does to democracy you can
always look at Egypt one year ago when
President Mubarak X President Mubarak
important wanted to keep people indoors
and thought about how to accomplish that
when it with respect to the net now I
have no idea what this guy was thinking
that if you want to keep people indoors
and keep them from rioting rioting he's
taking away their games and porn it
sounds like you'd want to do the exact
opposite but what do you know what we're
demanding isn't really rocket science at
the end of the day if you were looking
at the letter in the mail 40 years ago
in our parents sent a letter in the mail
that letter had certain characteristics
to it it was anonymous you and only you
would determine whether you identified
yourself a sender on the outside of the
letter for the world to see on the
inside 11 for only the recipient to know
or frankly not at all it was secret in
transit nobody would open the letter to
see if it contained something copied it
was untracked you couldn't possibly see
who was sending what by mailboxes and
the mailman was never responsible for
the contents of a message
what we are demanding is not rocket
science merely that our children have
the same rights that our own parents had
and at this point in particular the
copyright industry jumps up and down and
says we can't possibly allow that if you
allow anybody to send anything to
anybody we can't make money anymore and
this is where I go so what it's every
entrepreneurs job to make money given
the current constraints of society and
technology you don't get to dismantle
civil liberties because you can't make
money otherwise if you can't make money
in the face of sustained civil liberties
you get to sell mustard instead it's
perfectly reasonable that our children
have the same rights I'll Parenthood
regardless whether somebody can no
longer profit entirely regardless and
these values is why you're seeing
rallies or freedoms of speech across
Europe this is a map of the anti actor
protests earlier this year I think it's
a quite impressive map apparently so did
the politicians in the European
Parliament which is why actor was
eventually killed in the European
Parliament to the horror of the
incumbents that's where we come from so
let's take a look more closer look at
the incumbents and these red flags in
particular in the UK mid 1800s
Industrial Revolution was having an
immense pace people's lives were
changing and the automobile had just
started arriving in streets although it
wasn't necessarily called the automobile
you had to sort of see it in the context
of its time and we also knew that all
new technology always creates a lot of
enthusiasm with legislators with people
and in particular with the current
industries who stand to lose from it
seeing this as a perfectly logical next
step and unfortunately it does scare
people new technologies tend to scare
people if they push out of their comfort
zone and it's not just people as again
going back to mid 1800s we can see that
it had more excess effects than that and
in the streets of then England so after
a lot of debate there was a law made
which was called the red flag act of
1865 this law mandated that any car
horseless carriage automobile on the
streets are the United Kingdom should
have a crew crew of three people it
should have a driver fair enough I guess
Google's cars didn't exist in 1850s it
should have a stoker as in a machine
operator an engine operator and it
should have a red a person waving a red
flag in front of the car walking before
the car and that's the red flag this had
a number of effects first of all it the
law also said that the maximum speed of
any car in an urban area is three
kilometers an hour but since you had a
law saying that somebody must walk in
front of the car waving a red flag the
speed of the car was automatically
limited to walking speed
so the car was used under this law to
transport cargo and passengers to
railroad stations and stagecoach
stations which of course was the
transportation of its time stayed
stagecoach stations being a multi
carriage multihulls carriage which took
long distance and railroad has had
recently arrived with the Industrial
Revolution there it turned out much much
later that the reason or the people
pushing for the red flag act limiting
the usefulness of the car and only
embracing it as far as it could feed
this railroad and stagecoach industries
with passengers the people who had been
secretly lobbying for this law was the
railroad and stagecoach industries this
is a red flag maneuver you pretend to
embrace a new technology you talk about
how fantastic it is and at the same time
you lobby to limit its usefulness limit
its usefulness so that it can only serve
your purpose and can never get to
challenge you the car was banned from
competing with the dominant industries
of its time but and this is important
only in Britain as a result of the red
flag act in united kingdom germany's car
industry got a 20 year head start over
the united kingdom
and here's the difference between the
public interest and the special interest
the special interest was allowed to
portray itself as a public interest and
therefore turned out that it actually
set United Kingdom 20 years behind
saving jobs is only valuable when the
industry isn't already obsolete if an
industry is obsolete saving jobs in it
is counter productive policy and we see
politicians yet we see politicians doing
exactly this all the time and i'll get
back to very specific examples you also
have electric car batteries for a more
contemporary example it was said that
the electric car would never work that
you could never produce batteries that
was strong enough that you were large
enough that were cheap enough to produce
it turns out that there's been a patent
on this since roughly 20 years ago so it
should be about to expire it was bought
by General Motors and I guess pretty
much nobody is surprised you can check
this out on Wikipedia it's just a search
for patent encumbrance of electric car
batteries and you'll find it immediately
same thing there the special interest is
allowed to override the Public Interest
red flag maneuver and let's see how this
is being repeated information just to
understand how this is being repeated
with a net information is dangerous
information is so powerful it can unseat
kings or prime ministers or mayor's for
that matter and the people being
unseated tend to not like that very much
the United States is not particularly
fond of julian assange information can
be extremely powerful when I speak to
sociologists about the net they
generally divided into two groups the
first group says that the net is the
largest invention of mankind since the
printing press of just over 500 years
ago the second group disagrees with this
and says that no the net is the largest
invention of mankind since the written
language 6,000 years ago in terms of how
much it changes the power structures in
society for the net is the greatest
equalizer mankind has ever invented it
puts my voice on the exact power of
strength with a nine-year-old girl in
Paraguay who just got her first laptop
on the d1 laptop a child program and
that has never been true before in the
history of humankind this is a great
boon to mo to almost everybody except
those who happen to be in power at the
moment so let's see what happened before
when the Catholic Church had a monopoly
on knowledge and culture we're talking
pre printing press here the Catholic
Church decided what was true if the
village power issue village preacher
said something it was true pretty much
by definition
the Catholic Church never had to worry
about a law being written against it in
its interests for his control the entire
worldview of the legislators who wrote
the laws in this day and age monks
copied books by hand in a very laborious
process onto sheepskins and cough skins
it was an immense work and then in 1453
the printing press struck how will the
monks get paid if we print if we're
using this printing press device it was
a crisis of information and the Catholic
Church didn't really see themselves as
any kind of bad guys here they just
wanted to make sure that the public had
accurate information and there was a lot
of misinformation being spread about by
this new strange invention the printing
press all of a sudden everybody and
their brother started being able to
spread ideas thoughts observe Asians
they started questioning things very
very dangerous so following the advent
of the printing press laws against it
gradually appeared in Europe laws
against copying ideas gradually appeared
in Europe laws against copying texts
appeared but they didn't work they
didn't work once you had tasted what is
was like to be able to speak freely you
could not unlearn that and yet the
Catholic Church and the Kings
kept ramping up the penalties until it
culminated in the death penalty by
hanging for unauthorized copying in
France January 13 1535 it still didn't
work at that point kings and bishops
realized that okay so if the death
penalty still doesn't deter copying we
obviously need something else and here's
where red flag maneuver comes in again
Queen Mary the first of England it
wasn't United Kingdom than England
realize that ok you can't ban the
printing press because people want to
print stuff too much so if I instead
have this unholy alliance with a London
printing guild where I get to decide
what gets printed and in exchange I gave
them a complete monopoly for printing
there's an unholy alliance between the
crown and business both of us win and
the only ones who lose out are the ones
we don't want to see problem solved so
demon oh the monopoly was a war on may
four 1557 I think it's 1557 could be
1577 doesn't matter it was called
copyright and is still around this it
was originally a method for suppressing
dissent and it worked extremely well
these days though the mechanism has been
kind of taken over by the industry who
got a monopoly and who are now
suppressing dissent in their turn we we
observed that there's a very red thread
throughout history here people in power
use their power to keep their power
this is very consistent throughout
history of information throughout
history of power if you I was speaking a
bit about this earlier and the reason is
if you can dictate true from false if
you can tell somebody what is true and
what is not you cannot hold a greater
power you cannot wield a more powerful
characteristic newspapers same thing
repeated all over again when we came to
the mid 1800s in early eighteen hundreds
mid eighteen hundreds you had this
aristocracy this political nobility
which went absolutely crazy insane that
everybody and their brother were allowed
to publish ideas and distort the
intellectual levels of discussion about
houses what society should look like
where did this riffraff come from think
they have any right to interfere in our
discussion turns out that that everybody
had a voice concept was quite good at
the end of the day newspapers did win
out but not without a fight definitely
not without a fight information is
dangerous free thinking even more so so
there has always been efforts from power
to suppress free flow of information and
we see now that the copyright industry
says who are currently more or less in
control of information observe state
that every five or ten years there's an
absolute disaster looming in face of new
technology we can see roughly the past
century of every technology that should
end humanity as we know it starting with
a self playing piano in 1905 which would
be the end of a vivid vivid
musical humanity and quote here's page
two
actually I can't really blame them I
mean they learnt a very successful
formula if they throw transoms in public
they get taxpayer money it's a very self
reinforcing formula the latest thing
being that they are now demand the
copper industry or rather the collecting
societies which is a part of the copper
industry is now demanding taxpayer money
as compensation for our ability to store
music and movies our own music and
movies mind you on cloud storage like
like Dropbox so they want money for the
free services that we where we saw our
files because those files could
theoretically be music movies games what
have you so information is dangerous new
technologies that spread information is
dangerous so let's peek a bit into our
crystal ball shall we and see just what
industries may be about to fall next
we've already seen that disruption takes
time I mean the car was delayed by 20
years by somebody just complaining about
it essentially if we're looking at when
electricity arrived you had before that
you had factories that looked about like
this they were built in the city centres
they were usually built close to water
and they were built quite tall usually
they were you almost look like cubes
brick-built cubes very very much
downtown
it took 60 years from the point where
half of the factories had been
electrified until somebody realized that
the reason factories had been built like
that was because they were dependent on
steam power and that's still at the
point where they had my hand replaced
the steam power with electricity and yet
nobody thought or the fact that the
reason factories had been built so
compact but by water downtown was
because everybody had built them that
way because they were optimized with
steam power it took 60 years from the
point where half of the factories were
electrified until somebody realized that
you could get almost a three-fold
efficiency gain by building building
them flat way outside the city instead
60 years and that begs the question what
assumptions do we live with today what
do we just copy today without thinking
about it that is built on an assumption
that we're not questioning just as the
factory construction was built on the
assumption that it would run on steam
power even when it wasn't anymore let's
take a look into the crystal ball a bit
we know already a few industries that
have had problems shall we say well with
the net the first and obvious being
Postal Service's who ignored email and
now are sort of degraded into glorified
build carriers they bring our bills at
the end of the month which is also
anachronistic by the way and I'll get to
that by extension postcard manufacturers
are pretty much out of business
and I think it's funny how these poor
bastards are still still in 2012 trying
to get us to send Christmas cards at the
end of the year it's a noble attempt
perhaps I am not sure if it's still a
tradition in Denmark it certainly isn't
in Sweden and longer you have a second
industry which is new services it used
to be very monopolistic it used to be
very elite istic we're a small cadre of
people would determine again determined
truth determine right from wrong
determined true from false then came
blogging and it was generated ridiculed
as not being fact-checked enough not
being fast enough not being accurate
enough and above all not being the
traditional news service which I guess
it is understandable I mean the new
services were being pushed out of their
comfort zone and while they arguably
still have a lot of audience the old new
services could call them old media if
you like I tend to do that in Sweden
gamal media
they do still have a lot of audience but
you can observe that in many countries
people don't watch television anymore
and they certainly don't read newspapers
this is particularly true in younger
crowds you obviously have the copyright
industry which it could be said and this
is important this does not mean the film
industry or the music industry culture
will always be created what's at stake
here is those who safeguard the content
as they say but that word is very very
carefully constructed i'm not writing
content when i'm writing on my blog when
i'm writing op-eds on CNN when i'm
publishing whatever wherever it's a
craft I take pride in my heart to hear
somebody refer to it as content is
degrading verging on insulting as it
could be replaced by whatever other form
of writing and people don't care it
doesn't work like that when you create
but the word content is very very
careful to see selected to imply that
there is a container and the container
is what's being safeguarded the walls
around the distribution network is
what's being protected and they
obviously come crashing down we've seen
file-sharing since the 1990s we were
sharing games and music on cassette
tapes for two decades before then these
walls are coming crashing down the
fourth industry is kind of interesting
that i'm peering into my crystal ball
which is banking how many in here have
experimented with cryptocurrency let's
see your hands
quite a few scattered hands okay so a
cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or which is
probably the largest but their number of
them is essentially doing to the banks
what email did to the postal service it
allows you to send the value of a cup of
coffee to a friend in India on a Sunday
at no cost and they see it instantly
they have the money instantly or rather
they see it instantly thank you use it
after an hour and the first time you see
this the first time you use this it's
kind of like the first time you saw
Napster your jaw your jaw just drops and
it feels like you took a 40 Lee 40 year
leap into the future because after all
let's see what the banks are providing
to us in comparison with the free
services we we are used to they are
charging about five percent off of every
transaction transaction of your business
paypal charges three-point-four percent
plus a fixed fee which is about two
danish kroner i think third of a euro
plus a fixed fee per year compare this
with the free services that we that
we're used to and take for granted that
they are free we have an encyclopedia in
all the world's languages that cover
every piece of knowledge that could be
possibly interesting we can search all
the world's information in in
milliseconds we can store infinite
literally infinite amounts of data there
are web males that have infinite storage
for every customer web mates that are
free it was yahoo started this and we
can publish our DS to the entire world
all this at no cost to ourselves
whatsoever so let's see what we get for
our money from the banks well they're
storing a number in a database for us
oh and they're sending us after 12 left
as a year to there is a bit of a
discrepancy here in terms of disparity
and the IT services provided from this
industry when you look at the volumes
you get from other industries and that's
why I predict the crypto currencies once
they hit we'll just drop kick the entire
bank system because the value
proposition especially for international
trade is just immense the fifth I'm
going to predict as a telco industry you
know what we're paying by the minute for
a phone call we're still doing that how
many in here have a landline is home
this year out your hands some quarter I
think about 10 years ago i was i had a
landline to and uh every time i picked
up the phone i would ask myself why am i
paying for the minute for a 9.6 kilobit
line that can only be used for a voice
application when i have 100
general-purpose megabits in the wall for
a fixed monthly fee the business model
for telco industries just do not add up
any longer now there's a problem with
this on a functioning market a profit
margin is typically five to ten percent
the problem is that telco industry is
very very aware that the internet is
going to absolutely dis integrate most
of their business at least if you look
at these strategic discussions if you
look at the profit margins on data
roaming in the telco industry that the
margins are and I'm not making this up 1
million percent
that is not a functioning market when
google introduced Google Fiber they had
they presented this graph which
essentially shows the internet household
speed flatlining just after the telco
buyouts of all the small ISPs I'm
arguing that that's not a coincidence
and page and the sixth disruption would
be government's themselves and this is
where it gets really interesting you
remember what I said about
cryptocurrencies well it turns out that
peer-to-peer technologies can't really
be ruled like bank scam you can't go
into a peer-to-peer system and sees
somebody's money you can't see their
money you can't see how much they're
paying but governments depend on
applying violence to seize assets as the
last resort they at least depend on the
threat of applying violence in this case
not even a ton of T&amp;amp;T applied directly
to a harder a computer will make
somebody lose their money so all the
force in the world is useless against a
future economy once you go to
cryptocurrencies this is going to be
something of a bureaucratic nightmare
it's also going to be a very Popcaan
moment so we're coming up on 9 50 so i'm
finishing saying this the observation
that everything we see now has happened
before and all of this will happen again
and that is a quote from battlestar
galactica was which i think it was a
shame that came to an end in winds of
change some people build shelters others
in will mills there's my favorite
chinese proverb thank you
