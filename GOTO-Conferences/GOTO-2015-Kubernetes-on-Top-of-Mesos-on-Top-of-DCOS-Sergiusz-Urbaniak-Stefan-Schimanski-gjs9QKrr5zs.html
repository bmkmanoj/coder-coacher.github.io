just call me search I think that's much
easier and this is Stefan Stefan and
we're both engineers at atmosphere so we
are the guys who are programming
essentially so we are not professional
presenters so I'm sorry sorry for that
one but yeah we were engineers
atmosphere and working on the curb
benitez and mrs. integration you've been
hearing from from Brian about the
awesome communities project and we are
responsible for integrating this this
stuff in the message scheduler
infrastructure and we also responsible
for the DCOs integration you see like
nearly half of the team the other
colleagues are sitting around the world
and Tyler is not a dragon I promise with
businesses avatar yeah so that's us we
working on company dismissals it's all
open source is all written and go it's
all fully an upstream so when you go to
the Gator page that Brian showed you you
will find all the source code up there
what is metal sphere so basically
mesosphere is the company behind those
components which you see here so um I'm
just interested who of you have ever
heard of Apache mezzos before okay
that's cool that's that's a lot who have
you have heard of marathon a little less
yeah that that's kind of what i expect
kronos that's approximately same dcos
okay so that's interesting to see I have
to I have to give this feedback that's
that's very nice so okay so many of you
have heard of Apache me so so much
amazed us is what we call a distributed
systems colonel it's essentially a
scheduler for launching arbitrary tasks
in the clustered environment and the
other components listed here have other
other tasks marathon is an is a
framework which runs on top of a Pecha
measles
and is responsible for running long
running tasks Chronos as the name says a
crown replacement for things that run in
intervals so dcos is the thing that
integrates all those components entice
them all together in a nice integrated
environment what that all means we will
we will say just in in a second so the
challenge which we want to help you with
this you know to enable data to enable
warehouse computing so essentially i
really like this picture and it probably
you've seen it very often already but
one thing i really like about this
picture is that we we like to treat the
data center as it's a set of arbitrary
machines which can be replays taken out
and in and your software still runs
right so you you heard about cabinet is
and this is exactly the same goal we're
trying to achieve the sad truth in in
today's data centers and i took this
from from a wikipedia page i don't know
if you see this it's what we call static
petitioning so you have a data center
and you have label attached to to to to
your hardware where you have your maid
service running I don't know DUP DUP DUP
servers made and so and so forth and
this is the model we would like to get
rid of and the infrastructure that we
try to provide enables you to do then so
speaking of metaphors arm you know who
likes doing stuff on Linux here so yeah
cool nice so I also do a Linux since a
long time and essentially what is linux
linux is a kernel right so it's that
enough to operate your computer
apparently no on the basis of your
computer you have resources available
why do you have memory inside of it you
have cpu you have storage and so on and
so forth so the colonel you know it's
the thing that orchestrates those
resources and provides scheduling and
provides isolation and so and so forth
and you have different choices for those
kernels right I like Linux but there are
others too right i mean let's Darvin
this window freebsd
and others to choose from but there are
other components which are responsible
that your computer functions as a whole
to right I mean and especially these
things are layered so we need something
that is able to boot your system so
something that we usually call init d
yeah the good old system five boot
process and the brand new system d stuff
and so on so forth and on top of that
once your system is loaded and boot it
up you have other components responsible
for different things like you have a
chrome demon running things and
intervals you have a terminal
abstraction are mostly absolutely
terminal today then you have other armed
user space programs to running like
database is my sequel and so on and so
forth and when you're doing development
I mean who are viewed as docker based
development yes so you run of course
darker and other things that compose
those images those docker images on your
local machine like like this guy here
the darker compost stuff and runs your
containers on new single computer so
taking this metaphor and you know
putting it on a data center level that
makes it something like this so
essentially what the DC OS is all about
is taking the kernel which we see Apache
messrs being responsible for taking the
energy demon you know the thing that
boots your thing which is marathon
Chronos is the Crone abstraction command
line tools replacing your classical
terminal and Cuban it is actually which
runs your containers so and instead of
handling you know a single set of course
on your single computer the Apache MSO
scheduler is something Colonel like that
handles all the CPUs in your available
data center and the nice thing about
this abstraction for me is that it
doesn't treat your machines in the data
center a single single instances but
rather a set of resources which it can
take you know CPUs from or storage from
a memory from and you know put it in the
responsibility of communities
to launch parts for instance and the
base idea for instance of a Linux system
you have you have many distributions to
your disposal you have I don't know 12
DB on redhead and so on so forth and
this is how we look at this cos 2 D cos
is simply a distribution and
theoretically you could build your own
which would be an actually a nice open
source project take take those
components put them together as a
distribution which is installable in
your in your data center and and put all
those things in a nice packaged way such
that as Brian described you don't have
the hassle of thinking about the network
and how these things can pose together
it's all hidden away behind this
distribution which is easy to install in
and easy to maintain and COO benitez in
our point of view running on this D cos
you know it's something that I see as a
metaphor to to userland api's or
userland programs so from the
perspective of D cos you containers your
parts simply our program or process
instances running on this virtual
operating system and apparently all
those descriptors and these are those
EML files from from Cuba natives are
simply descriptors for you program to
run and this is how you declare your
relationship between your process and
the data center operating system so
again the challenge warehouse computing
and when you boot up a an arbitrary
operating system and you have a system
monitor which you usually call like
using top or you normal and graphical
environments this is the stuff that you
see on the D cos I high level overview
of the resources available in your data
center which shows you in a quick / /
site / view your CPU allocation memory
allocation failure right and so on and
so forth and Q Benitez is a subset of
this in this case you can drill down
more and even see those individual units
running arbitrary processes in your data
center and I really like this picture
because you still see some
in an abstract way your individual nodes
and the cpu utilization of the processes
and how they run on it so how does cuban
it is come into play it's we want to
make this integration of D cos and
Combinator's as simple as possible and
it doesn't matter when you whether you
run these us on Amazon or on premise on
your own Hardware in your own data
center everything you see saw on the
talk before with the cube CTL command
when you have a dco since the run
instance running the only thing you have
to do is you have to put DC us in front
of it so DCOs space cube CTL and all the
commands that you know from interacting
with with Cuba natives and instead of
launching those parts on on the roku
Benitez instance it those parts will be
launched on an Apache measles cluster
orchestrated with this us operating
system distribution and hopefully may
the demo gods but be with us a hand over
to to Stefan is going to show you how
how all this jazz works yeah so we
prepared yeah not a huge cluster by the
cluster was 20 machines can also create
a wondrous 100,000 it's running on AWS
at the moment so this is life view of
this TCS screen which you saw before is
a screenshot so there's not much work
done at the moment 37 tasks and you can
see the service running here so some
some big data stuff some HDFS Cooper
natus some spark but there's not much we
going on so if I go back to this nice
grid view which we saw before you see
they are pretty empty and we want to
fill them so what I did before when you
look again on the slide I did the
installation already so it's really just
this command and it takes the minute or
so until the Cuban it is really
installed and up and running so I did it
before because it takes a minute but
otherwise you have a clean cluster here
at lean KU Benitez cluster so I just
gives you a feeling of that so you have
the queue control which is bit too big i
hope you can still see it so sir said
something you have to prefix
that I made the prefix on is in fact on
my best i can say q control just like
that and i can do similar things that
set wine already showed so i prepared
one example yeah very simple engine X
instance I want to scare that imagine of
course this is not usually it's not on
the AWS system its it should be on your
data center somewhere maybe on your own
bare metal but it's not a pre-installed
or P configured installation of KU
Benitez like in the Google cloud so this
is more like for enterprises as soon as
a main idea I have a template here in
fact the replication controller of an
engine X pot I just found said there's a
create command against the yamen file
and we do that takes some seconds until
he creates was resources on the
controller or the API server sorry and
here on the left I I see the pots and
that's right if you can see that he
behind the screen there's a
certification controller so the left
thing is just describing how the
application controller looks like and
the left you see supports and at the
moment we have epic are set to 23 so are
just three pots I mean you can look for
them here somewhere in you know how or
where is it it's here so it's somewhere
here in this on one node we can can just
say cube control get pots and just take
one here and we in fact we could find
out gradually lifts but usually you
don't do that so you can say something
like that and you get all the data also
Jason's a whole description of the thing
and somewhere in this jason says
released a note but usually don't care
about that it's one big computer and
it's running somewhere and if it's
killed or it crashes it's that Lee
started somewhere at all what wine
describe stand by this replication court
order you can scare this thing so it's
the same command basically what you do
and googly flowered so if a 20 notes
luster maybe one hour 50 instances of
that it's not such a bad
yeah I just say scale it takes a moment
he creates supports or 147 missing plots
which we didn't have before and you see
on the left here at speeding up quickly
at the moment everything is pending so
it takes some time and here it's right
you see five are wanting 144 five
awaiting and it's just watch so it takes
three seconds or so it were to update
and you are seeing here coming up pretty
fast and what you see here so they
should slowly go up I hope and the tasks
are started here on some notes I just
showcase some some features here so we
have those frameworks and Kunis is one
so you can just go here you see it's not
taking so much if you add there are some
memory and the task I think there's the
wrong instance here one second which one
is this one
okay i started two clusters just to
showcase I think I was wrong here so we
don't see it in the UI here's a no no we
lost to network apparently so much about
the Democrats okay it's like so all the
other class that we would see also 150
so this is not really match versus
output here and we can also open the eye
of Combinator's I'm not really sure it
works here apparently it doesn't so
Democrats a lot with me yeah I think we
have a network problem or anything
because we don't see any update here
anymore not even air was so okay I
cannot debug that here on stage anyway
so those go up and usually 150 was in 23
minutes they are started running on
those notes and you can just access i'm
using load balancer or anything like
that ok so again when you see it from a
late view we have measles at the very
bottom acting something like a kernel
which does the scheduling part and the
allocation part then you have the DD cos
as a virtual operating system wrap
around it and Google up there and if you
a little bit in more interested in how
that stuff internally works we try to
give you a very high level overview so
first of all masers which is responsible
for the actual resource management for
the scheduling and so and so forth looks
a little bit like this so essentially
you're you have mazes running and mostly
also in high availability mode as master
instances persisting it's it stayed into
zookeeper and what frameworks do which
is what we call what which is our
terminology for the stuff that you
usually call user space applications on
a regular operating system world
interact with the measles master
with an SDK which is in our case HTTP
and protobuf based so and a framework
and this in this instance is a scuba
natives but there could be arbitrary
frameworks so we have we have much more
like for instance elasticsearch or
cassandra and so and so forth and how
that then works is that you have your
physical machines you'll note that stuff
that we try to expect abstract from you
and each of those machines runs measles
agents which actually have two
responsibilities first one is gather all
the resource information from the given
node for instance test four cores three
gigs of ram and so and so forth and the
other thing is it launches what we call
executives and in this case this would
be executor from the framework for
instance elasticsearch or communities
and arbitrary subtasks which would be in
the communities world parts and speaking
of cuban it is i think there is a very
nice you know match between those two
worlds because you can pretty easily
apply on what a coup benitez master does
which is the canonical example of a
measles framework actually right so the
only thing we did is we took out the
core scheduler of the cuban it isn't and
replaced it with the missile scheduler
and everything else works the same way
as from a native co benitez installation
and the coup benitez executor actually
is just a couplet right so so that's
that's the only thing that that has to
be launched by by the framework on the
given node and the tasks from measles
essentially the paths that you want to
want to launch so therefore we believe
there's a very nice you know overlay of
those two concepts and therefore those
two things go hand in hand and very nice
together so when you call the cube CTL
command the only thing that happens is
that you know we prefix all those urls
that the cube CTL command speaks to the
API server with / server / q benitez
which is the framework name and
everything else stays exactly the same
as from a native coo benitez
installation
so again DCOs provides all the packaging
infrastructure behind all this so you
just type a simple command like apt-get
install cubanita to type DCOs package
install communities and it does all that
for you and it provides all the other
high-level services if you want to try
it yourself it's pretty easy to spot a
DCOs cluster on amazon but you can also
do it on your machine and as of
yesterday we released a new communities
version Combinator's on missus version
which our internal version is 0 7 l
which is based on the upstream version
1.1 point 1 and here are some links for
you so if you are interested in to our
starting QB knitters on an existing VCS
cluster you have those URLs here which
you can you can look up if you want to
try just the cubanita so maysles part on
your own laptop which we all the
engineers do all day there's also a very
nice getting started guide for doing so
and then you also can look up our own
code which work on on a daily basis on
the getup itself so in terms of roadmap
I give the word to you yeah we are often
asked where are we so we're at zero
seven at the moment so it's not
production already we're working hard on
that in the team and so 07 is just day
old yesterday evening we did that and
play another one maybe in two weeks or
so and we have a kind of cold MVP
internally it's a 08 version which has
everything so it's like you can really
deployed and on a cluster and start with
maybe non critical applications so it's
it's a better version essentially and
some when I know in q1 q2 something like
that next year there will be production
whereever I think that's our plan at the
moment yeah and of course it's pretty
important so we are still a small team
but we are looking for people so we have
an office at the moment it's not so big
it's just search but we were looking in
Berlin for people which energy companies
from the u.s. from Narciso and
a big office in Hamburg and now we're
starting here Bellino we did that
already for a few months and we are
trying to grow the office here so if you
interested just come to us and ask us
about some details yeah and you have
seen the links already so you can see
everything what we did before just with
the doctor comp our setup that's the
second thing for example on your
notebook if you want to play with it
it's not so huge sorts of complex is
really just I know 100 line don't
compose fight with some services and
containers yeah and i think that's it i
watch it so we are open for questions so
we have a lot time for questions or feel
free to ask one question why should I
run Cuba natives on missiles instead of
natively so we didn't stress that so
much so you saw this PCOS screenshot or
as life berlin where you had all those
services on the left like there was a
Cassandra running on that which is also
possible kind of in incubators we had a
number like six or seven services so the
whole idea is that you can shares a
cluster this different frameworks like
you can have your Big Data stuff all in
this framework which is not possible
right now really and Combinator's so you
can have spark or Kafka or whatever so
you can share all the same resources
they are just living next to each other
and you saw you saw those circles 20
service for the 20 no cluster at the
colors were just a framework so they can
really one of the same note that's the
basic idea ok when should i use cabinets
and when should i use marathon they are
basically two api's so I mean the ruble
stressing at other times the main
contribution of Combinator's the API
which means the concepts what is the pot
water service and so on and marathon is
just another one so we don't see some I
mean there are cases where mass one is
more advanced at the moment they freely
we are quite a good rolling update
feature for example
they have pooping so a hierarchy of
tasks so there are things which are good
marathon the other things which are good
in Combinator's whether we really pretty
similar lines in the concepts and in the
purpose so use the one you like use the
one which fits you can you can have both
and you can have even one part of
supplication in balance on one in
Combinator's again speak to each other
it's fine there is another question just
your communities framework also support
the kubernetes IP per container feature
yes so it's possible to 21 the Maysles
cluster which contain eyepiece there's a
calico collaboration and it's also
possible to use something like leaf if
you know that some over the network it's
possible and the only difference we have
between container IP and not contain IP
it's our endpoint controllers one of the
many controllers if I mentioned it's the
one which connects parts to services and
this is a bit different just three lines
of code that's the only difference if
you replace it by the normal one you can
use content i beez yeah seeing the
future question do you have like a quick
overview either now or you can point to
a place that's our state's which
features of communities are not yet
supported by your framework and which
features are you you have an messes
marathon that are not yet in communities
is a comparison like that yeah just not
table but there's one pretty important
property of our last release so the big
thing of the 07 will use as conformance
which means there's a big tests which
which checks at a clusters really
conform to what Combinator's promises to
do and we are compliant to that with our
development cluster you plan to do that
with maybe isie 08 something like that
verse vs package and we want to pass all
those tests that's that's a goal if you
want to look what doesn't work at the
moment there in the documentation if you
follow the links we had there there's
the issues file issues md it's and the
github repository in the in the measles
part there's a lot of texts while
describing weather
one star okay there was sorry we had a
question here are you what is the Soviet
question is what is the conjunction with
marathon no so we use so the question is
the slide showed that coo Benitez runs
on top of marathon that's a technic
technically a little bit different so we
do use marathon as the canonical energy
demon for launching q Benitez so
marathon launches Cuban it is but it
doesn't technically run on top of it it
runs next to it if you want to say it
but we do use marathon in order to
launch a coup Benitez cluster when you
do a package a package DCOs package
installer Benitez yes it's just in a d
component of DCs which we use I don't
just another question which regards the
different consensus systems which run in
parallel on the missiles level and under
cabinet is level are they affecting each
other somehow is there anything that's
there's hardly any connection so I mean
the main purpose of HDD here's just a
persistence it's a state storage for for
the API server otherwise they're
independent so of course the measles has
either election or other stuff and yeah
we have the same for our scheduler which
uses hcd at the moment which might be
changed soon but so they're not
connected to know okay that's another
question which is quite interesting
about a kind of developer responsibility
or developers versus DevOps
responsibilities so it says dr. is
actually separating the infrastructure
concerns of running a darker demon on on
a host from the kind of application
level concerns i deploy containers or
manage containers looking at KU benitez
mezzos and
dr. swarm and fleet and all the other
things it proved pulls more off to
infrastructure concerns again in the
picture what do you see kind of venue
when you look at that in real-world
projects is it actually saw that as a
separate separate people setting up for
instance messes with communities and
then the application developers just
deploy on top of that or what kind of
setup so do you see how how their use in
practice I think it's it's kind of
platform I mean it's usually deployed by
some platform people they can be the
same I mean we have a colleague who does
those things they deploy applications
huge dimension but he also deploys the
coordinators I mean at the end it's a
platform and it can be used by
developers and they have a lot of
flexibility and a lot of insight which
is important so you say we can really go
into the container and debug it
themselves with a another batch
processes we really dive into the things
they are running so they can do
something like DevOps if you like
questionnaires it's the kind of
experience level kind of the same that
you need for kind of setting up and
fine-tuning like measures and kind of
configuring applications which is kind
of a on a different level of experience
or it's probably different I mean Jesus
the main audience of measles is to have
a lot of notes like 1,000 5,000 10,000
jets dimension I mean this is the target
audience of measles so it's a different
kind of knowledge to needs and compared
to application develop of course and I
think having said the concern of
knowledge I think that's exactly the
thing that dcos tries to abstract from
you so when you use debian on linux
right and you a nap gap you don't
exactly know what pre scripts post trips
are being run on it right and you don't
know actually you just type the command
and the thing is being installed and I
think this us helps you a lot with that
complexity even if you are running such
a cluster just I DCOs package install
the same way as you do an apt get
install yeah okay last question that I
see here is how do we support capacity
planning for instance
on other services when you have the
ability to you know scale the underlying
infrastructure servers independently
without pre pre allocating machines for
instance do you have things like that
honestly we should take the chance that
question with us yeah yeah okay cool so
good question yeah otherwise any
questions in the room cool then thank
you for your talk don't forget to rate
of course and thank you for for being
here and presenting and you can enjoy
your break and then come back for tea
