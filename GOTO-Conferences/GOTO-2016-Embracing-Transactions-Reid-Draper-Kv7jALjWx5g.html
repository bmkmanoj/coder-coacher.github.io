thanks for having everyone I'll start by
saying go to is a great conference I've
been a few years before and so if you
don't have a ticket already highly
recommend going so I'm going to talk
about transactions today specifically
embracing transactions I think
transactions are a really useful
building block for applications and i
want to show you how we can take this
idea of being able to compose
transactions together sort of try and
take it to its natural conclusion see
how one implementation goes and explore
what some ideas around this really
simple concept there's how many of you
have or using a relational database at
work okay so a lot of people how many of
you use an RM oh I would have expected a
lot more people how many of you right
Ross sequel okay so there's going to be
some Raj sequel ahead so if you use an
ORM be prepared to close your eyes so
we're going to start with a simple
question do transactions compose anyone
have an idea
I think they do but let's see so let's
kind of break this out and see exactly
what we mean by transaction and
Composition what is a transaction
anybody have a thought yeah I compose
compose them from composition so if we
dig into transactions more we see this
word acid come up especially with
relational databases and in particular
when we're talking about transactions
we're really thinking about adding the
city the rest of these are our nice
properties for the entire system of a
relational database by foreign
individual transactions sort of just
from our point of view not thinking
about concurrency or anything like that
we're mostly interested in this word
atomicity and this kind of breaks down
into a tonic which comes from the great
word atomos which means undivided and so
the transaction is something that cannot
be divided into further components the
entire transaction is either going to
complete successfully or roll back and
not complete at all and in general this
idea of being able to do atomic work is
a really important building block
especially with things like databases
and concurrency if we want to be able to
do some set of actions compose or group
them together and be able to know that
the entire thing is going to complete at
once how many of you have done some
database transformation maybe even on
like a no sequel database or written a
bug in your code that left the database
in some inconsistency yeah I've
definitely done that like
your times and so Adam issah tees are
really important component for this
because it allows us to say I want to do
all of these things at once and all of
them must complete or not robust
complete there's no way that we can on
board a new customer create an
organization for them create a user
that's going to go in the organization
and then why not put them in the
organization which means that now we
have to go write some script to fix up
the data and that if you're me emulating
there's a bug in that script which makes
things even worse and so I think
authenticity especially when dealing
with you know business critical data is
an important thing to consider what
about composition what does it mean to
compose things typically we think about
putting things together when we compose
and so we might have two things and here
we've got some circles and when we
compose them together what do we get
with another circle right a bigger
circle and if when doing this we've now
made this atomic it means that we can't
sort of peek under the hood and see oh
that's actually two circles together and
I can you know commit one of the circles
but not the other we think about
functions the composition function is
going to take two arguments 2 a's
doesn't matter what azar it's going to
return a third a so this is just a
binary function that takes two
parameters at the same time and returns
the same thing function composition is
composition right we take G and F that
returns a new function that's first
going to call G and then going to call
it that but once we have that there's no
way to kind of like peek inside you see
what the two functions are there's no
like explode to source code
kind of thing in most of our languages
edition can be thought of as composing
two numbers together so our a is in this
case or going to be integers and then
when we compose two integers together we
get the third actor so what anyone have
an idea what happens if we compose two
transactions when we get out another
trend another transaction right so this
is useful because we can now say I have
these two reusable building blocks which
are each transactions these things are
each indivisible I can execute them and
know that the database can't partially
commit one of these but I can also now
compose them together into a larger
transaction which itself can't be broken
down seems like a pretty straightforward
thing right so yep we get a another
transaction but it turns out that trying
to actually put this into code is a
little bit more difficult than I've made
it sound so far so let's run through an
example we're going to create a really
simple table it's going to have two
columns going to have a name that's
going to represent a city and that's
going to have the continent that the
city goes in so Chicago in North America
and here are some of that Ross equal I
was talking about so we're going to
insert in a new city Chicago North
America is this a transaction
yeah i think it probably makes our
definition this cannot be divided up
into further work right and if we
execute that and then we ask for the
state of the database we say okay
there's one row Chicago in North America
what about this we're going to now
create Chicago New York and San
Francisco all North American city is
this a transaction no no and that's
because we could do this first part of
the transaction we could create Chicago
something bad could happen there could
be a power outage on the database and
this first row commits there could be a
programmer error or the power could go
out on the app server and in a lot of
cases this works fine but saying we have
this food syntax error here if we run
this it happily adds new york and
chicago to the list even though there's
an exception here and then san francisco
is left not included in our list not
willing to relocate to san francisco so
this leaves our database in inconsistent
state compared to what we were trying to
do which is bad how about this is this
is transaction now here's a begin and i
commend the top the bottom so i think
that this is a transaction let's see
what happens so we're going to introduce
our same food syntax there this could be
anything could be an exception in your
programming language or some network
connectivity fail and so when we run
this post chris or whatever database
we're using is going to happily start a
transaction insert chicago new york it's
not going to show anyone else just yet
we're going to have our error and then
we're going to actually roll back this
transaction and never committed and so
if we run this nothing has been done
that set of inserting three cities is
undivided
so that's good so I think that a
transaction is a begin statement
followed by a series of other statements
followed by exactly one commit this is
pretty simple right okay so now we have
two transactions that we want to compose
together blue is it transaction because
it's surrounded by exactly one begin and
one commit and far is a transaction
because it's surrounded by one beginning
one commit but if we were to just sort
of execute them in linear order like
this that's actually two transactions
not one composed transaction so to
compose these two into one transaction
what does that look like well we have to
get rid of this commit the second this
first one it here and this second begin
bear and have begin foo bar to mint okay
all is seeming pretty same so far and if
you were sort of just writing these out
by hand and not calling into some helper
functions to create new york create
chicago this is pretty simple when you
say of course i'm only going to have one
begin at the beginning one commit at the
air and so we say that a transaction is
something where the statements are
always run in a transaction so if we
call something a transaction you can't
execute the code not going to
transaction seems pretty tautological
and if we compose with another
transaction there is exactly one begin
and one commit right and so if we call
something a transaction the statements
must always wrong
transaction and so we are a developer
and we're starting to write some
reasonable functions we're going to stop
writing exactly Ross sequel and use
Python that's going to send some
database state next to postgres or
whatever I databases and to do that
we're going to write ourselves a little
helper function that allows us to say
with transaction and this is going to
take care of running our code in exactly
one of those begin and one of those
comments so if you're not familiar with
Python this is basically allowing you to
say I'm going to create this thing that
we're going to call a which statement
will later be able to say with
transaction and it's going to call begin
then it's going to call whatever code
you pass them if there's an exception
raised will call roll back and if not
we'll call commit so this is pretty
straightforward so far and now we're
going to define a function to create two
of the city's that could go to
conferences ever so Chicago which is in
North America and Copenhagen which is in
Europe and so the transaction always has
a beginning to commit and we can't call
this a transaction without that and so
we are careful developers is we don't
want to expose this not inside of a
transaction it's not a transaction if
you can create Chicago and not
Copenhagen so we say define this
function go to cities will call with
transaction which is going to take care
of rolling back the transaction
exception and basically just remove the
boilerplate of us having to remember to
call begin and end if you used the
database driver before you probably use
something like this so first we're going
to insert chicago and then copenhagen
and if we execute this function in
Python it turns out we can actually
inspect exactly what postgres sees so
there's a log option we can
we can just look at the log files then
it will just echo back every single
literal statement that we send to
postgres so this kind of allows us to
peek behind the scenes and see exactly
what the database driver that were using
is doing so first it's in a call begin
it's going to create Chicago Copenhagen
and then connect is this a transaction
yes yes okay so we're good here we've
now created this hopefully reusable
transaction that is a function we can
call which will create two of the go
tuesdays okay now we're going to create
two cities that I wish go to work so I'm
really want to go to Tokyo and South
Africa which are in Asia and Africa so
now this is another reusable function
that we can call future go to cities and
inside of a transaction it's going to
create Tokyo and Asia and South Africa
on the continent of Africa and so I
claim that this is a transaction as well
these statements are exactly one began
at one commit now what happens if we
want to combine them together is this
going to be good or bad
if it's composable so we're definitely
in a transaction we're actually worth
three transactions because go to cities
calls with transaction future go to
cities calls with transaction and with
transactions definitely calls began to
hide and so we're extra safe right
there's like no way that this could
possibly not the atomic because we're in
so many transactions sadly that is not
what happens and I will tell you that if
you were doing this almost certainly
your database driver will happily send
exactly these statements to post verse
and if you're not looking at your lungs
I you'll have no idea what's going on in
fact I did stuff like this for a really
long time having no idea that there's a
super subtle bunker so what ends up
happening is we call begin from the
first with transaction and then we call
go to cities which also is going to call
begin so we begin again inter Chicago
Copenhagen go to cities completes which
says oh yeah this completed successfully
with no exceptions so we should commit
and then future go to cities is going to
call begin we'll insert these two cities
future go to cities which statements get
in it's going to call commit and then
this outer with transaction is going to
call commit and this turns out to have
issue
and so if we actually look at either the
warnings that our database driver may or
may not give back to us or the logs in
whatever database you use you'll likely
see something like this there is already
a transaction in progress and there is
no transaction in progress I'm kind of
embarrassed to admit back for the first
few months of seeing their sounds like
that it's just some and then I just like
started getting super curious like that
doesn't quite seem right okay and so
there's actually a really logical
explanation for this if we go back and
look at exactly what we're sending the
database can call begin twice and it
turns out that most databases don't
implement anything that we would think
of as like nested transactions or if
they do is really not what we want we
don't want to guess these transactions
we want one big transaction that creates
new york chicago copenhagen south africa
in Tokyo right and so if we just go into
a postgres shell and we type again twice
the second time postgres is like you
know you're already in a transaction so
I'm just going to ignore this statement
completely then you call commit again
it's like okay we're in a transaction
let's come in and then you call commit
the second time and you're not in a
transaction anymore so there's this
little annoying bit in between here
there's two commits where you think that
you're inside of a transaction but
you're actually not post Chris doesn't
raising the error or anything it just
says okay but I can't commit anything
and so if we try and run this code and
we raise an exception here what we'd
like to happen what we're trying to
achieve is that this entire set of
statements is going to complete atomic
weight right
we're going to insert new york and
chicago or copenhagen and chicago and
then tokyo and south africa and we think
that happens because in that little
function we wrote if there's an
exception we call the roll back right
well let's see what happens if we
actually execute this code we call begin
twice again we insert Chicago and
Copenhagen then we call the vet because
we do successfully complete from go to
cities so now that's in the database the
transaction is over then we raise this
value error but we're still inside of
what we think we're inside of this
transaction so our Python code says okay
it roll backing so we roll back but
we've just rolled back a transaction
that hasn't actually done anything
because we've already committed this
first one and so if we ask what's in the
database we get Chicago and Copenhagen
and so it's now seeming difficult to
create these little reusable functions
that if you use them on your own there's
no way to not run in a transaction but
to also compose it to create bigger
transaction it's it's feeling like these
things are kind of at odds with each
other right and so we have met this
first part the statements are always
well in a transaction and for a while
what I was doing is sort of saying I
have to either kind of be lenient and
say you know put in some documentation
and say okay this is some reusable
sequel code but you as the developer
when you're ready to finally put this in
the transaction make sure you wrap it in
a transaction and that's kind of
unsatisfying because we don't like to
rely on comic convention to convey
things like transactional integrity
that's a little scary
on the other hand we could wrap it in a
transaction and put a comment insist
don't try and compose this within the
other transaction but that's also just a
comment and we saw what happens if we do
compose it with another transaction it
doesn't actually compose into a bigger
transaction and almost worse you get the
situation where you have this false
sense of confidence that you're saying
okay I like there's like four with
transactions so this is for sure in a
transaction but it's actually not and so
we're kind of left in this frustrating
situation that we know what we want but
we're having trouble teaching this
higher-level language how to translate
into sequel and so when we compose with
another transaction we want exactly one
begin exactly one remember this is
what's proving difficult and just kind
of drive the point home this is a this
is you know kind of an illustration of
the situation that would come later we
have this first began in the outer with
transaction and then we had a few other
begins that post racism is there yeah
whatever we're going to write Chicago
Copenhagen but then because we called
with transaction on go to cities it's
going to commit now the transaction is
over this is not indivisible this is a
definable unit then we call future go to
cities and probably 99.9 whatever
percent of the time this works fine and
then we have that one situation with
like how the hell does the database
given the state are used transactions
everywhere and it turns out that there
is a solution to this is remarkably
simple sadly i'm going to show it to you
in haskell so
questionable how useful it will be to
all of you but I think the basic point
will be driven home and hopefully you'll
think of it's pretty cool that Haskell
can solve these problems in a really
simple elegant way come talk to me
afterward if you do want to talk about
how we might give us a Python Java
whatever because it is absolutely
possible ok so let's kind of translate
our Python code that we had before and
to Haskell this is just the types of
nature's we don't have to look at any
actual hassle cover and so creates go to
cities is going to be a function from
connection to what's called an iron and
this basically says this Haskell
function can interact with the outside
world and it doesn't return any
meaningful value we're just calling it
for the side effects because it's going
to insert these things into the database
it's not going to actually give us any
results back from sequel same with
create future go to cities and just like
in the Python version in the Haskell
host Chris library there's a function
call with transaction this is exactly
what we saw before it just says began
write your code tibet and if you nest
them together sort of inadvertently as
you compose these little musical
transactions together you get in this
situation where you're calling begin
more than once and then you commit at
like the most nested part of the
transaction and now your whole
transaction Joker and there's a really
simple change that we can make just to
the types that help us out here so types
to the rescue here so if we create this
new data type which we're going to call
PD transaction let's not worry too much
about what it looks like but under the
hood is basically just looks like this
it's a function from connection to some
IO action that we're going to execute
and we have this neat little property of
hassle
is the only way you can interact with
the outside world is through I oh and so
if we have this thing that is just a PG
transaction we know it hasn't actually
skip anything to post chris yet you
might describe what we want to do the
postgres but it hasn't actually executed
yet we have a chance to sort of sneak in
and say like all right we're going to
insert exactly one begin and exactly one
and so the only way to turn this PG
transaction value into an io because we
don't export the constructor for PG
transaction you can only create PG
transaction through these helpers that
we're going to give you the only way to
actually turn this into a value which
will actually execute against post rest
is to call this run PG transaction
function and what does that return you
it returns you an iOS it is not
returning you a PG transaction so once
you like run your PG transaction that's
it you can't pretend to compose it with
another transaction because we've
already set the beginning of the commit
so this really simple change now allows
us to define these reusable functions
which are built on query and execute so
it's going to take a query which is
basically just a string that we're going
to do some sequel sanitization on an
input which is just some hassle of data
type that we're going to send to the
post for us it's going to return the
list of output that matches our query
but it's going to do it inside of this
PG transaction type I know I owe so it
doesn't have to worry about sending
began and commit we specifically don't
call with transaction because there is
no what's transaction that works on PG
transaction so we know that the only way
that
someone can actually execute this is
calling that run PG transaction function
there's also execute which allows you to
insert things into the database and it's
going to give you back an integer of the
number of rows that were deleted updated
or inserted there and so now we can
create these reusable functions to
create go to cities create future go to
cities and they're going to run in this
PG transaction type that we've created
we can now rest assure that if somebody
successfully execute this against
postgres the only way they can do that
is by calling one PG transaction which
is going to put exactly one begin an
exactly one commit at the end and once
they've done that they can't do anything
else with the database for this
transaction a new transaction is going
to start and so the author or the
developer who actually calls this sort
of has to decide how big of a
transaction do I want to compose and
once I've done that I sort of agreed
okay I'm not able to compose this within
the bigger transactions anymore because
it's not possible right so we can now
say create all cities which is going to
be a function this is not a reusable
transaction because it returns this
different type it does not return PG
transaction the types tell us that we
can't even pretend to compose this
anymore we're going to call run PG
transaction passing our connection and
now safely and exactly one again in one
commits we can create go to cities
create future go to cities and nothing
is really lost to us as a user of this
we're just using query and execute as we
thought we were before and we create
these reusable components another kind
of cool thing falls out of this do you
think it's a good idea if you open a
transaction and then sit with the
connection
and for 15-20 minutes no but I
definitely done that before you're like
in some transaction don't even realize
it you're like I'm going to make an HTTP
request and then it times out after like
20 minutes and the database load is that
like 24 24 for machine and it's because
you have this long-running transaction
open inadvertently because inside of a
transaction your database still has
resources associated with this
transaction is keeping like its own
special isolated view of the of whatever
part of the database that you're
touching just for you special you just
for you and you're off making HTTP
requests and so these types actually
allow us if we want to prevent us from
doing that so if you want to be able to
do HTTP requests inside of a transaction
you can sort of give yourself that
permission by making a slight change to
this but if you want to be able to say
once a minute turns out to all I'm gonna
do is talk to post chris as fast as i
can commit the transaction not leave
these transactions open then you can
actually use types as well to eliminate
this entire honestly tough to diagnose
situation where you have these
long-running transactions where you
might have touched a queried table that
has 500 million rows and the database is
keeping this special resource intensive
few of it for you while you're off doing
something that you don't even care if
it's in a transaction you just kind of
made a mistake a very easy mistake to
make as well and so the hassle code I've
just shown you is in an open source
library that we've created at the pomona
at work don't give him so if you want to
check it out the whole thing is like 70
lines of code including a lot of kind of
boilerplate that just Maps the normal
post gross query functions query execute
little variations like that the core
code is honestly like
four lines of code that there's this
whole thing and exercise left to you all
to think about this in Python it will
not be as elegant but I guarantee you it
is also possible to do this sense
whatever your favorite language is so we
chat with me afterwards if you're
interested all right thank you very much
we have time for questions yes you hey I
healing to Cumberland yeah what Oh what
do we do we are an Internet of Things
startup based on San Francisco I'm local
to Chicago the companies based in San
Francisco are basically what we do is we
make it really easy for other companies
to create their own sensors so we have
physical sensors that are
battery-powered which connects back to
our network and you can send Lua code to
those sensors and create production
sensors that use analog digital
converter or gpio and right production
quality sensors that have a battery life
of one and a half to three years by
sending your own code Delta T's and then
on sort of the platform side you can do
all sorts of interesting analytics data
storage and processing without
there is a mac address yeah yeah do you
have any opinions on how frameworks like
spring solve this problem but basically
instrumenting around method calls using
thread local variables to detect whether
or not a transaction is already present
yeah so I I can't speak specifically for
what spring does I imagine several
frameworks do probably kind of solve
this although i will say several that
i've looked at so i originally kind of
read all the code examples in hospitals
again maybe that's not a very good idea
and so i started writing in python so i
did exactly what i was saying before I
wrote a little Python programming that I
looked at exactly what the Python driver
psycho pg2 I think it's called which is
like the Python driver that everyone
uses does it does the naive thing it
actually does something slightly more
nefarious which is that if you're in a
nested transaction it's like oh you're
already in a transaction so I won't Cole
begin again but then it calls connect
that's my and so I kind of redo the
slice it was like that's even more
confusing than just having like pairs of
nested beginning commit yeah I mean I
think somewhat sadly this is the kind of
thing that like you find out by looking
at some bug report and whatever
framework do you use anyone else
cool well thank you very much and I'll
be happy to talk with people more in
person if you want take</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
