in I actually used to live here it part
in Bates little on Sand Hill can picture
but as many years ago I'm based in the
corporate finance organization has that
on I'll come back to the company in a
minute when I joined staff Tory back in
1983 it was a smaller company than what
it is today and most small companies
they want to grow they want to become
bigger fair enough and many succeed but
many also discover that we have not only
become big we also become slow
bureaucratic rigid we have lost a lot of
that agility flexibility that we have as
a smaller organization this is just like
the aging process of a man as we grow
older we do lose loose a bit of
flexibility we had as teenagers
teenagers and I have some practical
experience here so I think the big
question for any big organization should
be how can we find our way back to that
agility we have as a small organization
without losing the benefits of being big
so how can we be small and big at the
same time the big question for small
organization should be how can we grow
without ending up in the same place now
what I would love to share with you is
first the case for change I don't think
I need to spend a lot of time or that
were you guys want to talk to finest
people I need to spend a lot of time
helping them to understand that there is
a serious problem with traditional
management then we shall talk I got a
few general slides about this thing
called beyond budgeting it's actually a
somewhat misleading name because the
purpose of beyond budgeting is not
necessarily to get rid of budgets the
purpose is to create organizations which
are more agile and more human and in
order to do that we need to change
traditional management and what do we
find that the core of the visual
management we find the budgeting process
and the budgeting mindset
so that's where the name is coming from
but as you will learn today this is much
much bigger then we shall spend I should
finish off with sharing with you how we
are trying to do this as tattled we
started out ten years ago and I'm saying
trying because everything I will talk
about is decided it's written into what
we call this tattle book which you can
find a stat or not come by the way but
that doesn't mean that all of this has
reached every head on every corner of
the organization this is actually quite
difficult for a lot of leaders because
this is different so I'm not going to
share with you some kind of sanitized
story about how fantastic we are because
change is hard
we made mistake we stumble we've had
detours but that's what really changes
about real change is actually a bit
messy now one way to position beyond
budgeting is to call it management
innovation it's about exploring new ways
of leading and managing in knowledge
organizations operating in dynamic and
competitive business enrollments which
actually goes for most organizations
these days management innovation is not
management organization that's actually
one of the problems it's a great way to
kill innovation try to manage it there
is an interesting paradox when it comes
to innovation because we all love
innovation right we want to be unique in
the forefront leading-edge when it comes
to technology and products when it comes
to management innovation it's different
that's scary right and then we ask for
we say we want best practice what we
really want is common practice what does
everybody else doing and they we should
call the console schools to make sure
that we are not doing anything stupid
here the consequence of this is that the
left-hand side here is a very crowded
place because everybody is doing it
management innovation is not yet the
crowded place because it is scary and
that is great news for brave companies
who dare to embark on this journey
because you get competitive advantage
out of also exploring management
innovation so it's all about better
performance and I would like to reflect
on this important word performance now
for a few minutes in a different setting
than organizations
I would like us to move into traffic
because in traffic we would also like to
experience good performance when we are
driving to work in the morning or back
home or whatever and my definition of
good performance in traffic would be a
safe and good flow of traffic what
traffic authorities actually what the
same even if I had my dogs from time to
time and they have different ways of
achieving that especially when there is
crossing traffic this is something you
often meet the traffic light to
questions around the traffic light who
is in control here and based on which
information and of course the one who is
in control here is the guy who
programmed this light right and the
information this programming would be
based on would not be entirely fresh
information as you were standing there
waiting for that or sitting waiting for
that green light and the guy who made
decisions here would not be in the
situation together with you but again
the best of intentions to create a safe
and good flow then we have an
alternative the roundabout same
questions very different answers who is
managing in the roundabout well it's
actually we have drivers and the
information we based our management and
decisions on is real-time fresh here in
our information so very different
answers could be interesting to compare
a bit more these two ways of managing
traffic which is most efficient and
effective by the way well it's actually
been proven that the roundabout is is
more more efficient and maybe it has to
do something with what you just talked
about we access the fresh information of
course you have access to fresh
information in front of that light as
well but what you don't have is the
authority to act on that information
because that authority rests with
someone else which is most difficult to
drive in one is the roundabout and again
back to organisations for a minute
everything we are trying to leave behind
the status of traditional management is
in a way much easier from a leadership
point of view than what you know or
trying to do instead but we can't go for
what's the easy because as EC we have to
go for the stuff that's good for
performance a leadership is actually not
meant to be easy
last question before we leave traffic is
it relevant to talk about values in this
setting of traffic and it's one of my
many leading questions today and the
answer is yes we sometimes talk about
values based management and the opposite
of values based management you could
call roots based management traffic
light is a good example of roots based
management read this top and greenest
drive we can always discuss yellow but
it is a very simple roots based system
and if the recent value set and mindset
among drivers waiting for that green
light which is about me first I don't
care about the rest that is normally not
a big problem in front of that light but
in the roundabout me first I don't care
about the rest is actually a big problem
because in the roundabout we have to
interact with people in a very different
way we have to be more we have we need a
positive common purpose of wanting this
to fall well we have to be more
considerate we have to interpret
intentions of others and so actually me
first don't care about the rest would be
a big problem
trust and transparency is also important
we were serious in the in front of that
traffic light the authorities are not
really trusting us what we have to be
managed in the roundabout they trust us
to kind of manage ourselves transparency
is important in front of that light in
theory the only thing you need to see is
the color of the light you don't need to
see in the rest of the traffic I never
take that chance but in Hindi theory in
the roundabout it's very important that
there is transparency that you can see
what's going on around you to make
decisions now the roundabout is a more
self-regulating way of managing and it
is also a setting where the label
performance management is not very
relevant it's actually a phrase I don't
like very much even if I have it in my
title for different reasons and here
performance management is definitely a
relevant label that's exactly what
authorities are doing but in the
roundabout it is much less about
managing performance it's much more
about creating conditions for great
performance to take place
and I think as as far as people as HR
people and actually I worked both places
that is something we need to reflect on
in how we do our job because I think or
I think there's a lot of illusions of
control here and when funnest people HR
people say that if we don't manage
performance
there will be no performance when they
say that if we don't develop people
there will be no development I mean that
is excuse me it is not true it
is much more illusions of control but
it's not bad news because there's a lot
of stuff we can do to create conditions
for performance to take place and for
people to develop themselves again back
to self regulation I would argue that in
today's realities organizations need
more self regulating management models
for at least two reasons the first
reason has to do with our business
environment which has a lot more out
there or what they call VUCA you
probably heard that expression we you
see a volatility uncertainty complexity
ambiguity and if we take that VUCA
seriously it should have significant
implications for how we design our
management models compared to if there
is no Bucca out there right the other
reality we need to reflect on and take
the consequences of it's not external
its internal it has to do with people it
has to do with asking ourselves what
kind of people do we generally think we
have in our organizations and one
language for that discussion was
invented by Douglas McGregor 1960 he
wrote a great book he called the human
side of enterprise and he introduced
what he called Theory X and Theory Y
it's got nothing to do with Generation X
or Y that came much later it's basically
two opposing views on people and what
motivates people
Theory X is very much the negative view
it's a view that most people in an
organization is a bunch of potential
thieves and crooks which all must be
managed tightly I kept my short leeches
because if not we know what will happen
they will all run away do a lot of
stupid things and spend money like
drunken sailors well that was the pop
for evolution McGregor he was a bit more
polite than academic in this book I
think that's what I meant then you have
Theory wine very much the opposite view
have you that most people beyond being
many are well educated
that there's a lot of competence and
that most people want to do a good job
they want to perform they want to be
involved they won't be listened to they
want to be treated as adults and again
we don't need to so far to agree on what
we mainly believe in although I hope we
mainly believe in why but there should
be very easy to agree that if we mainly
believe in why it has a very different
consequences for all management model
compared to if we mainly believe in X
now if we combine these two realities we
need to reflect on the world out there
people in the organization it could look
like this you recognize the two
dimensions and I would argue that
traditional management lies in this
lower left-hand corner one more
reflection on x and y before I move on
here and you know I hope you have
understood that as that all over
sympathy is on this side but we are not
not even every time I talk about x and y
there are some faces popping up in my
head and I can see those guys right now
those faces belong to people at status
that I think that would put here right I
think you need to keep a close eye on
those guys they are not many but they
exist and there might be some faces
popping up in your heads as well because
those people I mean they can exist in
any organization that is not the issue
the issue is do they represent the
minority or a majority because if they
exist but represent a minority we cannot
paste the design of our management
models on minorities what we need to
base that a sign on our majority view
and if that is why that needs to draw
the design now in order to get out of
traditional management we need to
address both dimensions both leadership
horizontally management processes
vertically and what we need to get out
of is something that's very rigid it's
very detail is very onion it's very rude
based a lot of micromanagement Center
has come out of control a lot of secrecy
and the strong belief in sticks and
carrots like for instance individual
bonuses now there might have been a time
when this was the right place to be the
right thing to do I'm not arguing that
might still be places around but this is
the right thing to do it might be but
for us and start on that discussion is
completely uninteresting and by the way
I'll come back to the company a bit
later because we know who has our
business environment disappear that's
effective and we believe that the
majority of people as that all
is on this side so we need to move up in
that upper right hand corner and the
route is again by addressing both
dimensions on the leadership start we
need to be more value spaced and
rules-based that does not mean no rules
it simply means that the stronger you
are on the value side the less routes
you typically need we need more autonomy
in this bucha world there isn't always
time or very seldom time to run nine
floors up to get the decision because
then it can be too late
and by the way decisions aren't always
improved because they are lifted
upstairs very very often is the other
way around we need more transparency and
this is good news for all the skilled
managers I met over the years who are
afraid of leaving this rather
comfortable safe corner because they are
afraid of losing what do you think they
are afraid of losing control right and
that fear is real because I can see it
in the rice what they maybe don't
understand is that a lot of those
controls they are afraid of losing are
nothing but illusions of control but
still the ferris wheel so here are some
good news for skilled managers
transparency can be a great control
mechanism it's a social control
mechanism and there is a reason why most
thieves and crooks operate at night
right because tan is dark there's no
transparency and you might have heard
this wonderful story from wash the giant
pharmaceutical company quite
traditionally malice but they did a very
interesting experiment around travel
cost in a pilot they kicked out a travel
budget they kicked out most travelers
and regulations what they introduced
instead was full transparency on travel
cost so everybody could see if you
traveled to where did you fly eat and
sleep cheaper expensive open for your
colleagues to see and vice versa what do
you think happened with travel cost in
the pilot came down through a very
simple self-regulating control mechanism
I'll give you another example in a
minute last but not least we need to get
hold of that internal the intrinsic
motivation in people that can move
mountains if you really can mobilize it
and my experience is that most managers
they accept that there is something
called intrinsic internal motivation but
here is where it goes wrong because they
think that well if we on top of that
internal motivation add a bit of X
motivation extrinsic motivation then you
get more motivation that sounds quite
logical doesn't it well let's take a
look at what research is saying here
initially research research says yes you
do get more motivation if three
conditions are present if there's little
motivation in the job itself if it's
easy to count and if the quantity is
more important than quality
so for chasing rats picking fruits
whatever individual bonus is a great
motivation mechanism but then research
goes on and telling us that when work is
more complex when more cognitive skills
are needed when more teamwork is needed
then you lose that effect you not only
lose it but very often it has a negative
effect it's called the crowding out
effect the the external motivation eats
from the internal motivation and the
total is actually less motivation so I
hope you understand that it's not only
budgets I lost my belief in I am NOT a
big fan at all of individual bonuses and
by the way I never understood it if
individual bonus should be so great for
motivation how far could we find the
biggest doses at companies at the top so
is that when we find the most boring
jobs in companies the CEO the CFO and so
on have the biggest bonuses I don't get
it
I just don't get it anyway that's that
or we have always tried to be a people
oriented value space company I'm not
saying you're perfect but it is
important for us this book says a lot
about it so our challenge was maybe more
that we had management processes that
had a different message because it
doesn't help to have these theory why
leadership visions if you have Theory X
management processes so our journey has
very much been about trying to change
your management processes to deflect
what you say about people and at the
same time make these management
processes more of you've got a burst
here's an example of thing some things
that we typically need to do typically
the detailed annual traditional budget
needs to go because it represents so
much of traditional management more
specifically we need to think
differently around how we think around
targets and goals to the extent we shall
have them we need less or what I call
29.2 targets what the target is 29.2
anything above is good anything below is
bad
understory that is a very narrow
mechanical language for an openness
leading language for describing
performance so we need sometimes we need
to think more natality terms well
however versus others doesn't help that
we hit 29.2 if the other ones are doing
30 or 35 and vice versa we need to think
about how we achieve these results we
need to think about values we need to
take into account when we shall evaluate
performance Himes our insights all the
things we know afterwards that we didn't
know what front we call this a holistic
performance evaluation I'll come back to
that and last but not least we have to
kind of break out of this prison called
the calendar year
why should everything we do circulate
around the period which is which runs
from January to December it makes sense
for a count again make sense for text
but that is not the stuff we are talking
about here so we need to organize your
processes more event-driven more
business driven and less calendar driven
and this ladies and gentlemen is what
beyond budgeting is about trying to move
up in that upper right-hand corner by
addressing both leadership and
management processes in a consistent way
to become more adjoint and more human
there's a number of companies on this
journey in some form of shape here's an
overview some of them and I could have
spent the rest of the day talking about
fantastic management innovation going on
in these companies we don't have the
time so I need to just to take a few
examples here let's start in the IT
business miles is in the region IT
company no budgets no targets no nothing
well they have a few simple for course
that's all their most important process
is recruitment they spend an enormous
time getting the right people on board
they never take less than 10 references
and when management is interviewing the
interviewers only about beliefs values
behaviors they don't talk IT at all they
leave that talk to skilled IT people
already on board and if the RT on
employees says no then it is a no
because they have a veto right IT
company so your PC is important my
simple use came by whatever pieces they
want and change it as often as they want
competence training is important they
can attend whatever training they want
as often as they want wherever in the
world the only thing the company
requires is that when they have bought
that PC when they have returned from
that training they have to post what
they did and the cost of it on the
internet so social control mechanism and
they have just one small concern it's
not a big concern once just once more
concern around this control mechanism
could it be too effective now the
veteran here is the company you see on
top on this pumpkin it's a Swedish bank
that today operates across Europe has
around 900 branches across Europe it's
the fastest-growing bank in the UK this
Bank completely abolished traditional
budget they already back in 1970 not
that's a goal in itself it's just one of
many things they did to become more
agile and more human
so no budgets no targets no forecasts no
nothing just a lot of decentralization a
lot of autonomy and a lot of
transparency and that's interesting but
that is not a goal in itself the goal is
good performance let's look at how this
company has performed over the last 40
years this company has been performing
better than the average of its
competitors every single year since 1972
this bank is among the most
cost-effective Universal banks in Europe
this bank has never needed a bailer from
the authorities because they messed it
up I can think of a number of other
prestigious banks who have some point in
time needed help because they must adopt
this Bank never Bloomberg has rated
Honda sparkin as the most solid bank in
Europe it can't be a coincidence a
radically different management model
fantastic performance hunters balkan and
some other companies they inspired what
in the late 90s became known as beyond
budgeting so actually beyond budgeting
as a kind of a philosophy came about
roughly at the same time as agile and
these are the beyond budgeting
principles I will not go through this in
details I have talked a little bit about
stuff here already on the leadership
side I will talk a little bit more about
this when we come to start all in a
minute but if you reflect on these
principles
first of all these principles do not
represent a management recipe right
these are principles they provide
guiding inspiration but what this should
mean in your organization that depends
your history your culture your business
so it's not identical what has happened
in these organizations on the previous
slide and that's the way it should be
I don't like management recipes because
in a management recipe somebody has done
all the thinking for you right your only
job is to read all the books hire the
consultants and tick the boxes I find
that quite boring but also quite
dangerous if you like to think for
yourself there's not a great news in
beyond budgeting another important
message this is an attempt to create the
consistency between we what we say about
people and leadership on the left hand
side and what we do in our management
processes on the right hand side let me
give you a few examples of the opposite
of lack of consistency that you so often
find in organizations it doesn't help
that we here on this side talk loud and
warm up about we understand together and
team and everybody in the same boat but
everything we do on incentives is about
individual bonus right right or wrong
there is a gap between what we say in
what we do it's poison another example
it doesn't help that we talk equally
loud and warm here about how fantastic
people we have on board that we would be
nothing without you and we trust you so
much but not that much of course we need
detailed travel budgets right guess what
would happen if we skip those the poison
and I hope you also see that beyond
budgeting is about so much more than
another way or managing cost yes we need
different ways of managing cost compared
to the traceroute budget but that's just
one of 12 principles now when we started
out in staffed or 10 years ago we were a
bit careful
so with these principles to widely today
that would wouldn't be an issue but let
me share with you the startle model and
this is also a nutshell Scandinavia's
largest company and here's some data on
the company yeah so basically that's us
and our journey started in 2005
our process we call we call it ambition
to action three purposes translate
strategies securing this flexibility
agility I talked about and last but not
least activate activating what we say in
this book about people and values and
Egypt now there are some steps in this
process which might be familiar you
might have something similar in your
organization but I think the way we do
this is probably somewhat different it
starts with strategy over here which we
try to make a bit more concrete by
making what we call strategic objectives
which is what does success look like on
a medium-term how a time horizon we are
more on words then on numbers then we
are trying to find KPIs that can measure
that we are moving towards these
objectives but the only problem with
measurement is that measurement alone
moves nothing nothing happens just
because we measure you don't lose weight
simply by weighing yourself I have tried
no big success and then my wife she has
a sharp tongue from time to time and she
told me a bit dryly that doctor maybe
you didn't stand there long enough all
that weight well that would have been
one kind of action but the point is that
nothing happens before we do something
so it's a big emphasis on actions and
last but not least what does this mean
for you and me and the teams that we are
in and here is an example of translating
words in the book because the very first
words in the starter book says that all
the way we deliver is as important as
what we deliver and when the way we
deliver we talk about behaviors and the
values in this book and that decision
came from our CEO to make sure sure that
everybody understood that he was serious
about this he put the waiting between
the what and how in all consequences for
your career for your base pay individual
bonus if you if you if you have that he
put that waiting to 50/50 and you might
say that that was a brave decision but
on the other hand it was an obvious
decision because how can we say in this
book that we are trying to be a values
based company everything around values
is completely absent from our
performance process
let me share with you some areas there
where we try to be distinctly different
from others let me start with KP ice
which are gonna call me from the
balanced scorecard thinking and I have a
very undeveloped view on all KP ice we
need to remember that the I in KPI
stands for indicators right they are
indicators that are trying to indicate
that they're moving towards our
objectives but they are not necessarily
telling the full truth they are not
called KP TS key performance truths they
are called key performance indicators I
spent too many years of my life
searching for those perfect KPIs I've
given up simply because they don't exist
Albert Einstein not everything that
counts can be counted and not everything
that can be counted counts so a
measurement can be good servant that as
a master alone measurement can be a
disaster you can't run it only by the
numbers when we started out many many
years ago we'd kpi's there was only KP
us there were nothing here nothing here
and again then you get a very narrow
mechanical performance language you need
something broader and you also need is
holistic performance evaluation which I
will come back to where we take off for
measurement losses and look at what
measurement didn't pick up before we
make any kind of conclusions
now here is an example of an ambition
traction I won't go through this in
detail but it's inspired by the so
called balanced scorecard trying to
identify all the drivers that in the end
give you good financial results and by
the way the way we define financial
results and performance is not any
absolute numbers it's all about league
tables we have defined the league table
of eleven other oil and gas companies
and for all it's all about how we are
doing versus those companies so we set
the relative targets just talking
football but again if you want good
financial performance you need to
perform well toward customers and market
you will never do that unless you're
good on internal operations you will
never be good on internal
unless you're good on health safety and
the environment and people in
organizations this is about winding back
to the things that in the end give you
good performance you can't manage down
here if you want to manage or create
conditions for great performance to take
place it has to happen in those other
dimensions and the consequence can be
good performance today we have around
800 of these in the organization it
might sound like a big number but nobody
has a relationship to 800 you have a
relationship to your own and those
around you and let me use this slide
towards the end to illustrate two other
areas where we try to be different the
first has to do with creating so-called
alignment you know this red thread
throughout so that we are kind of
walking reasonably in the in the same
direction it can't be chaos it can't be
anarchy there is a simple way of
creating alignment that a lot of fun is
people love but that's the wrong way
it's called cascading it's called
sitting sitting at the top corporate
finance and then cascading down these
are your study objectives these are your
KPI initial KPI targets and you know
finest people when then they can when
they can add up all the local numbers
here and it matches the corporate number
then they think they can sleep well at
night we will deliver because all in
that numbers add add up they are so
wrong because if that kind of cascading
kills everything around involvement
commitment motivation it is worth
nothing we still need alignment but we
also need commitment involvement
motivation we achieve that balance
through what we call translation instead
of cascading translation is about
anything here when they shall make their
own ambition traction they would look
around they would look we have a level
above maybe all the way up to corporate
maybe a bit left and right if there are
interfaces and then this team shall have
a deep and good discussion about how
what should our ambition look like in
order to support the direction and
ambition levels of other teams that we
have a relationship to and if such a
translation should go wrong which is
almost it's not the problem but if it
should go wrong of course the the the
level above should intervene and what
paid before but one reason why it's not
a problem is again transparency because
all of these ambition two actions are
open for all employees there is some
share sensitive information we have to
hide but beyond that everything is open
so there's no place to hide with a
stupid ambition traction with wrong
direction or or to low emission levels
this doesn't mean that we never cascade
there are situations there can be
critical situations where a little dose
so that can be needed but it should be
much more the exception than the rule
then it was more accepted when it when
it happens the other area we try and by
the way it's not mandatory to have an
ambition to action it seems decide for
themselves and many teams they all score
some ensured we have an ambition to
action in our theme and our answer would
be that well we would definitely
recommend this but your decision should
be driven by whether you and your team
perceive this as a good way of managing
yourself alright that should be your
motivation so but even if it's not
mandatory the number has kind of
steadily been been been increasing now
another issue has to do with time we
used to have annual versions of a
mission direction right so every autumn
we made a new one for next all these
teams maddening you want for next year
it wasn't a budget process but it was
still an annual process we don't do that
anymore
in 2010 we decided to skip any
inversions so now these teams all these
teams can update whatever they want on
their own ambition to action when
there's a literate what they can update
objectives with strategy change they can
update KP ice if these objectives change
or if they simply find a better KPI they
can even change their KPI targets if
these targets have lost their meaning
and lost their meaning could mean this
target is impossible to achieve or it's
a piece of cake the only control
mechanism we put around this is that if
you want to change something that's big
you can do that at any time but if it's
big you still need to get yes from above
one level up if it's small you simply
inform to the same level big or small
always make sure that we inform those
affected by your changes so this is the
coordination of it and we have left it
to the organization itself to define
what is big and what is more it's not
something we can define a corporate
level which means that there might be
someone over here that have a different
definition of biggest more than someone
over here but that's okay as long as it
will expose places targets first of all
we are saying that you don't always need
to set targets right and generally I
think we said too many targets some
people say that you if well if there is
no target then you can't evaluate
performance well that's and so
I hope that the next step on our journey
here will be that we set much less
targets than what we do today but the
important thing is actually who says
those targets I'm much more relaxed
about targets that team set for
themselves compared to targets coming
from a both and again the kind of
targets you set is also important what
I'm more in favour of a relative targets
than absolute targets the target should
have natural time horizons why should
all targets have a deadline end of
December it doesn't make sense right so
to the extent there are targets have
natural time horizons so I'm sure if
there's you see so I'm longer if it's
more complex you can still if you want
have an annual performance evaluation
where you look at performance once a
year and some targets would be completed
three months ago sometimes did work in
progress so that's not a problem let me
then move to the holistic performance
evaluation which i've touched upon a few
times and holistic means two things here
first of all is the 50-50 between the
what and the how second it is about when
we shall assess especially the what side
the delivery side it is about pressure
testing measurement before we conclude
because if the formal evaluation is
reduced or dumbed down to only counting
the number of red and green kpi's
the only qualification you need as a
leader is actually
two things well first of all you must be
able to count and second you can't be
colorblind and I wouldn't pass because I
can count but I'm called a blind but
anyway I mean we we we can't reduce that
important job to something that dumped
so yes we do count but that's just the
starting point then we take off the
measurement glasses and look at what
measurement didn't pick up yes I see
that
that KPI is green but that we really
move towards those fatigue objectives if
we look at what measurement didn't pick
up how ambitious were those targets if
you have one team that set themselves an
ambitious target really stretched and
some spoiled but somebody else target up
here didn't completely make it KPI
yellow and green then you have another
team over here the leader is a kind of a
good negotiator good at gaming
low-balling all were so difficult we're
able to get the target down here
performance here Wow green KPI take away
those targets which team perform best
should we punish the team that stretched
a little completely make it compared to
the team that kind of low-balled and
made it we has to been significant
changes in assumptions significant
headwind tailwind that we should take
into account what and a few other
questions which we need to ask before we
can conclude what kind of performance
are we looking at and today we do have a
rating scale in both dimensions 1 to 5
I'm not a big fan of rating scales and
we have that discussion as many others
shall we simply skip that rating which I
hope we will do but the important thing
for me is that we have this holistic
pressure testing and the outcome of that
that the score is the basis for
development plans for all employees and
for rewards based pay adjustments and
individual bonus for those own
individual bonus so we do have
individual bonuses very modest compared
to our competitors
I'm not a big fan of it but again the
important thing is that we have this
this holistic evaluation so to conclude
going back to the traffic method for
what we are trying to do is to change
your management model the way we think
about these important issues kind of
leaving the traffic
right performance management where
you're thinking and to transform this
into something that has more to do with
creating conditions for great performers
to take place when it comes to how we
manage cost are in a time to talk about
that but we don't have traditional cost
budgets more event-driven more
translation more relative KPIs and more
transparency and less secrecy this is an
attempt to simplify but simple is first
of all simple is not the same as easy
and also yes our management processes
are simpler but from a leadership point
of view this is not simpler and it
shouldn't be because leadership is not
meant to be it's not meant to be simple
so I hope there is time for some
questions afterwards I think we've got
time for that but if anybody wants to
contact me later on these are my
coordinates if you want to follow me on
Twitter
I only tweet about this stuff there's no
cats and dogs and family only budgeting
and if you're even more interested it
was something called the beyond
budgeting round table which is a global
network of organizations interested in
this on the chairman of the European one
if you want to come along at one of our
European meetings you're more than
welcome the next one is not in London
middle of October and if you're even
more interested this is the commercial
of the day seven eight years ago I wrote
a book about beyond budgeting so much
has happened afterwards I've just
completed a significantly revised second
edition which is out now in next month
in the US and a bit later in in Europe
all right I was asked to put on this
slide towards the end so if you like
this session please rate it if you
didn't don't bother
alright any questions or comments
reflections
and I assume you're thinking about the
climate and climate issue here at the
first side that I mean we do not
definitely do not deny climate change is
real and we are part of the problem we
believe that we can also be part of the
the solution here if Europe is consuming
more gas and coal then that would
definitely help but we definitely are
part of the in the problem so you also
come in how are we able to really to
attract young people we have long been
the most popular employer that's that
work and we still are and I think it has
something to do with the fact that we
are trying to be different we hit the
ground running in 1972 we had to catch
up in a very short time with the other
oil companies that have been doing this
for a hundred years so autonomy
decentralization has a one there was no
choice I mean people were giving big
jobs at young age I joined stattle in
1983 1984 I was the head of the
corporate budget department yeah so the
answer is that from a recruitment point
of view this is this at least so far is
not an issue and it's the same in the US
where we typically recruit from other
our competitors other oil and gas
companies and people comment to us that
they want to work for us because we
operate in a different way
so if you can share a recording on my
talk well they are videoing it and I
assume that my voice is going on to that
as well so yeah just start this class I
have no problem so absolutely I
appreciate that so the question is about
the fear of losing control being also
about the fear of not having those tools
available yeah well I think that's part
of the loosing control thing it's the
kind of them it's the mental fear and it
is the kind of the tools thing but but
again I mean this is about leadership
and also this is not about abandoning
control it's about getting rid or what
we should call bad control but it's
about reinforcing what you should call
good control transparency is an example
of a good control mechanism so we are
telling these scared managers that you
might actually get more control by doing
this by leaving behind all those
illusions of control the bad controls
so the question is about the
transparency mechanism at miles around
around that everything is open available
and what washed it first first of all a
story we do not all transparency we do
not go down on individuals we stop at
teams so yes
travel cost we show one in trouble
persons among teams and show trends and
so on but we don't go on individual
level and I think that transparency is a
very delicate control mechanism you have
to use it with caution and with wisdom
because you can really fail if because
it's not about naming and shaming and
blaming it's about creating a it should
mainly actually be about learning what
can we learn from others and then you
get this gentle performance pressure as
a nice side effect but try to position
it more as learning how can we learn
from others is everything a secret what
I think the the biggest learning over
this journey which actually started 20
years ago in 1995 I was heading up
finance in a company called borealis
which when we kicked off the budget and
back in 1995 at that point in time that
was before I had had my HR career at
that point in time my problem definition
was much more narrow it was about kind
of the resource waste of budgeting and
and that at the time we spent and so on
and I didn't see as clearly as today all
the people and leadership aspects of
this I didn't see how it kind of all has
to connect I think that's been my
biggest learning and again that is why I
love these beyond budgeting principles
because they are trying to address the
totality of these important issues right
and it has to hang together and there's
a lot of great stuff out there on I mean
let me put it this way some people ask
how come beyond budgeting is taking so
much longer than for instance agile
liens and banner scorecards and other
popular concepts which are and there's a
simple reason for it you can't compare
this be stuff for two reasons beyond
budgeting is different on granularity
and on scope beyond budgeting is low on
granularity it's not very specific and
but it's very high on scope it tries to
address everything under the leadership
and management agenda no criticism
towards agile lean or whatever but those
concepts do not necessarily have clear
views on resource allocation on
incentives on a lot of stuff we are
trying to address all of it
so the totality is my biggest learning
so the question is how does this
comparison with rugelach API work and
first of all most of all relative KPIs
are internal they are not external I
shared an example of some external
status financial performance compared to
eleven other all in gas companies but
that's the more the exception 98% of our
reality KPIs are internal
comparing for instance platforms in the
North Sea on regularity safety
production unit cost and so on and again
with the main purpose of learning but
you get this gentle performance push
this is what Honda's banking is doing
they compare branches on three simple
kpi's customer satisfaction return on
equity cost income ratio but there are
no targets what they say that we don't
need to set targets because nobody likes
to be like us it's a very simple
self-regulating way of driving
performance but learning should be the
main purpose and internally we have this
data we have a common database with all
this the actual performance of everybody
so it's not a problem it can be a bit
more difficult externally
so the question is what are the
alternatives to individual bonus I think
there's a lot of alternatives first of
all you know I challenge the notion of
individual performance as a starting
point how individual is really
performance today I mean this notion of
the Lone Ranger riding out at sunset
that kind of blowing the smoke of his
Smith &amp;amp; Wesson or having kicked some ass
and softer of today's trouble that is
something of the past I mean even if in
what we Herald as individual performance
the exhales well maybe that sales today
was the result of great back of his
performance on the previous sale right
so I kind of I think the problem already
starts with defining performance at an
individual level but second
organizations have boulders for two
different reasons there is a market
reason we have to be competitive I can
buy into that but there are many ways of
being competitive the second is it's
good for motivation and that is where
I'm challenging this stuff because
theory research is saying the very
opposite alternatives common bonus games
you might have heard about the the peer
bonus games that you're gonna Paulo
foresters talks about where I mean
everybody gets a bonus but you are not
allowed to keep it you have to pass it
on to colleagues that you think deserve
it and it's based on a notion that
colleagues knows better about to perform
stunts and then than the boss you could
argue it's some kind of individual bonus
still but it's still a better solution
but again you should read a great book
ultra-cool punished by rewards it's a
wonderful book that can really you know
alright one more quick question I think
we need to do the course
so the question is if you can have
transparency on all salaries well
actually in Norway the authorities are
doing that job process because all the
kind of texts
what kind of texts and information is is
posted it's public but again I mean
transparency is not a goal in itself
right
the main purpose is learning and I'm not
sure if I see the learning purpose of
kind of knowing knowing other people's
salary but yeah again there's no right
or wrong here in some companies it might
work other companies it wouldn't but
generally it's a very effective
self-regulating control mechanism all
right his 10 posts you got more stuff to
do so thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
