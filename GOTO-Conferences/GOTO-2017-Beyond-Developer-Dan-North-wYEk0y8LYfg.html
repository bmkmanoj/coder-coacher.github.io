hmm
Sunday afternoon so yeah that was a fun
one to explain to my wife I'm just gonna
be traveling to anyway welcome I want to
talk about human beings so who here is a
developer nearly all the hands went up
who isn't a developer okay are you all
sort of manager so you your your causes
of work in developers yeah or you coach
developers okay so if you're in Martin
has talked this morning
brilliant I'll of Martha's hooks and he
started off with there's coming out with
some quotes about you know that we sort
of think of is fairly modern in terms of
software and he's saying yeah and Alan
Perlis said this in 1967 and you know
Melvin Conway said that thing in 1968
and all this stuff like you know we've
been there before mmm-hmm I wanted to do
something a little bit similar I want to
go back in time I want to talk about
what it used to be like to be a
developer and how that's changed over
the years and what that means for us
right what that means for us as
developers so let's go way way back
let's go back to the old testament okay
so in the beginning in the beginning
well not all the way back 1844 mmm-hmm
does anyone know what this is one hand
went up go what is it no no the other
Lovelace this is a a reproduction of so
this is all of the software in the world
in 1844 this is arguably the world's
first computer algorithm so the story is
Charles Babbage who's invented this this
computing engine this this arithmetic
engine thing it's made out of
steam and goats and stuff and and and
he's explaining to people how it works
and what it does and that you can get it
to do calculations and there's this
young Italian guy in the audience who
went on so it turns out to become the
Prime Minister of Italy but he's making
notes and it turns out he's making notes
in French I don't know if he's showing
off or what but he's making notes in
French and so a little bit later Charles
Babbage decided it might be useful to
have this translated then he's got notes
of his talk so he asks a young lady her
name is August ah ADA King Knoll we know
her better as Ada Lovelace the Countess
of Lovelace she is the daughter of Lord
Byron
Lord Byron famous for being a opium
fiend and poet and so a little virus
will run off and gallivanting with all
these women and so his wife said to said
right there's no way his daughter was
gonna grow up to be a poet so we're
going to teach her engineering and
science and maths and stuff and so Ada
Lovelace had a very unusual education
she was educated in a very scientific
way and so she took on this job of
translating this this stuff for Charles
Babbage from French and on the way
through she made some notes and they
were very originally called notes so all
of the notes it just is a little note
and note G which was the previous
picture that is a that is her making a
notation of essentially how you could
teach this analytical engine to do
Bernoulli numbers to calculate binary
numbers so she saw that you could take a
computing engine and give it
instructions and make it do stuff okay
no tests okay just gonna put that out
there but you know they didn't have a
computer so that's fair enough so this
is 1844 this is all the programmers in
the world so there's two things firstly
all the programmers in the world with
female and secondly all the programmers
in the world really knew how to dress
who knows there are t-shirts and shabby
jeans and whatever and she's like that's
quite an outfit so okay so time passes
okay does anybody recognize that any
hands going up hands one one of my
favorite favorite games of all time from
the 1980s it's The Hobbit The Hobbit
adventure game and you type in things
and it said and if you typed in weight
it said you wait time passes and if you
were with Thorin Thorin waits as well
which is kind of nice you know
Thorin doesn't just walk off and leave
you throwing weights with you which is
nice hmm so hundred years later okay
it's now 1944 things have gotten a bit
serious now
so the idea of a computer has become and
as with many of these things we get
Martin alluded to this and this morning
most technical innovation tends to start
in the military it tends to start in
defense and then it goes into academia
and then it goes into commerce it goes
into business and so for instance the
internet started as an exercise in
getting computers connected to each
other by DARPA the US Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency and it was
originally called ARPANET and then it
went into universities and it's called
Janet the joint academic network and
then we knew it as the internet so
computers are being used to crack codes
okay so this is to women because again
all of the program is at the time or
women and these women genuinely are
hackers because they're hacking they're
hacking the lorentz cipher the-the-the
the crypto that went into the into the
Enigma cryptography machine so and
according to Wikipedia the the the fount
of all knowledge this is Dorothy Dubois
saw and Elsie Booker Hurley programmers
and sorry necessity is a mother of
invention and then then what happens and
then we invent tools so this is Admiral
Grace Hopper one of my heroes she
invented the compiler because
because she had to yeah because because
this sucks not to have a compiler
there's a wonderful interview with her
honored on a chat show and interviewing
but he says he says so say says so they
hired you because what you were that you
were a computer expert and she's like
there weren't any computer experts we
were inventing this stuff as we went
along so she invented a compiler she
also invented the nanosecond I don't if
you know about this so what she was
doing she was trying to explain to other
Admirals in the US Navy in the US
military in general she was saying you
can't have instantaneous communication
with your ships at sea because space
right and they said well alright I can
pick up a telephone and blah and she
said no let me explain and so she phoned
down to the machine room she said I need
you to cut me off a bunch of lengths of
wire about that long okay and so a
hundred lengths of wire so she would
walk around with these lengths of wire
around her neck and when she was in a
meeting she'd say here have a nanosecond
and she'd pass one of these links of
while is like what's that that and then
if that's how far light travels in a
nanosecond and so then she'd say right
so now what happens is this when you
send a message the light travels in
nanosecond so I'm going to lay these
things out yeah so every one of these
all the way up to the ionosphere
all the way back down to the ship right
every single one of those is a
nanosecond
that's the shortest possible time you
can have communication in and they were
going oh oh she also had some
microseconds as well but they were much
longer like big coils of wire that's how
the event tools and then okay so now
we've got some tools and now people
start to specialize so this is now we're
in the sixties and computing has become
simple enough even men can do it and and
so we've got these two guys here
debugging a mainframe this is an
academia now and of course pair
programming which is nice right so you
know they got into that pretty early on
and so people start to specialize and so
you get into these if these different
kind of specialisms so it wasn't just
coming and a fixed staff it was well you
know we've got the idea of an analyst
and a programmer and whatever else and
so we got Commandments
okay so then I just like to lay down
rules and we say things like you shall
have a business requirements document
okay because this is what we do when we
take things into industry we like to put
rules around it and we say things like
you shall have a functional
specification you shall program in the
manner of the specification okay you
shall have no other specification before
me okay there is one truth right and you
code to that truth analyst shall analyze
architecture architect we have these
silos of specialism and then we say
programmers shall program and by that we
mean take a detailed functional
specification and turn it into code it's
like a tin tray out tray kind of thing
and then in a testers shell test which
is taking the crappy code and turning it
into bug reports right similar sort of
deal okay there's more there's more
Commandments doesn't stop there you
shall complete a formal change request
you don't just go this could be better I
think if we you know if I brought my
baby in and put it at my feet and
figured out how to land a rocket on the
moon right I could probably no no no no
no do you have a functional
specifications you have a formal change
request for that no no I don't you shall
provide release documentation okay you
don't just get to put stuff into
production
you shall not release to production
yourself lest you incur the wrath of the
release manager we still have that one
that hasn't gone away
you shall not hack on that which is in
production more of a guideline really
but then start and this was my early
career this is probably up until I know
9899 I started programming I'm much
younger than than Martin I started
programming in the mid 80s okay about
two years but like professionally as
well not professionally but as a
graduate probably 91 91 onwards so wrapt
first ten years of my career this was
normal this is how you did work and then
and then stuff happened all right let me
got the New Testament and this was
around about 2001 there was a new
covenant a new deal and you contract
this is Linda rising famously calls this
the Council of middle-aged white guys
which I quite like this was Bob Martin
late 90s early 2000s he knew a bunch of
people and all these people were trying
to solve similar problems okay they were
essentially what they were trying to do
was help teams deliver stuff in big
companies and what they were tend to do
is you know we have these multi-year
massive programs of work and various
different people had these guerilla
approaches and his guerilla approaches
had names like XP dsdm fdd future driven
development crystal adaptive scrum right
so all these loads and loads of
different methods that people have come
up with and named and it said okay this
is great but that's really kind of
fragmented we need an umbrella term it's
come together and come up and so they
did and it turns out that they actually
tried this in 2000 and they all met up
in a log you know in a ski cabin in Utah
and they spent the weekend drinking
whiskey because that's what happens when
you get 17 middle-aged white guys
together and and apparently nothing
happened and so they were no well I mean
it was great fun but nothing happened so
then the following year they got
together again and this time they came
up with a thing we know is the agile
manifesto mm-hmm so agile manifesto or
you think it's a fantastically enduring
document okay if you stand back and
squint
everything about this is true
15 16 17 years later and I suspect it
will still be true in 10 years time we
are uncovering better ways of working is
how it starts it doesn't say hey we
solve software we've done it see we got
this there's no uncovering ways of
working it's an ongoing it's a continuum
we value a bunch of things we value
processes and tools those things are
important we value individuals and
interactions more than that
so the stuff on the right isn't rubbish
the stuff on the right is valuable
otherwise it wouldn't even have made it
onto the sheet but the stuff on the left
is more important that's what they say
we like comprehensive documentation
because that's how people are going to
understand what's happening later on
famously with at Amazon whenever
someone's going to start a new feature
or new product to Amazon they start with
what what do they start with meetings
functional specification BRD they start
with a press release the first thing
they do is they write the press release
as though the product already exists and
is awesome
and so they've write this amazing press
release and they go right shrug let's go
build that because that's a really
really good way to focus a very good
friend of mine who's my favorite
programmer he whenever he starts
anything he starts with the readme he
starts with the readme that he wants to
read in order to build this thing and
then he'll then the second thing they do
is they write the FAQ imagine this is
already out there and is super popular
what would the questions be and how
would we answer them and I did this one
so I'd written a thing like a little
Heroku kind of ripoff sort of the
internal cloud deployment thing and and
I was leaving the company and I was
handing it over to my buddy and I
started writing the documentation for it
I thought because I don't even a dump it
on him and I wrote the readme and I said
here's all the things you need to do to
install this and as I was writing it it
got to about two or three pages long and
I was embarrassed right and so and so I
figured right what could i clean up here
to make the readme smaller and so we
ended up so I integrated I only took
like a few days but
eventually this readme went all the way
down it said write install this thing
change that thing over there and mate
and just choose a port number so the
whole thing you could configure with an
IP address on a port number and so I
fight for that as embarassment driven
refactoring right I couldn't look him in
the eye and hand him this thing I had to
clean it up so okay so we've got this
agile manifesto hmm and and this changed
a huge amount of stuff who's been in
technology for less than 15 years okay
yeah probably half year over half so
that means this stuff's always exist if
your whole career this has always
existed so who's been around more than
15 years all the tyre darts go I have
right so you've seen this kind of sea
change during your career so revelation
what revelation is there's more going on
I'm now not a person who turns
functional specification into code
you know testers are not someone who
turns deployed software in a testing
environment into a bunch of test scripts
and test script reports we need to think
beyond developer okay we need to think
about things slightly differently so I
tell you what I am now
I think of myself I'm a
multi-dimensional creature I'm a
developer sure
but I'm a developer in a team okay I'm
not a developer on my own with my own
little pile of work I'm in a developer
in a team I'm building a product so I've
got to start thinking about what it
means to build a product and I'm not
again I'm not building that product in
isolation I'm building that product on a
platform okay so that means I need to
start thinking about the ecosystem I'm
working on in the organization I mean a
department it's not just my team you
know this isn't a little siloed
team-based thing there's probably a
whole bunch of teams working towards a
single program there may be a whole
bunch of programs going on across the
portfolio I've worked within a
department and that department exists
inside an organisation so there's a
bunch of stuff going on here right but I
don't want to talk about me I want to
talk about you okay
because you are all those things too
hmm so what I want to do is unpack each
of those things and have a think about
how that impact what you are who you are
your identity things that are going to
help make you a more effective developer
okay so we're beyond this little silo
programmer thing so you're a developer
what does that mean
it means you need to start thinking
about some stuff obviously it means you
need to learn the language right
whatever language you're programming in
you need to learn that language and
there's learning in this learning right
there's I can know roughly how to get by
in c-sharp right I can figure out what
to type I can figure out that kind of
thing that might help but then for
instance c-sharp and Java look very
similar as languages I'm much much more
proficient in Java because a language
isn't just the syntax it's the libraries
so there are some core libraries in that
and it's not just knowing where they are
it's known what they do know what their
performance characteristics are a great
example ruby has a data structure called
list and I can make lists in Ruby and
they are a list right has another data
structure called set in Java I have a
plethora of lists and sets different
types of those for any occasion why
because the sorts of problems that Ruby
Souls it usually doesn't really matter
what's going on under the hood right by
the time it does you have to invent
stuff like memcache right because Ruby
really wasn't designed to do the things
that people try and beat it to do yeah
Ruby is a great prototyping language is
a great sketching language like Python
they're really good sketching languages
they're really expressive but again they
don't have an opinion about things like
so in in Java I could have a regular
array list which is a list backbone
around could have a linked list which is
typically going to be slower to do a
bunch of things faster to do a bunch of
other things much easier to for instance
resize insert things in the middle of
muck around with whereas an ArrayList
I've got all of the the behavioral
characteristics of an array
with sets I could have just a regular
hash set so I've got a bunch of buckets
I could have a linked hash set I could
have a concurrent hash set which means
it's got certain safeguards which means
it's safe under concurrent modification
which probably slows it down a bit but
means that it's safe in certain
circumstances as a Java programmer I
need to think about those concerns
typically and I need to choose the tool
the most appropriate tool for the job
or if I'm most Java programmers I go oh
hash that yeah new hash set set set
equals new hash that right
if you think about what's going on under
the hood some artists earlier on these
algorithms and data structures the fact
the language has them you should know
what's going on in there I had a
conversation with Josh Bloch once many
years ago it was one of the core early
contributors to Java so he wrote the
Java to collections API he did a whole
bunch of stuff early on and he said in
java 1.0 if i think is pre 1.0 the the
implementation of hash code in in
java.lang string was made a hash of the
first seven characters in the string now
the owner of the hash code is it comes
up with a number and they use that
number to put it in a particular bucket
and then what they realize is that most
of the strings people were using in Java
started with http/2 on slash slash and
so your perfectly balanced hash set your
your hash based list of whatever's
everything was ending up in the same
bucket right awkward now luckily they
didn't publish that implementation what
they published is it has a hash code and
it has an equals and this is the
relationship between hashcode and equals
so they could slide in a whole nother
implementation of hash code for Java 1.1
and no one noticed yeah and so be
careful about the behavioral
characteristics of what you're doing so
you need to learn the libraries you need
to know what's there my brief forays
into closure have been which is a kind
of Lisp that runs on the JVM have been
every time I do something in closure I
end up writing a bunch of code and I
look at the core libraries and some code
goes away I look at the core libraries
and more code goes away so I do this and
then why Coco did to do
and ends up mostly being in the core
libraries because the people who design
cloture are much much smarter than me
okay and so really a good way to become
proficient in cloture is to really
understand what those core libraries can
do for you because there's a huge amount
of power to wait in those what else it's
not just about knowing your own stuff
it's about being aware of what else is
going on out there
so JVM folks who's been looking at
Kotlin who's been take a look at Kotlin
and obviously Scala and closure and some
of these other jvm languages there's a
huge amount of stuff going on on the JVM
it's a very exciting place to be
if you're in the dotnet world you're
suddenly seeing like you know dotnet
core on Linux sequel server just came
out on Linux sentences I never thought
I'd hear myself say in my lifetime so
understanding what's going on in your
ecosystem understanding what's going on
elsewhere as well so this is all the
part of what you need to do as your day
job and it's not just about programming
it's not just about writing code that
that intellectual masturbation we were
talking about this morning it's not just
about you know I'm going to write
beautiful code it's I need to get this
stuff live right so I need to know what
the tool chain looks like for my
language or for my technology stack if I
don't understand the tool chain it
limits me it limits me in my abilities
and again I don't exist in isolation
okay so a big part of you being a
developer now in the modern age in the
post agile or in the agile I guess
whatever age is there is a huge amount
of stuff out there and engaging with the
community doesn't mean copying some
stuff I found on Stack Overflow right
and upvoting it when it works but that's
not engaging with the community yeah you
know meetups any kind of gathering where
you can go and learn share knowledge
come into conferences everyone here is
at a conference
epic fab right so share your knowledge
talk to people you haven't met before
right I know I'm saying this to Dana's
and that's nothing we don't even talk to
that families what you're talking about
but you know try it try it's going like
you know walk up
you've never met before and say hi where
do you work what do you do what are you
here for what are you excited about
learning okay so that's what you know as
a developer but again you're not just
you on your own you're a developer on a
team so what does that mean
that means you need to understand how
work gets done you need to understand
what does the system of work look like
in your team right and how could you
improve that system of work
understanding that we're not generic
fungible exchangeable things each of us
has a skills profile each of us has
capabilities but also each of us has
interests each of us has aspirations
each of us has stuff that they get
really excited about and also stuff that
really really bores us and if you get me
doing something I'm excited about guess
what you'll get great work out of me and
if you get me doing something that sucks
for me then I'm probably not going to be
at my best however hard I try it
so understanding the roles in a team
mm-hmm I I think of this as two stages
the first stage is understanding what
the different roles are what people
think the expectations are and the
second part which I much prefer is
messing around with them a bit right and
this idea of t-shaped people or M shape
people or pie shaped people or whatever
the idea that you can not just you did
not just known for the thing you do you
know if I take Martin Thompson is a Java
Performance specialist
that's a pretty most people say that's a
pretty accurate description of Martin
he's not he's a really bloody good
programmer who happens to be working in
Java and happens to get really excited
about what happens close to the metal
right that's him now I listened for the
last jump punch of time there will be
other languages that won't make him
redundant or historic and what it means
is he'll go oh let me try and take all
of this stuff I know and apply it to a
completely new context what if this were
operating safety-critical machinery how
would that affect things what if this
were in a small mobile device what if
this were in a pacemaker I know so
understanding the roles in the team and
mucking her
those rolls a bit I'm sorry kids you
have to learn to share your toys right
collaborating is really important
there's a bank a well-known investment
bank no Ivan I know in the well they're
American but I know them in the UK and
when you first join their as a graduate
you know they're kind of a graduate
accelerated whatever development program
they do two things they throw you
together with a whole bunch of other
graduates from all over the world and
they tell you their art there's two
things that matter to make you
successful at this Bank and they call it
impact and influence okay
impact is what you can do influence is
what you can cause others to do around
you so early in your career most of what
you'll do is impact it's you being good
at what you do and getting better at
what you do and growing in that way
later on in your career it's about
influence so even if you're the best
programmer in the world there's only one
of you right if you as a good programmer
can infect other people infuse other
people with those habits with those
capabilities you just became a 10 X 20 X
50 X programmer yeah that's how you
scale my Ken beck famously said I'm not
a great programmer he said I'm a good
programmer with great habits what makes
him a fantastic program it is he goes
into organizations and teaches those
great habits to other people he is a 500
X multiplier right so collaborating with
others being aware that you solve
problems better when there's more than
one of you pair programming isn't two
people and a computer sitting in a
computer programming it's two people
programming okay it's not one of you
navigating and driving and all these
crappy metaphors it's to human beings
collaborating to solve a problem they
happen to have a computer with them but
all of the magic happens by the fact
that these two people are collaborating
and disagreeing right and
IIIi maybe I'm pairing with I know on
something and she so she solved this a
hundred times before and so she says
okay I know the answers this is the
answer and I've solved this a hundred
times before and I know this is the
answer it so we start working and and
this sort of happens let me go that way
a bit and then we go that way a bit and
then we end up sort of here and we both
go whoa that is so cool right because we
would never have thought of that either
one of us on our own yeah and all of the
software software in my career that I've
been really proud of most of the
software I've ever written that was any
good
I didn't write I was one of a pair that
wrote it but I cannot put my hand my
heart and say I wrote it because I
didn't okay and not just people you like
collaborating is about really reaching
out really getting to grips with all of
the people in the team okay so you may
be very much a technical program you
like to be down in the weeds and the
technology and all of that and maybe the
idea of you know I happen to be building
a trading system I happen to be doing
healthcare I happen to be doing finance
it doesn't really matter the domain
because I'm really down here
you still need to collaborate with
people towards the business side towards
the commercial side of the product
you're building that makes you a better
programmer that makes you a better
developer so collaborating with all the
others and again it's not just about you
say there's six of you in the team if
each of you is looking out for yourself
each of you has one person looking out
for them if each of you is looking after
any everyone else in the team you now
all have five people looking out for you
it's just basic maths okay so you attend
to the team's health you sometimes you
pause and there other people you know go
ahead of you there was one team I was
working at a bunch of years ago in a
bank most of my stories Bank sorry and
there was a particular manager who
wanted to understand each individual
team members contribution in terms of
story points okay so we're gonna measure
everyone's story points am I going to
cull the weakest people in the team and
so there's a chap I don't know if any of
you guys have come across him his name's
Tim McKinnon phenomenal developer and
wonderful wonderful coach
and all-around lovely human being so
he's in the team and he's coaching in
his team and his velocity was zero
Tim's velocity Tim's personal velocity
was zero points and so the project
manager said what it's obvious isn't it
that's the person we call and I said no
no no no you don't get to do that the
reason Tim's velocity is zero is Tim
never signs up for stories because Tim
knows he had much more effective pairing
with everybody in the team he is the
minister without portfolio within that
team right and so what he does is he
accelerates the whole team he is that
10x developer by not committing to
anything himself he enables the whole
team to go fast I said if you take that
guy out of the team everyone on the team
will slow down you will cripple that
team and it took a bit of fighting but
we got to hang on to it yeah so
attending two teams health is a really
really important thing there's a bit of
a tail wagging the dog thing that
happens in even in some quite
forward-looking organizations where they
get a bunch of agile coaches right and
the agile coach is coming into agile
coaching and what that does and
particularly theirs in scrum a lot
because you have said have a scrum
master and the scrum masters job is to
remove obstacles no the team's job is to
remove obstacles because that's how you
get work done right but as soon as I
have a person I can absolve
responsibility onto them some of the
product owner I've got a product owner
so I can absolve responsibility of
product thinking I don't need to think
that anymore so originally these were
coaching roles but we've lost sight of
that and now they become the system's
kind of gone back in the other direction
which is sad so the team attends to the
team's health the team removes the teams
obstacles okay so you're in a team
you're building a product what does that
mean
that means we need to start thinking
about product there's a parallel track
going on about kind of lean UX and
product development and all that kind of
stuff I hope you guys are taking the
opportunity to kind of bounce between
the two because there's some gold in
both tracks it's really really one look
it's a really well set up day today or
it's a really badly set up day because
you want to be everywhere I'm building a
product so that means I need to
understand why I'm here I can't get
excited about something unless I know
why I'm here you know we hear all the
time
how do I motivate my team well give them
something meaningful to you and they'll
do the rest yeah if they don't have a
sense of meaning if you don't have a
sense of purpose in your work someone
needs to pay you a lot of money to turn
up if you do have a sense of purpose I
was talking to someone earlier on about
games the game industry and an awful lot
of particularly independent games
development is just done out of passion
I've got this game in my head and I have
to get it out of my head if I don't get
it out of my head I'm gonna explode
right how much would I get paid I don't
care get out of my way I need to build
my game
yeah so you need to understand the
business objective what's the point of
what I'm doing because if I understand
the point of what I'm doing I can start
making trade-offs I can start moving
towards that goal you study the domain
if you're building healthcare software
find out how healthcare works if you're
building banking software find out how
banking works and working with an
enormous German bank at the moment and
we're going through an exercise and it's
it's wonderfully life-affirming where
you know people who think their job is
to move data from point A to point B and
you suddenly saw actually your job isn't
to move data from point A to point B
your job is to enable the flow of
information so this guy can pay his
mortgage or so this lady can have money
arrived in her bank so that her family
can eat right and do stuff yeah your job
is to create the mechanisms by which
money flows through Germany that's what
you're building you're building an
entire system of Finance for a country
and you look at it and they are right
and they suddenly go whoa ie they start
taking it a bit more seriously which is
always nice to see in a bank I think
it's quite healthy but you just see the
motivation they they're energized
they're like you know I'm not doing this
I'm not turning this set of requirements
interested and they start to become much
more empowered and I'm a bit I'm a bit
in two minds about this word empowered
because in power times like something
you do to someone I'm going to empower
you right it's an asymmetry know you can
empower yourself you can decide you're
going to go and do stuff you can decide
you're going to think differently about
things that's how one can empower
so we study the domain and by studying
the domain that means we can understand
we can solve problems in that domain you
can't study a domain unless you know
about the people unless you interact
with the people who care about that
domain so if I am again building a
finance system I've got traders I've
probably got brokers I might have some
compliance people and legal people right
some security people how else might I
have well I've got the tech operations
people and the support team right those
poor buggers who are going to have to
run my software yeah we don't usually
think of those so we need to get to know
all the stakeholders Mark McNeil is all
my favorite UX people he has this lovely
phrase for stakeholders it's as
stakeholders are people whose lives you
touch write anyone whose lives you touch
by doing work they are stakeholders okay
so anyone who's involved in the work
you're doing so they're those scary
security people they're scary legal
people their lives are touched by the
way you're doing work chap I know was
working in a bank and they were building
a new system and he said I'm going to
build security in I'm going to build
security in rather than what we usually
do which is a security audit at the end
where we have they rip holes in it and
they send us away for three months I'm
gonna build security and so he goes to
the security officer and he says hey
security officer can you tell me what I
need to do to build a secure application
and the security officer said sure show
me what you've got
yeah I don't got anything I'm gonna
start it he said no you need to show me
what you've got I tell you what's wrong
with it
that's how security works and you guys
know what I do it the other I want you
to tell me because I'm good at software
but I'm rubbish at security will you
explain to me how security works it's
like he says no one's ever asked me that
before so he said well okay let's figure
it out together what's the first thing I
should know and they started talking
about like attack surface areas and
threat analysis and threat modeling and
risk and trade-offs and all this kind of
so between them they built up a
collaboratively a body of
your idiot list for security 101 for
securing an application and so that was
a side effect artifact of this product
and so the next time they came along
with application someone said or what
about and also what it meant is that
when they got to the security audit at
the end the review was a bit like this
you know well that stuff we talked about
yeah did you do it yeah on your way
because they'd already been engaged and
so these people who are often
gatekeepers policemen down the line
they become upstream you know it's a
shifting left thing they become upstream
collaborators they become consultants
into your process so getting to know the
stakeholders is a there's a reinforcing
virtuous cycle there so you're learning
about them they're learning about you
you're figuring out how you can solve
problems together it's pretty exciting
and of course you contribute to the
product I'm working for a retailer in
the UK one of my clients and everybody
literally everybody who works there
shops there okay partly because they get
a really big employee discount yeah but
everyone who's writing code everyone is
testing systems or the product team the
back office all of the commercial guys
every single person their shops in this
store so when they say well what would
our customers want well I can tell you
because I am one yeah and only going to
their shop because I like their shop as
well and I try using their mobile app
and it's great it's great though amazing
brand amazing products pretty good
website you know but they know this cuz
they use it and so what's happened is
the mobile product in the last probably
year has gone from okay to actually
really pretty good you know and because
they didn't have meeting after meeting
of business requirement documents and
flowcharts and blood they said what do
we want to be better let's go make it
better what's the next thing we want to
be better that's get it in front of some
customers and let's see what they think
so you can contribute back to the
product and we've I'm asking you this is
a please this is a call to action
everyone here who's in a development
role is to shake off that mental shackle
of we have requirements come at us
we are told what to do in psychology in
Psychological terms it's called being at
effect you can either be out cause or be
out effect if you're at effect that
means things happen to you if you're at
cause that means you you make things
happen so we tend to the at effect when
it comes to requirements when it comes
to what we do in a product everyone here
has a brain everyone here has empathy I
really hope I'm apart from the sociopath
so you guys are fine right apart from
the sociopath everyone here has empathy
to different degrees and so you can
contribute to the product I've seen
probably some of the highest performing
teams I've seen were in trading firm I
was working out a few years ago and you
had developers and traders sitting in
amongst each other and it was just as
likely a really cool idea for improving
the trading stack would come from a
developer as it would from the traders
and over time in fact the traders they
knew their way around Excel anyway but
they started learning Python because
it's a really easy language to learn in
it meant they could just sketch for
things and once they were sketching
things I could say hey I've had this
idea I know it's really crappy code
because I'm a trader but what do you
think of this and then one of the
developers would go that's a really cool
idea I'm gonna iterate on that and they
did trait on that and then turn into a
product and it made a lot of money all
right so you get technical algorithmic
ideas coming from traders you get
business ideas coming from developers
because they both care about learning
the domain carala learning the product
and they contribute to the product so
dividing a product we're voting of parts
on a platform in defense of WebLogic 6
which took a bit of a kicking this
morning so I was also I too was using
WebLogic 6 in probably 2005 ish and but
interestingly you see and this really is
the kind of feed again into what Marty
was talking about earlier is yes we
understand principles and things like no
data structures and whatever else at the
time we were wrestling with WebLogic 6
there was web logic there was WebSphere
there was Oracle had a product that no
one even knew it name was and there were
a bunch of these things and all of them
were equally massive unwieldy
complicated heavyweight and all very
cliquey configuration so you had to
click on a really slow ugly UI that
would crash a lot
and do bad things and what we noticed
was behind the scenes WebLogic was a
Java app and we pretty much knew our way
around Java apps and everything it did
was XML so what you could do is and this
is what we did was you could install
WebLogic and then just snapshot the
directory snapshot everything that just
changed on your file system and you got
a whole bunch of XML files and then you
go into the config pages and start
changing some values and then see what's
changed
do it like a recursive diff put the
whole thing under version control and
that started to tell us we're in these
XML files those values were being stored
it wasn't a great leap to then take
those values and tokenize them and then
have an automated build process that
would drop the values in for us and so
we had this idea of a template server
and so you could take a server you could
template it up you could drop the values
in and now you had build time
configuration completely automated and a
whole bunch of other patterns and
techniques came out of that period and a
bunch of them were then collated into a
book written by J's humble and they
Farley because J's was on the team with
me I heard jazz we were doing the build
engineering side of web logic and Dave
Farley was heading off a bunch of
development teams that were chucking
stuff into it and I guess again in terms
of necessity being the mother of
invention all of these things turned
into what we now call continuous
delivery so we can thank pod logic for
that because if it had been easy to use
that might never have happened but so
you know even when you're using these
tools you can be a defect all this tool
is horrible it's I hate it
ok BizTalk I have no love for BizTalk
right there's nothing good came out of
his talk but you know a lot of other
tools in technologies you're in there on
you're thinking how can I make this
easier for the next person to use ok so
I need to understand the technical
landscape within my organization right I
need to understand what the api's are
what other technical platforms there are
I need to understand my path to
production we talked about this already
so it's not yet enough to
right code I need to be able to deploy
code I they need to think about runtime
concerns monitoring telemetry in
instrumentation
alerting even prediction you know once
you get to alerting sufficiently
sophisticated you can put a bit of
machine learning on there and guess what
you can start to predict when bad things
are going to happen Netflix does this
with their Amazon stack so I need to
care about runtime concerns as a
developer this is something I do in
teams is I put all of the developers I
rotate through the build role for a
period of time I find it makes them a
safer driver okay I'm a huge fan of
development teams carrying a pager right
because if someone's going to get paged
at 3:00 in the morning it might as well
be you oh well now you're going to think
twice about whether that's a warning
message or an error message on you
because a warning message you won't get
paged to 2:00 in the morning
no okay and usually it's someone else
that gets patched they we tend not to
care about that we value automation okay
we care about automation but not all the
automation we can get obsessive with
automation automation has a trade-off
it has opportunity cost automate things
automate repetitive tasks my heuristic
is automated when it gets boring okay
boring means you've done it enough times
that you know how it works and it's been
similar enough times that it's boring
now if it changes every time
don't automate it yet once it becomes
boring that's a good time to automate it
and again you contribute back to the
platform as you're learning things
you're feeding that back to the other
teams the other custodians of the other
platforms and you end up with Dave
Thomas calls these organizational api's
you end up being able to cut to
communicate between departments or
between groups through their API is
because you've got a robust enough
business process and modeled through
those api's in the department so what
does this mean this is that remember I
talked about impact versus influence
this is the influence part so you
understand the wider context okay and
you can make trade-offs I'm in a
position now where even though locally
for my team or my program this would be
this would get me forward the right
thing for the organ
sation is to do something a little bit
more sensible organizations like Spotify
have this you know it's wonderful matrix
model of tribes and guilds and whatever
that mostly exists to try and get some
consistency okay to try and create those
communication channels communities of
practice so that people can find out
what's going on it's a very very clever
idea
it breaks under really really big scale
but there's other stuff you can do right
and there you are showing your knowledge
across teams so you're maybe having like
meetups internally internal open-source
internal conferences one of the things
like I love about the work I do I'm an
independent consultant I often get
invited into companies for doing
internal conferences like really big
companies often do internal conferences
and they've run like this they've run
very professionally but it's just for
their internal employees and it's great
because that that's a clear message that
we're investing in people we're taking
everyone out of their day jobs and leave
them all time I know Berlin or Paris or
somewhere call for a couple of days and
and we're going to decal right now all
of those people are now not at work
that's a really cool thing so sharing
your knowledge across the teams all your
knowledge so when I first started out as
a contractor which would have been
probably late 90s I very quickly
realized that there are two ways to be a
successful contractor to be a successful
independent one is to hoard all the
knowledge if you hoard all the knowledge
you're under sack of all okay the other
is to share all the knowledge because if
you share all the knowledge people want
you to it you to be around they like
having you there and I also learn and
this was Jim I thought work stays
there's a really interesting thing that
happened was this you you would go in
there and you had to solve a problem and
you'd make yourself redundant and they
what happens when you make yourself
redundant usually isn't go away it's
usually that was pretty cool can you
come and solve this other gnarly problem
we've got over here so you don't really
make yourself redundant you just make
yourself available again and then you go
off and do something else so I realized
fairly early on I was going to have to
choose one or the other and I went with
all the knowledge so that's why I do
this stuff I love sharing knowledge I'm
a huge fan of sharing knowledge
encouraging and others you contribute to
the department okay so this is now about
care and feeding of the organization you
know I've seen really really high high
performing developers move into people
roles so where do they burn out as a
developer know they realize that they
could have a much bigger multiplying
effect by helping loads of other
developers right a lot of programmers I
know who speak events and things they
could be a lot more productive if they
weren't speaking events right if I were
sitting there typing stuff yeah but you
know what they are trying to contribute
to the wider weather group so and now
this is about the influencing so you
influence it across the organization so
this is like building your communities
of practice this is doing your learning
lunches or that kind of stuff okay and
then finally in an organization then
it's an organization wherever you work
has values that maybe one of the reasons
you joined that company okay do you
project those company's values and as a
nice little kind of rule of thumb in
terms of are you proud of where you work
would you proudly wear a t-shirt with
your company's logo on it okay I know
lots of people who would I know several
people who probably wouldn't yeah or who
would be completely indifferent because
it just sort of you know they work
somewhere it's neither great nor
whatever but that organization has
values right and so mm-hmm and so you I
your values are either aligned with them
or not and if they're aligned with them
you should be projecting those values
you should be walking down the street
and someone says oh that's a silence a
person they must work at that
organization because of the way they
conduct themselves and so you care about
the organization's reputation it matters
to you you take it personally right and
so that means that you get out there you
get out into the world there's a lovely
phrase a destination employer making
your company a destination employer it's
kind of exciting
so that is somewhere that other people
would want to come and work I have an
idea that I'd like to do is a couple of
my banking clients
I'm calling it the reverse Cockcroft
maneuver okay
so Adrienne Cockcroft was at a
conference not unlike this and he was
talking about Netflix and and some of
the cool stuff they do because he loves
talking about Netflix and the cool stuff
they do and someone on the front row
they put the handoff and he's doing a
Q&amp;amp;A and they said Albert mr. Cole Croft
you've got all these incredible
engineers you know I'm just a bank and
he looked across the front row he's
looking at like the company names on the
on the people as kind of lanyards and he
said I got them all from you he said I
got them all from you and then I got out
of their way yeah and because that's
what he did
these people were really high performing
engineers they were really frustrated
their organization didn't get quality
didn't get why you'd want to care about
this stuff and so they all went off to
somewhere cool like Google or Netflix or
whatever so I'm proposing the reverse
Cockroft maneuver which is I want to
make some banks some of the places I'm
working so cool but it really could
start hiring like Netflix and Google
engineers because they're going to want
to come and have more fun right because
they can do more meaningful stuff
because again this isn't moving a bunch
of money around this is creating the
infrastructure whereby you can pay your
mortgage or you can get your a or your
money moved around or you can send money
to your family in India or back to your
family in wherever else because we've
created the financial structures that
can do that and well I won't say too
much because it's all and it's all an
ongoing at the moment but I'm hoping in
about a year or so time I have some
really exciting stories for you so but
not all the knowledge because you hope
you can flip that IP and stuff yeah so
when you are speaking externally about
your organization be aware that you're
speaking about your organization so and
again you contribute to the organization
in those ways so so you're all those
things okay you're a developer in a team
building a product on a platform in a
department in an organization you are
beyond development
I love this quote is saying if you want
to go fast go alone if you want to go
far go together if you want to go far
quickly pack light so I think that yeah
you want to go fast go alone you want to
go far go together Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
