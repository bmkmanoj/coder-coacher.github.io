to make sure that we understand when I
say continuous delivery that we on the
same page so i found this tweet from
martin fowler earlier this year and
that's how I kind of understand
continuous delivery as well just so
we're clear on that one it doesn't mean
that so it's not the continuous
deployment part where we actually ship
it to the App Store Google Play it's
more preparing so we at any given time
actually have this line that's how we
see it in my team we want to be able to
build a release ready binary at any
given time whenever some product i want
to say let's ship it then we'll just
click the button and then we have the
binary to upload so that's what I'm
going to be coloring and today sorry
yeah and whenever I refer to a wee that
will be me and the small team that I
mean that ebay classifieds and Denmark
and so this is kind of these are the the
two apps that we are maintaining and
developing a beaut biased and DBA if you
guys a Danish most of you are probably
familiar with these brains and so it's
how we do it on these apps that I'm
going to cover and not all the different
options that out there yeah and here
just some of the the tools that we using
we have selected tools that can support
multiple platforms and with multiple
platforms I do only cover the two major
players iOS and Android sorry about that
Microsoft but eh I know that Apple has
started to get more into actually
support you I testing and we just see
that as a hopefully a benefit that can
make sure that cala bassa we use for UI
testing can be more stable since they
can work on the same level as able to us
but we do prefer tools that can cover
multiple platforms so first let's look
at how we do our branching and building
and distribution and with distribution i
do mean how we get our apps for it
manual testing
it to test devices within the office so
we are using a get and working with
feature branches so we do have our
master branch that will have to be
stable at all times and then we'll just
create a new branch whenever we have to
fix something and we might need to do a
bug fix so i'll create a brand for that
one the right on top and fix it and all
the tests and all the stuff that i'm
going to call will be running for that
brains as well when i'm done i'm going
to merge it back to master yeah while
someone else on my team might be working
on the new cooler feature the yellow
orange color actually I do miss an error
here because once I have merged the red
bug fix into master will make sure to
also merge from master into the feature
brand so it contains the bar fix as well
otherwise we might get reported the buck
that was there and the new feature
branch which is not when we intend to do
and working with feature branches also
gives us this great benefit and github
that we can use a pull request whenever
we want to close a feature brains and
merge it in and that's an easy way to do
a code review say to only see what has
actually changed in this branch then we
want to make sure so we're using Jenkins
for continuous integration server and we
want to make sure that all our jobs
building unit tests and integration
tests and you artist that they run for
whatever branch we have in scope right
now and for that we're just going to
show you how it actually works so I'm
going to create a new branch and the
code name here is that it starts with a
feature it's just a naming Pether then
that we have selected so whenever al
Jenkins server sees a branch called
feature it's going to create all the
jobs required or that we have specified
we want so if i create this branch and
push it to get and then you'll see the
jobs on top just created automatically
for me i don't have to do anything we
used to do this manually which led to
that we didn't do it so we will just
work on the feature branch and nobody
really ran all
test some developers tend to forget to
run those on the local machines and then
we will merge it a few weeks later
however that branch was living for how
long and then we will see the the arrow
say on the master branch as soon as it
ran there so now it's automated and push
push the branch out and get these jobs
created if you look at the the master
branches you'll notice that most of them
end with a dash T and that's part of our
template pattern as well so what we're
looking forward to automatically create
the jobs we want that's why you see that
too proud builds a little from the
bottom they don't have the tea that's
because we only run our UI test in the
test cloud I will come back to that
later from our master branch we don't do
that from feature branches which is due
to you have to pay for each minute you
use this you use devices in the test
cloud so we don't want to do that for
all our future branches will wait with
that until to the master branch so the
way we do this and I'm sure that
multiple ways I just want to share how
we do it there's this nice little plugin
that we using it's got great
documentation and so you can go in there
and and read that and what it basically
you have to do is create a job a
synchronization job for you to app that
you want to do this on so this one I
will make sure that we are in sync with
the feature branches we have on beale
basin with the jobs that we have
available on Jenkins and you here we
just specify that this synchronization
jobs runs about I think it's one ery
hour or you can do it manually and this
is the set up of a of the job up there
hey you basically just include a great
script and these are key values a down
here all mentioned in the documentation
so you specify what branch it should
look for and the name of the template
pattern that it should look for in your
branches and then it's happening by
magic and and of course whenever we have
merged a branch into master and delete
the brand's it's going to delete the
jobs again so it doesn't get cluttered
on Jenkins as well
if you did notice a that was one of the
from the Jenkins depicted right before
there was one dot that was Green that's
because the only bother to run now huggy
app built so we're using hockey up for
distribution and we used to use a test
flight until I bought it and and put it
into the way they wanted to do it and
now we use a test flight class sorry hug
yep because it's more flexible in the
way that we want to do it and so we do
actually the image is just part of what
we can get from apps so we create a new
app in hockey app for you to feature
branch named the same as the future
brand so we know I install the go to
Copenhagen demo that's the name I'm
going to see on my home screen so I know
exactly what a version of the app that
I'm starting right now that's very
useful for our manual QA testing and
also for UX verification if they want to
see it on real devices that we have
messed up any pixels and the flows out
what they expect it to do so that's a
job on Jenkins that make sure that talk
to the hockey app API and create that
one and also we have hooked into to the
list as this the other plug-in that make
sure we're in sync with the with
branches and and jobs we have hooked in
and make sure whenever it's going to
delete a branch will also delete or when
it's going to delete the branch here and
the jobs we also delete the app in
hockey app so we don't leave old apps
that are no longer part of an branch
behind and so once we have all this
setup we can actually weaken our we can
build automatically and we can get it on
test devices and so we could actually
also just do the binary to upload but as
you might have noticed from your own
machine suggest because you can compile
and distribute it and run it doesn't
mean that the app is actually working
and which is what we want to ensure when
we do this a whole continuous delivery
so the next part is going to be about
how we do all our testing so before we
go into testing there are a few a
prerequisites you have to ensure hey I
would say at least and so required
either you have stable
test environments and the S is because
if you're lucky you have more than one
test environment we have nine dublicate
test moments of our DBA platform and
shared with the web team of course that
does their part and we have our own API
for the apps but they are nine different
a very cloned test environment so we
have one of them specified that that's
where we want to run our stable tests
and they are quite stable most of the
time and then you need good taste data
on on your test environment as well each
weekend we get a fresh copy of a
production data into the test
environment so we know that we have at
least some valid data and I'll get back
to that of course all tests have to be
self-contained as well we know you
create stuff we'll cover that but when
you do create stuff so the optional part
is you might want to have some hooks
into your test data where you can modify
things that doesn't happen in a normal
way for instance when we create a
listing on DBA put something for sale
it's going to be valid for four weeks
but we can wait four weeks and we want
to verify that whenever the listing
expires the app behaves correct so we do
have a hook only in our test environment
where we can force that event to heaven
that normally would happen in a bad job
so we can file that off as part of our
test and then we know that these things
should now be expired and we can verify
that in our UI test that that's actually
the case so optional butts did a very
good idea it of course it depends on
what kind of data you have and what you
want to test yeah so the different kind
of tests that we do have I'm not going
to cover much about unit tests just of
course that you know that we do have
unit tests and like all the platforms
that super fast and it's an easy way way
to test a specific behavior of a given
component but it's happening in
isolation we're using it for iOS we
using AC tests and some mock objects and
that's about it i'm not going to call
more into that part
then we do have integration tests and
that many different opinions about what
of integration test is we mainly use it
for actually testing our whole service
layer and from the app making sure that
we get the expected Jason back that we
can pass it into our models and that
they contain the data we expect it to
try to do so the small mobile team that
we end we are squeezed in between a wet
team doing a DBA and in other words i'm
doing bill basin so they are kind of own
the domain layer and then we also built
our own API on top of that that serves
the JSON back and even though we have
good test cards on the the web platforms
as well sometimes they do make changes
that break stuff that they didn't know
about until the app finds it so actually
these integration tests quite often or
not quite often that sounds horrible but
they do sometimes a stop potential box
from making it into production because
we can go to them and say hey you guys
you just broke the login feature
whatever it could be because this is
where we can actually pass the Jason
it's not this is much easier and faster
to do then from the UI test which is the
last part and so here we close to the
Jason pardon from the UI test it's a how
the user sees is this is where we cover
in turn scenarios a actually touching
the buttons and verifying the UI behave
the way it does should be and but it's a
lot of work to ensure every field is the
way you expect it to do from the UI
that's why we have the integration test
verifying that the JSON is passed
correct and then the risk goes up to the
UI and yeah so the UI test is well gonna
be the next slides will be about because
I find that to be the hardest part and
where people have the most questions
when we talk about test unit sales and
integration tests are close to the coat
and you right in the objective-c the way
you want and the UI test is where it can
be the more difficult to try to do it
and there are some pitfalls that you can
run into which I'll be coloring and some
of it might be if you're not familiar
with for example
cucumber it might be a bit steep
learning curve just to see it when I'm
gonna show you but then at least you
should know in back of your head him he
did say something about this could be a
problem if you start doing it so
hopefully you can easily follow along
hey so cucumber in calabash any of you
using it or familiar with these tools a
couple of hands okay so in short a
cucumber can be used to test a all kind
of things and then you can put in there
let's call it a driver that can actually
manipulate whatever if it swept you want
to test or if it's some other system and
calabasas what you can use to test the
iOS and Android so the way it works is
that calabash will for iOS install a
little server component in your app that
it can so I can talk to you your test
which would be written in cucumber and
so it's going to exchange a JSON over
HTTP so it's callobus you can tell to
swipe on a cell or scroll up and down
and press the button and all this that's
the work of calabash and cucumber is the
language that used to try to write your
tests and semoran who is behind the
calabash park has a lot of great
documentation if you want to know more
about all they need a greedy parts of it
but let's dive more into more readable
stuff witches and test scenario so this
is a cucumber written out very easy to
read and so the picture shows you from
within the DBA if I want to report a
listing that someone has set a low price
oh I have suspicions that it's a stolen
goods or whatever for any reason it
could be and the tests want to verify
that you as a user can only submit a
report like this once and the next time
you want to do it you should be told so
and you don't have to read all the lines
but if you already done that you should
see that it's fairly easy readable and
you actually you should be able to
understand what the system is supposed
to be doing at all times and calabash
ships with yeah so if we break it down
and this one is would be
cucumber has a feature files it's just a
file that contains multiple scenarios it
could be a login feature you want to
test and then you would have multiple
login scenarios testing it for bad input
and when it goes well and all this and
each line in the scenario is called a
step and calabash ships with a some
predefined steps which if you go this
way I would advise you not to use them
cuz they're very general it would say
then I see and then in quotation you
would put in an male announcer and it
will find a text that says and male
announcer and that will go well but the
whole idea with using cucumber is that
you can write it in your domain specific
language which we tend to do a lot also
as you will see this has to work
cross-platform we want it to work
cross-platform so we are trying to
specify a user behavior or user
intention and not how it's actually
implemented we probably do fail every
now and then so it would say touch a
button or something like that but it
should be closer to just intention and
not how it's actually implementing
because it could be differences between
Android and iOS and this scenario you
want to be able to run on both devices
so it to make it work cross-platform
these three boxes are what is common
from a you get from cucumber so it's got
the feature file i mentioned which
contains scenarios and each scenario
contain steps but then you should make
sure that you put in an extra layer
which is the page object pattern you
don't want your logic of touching and
querying stuff within your steps you
want to put them one step further down
the line which would be paste objects
and then you can make implementation of
your page objects for iOS and Android
wear which will see an example that way
you can reuse your scenarios and steps
across the platforms and only make the
page object specific to the platform I
just put in that so to load you see the
file structure right here of a
we stole all our features and all the
tests so there's an android and iOS
folder so whenever I want to run my
cucumber tests on Android I make sure to
use it that's our command on cucumber
telling it to now load the files that is
stored on the Android and running on iOS
it should load the one in the iOS folder
and then of course the page objects has
to be implemented in both cases and
swing for the same methods so this whole
feature folder that you see right here
is actually used all that in a kid stop
module so we can use it from within our
Android and iOS app sharing the same
code the same test code yeah so looking
more into the page objects this is a
step definition and what it does is
actually just invoking a page object so
this one is the iOS part of report
listing and so the page object is just
to encapsulate a whatever code is needed
to work on that report listing page so
here i want to send the report and the
transition method down to the bottom
isn't built in a calabash method that
will now tap the viewmarq and male
announcer which is the bottom you saw it
the at the bottom and then the page that
you now navigate to is that's something
we build ourselves this a previous page
I could have put in any other page
object and which is just a ruby class
that will now be in control so looking
at the step the at page a variable is
going to be in scope for all the steps
running in a scenario and this method is
returning the new page and so the next
step can say page do something and that
will be the next one in the flow someone
does have an example app called a
cross-platform example a which I
encourage you to download and have a
look at they have both how you do this
crowd platform part and also the whole
page object pattern is split out
but very very important that you don't
start you'll see I have another example
showing how bad we were putting a lot of
code and step definitions and you don't
want to go there hey you just want to
start out by doing page objects right
away hey yeah that example is actually
up right now because these are all the
learnings that we had along the way and
one of the major issues we had was
timing issues and so don't do it like
this first of all this is a step
containing logic and not put in a page
object but you could have done the same
lousy sleep code in page object and that
would still be bad and try to avoid that
sleep method at all costs instead
there's a lot of weight for help us wait
for something to appear wait for
something to not be visible anymore use
those instead it's going to make your
life a lot easier otherwise you'll find
yourself increasing those sleeves
whenever you build server gets a little
bit slower then you'll just a at one and
add one and your test suite is going to
run slower and slower and you still get
timing issues that you can reproduce in
your your own machine but only on the
bill so and yeah this is a real
experiences um it's not something I'm
making up we had those problems so the
same step is now a really simple now
it's just asking the page subject to
write the price and the right price is
now it's crawling nice and easy and
waiting for a certain cell is the price
I'll try to be visible then it's going
to touch the price so and use the
keyboard to enter the text and close the
keyboard again and all these same
methods mentioned down here they'll make
sure they wait for for example the
keyboard to appear and to disappear
again which is all the sleeves or on the
left slide that used to do that so
always favor wait for methods a prior to
instead of a sleeping sleeping is really
bad yeah and of course you wanted your
whole test suite to be stable so you can
actually trust it and and
wait for is a one good way to get there
but still you can see some flaky test
area now then which is actually not to
blame for another your abilities to
write the wait for or calabash actually
it's more obviously most often it's
going to be at the lower level UI
automation or the simulator on iOS after
it's running for I know quite some time
I think our whole test suite for the DBA
iPad app takes one hour and 30 or 45
minutes and it really sucks that it's
been running for that long and then you
see one little scenario fail and it
failed because the simulated just
creston you for no particular reason it
just lost the connection or something
and so cucumber come with this night
they have a coma is different for
matters how you want it to output stuff
and one of the four matters is a rerun
formatter and which is really nice
because then you can specify you want
that for matter and tell it to output it
to some file and that out that rerun txt
file will now contain information about
what scenario is failed in the first run
and then you can just ask cucumber to
run whatever isn't that a rerun txt file
and it will run those failed test again
and of course to make this work on
Jenkins you need to wrap something
around these lines it could be a rake
task or a shell script because you don't
want to report in the first part back to
the engines because then it didn't end
of think that it failed and forget about
the last one so you have to encapsulate
this in a in one a self-contained a
runner that will only report back to
Jenkins once the rerun has as completed
as well it's a little sad that it's
necessary to do this and that's why one
of the reasons I said that I hope since
Apple is getting more into doing their
own UI tests maybe they can improve
their the underlying part so we don't
have to do this and we do find it a
pretty good solution because we don't
want to hunt red pills that aren't
really read but just do some weird crash
so so rerun format I say
is the best of the worst i would say
west choices yeah so it the whole idea
wary of doing this is of course that we
want to be stable at all times but also
provided us as developers with rapid
feedback as soon as we broken something
we want to know and that used to work
quite good for us but then we were
pretty good at adding more and more
tests and all of a sudden it took quite
a long time to run all these tests and
then the fast feedback kind of
disappeared because then you would do
some stuff in the morning and then you
wouldn't you go to lunch and then after
lunch you might get a report back that
some test has failed so now we do have a
two different test Suites oh well
actually it's the same test suite but
you can use text in a cucumber so we do
select scenarios and needs a feature
then we want to run after each commit
and then only run the full test suite at
nighttime so we only run a subset of all
our scenarios say that will cover all
the basics of the of the app right after
each commit and the rest will run at
nighttime that's one way to improve the
speed of running your tests the other
one is improving your scenarios to be
faster at setting up and cheering down
whatever data they would need and for
that calabash has a little backdoor that
enables you to invoke the app without
going through the UI and that might
sound like it cheating and it is a bit
but it's not bad because of course you
only do this for four steps that you
have already called will in other
scenarios so I'll give you an example
and this scenario I want to see that I
can manage my listing son in the DBA app
and see whatever changes I make so this
used to be the first to highlighted
lines used it first of all do you log in
through the UI typing the long username
typing the long password submit it login
and then create a listing
a that you see it's in the past tense i
have created a listing but at first this
step has to go through the UI select the
classification right the price i want
and fill out all the required mandatory
fields for that flow and then that's
actually first after this step that the
real test started because i wanted to
verify that i could change those things
that i did so what we do here is
actually using that little backdoor
which is why we so we can in the Indies
code see that's why it says so using
quick login that's way for us to remind
ourselves that this login is not logging
in through the UI it's using the back
door and the differences were quite will
quite happy with the differences in time
so that the one on the left is using the
back door the other one was say without
the back door so now it actually took
longer to prepare the test data to run
let it dictate to actually do the test
itself and so it's a great speed
improvement and we use the back door
quite a lot in a lot of tests of course
again as I said only do it when you know
you have a full scenario is calling the
actually login and also for this party
where we create listings we have other
scenarios for that and this also comes
down to that the test whenever data is
required and has to be able to create
their own tests their own data so they
are self-contained they can't rely on
someone else has locked in previously
with the unique settler user and created
a listing because you never know if that
scenario will run before the other one
or not so that's be self-contained and
the back door can help improve the quite
recipe so now we have a lot of tests and
they want right they they run fast and
they run stable but they can still fail
and that's why we want to have visible
feedback so we do get notified in the
team that someone has screwed up and we
have to fix something so this is just a
little short showing a picture from we
have a big monitoring our team space
showing a
only the master bills that is very
important all right we used to show all
our feature builds up here as well but
since we do have a deal on the team that
it's okay for feature branches to be
read for some time since you actually
working on new features and they might
not be completely done yet then we would
see a red dots on the screen and you'll
start kind of ignoring them until you'll
notice that it said it was the
masterbuilt so to deal with that we just
removed all the feature branches from
showing on this build monitor only
showing the master and now we know that
if we look up there and we see something
is red someone has to take an action on
it and so all the other feature brands
is that we just report them into slack
so Jenkins has a nice little plugin we
can notify in slack and we have our own
little slack group where where we get
notified about bills also master bills
and this one shows our cloud bill
apparently failed here after 14 seconds
probably because it couldn't I don't
know 40 point 14 things that's quite
fast but here you can see ya so our DBA
a all tests and iPad takes about one
hour and 30 minutes to run the whole
test suite so on our Jenkins server we
only run on iOS at least that is we only
run on the latest simulator that is in
the tools that we're using right now we
haven't gone up to an Iowa SDK nine
years so it's right now a 8.4 that we
use which is all right but if you have
used the auto layout on on iOS you might
have noticed that could be some
differences between iOS 7 and 8 ok we
have noticed that at least so you want
to test on real devices as well and for
that we using a sam range test cloud
where we can just use all the scenarios
that we have or you can use the tech and
specify watching airs you want to run
out there and it and then we can select
it whatever devices we want to run this
these tests on so we use our own
analytics and find out what a
combination of OS and
where the most our users has and then we
select those devices in here and make
sure our test run on that we have also
in the test cloud split out so we run a
one test the only on iPhones and I want
only an iPad they could actually run in
one run together but we do prefer only
have images from from one platform that
makes it easy also for UX to go in here
and and have a quick glance if something
looks weird on iOS 7 or 8 on the same
platform it would be a little weird
having iPad and iPhone devices in
between so the cloud is really nice a
its kind of highlight whenever something
has failed and you can see what was the
last step and what screen sure what what
the screen look like at the time it
failed you can a click in on any device
and you can see memory and CPU usage for
each step so the lines here will equal
one step in my feature file and then I
can see if I suddenly I see a big
incline in a memory usage I can go back
to that specific step and say oh that's
when they go look at a big images maybe
that's why it started using more memory
and as you can see you got the device
lock and the test log so you can see
what what's going on hey yeah the cloud
has saved about a few times where as I
said about auto layout where we have
missed something that didn't work out on
iOS 7 so some element weren't shown and
and our chest would catch that for us
which is really nice so is this test
automation if you do that then you're
going to be heavy and that's about it
not completely they're great and you
should definitely do it their way faster
than any human can can do the same test
over and over again and they never
forgetting the details they're always do
it in the same order as you instructed
it to do which is also the downside they
only do what you tell it to do a so it's
a great way to avoid
old box and and miss a you don't want to
have those air regressions where an old
buck you can talk tribal about that old
box might reappear in later versions a
bug on the lock screen that happened in
iOS 7 is now back in iOS 9 i'm not sure
if it's the same bug what i thought was
kind of funny and you don't want that to
happen that's what the automation is
really good for and but it's not gonna
like it's not going to be the human
brain of thinking for themselves so
manual testing is still very important
but to have the continuous delivery
actually working you should do it a as
part of your whole story and not do huge
test run whenever you're completely done
with the feature so a manual test is
part of our definition of done for each
story which means that someone else on
the team has to verify it manually that
this part is working it could be our QA
QA expert that we do have on the team or
I could be another developer if he is
the QA guys piece of doing other stuff
and but the automated tests make sure
that you don't have to spend a lot of
time doing the same boring test or an
Oregon our QA can now spend a lot more
time doing exploratory testing and using
his weird thinking of how he can destroy
this nice app and finding box that we
haven't automated because it does
doesn't think for itself the automated
test and he can focus on areas with the
highest risk of course if he does find
something a very obvious that we can
automate then we'll go ahead and do that
to prevent a box from happening again
but you need them the manual tests as
well you can you can totally skip it and
then all this in combination you have to
have a lot of trust first of all you
have to trust that your entire team is
up for this and they want to keep
maintaining and writing these tests it's
not one person on the team who should do
this all the time it's a team effort to
do it and very importantly you have to
make sure that your QA actually trust
your whole test suite as well if he or
she doesn't trust it and want to do it
manually all the time or no again then
it's no good
yeah so they have to be convinced about
this nice automation as well and we do
trust our QA to find the tricky box that
we haven't automated yet which is why we
try to give him as much time to do that
as possible as a team effort also very
important is that whenever i'll build
monitor is showing something red we do
trust that something is bad and we
should go fix it we do not allow any
broken windows just to live on for a few
weeks and say it's probably going to fix
by itself we dive in and sometimes it
could be an error in our search indexing
on the test environment was not
completely right at the time well then
we will rerun the test it's not proven
yet that it's a bug in the app but we
have to investigate and follow up and
lately we have made that into that so we
have five developers so we have one day
a week each day where we make sure to
dive in if something is red so we try to
share the responsibility for that on the
team which is working quite well and
then we also sometimes take a good look
at our code courage and to make sure
that we covered the area say that we
want that we expect to cover and that we
haven't left out any big part and we can
also use this to inform our QA that we
do have certain areas that we haven't
been able to find a good easy way to
automate any tests so he should make
sure to do that manually just keep in
mind that code course doesn't
necessarily guarantee that it's a good
test it just guarantees that the code
has been touched by some execution but
if you forget to do any assertion in
your in your tests well then you might
let a lot of box go unnoticed so
CoCoRaHS doesn't like necessary can see
that you have a very good test they just
make sure that you have good coverage at
least touching up making sure it doesn't
really crash yeah so one of the benefits
after we had all this setup was that now
we can actually so the first slide was
about continuous delivery being
something that we could do a binary
whenever and hablo
whenever we want to and we want to take
advantage of that actually starting to
putting out more frequent releases but
for that to happen we had to convince
our product owner about the new agility
that we now have because they were used
to we should take about a week out of
the calendar to prepare a nap I do all
the testing and the bug fixes because we
found the Box in the last minute and
then fix it and now they know that we
can like from hour to hour say they
would say can we upload or then the next
sprint can we can we do it is show we
just press the button and get the the
file and and upload it and that was made
possible also they were afraid of first
that customers didn't want to get
annoyed by being told that's new update
but since apple also found out that it's
a good idea with automated apt updates
we do see a very fast adoption rate
whenever we put out a new release so
it's not really a big problem anymore to
do rapid releases and we do help out
product owner defining the scope saying
and that would be a good time and if we
want to release this then I know at
least I to box I would like to fix and
go out in the same release so we do help
each other and defining the best release
scope for you to retype release we also
did find that we had to prepare our appt
a little bit for it first of all we have
built in a kill switch because well a it
means that we do have a lot of old
versions running and at one point you
want to start closing the old ones to
force people up on the new ones it's
only like a percentage of something of
the users that are stuck at old versions
but we do have a switch so we can start
blogging them on each app start that hey
that's new app in the app store you
should go get it and so we can solve
close it and wanda married now and then
and eventually we can do a hot clothes
and it's just going to say you can't use
this version anymore you have to go and
update which is also a good emergency
brake in case we do send out an app that
would crash for some reason and that can
actually happen despite you doing
automated test or not so a kill switch
is is a good idea also welcome screens
you see that in a lot of apps you want
to tell you use us what's new in this
one because they don't really at least
that's what we see it they don't really
go into the app stories what's new that
you'll see
blue dot an iOS on the home screen
saying oh this app has been updated they
have no idea what they just got a cool
new features so you want to be able to
tell it within your app that something
great is up in this new app so you have
this whole setup and if you want to make
your appt upload even easier you could
look into Fastlane tools for iOS which
has a lot of easy ways to do screenshots
and and prepare your iTunes Connect and
there's still this whole part about its
being the app world so you actually go
on to pupil devices and and it's you
can't just deploy to a server but with
all this setup you should I kind of envy
my dog for looking really relaxed this
is the feeling you should have after you
upload and all your automated tests are
green just on your back really
comfortable no worries I'll just click
the button to release it in the app
store whenever it's ready if you don't
have that feeling then you have to go
back to the slide with the trust and see
if you have any trust issues in your
team and that could be related that
you're still a little worried it's going
to be okay or not and if you don't have
any trust issues then the last option is
to just remember to embrace failures
because they you don't get bak free
software no matter how hard you try the
still going to be box in there but the
best you can do is to learn and improve
from your box and building new test to
prevent any bug that you've seen a from
heaven again ever could have done that
with the lock screen so it wouldn't have
reappeared in iOS 9 and also instead of
when someone has created a buck and the
test is red or something instead of
blaming that available and running a kid
blame game or whatever turn it around
and say hey it happens because we all
just human beings we're coding just
celebrate that you have a cool set up
that will catch these things so you turn
it into a positive thing and say yes we
have cool test courage automatically it
just turned red because someone made a
mistake that's not the case let's
celebrate the test that found the buck
instead and remember to know your app
quality at all times it's so together
without bill status we do have
screen showing our so this is from
criticism if you see spikes happening
you should take action before you used
to start to report it to the customer
service we ever get those are bad f
store reviews take action immediately so
make sure that you knew no you are f
quality and when stuff like this spike
happens be happy that you within an hour
can run in a fixed block and click the
button and build a new file and upload
it and and get it out right away and if
that does happen I should know that this
was actually not part of an app release
I was a third party a component that did
this I just wanted to show that we could
take action a right away and of course
we didn't do that bug ourself I swear
yeah yeah I think that's a that's
actually it how am i doing on time yes
and remember to rate the the session now
from within the app and any questions
you know again how do you know I we have
this deal that our product owner define
prepares iTunes connects because they
know what they want to write and
actually it it's very rare that we do
change a fine sense the images we have
in the app store because that's why I
mentioned the welcome screen we want to
highlight what's new within the app
because most people coming back to the
same app don't really notice what's in
the app store a new customers of course
we'll we'll see it in there but we we
only have way are we only support Danish
in our app and but if we were to support
multiple language I'll definitely look
into the fast lane tool so if iOS which
can do a lot of help for actually
submitting to the app store if you want
to automate more into that part but our
automation stops at so Jenkins can build
there and sign the correct API file for
uploading we don't have to do anything
about that's just clicking a button
manually and it will be ready with the
binary to upload but the rest we we
still hadn't manually because it's it's
so easy to do for us with only one
language but faster in tool so it's
definitely something that I would look
into if I had more languages to support
and I was wondering hey nice to meet you
another six and
tracking on some sort informed
indicators for native apps as well if
you do that how do you how do they test
other what I didn't hear the first part
you you track like whose engagement and
things like this in your application and
like you know kinetics in your
application
you do you own a test as well I know we
don't have automated test for that it's
on our list that we want to hook in and
verify that we do the right tracking and
we do have a project coming up where we
have to improve our tracking using a
global based obey names for certain
things and I think in that respect we
might have to look into collecting the
tracking somewhere and then verify it
afterwards but we don't at the moment
but it's a great idea so if you have a
solution a lot to hear back anymore
Christmas right well thank you for
coming
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
