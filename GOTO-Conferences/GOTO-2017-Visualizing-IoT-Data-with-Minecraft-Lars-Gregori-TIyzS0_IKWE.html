ap high press it's part of s ap thin
three years high prices building
ecommerce platform a big one and there's
also some micro service platform and I'm
part of high priest labs and at
hyperlapse we are eight people s ap high
priests itself are more people so it's
clear as high priest labs we are
integrating the e-commerce platform with
new technologies so our idea is to put
it on micro service on Internet of
Things and everything and therefore I
had lying around a BeagleBone some time
ago and it just lie down on my desk and
there was some it was connected to the
Internet and thought okay that's a
little bit boring so connect one of
these one of the many GPIO pins with
temperature sensor and a light sensor
okay what's next so I'm working for s AP
you get in contact with the hang up
database and or just throw some data in
but that's not really the use case for
Hana to send every five seconds some
data so yeah but I played around with it
that was fine so sending data in getting
data out and I thought what's next so
and there are some also some some
examples where you can visualize the
graphics okay now I've done I control
the graphics it's totally interesting to
see when it's day and night on the
graphics but one one to two peaks was
really interesting this was during the
night so a security guy came by and
turned on the light you see the peak and
afterwards it turned off I thought okay
but this is not not so interesting I
mean you you have this on on Excel you
can show the graphics on excellent
everything and to finish this I had to
change also the title and name
all the graphics and thought this is
boring at this time I also played around
with the Raspberry Pi at home with my
little daughter she was digging around
building a house and putting in a bed
with some library and everything and I
realized okay you can also connect to
the Raspberry Pi and set some blocks and
get a position of the player and
everything and with this idea I came up
to visualize the data in which I
collected every day in Minecraft so I
went to the office and played around
with it so colleagues came by and asked
me always are you playing minecraft all
day answered no no no it's really
serious work I'm doing a visualization
of IOT data and I brought it on a big
monitor and people could see okay yes
the temperature it was nice summertime
so in the morning and or during the
night of temperature stayed constantly
in the morning someone opened the window
it falls down and then it getting up
during the day so everyone could see it
and could see it on minecraft so and
that's the reason I'm here and yeah you
also know so the agenda for today it's
how to visualize data in Minecraft
therefore as I told I or it's possible
on the Raspberry Pi and it's also
possible on a PC with modding then I
wish allies real-time data some sensor
data I fear now do we know but I will
get into it more and the question is
what about not real-time data what about
a dashboard of historical data so I will
also visualize this okay visualizing
data so first of all what's minecraft
I'm who of you hand knows why I played
played with Minecraft who not makes a
little bit easier okay so I can give a
little intro in it it was starting the
development was started 2009
Marko's person also called not East yeah
had this idea did it at home and yeah
and start with Minecraft which is built
on blocks used years later 2011 the
first version came out and 2014 he wrote
tweet he want to sell the company and
Microsoft bought it for 2.4 billion and
yeah not took the money and first thing
he did was to buy a house in Beverly
Hills so a real house not a Minecraft
house that's yeah I will show lit but
minecraft what what's the idea behind it
but first of all I will ization on on
the Raspberry Pi the Raspberry Pi itself
is based on Pocket version of Minecraft
so there's a PC version which is based
on Java and also the pocket version for
iOS and Android which is implemented in
C C++ and runs on the mobile phone and
there's also some minecraft version for
consoles like the Wii U Xbox and all
sort of new Nintendo switch on the
Raspberry Pi you have it opens up it
hasn't server on the on the Raspberry Pi
where you can connect with the socket
connection so when my little daughter
was playing around with it I just open
up a telnet session get connected to the
port on the Raspberry Pi and then you
can send a command like get player
position so I told her oh yeah I could
you move on this place I won't need to
coordinate for it and then she moved
away and during this I just said some
blocks and then I said oh here could you
go back and oh yeah the blocks have been
said so
with set blocks you have the XY sent
coordinate and also just the type of
block and there are different types like
dirt glass air stone everything like
this and with this idea I I thought okay
it's a little bit not so easy to do it
always internet and tipped on the
command so there I looked around and as
yet for every programming language
there's some library available for it
the programming language only needs some
internet connection to handle this on
map the minecraft yeah server get the
connection and then set block get blocks
that blocks can play a position and
everything
what's also possible is to get an event
for it so if someone right clicks with
this world on block then you get an
event for this we also set up in the
office a shop so we've got five blocks
for example and put this in our micro
service platform in a shopping cart so
was also another reason people stopped
asking me are you playing minecraft all
day yeah so this was the first version I
played around with and worked fine and
other version I showed today is modding
minecraft on a PC so minecraft is
available on on Mac on Windows and Linux
and it's written in Java on Java program
and you have a server part of it where
you connect your client so it's possible
to have an server and lots of people can
connect to this and you can play it as a
multiplayer for this right and there are
two different main modding frameworks
available it's minecraft forge it's more
for the client-side so this is possible
to change also the texture of the blocks
to make it more yellow Mourinho's
something and but therefore you need to
install the plug-in on your client site
or minecraft what I'm using is a spigot
which is based on the bucket API and
this is more on the server side so you
implement all your plugins on the server
side and shows it in the client first
yeah the changes for this I show some
code later on we got what was it oh yeah
our problem is minecraft the company
don't like it would - that the plugins
itself
distributed the char file which is
available so the minecraft itself
distributes as as a child file it's all
versions are available and so the
blackens itself takes this jar file
opens it up and put some hooks inside of
the code and this is the possibility to
plug in yet to plug in a plug-in in this
case okay real-time data um before came
here I thought okay I'm coming to
Amsterdam and what kind of data should I
show so I'm talking about Sakura
politics are not so good idea I came up
with the idea maybe some music some gaba
music and area RPM data and thought okay
gaba is something from rotterdam I will
not make friends here in Amsterdam maybe
so I came up with the windmill and
therefore I used the windmill farm
there's outside you know Northey there's
a big windmill farm and I collect the
data or since March every day the load
rate so this will be the idea for this
talk to use windmill data for the
visualization ok let's switch to
minecraft
this should be fine right so we'll give
a short introduction tour to Minecraft
itself with the single-player mode so
you can here create a new world give it
a name like Oh - oops
Oh monkeys sometimes yeah then I have
the possibility with a survival mode
therefore after yes a wife this means I
need some food and there are some
zombies running around which could kill
me so I have to protect myself with the
house and everything
I will leave this and there's also some
more options like a seat number one two
three four five and I have the
possibilities also to say I want some
cheat codes so I could change the game
mode then I create a world and opened up
so it ran us in a background at the
whole game with the random data in this
case it uses the seat code and I should
land right in some forest so here the
idea is there should be some ships
around these are also resources to
survive and if you dig on the tree it
takes some time and I can now craft this
wood into some planks and take this
planks and without of these planks
I can build up creative table which
allows me to build more stuff for
example so I need more wood notice all
all in all in time so I'm still it's
fine no one has to interrupt me just in
case I'm getting too
start playing around so with this I can
use two of them and get some steaks and
with the sticks just take this one and I
can craft an axe and with this X it
should be faster now just put like this
X and there are some what and now it's
faster okay I can also change into the
creative game mode in this case no
monster zombie skeleton creeper yeah
right a creeper I kill me and I can fly
around so in a creative mode it's more
like I also have all all yeah items
available and there's the idea to build
up your big cities or something big
scenes people getting together and build
nice cities houses shapes everything
which is possible for sure they don't
one of this yeah so this is the normal
single player mode I can play it alone
at home no one disturbs me only my wife
sometimes and then it's fine with the
multiplayer mode you connect to and
server so and that's the way also F
plucking so the modding framework works
so this is yeah it's plug-in there's
already some plugins available I put
here in the directory you don't need to
see it doesn't matter and I just run the
code in this case a servable start a
minecraft server where I can connect to
and this loads the plugins into it now I
can connect to this port and here we are
so yeah it's just the normal world but
there are some something hidden behind
the mountains the Maya dear here is
first of all to show real-time data and
therefore even Arduino
it's like little microcontroller and has
connected what's connected and like a
dimmer for a light and a light sensor is
here a button this one and this one is
the temperature sensor so the idea is to
visualize some light data
it makes complicated hold it here let's
see where's the Sun Sun is here now work
when I turn on the dimmer I can oops so
this is zero the value and doing the day
the light the Sun goes up and when I
turn around we will have a nice sunset
there's a Sun rose oh yeah
now we have a sunset you can also turn
it totally dark then we have someone
here but I like the sunset
oh hello okay a little bit light so this
was first demo and the code for is it's
fully and everyone read this yes in the
bank yes cool so this is the code for it
the Arduino is connected Y USB cable
directly with my computer so this is not
really internet of things data I need
internet for this but with the internet
it's sometimes a little bit difficult
and I think it doesn't matter and makes
a big difference if I would put this in
my office the problem would be that at
this time no one will really a deal
maybe but um how to change data so I
thought I will bring the data by myself
without internet so this one is all we
know which connects to the yeah to the
USB cable and here I get a pin so it pin
analog pin 0 this is this one I can read
the value when it changed this for
example to one which is the light sensor
oh wait wait
if to run it in debug mode
zero-one so now we get the sunset and
when I you can see when I move it around
now the light sensor comes up I start
the other way around
okay I have some some additional value
on it yeah but you can see it depending
on on the dark or not so dark and how
fast I flick around yeah one gets up and
down I change it back racy so here I
read the value it's an analog value or
yeah I set up the pin on this pin I read
the value with this gate value and then
I just put a factor on it so in the
Minecraft the day is 24 hours in this
case in real time it's 10 minutes they
10 minutes night and 24,000 here is the
tix for it and 1024 it's the value
arranged I get for the analog value so
when I move the body to the other side
at the dimmer to the other side when
it's 0 then I get to 0 as a value and
otherwise 1024 or 24,000 in this case so
then I use this light value of and with
the factor and at 20,000 to 22,000 to it
because the day starts at 1,000 so I
don't really get night and they really
connected so I change I add some value
here and at this point I take all the
worlds and set the time for its oil
there's one world running at the moment
and I said to the time value which is
calculated by the light value and
therefore I can
on the light and turn it off so day and
night this is one thing the next thing
would be the temperature value so this
is connected with analog 3 used
temperature value on it
same same thing I get the pin it's an
analog pin I get the value so simple
data and you for I do you do some
calculation with the minimum value so
depending on the room temperature here
which I don't know when I'm sitting at
home and start to program this I just
take the actual value as a minimum value
and when I put a finger on it and I
don't have cold finger at the moment
it's also good
umm value should go up and therefore I'm
using a bull kernel so let's go back oh
it's still night here make some de-icer
okay hello
we run it yeah maybe we compile it I
don't know something like this ok demo
it's connected up to server maybe no so
we start it
okay logging in
mm-hmm
should be fine something is wrong crazy
I think in a background okay
oh no nice the next demo okay weather
clear so it changing yeah so that's
that's also the nice thing about
minecraft you can change the weather but
still dark outside that's not so good
why oh I need you some arrows oh
the other out
sorry
support fine oh man yeah doesn't matter
with active game
maybe maybe I just try something time
said here we are now we have to figure
out if the work on I was working so I
dig some holes say
like it is not working it okay
I'm to panic maybe I have a typo I knew
I should oh I'm falling and all it's
also good idea okay
now help us doesn't matter
I have it here um wait wait here in the
plug-in and so this should work
no it's working yeah there's something
changed though
okay now I've enough warm hands of maybe
I should go away working come on
something happened what's going on with
my code okay we can debug oh maybe I
stopped the debugging thing hmm
so yeah live demos I like live demos
normally when they work
put some breakpoint here
I know here and I don't get the value
it's always happened okay I restarted
once again no time it should be
again
or inside of it you know
and now correct answer
oh yeah now it's working great so
depending on the temperature it will
Cano will display this as s yeah the
higher the temperature bigger the lava
which comes out and now it's flowing
down so um here this is the code for it
it's yeah just to show it on the lava
higher level so i get the value divided
by four otherwise it will be too big get
a position of the block which i'm
setting with the volcano command the XY
set position and depending on the high
value i just fill it up with lava this
case you can see the material is lava
also the height and the rest of the yep
up of the height value i use the height
max value which will fill up with air so
when it cools down should be filled up
with air right
and now lavas flowing down right so this
was one demo now i'm going down and the
snow it's also controller i can also
control snow on this way or rain
depending on landscape where i'm so when
i on it mountain with no and press this
button starts snow on the ground it
would start to rain and you want to
visualize some value which is high for
example so if you have this for example
as in control monitor and there's some
problem around i think you will look
more into it when there's some snow
flying around yeah instead of rain rain
is live boring and annoying sometimes so
right so yeah let's go to amsterdam
you can also be teleported this simple
thing get the user I take the user
position and just give it another
position so this one maybe I should turn
on some light that makes it a little bit
easier
oh yeah I'm fine okay
so yes someone in this case give credit
to deep-sea 777 he buildeth up amsterdam
and this is where the anna frank house
is its 8th Prince Prince Prince Prince
okay and yeah you start to build
Amsterdam here an interesting part on
this side is still some desert and here
like some jungle also yeah that'd be
looks a little bit different but here I
want to show for example also the
possibility where the how here the doors
open I open the door and have some coat
you're lying around which I commanded oh
this is this one I tried on because uses
some more power now unlike it I'm
running on debug mode know if other
doesn't start okay
ah no it's coming here nice okay here we
are here we are this one it's Oh II bug
it like okay so in this case I can also
show some torches depending on the light
value
so higher light value more torches
that's also possible instead of torture
I could also use I don't know maybe
close stone or something like that
so yes torch
close stone we load it back and yeah
and so closed on also nice because now
it's dark outside otherwise you wouldn't
see something right I have to turn it
off
again and let's of this side so the next
thing would be yeah to visualize a not
real-time data control data so for
example a historical data I collected or
the wind farm here every day the load
rate and want to visualize this one and
also my idea was visualize some some
Jenkins build status nice to have I do
sorry
so now I'm going here outside and I've
already prepared the room for it so I
have to walk here and can say okay
Jenkins set up as a command and it
changes the floor the reason for this I
fire here on the floor if it would be
wood it burns and the roof is also what
so everything would burn here I have to
change it to sandstone and as you can
see here are some Jenkins instances
which I have here already prepared I
just refresh them so the first one this
one can run but it's always getting the
wrong number so instead of 42 it's
getting one bank this one didn't run
ever and this one always fails this one
takes 51 seconds it's the reason it's
project 51 but it's fine
this one is yellow and this one is
always blue when I for example start the
42 and go back it should blink here so
you can see it's running we go so I also
put value of the champions API so
if you're not familiar with Jenkins
there's an API REST API available where
you can get Jason Jason back and this
shows the status of of the Incans which
is running at the moment so in this case
42 is running I also have good F the
possibility to hit on the block and now
this one should start to build maybe I
have to oh yeah no it's starting right
so when i refresh this page 51 is
building and 42 stopped and it's still
red so you can see it and a good thing
when I start to destroy it it rebuilds
itself so now at the floor II you have
to set up the floor again yeah so it is
also possible to have something support
some kind of dashboard in in Minecraft
for example Jenkins it would be with
windmill maybe also some some status
information if it's fine if it's running
if it eats a maintenance or something
like that so that's the idea here
yes I think that's it for here some
questions here I I can run this one now
I just waited to today I will never run
just take a look don't run blue
everything is fine so yeah and also when
I change the name so I want to teleport
on the roof of this so we are here now
and enjoying the few outside and need
some light again as to why it was the
right oh now it's raining again
you also have some thunderstorms it
doesn't make sense
weather clear everything fine okay um
now want to visualize a graph of all the
data I collected so that's the load rate
off of the wind farm I got this idea I
found an email address I wrote him an
email but never get back some answer
then I thought okay maybe they don't
have some power at this time and no
email access or something like that and
then figure out to find it some some
page from the internet I have the link
at the end of the day of the
presentation and every morning at 8:15
yeah 8:15 for reason I set up Chrome
drop and groan drop runs on 8:15 I get
to the handle off of the internet
connection everything load the data and
yeah collect it and put some JSON data
out of it and so this code here reads
the chase and data and visualize it and
to make it more like random or not not
like one simple data I also put some
random values here so it looks like this
this wind for this windmill is having
better load at the moment as this one so
they are 2036 windmills this is the row
down and this way it's every day for
some reasons there was in the beginning
of March and April no data I don't know
if there is some maintenance or
something like that and yeah you can
look at this data you can see where the
load average is load rate is and
everything so here we have higher you
we have no data and to get more
information about it so can hit on it
and of a March no load rate and walk
here this one got thirteen five thirty
nine point five percent and this one
should be higher 78 at beginning of May
and winning beginning of June sixty nine
percent so this is also one way to
visualize this boring data when you have
the yeah graphs and run around you can
walk on it
and and if you like you can also destroy
some data with some TNT for example
which doesn't make sense but it's fun oh
let's destroy my TNT okay running away
so maybe you can also use this as yeah
read now the data out of Minecraft and
produce some new data for I don't know
machine learning is also something
really important how much time do I have
okay looks good looks good because now I
want to go to the beach as I told in the
beginning so now this looks more like
Amsterdam here in the mountains in the
back here some lava running around here
nice so it can go here and say okay well
I create a farm and now I have the same
data
I already collected as a wind farm
so how every yeah visualize also the
same data and then I realized it doesn't
make sense to show it here because you
couldn't compare it so I went back to
the
fall down and just wait farm here the
middle of Amsterdam in this case now
what's also possible oh and you design
for this up here sign and connect it in
from sign okay always the wrong color so
now you can see it yeah beginning of
April there was no data and now the data
are coming back so we are now at this
point here and at this point it should
be blue take a look when it's blue
I'm just low winds flow again
15:14 can you see it here's the date for
example and I also collected from the
open weather map on whether the speed
and decree of the wind speed also at the
same time so this was something around
the beginning ok doesn't matter I think
you get it so we are now somewhere here
at this area yes so that's it with
Minecraft nearly finished so this was a
bit the picture on the beginning of the
presentation and imagine this people
here are not playing they're controlling
maybe a wind farm so sitting around
looking what's happening what
temperature for example it's also
possible to to read the value of a wind
windmill if it's getting too warm is the
motorist has
some problems or something like that you
could visualize this and yeah it's also
Minecraft on the hololens available so
you put up your your augmented reality
augmented reality or your classes and
then you could build up your own island
with with some data you want to
visualize walk around and interact with
this so I also showed with Jenkins which
started rankings for example or maybe
set up a ticket for a maintenance or
something like that well this was my
entire view yeah that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
