is about component programming in the D
programming language okay everyone in
who's a professional software programmer
talks about reusable software it's an
axiom it's taken for granted we all buy
into it we all try to write reusable
software okay who around here tries to
make their software reusable everybody
who tries not to make their software
reasonable okay so there are a few so
you guys can leave now yeah okay well
there's kind of an ugly reality to
writing reusable software I've been
programming for 35 years and I
discovered something terrible about my
code as I never reuse it almost never
reuse it
I believe in reusable software but I'm
always writing it over again copypasta
doesn't work doesn't count
okay copying it and tweaking it around
that that's not reusable software so how
many of you have had that experience you
look back over your code and it just
ain't reusable despite your best efforts
okay something has gone horribly
horribly wrong okay it's not for lack of
trying every time I make something I try
to make it reusable because you know I'm
a believer it's not because I'm a better
programmer than I used to be so I hate
what I wrote before and I want to
rewrite it it's just for some reason
it's not working and I need to look
deeper for what the heck is going wrong
with my software why is it not reusable
okay so I look at it and you know some
things about my code trouble me
my abstractions are leaky they always
seem that there's no hard boundaries on
the edges and it it always seems to flow
out into the surrounding code and the
stench of the surrounding code times to
flow into my abstraction and the end
result is I can reuse it
sometimes my components they're too
specific they work for a particular type
but not for any other type and so when I
want to reuse them it's all built wrong
it's for the wrong types so at some
point I think I need to go back to first
principles you know when things aren't
working and you can't figure out why
sometimes it's time back up and start
over again okay let's start with what's
a component anybody want to say what a
component is anybody brave if you google
component software you find an enormous
amount of literature on the topic
certainly not anything I can go over in
a brief presentation like this so let's
talk a little bit about what I think of
as a component there's lots and lots of
reusable code out there I mean C
libraries Java libraries C++ libraries
and they are reusable and they work but
I wouldn't really call them components
okay I would argue that a component
follows a certain predefined interface
that conforms to and it must be built so
that components can be replaced one
component can be pulled out another
component can be pulled in the only way
that'll work is if the interfaces are
adhered to the trouble with most
libraries especially like C libraries
C++ libraries as each library lives in
its
world they invent their own API they
invent their own interfaces they're on
types for example with C++ for years and
years and years until the STL caught on
everybody made their own string type who
knows what I'm talking about it's you
know the first thing people did with C++
was they made their own string type and
their library depended on their own
string type which means none of the
libraries would interoperate with each
other without some complicated
scaffolding to translate one string type
to the next term string type this is not
component software
so what is a typical or basic program do
I would argue that it reads input it
processes input then it writes the
output does anybody disagree with that
remember most of your programs like that
they read their input they do some
processing they write their output so
even if your program is an interactive
program like a GUI app that doesn't
really follow that model but it'll have
subsystems in it that do that take a
bunch of data process it produce a
result sort of batch processing let's
write it in some pseudocode we have the
source of the data goes to an algorithm
goes to a sink of data and we want to be
able to compose our components so source
apply one algorithm take its output feed
it into the next algorithm and the
result we call our sink that's where it
goes okay wherever we seen this before
of course answers obvious it's the UNIX
files and the filters command-line
interface who's all familiar with that
files and filters just about everybody
in an incredibly successful model of
snap-together software I think it's the
reason why UNIX has persisted for so
long it's found its way into the C
ecosystem or the C view of things as the
file interface files are the sources and
the sinks the algorithms take the role
of being the filters pipes connect them
and it's so pervasive and so successful
that people even
invent pseudo filesystems in order to
work with that software and here's a
link to an example of pseudo file
systems for Linux so there's things that
never hit a file but yet they have a
file interface to them well it's not
perfect it doesn't really get us there
for one reason it evolved it was kind of
discovered and evolved over time and as
proof of it having evolved check out the
AYGO control interface which is when
something didn't work right quite right
with them people would dump it into some
Cluj in i/o control and I can Oh control
as infamous for being a gigantic Cluj
it's just kind of a grab bag okay
another problem with the file interface
is your data is viewed as a stream of
bytes you can't go forward in it well
you can go forward as you read it but
you can't go backwards you don't have
random access to it and it's a stream of
bytes it's not a stream of structured
data or any other forms of data but you
know and that a stream is not always the
best the best source of input for an
algorithm for an example an algorithm
may need an array and a stream is not an
array but it shows what a component
interface can be and what a component
interface can deliver for you for
example with the files and filters the
idea in Linux is you have the series of
things like grep and sort and top and
then they all work as filters and
anybody who writes those filters doesn't
talk to anybody else who writes filters
but they all conform to the interface
so they can all be
snap together and plugged in together in
any order separated with the vertical
bars or the pipe suit symbol so let's go
back and look at sort of a canonical
example of what typical code I write
looks like it its input comes in here
we're reading a pattern out of the
arguments while we're not at the end of
the file we read a line if it matches
our pattern we write a line okay who
writes code like this loops loops loops
loops loops it's this I'll code it's
deeply embedded in my brain when I think
of writing code I always think in terms
of loops like that and Jude doesn't look
really much at all like source going to
algorithm going to sink in fact it looks
like sort of slowly come to the
realization that it looks like this it
looks like a maelstrom or a swirl your
data comes in at the top and it starts
going round and round and round and
round and round and eventually it sort
of goes out the center or in the middle
so how do you encapsulate this stuff do
you draw a square there and say well I'm
going to encapsulate that part of the
you know that doesn't work if I draw the
square like this well I'm in capture I'm
capturing my data sink in there and if I
want another algorithm to plug into
there somehow I've got to inserted it in
the middle of this this whirlpool and I
really kind of think this is why my
codes not reusable it's really hard to
reuse loops because they just don't you
can't cut pieces out of the loop what I
wanted to look like is the sum
line this is a world war two assembly
line for a bomber aircraft and what
happens is the parts start at one end
and the assembly is moved along the line
and at each station something happens to
it something happens to it something
happens to it and then at the end of the
assembly line a completed airplane rolls
off the end and this is extremely
effective for manufacturing why can it
work for software you know they don't
send them around in a circle
I would like my code to look like this
my arguments come in I get my string
pattern out and I go from standard in I
want to read it by lines I want to do
some matches and I want to write to
standard out notice no loops
has anybody seen code like this before
yes where siege are you functional
programming awk all right what I can't
understand you shell okay
okay so we've given up on the C design
which is successful but limited and
let's look at what the next design look
like and that was C++ ooh
object-oriented programming C++ was
originally designed as C with classes
and it was to enable object-oriented
programming but for some reason it never
resulted in better component programming
in fact they came up with eventually
with i/o streams it started looking a
little bit like source algorithm the
sync and it did this by overloading the
angle bracket operator but for some
incomprehensible reason it never went
beyond reading and writing files and
just kind of sat there it was just kind
of a replacement for C's way of reading
and writing files it didn't really go
beyond that and of course there are lots
of successful C++ libraries but they
exhibited the usual problems like I
mentioned before of they didn't connect
with each other
everyone invented their own string class
everyone invented their own memory
allocation scheme and none of them would
really connect to each other and then
came along Alexander Stepanov who
invented the STL and with that he
single-handedly revived C++ you know put
the pedals on and revolutionize it with
the standard tempered light standard
template library which at last we have
more than just files we have algorithms
we have a common interface and best of
all it compiled a highly efficient code
so this was a huge advance for us native
programming language guys not quite
there either
we still seem to be programming with
loops loops loops loops loops remember
we wanted we have we have some
components now but we're still writing
loops eventually you know some of the
loops got turned into STD callin for
each and transform but it turns out
they're not real composable because
iterators are a generalization of a
pointer okay the problem with a and you
increment a pointer to get to the next
piece of data the problem with that is
where's the end of your data you don't
know you need another piece of
information and tell you when to stop
iterating so what that interferes with
has any kind of come any kind of
composition of iterators and algorithms
we can't compose them because there's
this extra piece of data that's got to
fit in there somewhere that tells us
where the beginning of our iteration is
and where the end of it is how do we
know when we're done so let's go back to
the drawing board again we need a new
design what are examples of sources
well of course streams which are is an
old file interface another source of
data would be containers container could
be an array it could be a hash table it
could be a database it could be a bag it
could be a set all kinds of you know the
classic data structures are all sources
of data algorithms of course from
functional programming there's a filter
map and reduce and then there's sort
which is an interesting one I'll get
into later sinks
again sinks can write to files they can
write to other containers or they can
produce a single value as the output
like a checksum could be a sink because
it accepts all its data and at the end
it produces a single value a checksum so
here's a list of some typical sources
algorithms and sinks you can't get all
of these from the streaming interface
because the algorithms sinks sinks
they're more than just files so the idea
is I should be able to select the source
from column one algorithm from column
two a sink from column three and it
should work not only that I should be
able to select any number of these
algorithms stick them one after the
other and it should work so this is
where we want to get at with our
component programming so have any of you
successfully done this in Java and C++
and C I haven't seen it okay so let's
sum up the requirements of the for the
design that we were looking for we want
them to snap together we don't want to
have to have scaffolding connecting all
our little bits and pieces or components
together we want strong encapsulation
support so our abstractions aren't
leaking or bleeding out and there are
the surrounding code and the surrounding
code is leading into our abstraction we
want to generate industrial quality
efficient code if we don't generate
industrial qualif industrial quality
code then the user is not going to use
the components they're going to go back
to using loops and you failed so we're
trying not to create a toy system or a
something that only works in
tutorials and we want it to work well we
want a natural syntax that flows from
left to right which is the way we read
in the way we think about things we
naturally think not in loops but in a
serial manner left to right we go this
step this step this step like an
assembly line and we want our code to
actually look like the way we think
about it and the last thing is we want
it to work with types that we don't know
about in advance because nobody wants to
rewrite theirs right a sort for
characters and write another sort for
integers and another sort for your
employee data type I should work
generically so we should have called
them sinks our sources but we wound up
calling them input ranges the D source
component is called an input range and
what we're thinking of what is a
simplest possible interface we can have
first we need to know is there data
available is there any more data so
empty returns a boolean tells you
there's more data reads the current
input datum is called front which sort
of means the front of the data that's
coming in E is our data type and we want
to advance to the next data which we
call pop front doesn't return any value
so these two are properties this is a
method and it's hard to imagine it being
any simpler than that yes
so the question is why not have pop
front return bool and sort of combine
two operations in one we had a huge
argument about that and we finally
decided it was best because it turns out
that some input ranges are hard to get
them to combine those two in the one it
turns out that it's more flexible if we
separate the operations into three
separate things and if we tried to
combine them okay so the gentleman there
said you know trying to determine if
you've got more data in there should not
change the state well yes you can do it
those other ways but we decided to do it
this way we I've been in these arguments
before we could spend all day arguing
about the merits of but I don't think
you really buy anything by trying to
combine these things because it really
is three separate operations you want to
do and so you might as well just make
them three separate operations all right
so the question is do you want a window
on your data which contains maybe some
predictable amount of data at the same
time that's something I think I can
address in a future slide so I think
it's excellent question okay here's an
important thing an input range is not a
tight it's a from the C++ land it's a
concept concepts actually work in D and
they're actually fairly simple all the
type has to do is have these three
primitives so we're not deriving from
some interface type it's is sort of if
he's got these three primitives it's an
input range and it's recognized as an
input range okay here's a simple of
course it is a bit of a code
but it reads characters from standard
and by character and we can start with
front which returns the current
character pop front sets a flag saying I
read my character and I need to read
more and then bool or empty checks to
see if well if we've got a buffer or
character already in the buffer if we
don't we get one if we can't get one
because we were we hittin a file we
empty returns true it no more otherwise
we have our little one character buffer
we set the flag saying we've got data in
the buffer and return false meaning
we've got more data so this is one of
the simplest input input ranges
so we're gonna reach from standard in
and write to standard out and what would
that look like well where we construct
an instance of that which is and here's
our range our and our loop condition is
you know if we're not empty and our loop
continuation is we get the next one and
here we're reading the front and writing
it out to standard out so this is our
first step to building our component
programming and of course we're not
there yet
with a little compiler magic the for
loop becomes a for each loop and the
compiler knows about front empty and pop
front and can build a loop for you if
you use 4-h and so we're getting the
characters out one by one and are
writing them to standard out and an
interesting thing is look monotypes it
statically typed but we don't actually
have to say what the types are the
compiler or the language figures out the
types for you so that's streaming thing
and remember I said before that
streaming was not adequate the file the
straightforward streaming file interface
is not good enough for components so we
introduced a more advanced input range
called a forward range and what it does
is adds a property one more method makes
it a forward range actually one more
property not method and that's safe and
what that does is it saves a it returns
a new range which is a copy of the
position of the previous range so now
our original and our copy can traverse
the range independently of each other
and the canonical example is a list a
singly linked list it's saving just
means you know and
a pointer to the to the next node in the
list and an algorithm like a merge sort
would use a forward range bi-directional
range a range that we can if we start at
each end we can go like this with it
okay we can move toward the center and
it adds two properties analogous to
front and pop front you get back and pop
back which do the obvious things and the
canonical example of the bi-directional
range is the doubly linked list you
can't access the middle of a doubly
linked list directly but you can start
at each end and work your way towards
the middle and doubly linked lists are
not the only example of such utf-8 and
utf-16 are by de rich bi-directional and
codings
a more interesting one also is the
random access range random access range
what this does is overloads the brackets
operator so you can index it and once
you index it you need a couple more
things to make indexing work you need to
know the length of your random access
range so that you're not going to go off
the end of the range or you need a
forward range that is infinite and how
does it know what that arrange is
infinite empty always returns false for
an infinite range so who can give an
example of an infinite range and injures
are an infinite range that's right
that's the probably the simplest example
but you know something like the digits
of pi would be an infinite range
although it's difficult to index that it
is an infinite range
okay sinks sinks are really simple they
all I do is I have a put method where
you can stick something in that's it
pretty easy huh okay so let's write
ourselves an output range remember all
we need is that darn put thing so here's
our range which we've encapsulated as a
struck called STD out by care and put
writes our character or def put C and if
we hit the end of the file we throw an
exception saying there's some something
went wrong with STD out all pretty
straightforward so recall our earlier
loop example and now we replace it with
an output range and it just becomes
here's our we declare our output range
and here we just insert characters into
it and already it's improved over our
previous example because notice that we
don't do any error checking here how
many tool write C code without error
checking come on everybody write C code
writes it without error check how many
people know that printf returns an error
code saying if it succeeded or failed
how many people check that error code
nobody yeah nobody checks the error
codes in the C you can and you can tell
this by if you fill your disk up almost
to the top and then write execute some
you know Canonical's C code that writes
to standard out and let it run and see
what happens does an error out it just
silently fails but anyhow by
encapsulating it we've actually we're
always going to detect that hair you
don't have to make it or ugly ugly Phi
your code was checks for it it just
checks for the errors for you
so what this does is of course it copies
it standard and the standard out and we
could call it copy our first algorithm
so our algorithm is copy and it takes
ours input range and our output range
and it copies it so I think we're making
good progress we've got our first
algorithm and our two ranges the problem
is is it's nailed down to those specific
types so if we want to have use
different types in there we're back to
copypasta we've got to copy this and
then edit the types up to change them so
we're still not there yet
so this is how you write templates in D
we call our source range a source or
generic type source generic type sync
and we parameterize based on those types
and there's our algorithm but now we've
got the opposite problem our first
iteration was too specific on what it
types at once our next iteration is too
general it takes any types in there you
could pass it an int okay what's gonna
happen if you pass an int type as your
source any brave souls tell me okay any
C++ template programmers here what
happens if you've passed the wrong type
to a template you get a horrible error
message because what happens is it dies
sometime somewhere deep down in your
implementation of the algorithm and you
wind up with an error message that
appears to have absolutely nothing to do
with what you're doing worse it may
actually compile and appear to work but
yet not work
so what we want to do is add constraints
constraints are these idea of
implementing a concept so here are to
our two template type parameters and we
can this is called ace constraint and we
go if this is an input range and the
sync is an output range and it has an
element type that matches the element
type of our input range then the
template will be instantiated and we
will accept it so this is kind of what
makes input ranges and output ranges
concepts indeed rather than inheritance
so we're not saying we're inheriting
from a particular type what we're doing
is we're testing to see if the type has
certain properties and that's what these
library types do and how they work is
actually a whole nother presentation but
that's not relevant here at the point is
they do work so the reason we have the
sync here the C++ STL sync returns the
input range as its argument but it's not
composable because you still need the
end of your data this by actually
returning the input range makes it
composable because now we can copy one
in the next so a current status and step
by step we're trying to meet our
requirements as we've declared our
source range our sync range and we do
copy and we're not there yet we're
getting close it's starting to look like
what we want we want to add uniform
function call syntax what that is is
nothing more than you take the first
argument and you stick it out in front
of it that's exactly how member
functions work there's a hidden
parameter which is the first parameter
called the dis pointer or self reference
or something like that
and you can usually stick it on the
front well this idea UFC has generalizes
it so it works for other functions too
you can pull the first parameter out and
stick it on the front it's purely
syntactic sugar and what it enables you
to do is write it like this we have
source copy sink
so that's although it's not using the
arrows at least it's going left to right
that's what we want it to look like okay
let's go into some a little more about
algorithms as opposed to oh boy I think
we're running low on time so I will
speed up okay filters everyone knows
what filters are from functional
programming filters read their input and
make a selection based on a lambda and
the ones that pass the selection go
through so here we have an array we
select the ones less than three and
print them out which is one and two maps
maps transform its input from one to the
next so one two three four five we
squared them with a times a and this
little program prints this reducers
produce a single value in this case we
want to sum them all up so a plus B the
result of one plus two plus three plus
four plus five is fifteen so let's put
these bad boys together and see what it
looks like what we want to do is this
little program reads from standard in we
want to keep our line terminators in
there so we want to read our standard in
by line and then we want to map it we
want to because reading from standard in
uses a buffer and keeps reusing its
buffer we need to make copies of the
data because byline is going to reroute
use this buffer so this man
just makes a copy of it and its output
is fed into array which turns it into an
array it assembles all those lines into
an array of them then we sort them using
quicksort and then we take the result
and we copy it to standard out using
locking text writer what locking text
writer does is because writing a
standard out can be done by any thread
you have to lock standard out while you
write to it otherwise you get the output
from all your threads all interleaved
and erratic ways so that's what this
does language features of D that are
needed to make this all work
need exception handling for errors not
error codes I don't even really know how
this would work how this would look with
error codes because certainly it would I
think it would turn out to be rather
ugly you need generic functions you need
template constraints to implement the
concept idea we need uniform function
calls syntax in order to make it look
you have that left to right locally
desire I already talked about them being
concepts not types the language needs to
support inlining customization and
optimization and all this is necessary
in order to have high performance
results specialization you can write
specialized versions of your algorithms
and the compiler will pick one that
matches your data types so if you have
specialized sorts for various different
kinds of data this will work with that
type deduction if you notice no types
appear anywhere in there the compiler
deduces the types in this case it pretty
much deduces them all because it knows
that standard and returns characters so
that influences everything else
following on as dealing with characters
coming in and tuples although I didn't
have an example of it
algorithms and filters and stuff can
actually moulton do multiple things at
the same time on a single pass over the
data and then return a result as a tuple
so it's nice to have tuples in the
language to do it
okay conclusion components are a way to
make code reusable trying to get them to
work it's a combination of conventions
and language support for them lots of
advanced features of D come together to
get components to work I don't know of
another language with this combination
of features so if you do have want to
make components work in there I don't
think is going to work as well and it
builds on the success of previous
component models which are files and
filters streams and the standard
template library so there are two other
component models in wide use one is the
functional programming idea and the
functional programming language is
typically how do they connect the
sources algorithm the sinks who's got
ideas sir using lists that's right they
connect what they do is they have it
everything is represented as a list and
so that's how everything connects up as
a list and the problem comes in when you
have algorithms that don't really
perform very well on a list like a
quicksort so a better component design
is one that enables the component
builder to write a data structure that
more appropriately matches his data than
just trying to force fit everything into
being a list the other component model
in wide use uses virtual functions
you know like comm programming and
things like that
and that has two serious drawbacks one
is every iteration through it you're
calling virtual functions which on
modern architectures is slow now it's
possible with a sufficiently smart
optimizer you can fold out all those
virtual functions or D virtualized and
inline them but not many languages are
sufficiently smart to do that and the
other difficulty with them is you tend
to not have control over your data
layout and if you're writing
high-performance code and today's
processors which need to optimize for
memory cache lines and things like that
you really want to closely control how
your data is laid out and the interface
designs the older ones generally
preclude you from doing that so
questions yes sir oh I see what is the
output of the filter then the output of
the filter is another input range ah
that is an excellent question the
excellent question is you know this is a
range coming out do you get any output
out of the filter until it's read all
the input or do you get it element by
element okay and I would characterize
that is it lazy or is it eager and the
answer is it's either you can do it
either way so one of the neat things
about component programming and B is I
can replace an eager algorithm with a
lazy one and vice versa all without just
changing the name of the component I
plug in there so in fact I've often done
that my first iteration of a component
actually usually is eager because it's
easier to write an eager one and later
on if I find I'm using it a lot I'll
improve it by making it a lazy one and
an interesting thing about lazy ones is
lazy ones open up the possibility of
doing things in parallel so although
that hasn't
done yet with this stuff the opportunity
is there to actually paralyze things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
