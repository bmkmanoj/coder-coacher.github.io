be with Martin order ski of course the a
very famous fatherís gala and which is
a an impressive journey from research
into a language which is taking off I
think in your slides today show
something over a hundred thousand you
know projected users always difficult to
tell itself inside it's doing a lot of
you know serious commercial users like
Twitter and so on
well no guild group and so on so Martin
gave a great talk on the simple parts of
Scala and I think for you know one of
the criticisms that people have sort of
said is that J it's really kind of a
melting pot language in some senses it's
got some Java some Haskell some yeah oh
oh and so on and and I think today you
you cleared that up but maybe for you
know our audience and to have yet to see
your talk but we'll hopefully see it
live or on video you can sort of maybe
summarize that the key features that you
think are important for people to learn
when they're really adopting Scala okay
so SCADA is a language that spans a wide
spectrum not only because it's both
function and object oriented but also
because it can grow into new languages
it's a very good substrate to build new
domain-specific languages on and that
can make for a very confusing Tower of
Babel that people built all sorts of
languages escolar libraries and those
are all undeniably useful and their
specific application domain but
sometimes it can get very overwhelming
so what I try to do in the talk is
actually take a step back and says well
let let's leave all the domain-specific
languages and advanced libraries aside
if it's just Scala what's the core of
Scala what are we really talking about
and the word I came up with is a very
old characterization that it's really a
modular language modular means it's
built from simple
parts that can be combined in
interesting ways and I was trying to
identify those simple parts that help
people essentially composed programs
decompose programs and abstract over
programs what we had there were seven
features one was that everything is an
expression everything can be nested data
can be constructed and deconstructed in
tools so that's case classes and param
matching functions are values but you
can also fall back to the state machine
behavior of recursion immutable
collections are a backbone for what we
do and a the right amount and the two
typica very modest amount of mutable
state that he makes and the whole thing
and that for me is sort of the trait of
successful Scala programming and that's
what I was talking about today I was
very effectively communicated it's great
to have you now some of the big users of
scallop come from that Haskell community
and there's a big third dialect of
scallop and you say a DSL Scala's edge
which has a sort of strong opinion about
me of really wanting them on Attock
approach and higher order types and so
on if they've they've argued that you
know the mod add implementation with
trampolining and so on it can be quite
inefficient but I think will you show
today it's really it's a lot of cases
where you don't really need to take them
on a tack approach for a lot of things
yeah so some oh no it's like right just
to put put put that right we use them
all the time because monads are options
and lists and futures and everything all
these things are monads and there's
under the surface but they are they are
library abstraction people people use as
a matter of fact without even seeing
them as much right that's just things
that have this burn addict nature and be
used essentially that all the time and
for expressions in Scala very convenient
syntactic sugar over any computations
over arbitrary Mona so all this is great
but Haskell is a different language from
Scala in the sense that it is a lazy
functional language and it is a pure
functional language and those two things
go too big to go together because it
turns out that once you're lazy you
really can't be cavalier about having
effects anymore because you don't know
when they will happen so you need to be
pure I I talked to Simon participating
Jones a lot and one thing you said is
you can be bent about where the laziness
is the right thing or not in fact that's
the thing that I guess most most
language communities have stayed away
from laziness but it says laziness the
big thing in Haskell was it kept us pure
so that is one very clear and rigid
model of function programming which is
not shared by Scala
so Scala is more in the ML tradition
that you have a strict functional
language and you do have side effects
but you can express essentially a pure
functional language by encapsulating all
effects in monads
and that's what Scalzi does and I think
it's a possibility to do that but it's
not really for me the natural way to go
it's got a program for me the natural
way to deal with effects still waits to
be invented I'm actually quite hopeful
that we will find something in the next
five years say that will be practical
and for that reason I would say
definitely function programming is about
managing effects about minimizing
effects but we do not necessarily at the
present point have to capture the human
them in a type system this it might be
implicit pretty implicit by
understanding that in your program you
want to minimize effects as those
function programming is that's my
current viewpoint on it and I know that
not everyone shares it we all have our
perspective that's right - and should in
terms of the implementation you know the
there's been some work at the JVM level
but I think it's it's clearly being
applauded we were talking to both the
John Doe image from IBM and George Saab
from Oracle whoever they don't there's
still a bit short for what functional
programming could
use in terms of you know I mean you have
you have to did you do a lot of work to
get tail recursion for example and yeah
so JDK 8 with lambdas is great for us
because it will give us more a more
lightweight implementation of closures
to all functional languages so there's a
big step forward I'm also very glad
about the default methods and interfaces
because these will be give us a much
more direct implementation of a lot of
the things we do in trains so all these
things are definitely good but yeah of
course in a functional language you
would like to have always more
particular native time incursions would
be nice
multiple values would be nice so that it
could multiple returns quite nice and I
actually are here that that is planned
for Java 10 so in fact it's I would say
overall it's a great platform to be on
because it definitely moves in the right
direction even though sometimes the
movement is slower than you would like
it to be but that's life is there any
activity in Scala for the cor no it
wasn't some sort of starts but there was
some and we have there's no recent
activity on the CLR part of the reason
is that they are very good and
established competitors on the CLR the C
sharp is a more functional language and
Java is and then there's a charge of
course which is a direct port of an ml
like language and ordinate so since both
are supported by Microsoft it's sort of
an uphill struggle to say we want to
establish a third language that somehow
fits between C sharp and F sharp I think
there there are easier targets for us as
we concentrate on them it's good well
thank you very much Martin for talking
to us and if you don't get to hear
Martin live you do want to try and check
out the slides are online and his video
will be online in the coming months so
you know make sure you find out about
Scala the simple parts thank you thanks
great to see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
