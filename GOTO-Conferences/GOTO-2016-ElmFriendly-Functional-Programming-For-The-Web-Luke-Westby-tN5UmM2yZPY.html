I'm Luke I came over here from Chicago
to tell you about my favorite
programming language Elm so Elm is
friendly functional programming for the
web that's the name of this it's the
name of this session and you can see
that on the Elm homepage Elm - Lang org
it kind of builds itself as a delightful
language for building reliable web apps
so it's it's functional but it's it's
kind of like that's not really the
important part the important part is
that you can you can use Elm to build
really really nice experiences oh really
that's way better all right all right
for real this time
yeah so you can use Elm to build really
nice user experiences so kind of as the
web was developing we had this
progression of Technology where people
were coming up with ways so that you
could build cool stuff and now we're in
a place where we kind of understand how
to build cool stuff and the idea is how
do we build technologies that make
people really good at building cool
stuff and so Elm is a really nice
solution to that problem it's a really
thoughtful solution to to making people
really capable of building really nice
things even as beginners so today I kind
of wanna understand how many of y'all
just by a show of hands have used Elm
before in any capacity oh wow that's a
pretty good amount okay and so how many
people maybe haven't used alum but you
know you've heard of what it is and
you're interested in it okay that's a
lot more so the idea that I want to the
ideas that I want to kind of go through
today all right so to get folks who are
interested kind of from being interested
to having actually seen somebody build a
little thing with elm and understanding
what the experience is like and so I'm
going to do that just by by writing some
so I have a terminal here I'm gonna
steal a a technique from Jose Jose that
I saw yesterday all right and then I
think this is pretty big so let's see
the first thing you have to do when you
when you set up any sort of technology
just like install it and get your
project set up so I have most of y'all
worked with a tool like web pack or or
gulp or you know a whole long list of
those things yeah
would anybody say that it's like a super
easy experience to set up a front-end
build chain so sitting up Elm goes like
this and maybe you'll you'll find it a
lot nicer so one of the things you can
do is click get started on the home page
and you'll see here there are installers
for Mac or Windows and I think the most
convenient way to do it is if you've
already got NPM you can NPM install -
JEE elm and I'm not going to run this
because we are at a conference and I
don't trust the Wi-Fi so once you've
done that it will end up with a few
things in your terminal so we've got L
make which is the compiler LM is a
compiled static language we have elm
package which is the package manager LM
repple which is the repple and elm
reactor which is a reactive debugging
environment elm is all about really
descriptive names for things instead of
kind of fancy marketing names so if you
want to install a package without me use
Elm package it's just kind of how things
go if you want to do HTTP use Elm HTTP
so we're going to set up a project what
you need to do to set up a known project
is run LM package install enter package
manager is going to ask you if it's ok
if we install a couple
libraries so we have core and we have
HTML which depends on virtual Dom so
core is the all the core libraries you
know list different data structures math
functions all the things like that that
you would just have to have around in
order to be productive with an elm an
elm program and then HTML is how we're
going to take our stuff and show it to
the user so we'll get to that towards
the end well tell the package manager
that it's ok to install these things so
now we've got a bunch of dependencies I
really wish that we're bigger ok it's
not letting me zoom in I'll just LS
that's cool so we've got this album
package that JSON which tells us a few
things about our project we got a
version and just some information if we
were going to be building a third party
package and then we'll tell elm where to
find our project files it's pretty
conventional to put it in in source so
we'll make a source directory and then
this is really important these
dependency specifications so Elms
package manager has strict semantic
versioning requirements and the way it's
able to do this is since elm is
statically typed the compiler can run
while the package manager is working
figure out ok you published
you know version 4 of elm Lang slash
core and you've made a change you've
changed the type of some function you've
changed the type of add to not no longer
accept floats but now accept integers
which would break everybody's code and
so when you go to publish this and you
try to say well you know integers and
floats are still numbers so maybe it's
just like a behind-the-scenes kind of
thing and you you bump the the patch
version you say it's now 4.0.1
the compiler is going to go in it's
going to figure out actually this is a
breaking change and so you're not
allowed to publish this unless you
change the semantics version major
version to 5 so nobody is allowed to
publish breaking changes under non major
versions it keeps everything really nice
for the people who use packages so
you've you've set up an elm project and
you don't have any fear that updating
your
tendencies is going to cause type
discrepancies it doesn't protect you
from from bugs but it does protect you
from mistakes in in types and things
like that so we add just to quickly
recap we've run out package install
we've changed this to point a source and
we've created that directory and the
last thing we'll need to do is create an
index.html so we've got source
index.html and then our Elam things and
then my cheat sheet of topics so I'll
just fill this in
so we'll point this at some some built
file let's call it Thane and then we can
go ahead and create no file so in like
three steps we've set up everything that
we need to to run a basic element and
that's pretty cool so let's actually
write some own that's why we're here
so when Soros we've got this may not Elm
file means a pretty a pretty standard
name for for an entry point home file
and all m-files need to have a module so
this files named mean so we have to call
it mean if we had a module called source
slash whatever slash thing we'd have to
call that whatever dot thing module
names have to map onto the directory
that they're in with the correct file
name so if this is may not Elm the
module name has to be main and then it
helps us keep our our module names kind
of unique and avoid name clashes and
we'll say what it exposes so it's gonna
just be everything right now dot dot
means everything
so Elm is really lovely it's really easy
to learn when you dig into it because
there are really few concepts that you
need to understand so there are there's
some data there's numbers integers
floats there's strings boolean's all the
primitive types and then there are data
structures and combinations of those
types all data has a type so we need to
say what our data is and what its shape
is and then we create relationships with
with data using functions so it's just
data and functions that's all we need to
really understand to understand Elm and
then sometimes data has a special
meaning to the to the UM runtime and it
tells it to do things like render or or
do HTTP requests but it's still all just
data so you don't you're not actually
ever causing an HTTP request to happen
you're only ever describing what your
request should look like and then at all
it'll happen later kind of out of your
control and this has some really nice
effects it allows us to think only in
terms of what the state of the world is
in terms of data in terms of a model and
it allows us to describe all the changes
in our system using only functions only
stateless functions so there aren't
little islands of state kind of all over
the place interacting with each other
and being overwritten we've only ever
got one state and we're only ever
allowed to do immutable updates to that
state with a function
so let's let's take a look here so let's
let's start with like some value and
we'll say some value is an int and some
value is equal to 42 and I can compile
this with el meek I just say I'll make
that's not source slash mean not elm
it'll tell it to output to build slash
mean j/s and it compiles successfully
the generated code for alum is is
interesting-looking it's a it's quite
large it's a lot of code goes on for a
while the the idea is that elm has no
runtime errors it doesn't have a concept
of runtime errors and I'm going to be
going progressively over what are some
of the features of the language that
make that possible
so you don't really ever need to like
stick a a breakpoint on any line of this
of this interesting-looking code a nice
property of this code however is that
since everything is kind of at the top
level and just concatenated with dollar
signs it's very amenable to minute
minification so you can end up with a
really small you know 40 kilobyte after
gzip file for a really complicated
application all right so we've got some
value I will write a function add so add
is going to take an int and an int and
it's going to produce a new int and we
define the body of the function like so
so we have left as the first argument we
write as the second and we're only going
to do two arguments so we'll say equals
and then left + right so for folks
coming from like a JavaScript or Java
background primarily this is like a
weird way to look at a function because
there's no parentheses and there's no
comma and there's like a weird random
arrow in between these two ends here
it might make sense if it looked more
like this but we do it like this because
you know all of your functions kind of
progressively apply apply arguments so I
don't have to just
all add with two numbers I don't have to
call it like this necessarily I could
say that I want you know a premade
function add ten and I want that to just
take an in tune add 10 to it
produce another int and I can defy to
add 10 in terms of add I just pass it
one so when you're reading function
signatures you know you kind of go from
left to right and you say well add takes
an int okay and then after this arrow we
have two more things so after it takes
an int it's giving me a function back
that's going to take another end which
will then give me my final result and
this is true of all functions in Elm so
if I want to say our results is an int
will produce the result and say we're
going to add some value to itself
ah-ha I misspelled it cool so now now
we're all good we can compile this or we
can run it in the repple I could say
import to mean exposing everything you
can look at some value just 42 and I can
look at the result which is 84 excellent
so what's that let's like talk about a
scenario so after this talk which is
super good y'all have been convinced
that you're going to use elm and you've
gone off and you've built like a massive
project with it at your super successful
startups and now you've got lots of
teams and we're gonna say that you know
feature Team B is over here they're
responsible for the implementation of
add and results and feature team a is up
here and they're responsible for some
value so the project manager the product
manager for future team a comes via and
they say well listen it's really
important to our customers that that's
some value B implement
as a string instead of an inch for some
reason so we can go in and we can make
that change now this is problematic of
course if this was not this was not Elam
we might we might be able to do this we
might be able to take some value pass it
into to add and end up with something
super weird like this stream for two for
two or maybe there's like weird casting
going on somewhere in any case the user
is currently expecting to see 84 as the
value of results as we as we see over
here and they're not going to get that
if this runs but we're lucky because
we're using Elam and when I try to
compile this the compiler has has some
words for us it's going to sell us the
first argument to the function add is
causing a type mismatch it's wrong as
expecting the first arguments be an int
but actually it's a string I don't know
if you all have used compiled languages
before but this is the most amazing
compiler message that I've ever seen in
my whole life it's exactly where the
problem is and what we did wrong and so
we've we've made a mistake we're on two
totally separate teams there's a lot of
code in this code base but before we've
even before we've run in CI before we
run any tests before we've gotten to
production before users have started
submitting tickets before we've done
anything before we've even seen any code
run we already know that there's a
problem with our program and so we can
go back to the the product manager and
say we can't really do this we'll have
to come up with a different way we're
going to be late on this deadline maybe
and so we'll just change it back to an
int and when we build it everything is
okay now if you're like me you kind of
get frustrated with process sometimes
and maybe you just like want to get it
done and see how it goes
so if it were me I'd be sneaky I try and
like take these types off I'm just going
to take away the types and I'm going to
try and put one past the compiler
it's virtually the same message so I
took away all the type annotations and
we're still being told add one some
numbers and you're giving it a string so
this is this is really cool
albums type system is it's thorough it's
it's a hindley-milner type system for
for folks who are interested in in the
computer science of it meaning it knows
what the type of AD is supposed to be
because it knows what the type of the
plus operator is the plus operator
itself is just a function find like this
rather it's a number it's kind of a
generic so the compiler already knows
what plus is defined as and we've
defined add entirely in terms of plus so
it knows what add is supposed to be and
it knows what some value is because it's
defined as a literal so the compiler is
able to keep us in check even if we
don't feel like filling in those type
annotations all the time so we've saved
ourselves a lot of debugging so so far
we've we've covered like basic basic
data you know 42 is maybe interesting
but it's not interesting enough so what
we're going to do is model some real
data so like I said in Elm we have
primitive types we also have ways of
combining them into data structures so
the way that we do structured data in
almost with records so if I want to kind
of define myself let's say my name is
Luke I have a name which is a string and
I have an age which is an int and if I
want to fill this in this is a record
type so we've got name fields with
particular types just in curly braces
and colons for for each field and if I
want to create an instance of this if I
want to create a value with this type
I'll first fix the indentation
come on here we go
so my name is Luke I have an age and
then maybe I want to like model my
fiancee - so death also has a name and
she also has an age
okay and then let's let's write a
function on this because LM is all about
data and functions so we'll get like um
you know person info
it'll take a person with a name string
and an age which is an int and it'll
produce some string message okay we'll
say a person named little penny string
is the string look at the string version
of their age and it'll say years old
period so now we have a function on
these data types now if we jump back in
to the repple let's see we can call we
can first import mean again and then if
we call person info let me I'll tell you
how what my name is and how old I am
call it on Beth you'll get the same
information so this is pretty cool
that's keeping us in check if I happen
to misspell a parameter here I try and
evaluate this again it's going to tell
us this is a really cool error message
and actually I want to run it with the
compiler because it's better with color
check this out it's awesome so it's
saying the type annotation for person
info is wrong or it's it's disagreeing
with with what you've given it it's
saying you pass in some record with a
name field but what you actually tried
to pass in when you called it was
something with name without an e at the
end it's so smart it's done 11:15
distance comparison between what you
gave it and what it actually got and
actually figured out hey actually you
might have just misspelled this thing
and that's totally the case so if I fix
this
everything goes back to normal so we
might be seeing that error message a lot
because I'm bad at spelling but it's
totally just like a demo of the awesome
compiler messages it's totally on
purpose okay sure
it'll be less direct so if I just like
naturally key word a little bit so it's
not going to tell you that it wants
something with name but you actually
gave it something else but it's not
going to do that distance comparison it
doesn't really know that's what you
meant but it's still it's still pretty
close still telling you what you missed
and what you had okay so pretty good so
far so we've we've kind of eliminated
type errors we've kind of eliminated a
sort of method missing errors these are
things that you're not going to have to
deal with if you build a project with
elm especially spelling mistakes which
is probably like the single most common
source of undefined is not a function in
JavaScript so you can prepared it to
like virtually never see that again if
you use home so this this will this code
is not perfect though it's um
it's prone to kind of refactoring
problems it's Pro it's got a lot of
duplication so if I wanted to say well
actually my age is afloat because I'm 25
and a half it's uh it'll still compile
okay because we have an actually called
person info but if I open the repple and
I try and call person info with myself
we're gonna have a problem because it
wants an int it's actually a float but
things still work with with Beth so
we've got a refactoring issue I've got a
code duplication issue unless let's get
around this by allowing us to assign you
know qualified name
to our to our complicated types so I can
just do this you see type person type
alias rather person doesn't mean just
ring age which is a float I can replace
this
and now when I call it everything's fine
and I can go back and I can refactor
this to be an int and I get helpful
minting errors and I get helpful
compiler errors again tell me to go
through and fix my data before I even
bother to deal with my function so it's
saying that you've declared us as a
person this unified sort of source of
information about the the shape of these
things but you assigned it to be a float
so you need to go and fix that so when I
do that
everything's fine again
excellent let me see where we are okay
so let's now do something a little bit
more complicated it's a best seller
Chicago so she's gonna leave us for now
let's um let's make this let's make this
data model maybe a little bit more
specific to two conferences let's say so
the people here they have names we're
not interested in people's ages at
conferences but maybe we are interested
in like their their role at the
conference kind of what we're doing here
what's written on our badge that I
forgot in my room that's gonna hold it
up so let's say like role at conf
make this string instead of this we'll
say well at cough is speak here but
maybe we also have like attendee or crew
things like that and so I'm a speaker so
I will do this for person info will say
is a and then will do to what's already
a string so we can do person dot role at
kampf it will say at go to C pH okay
save this okay so I'm gonna speaker it
go to C pH I'm pretty good but like I
said I'm not very good at spelling so
it's more likely if I was doing a
production application that I would do
something like this I'll leave off the R
or something and so when this gets
called eventually in our our nice UI
users are going to be pretty upset with
us because you know this is a really
nice conference and even though I did
the best I could
I totally embarrassed everybody by
spelling the word speaker wrong the
problem is this is totally valid code
this is completely valid elm we've said
that role at conf is a string and it is
like it's totally a valid string I've
done nothing wrong as far as the
compiler is concerned I'm just bad at
English
so what I need to do is make sure that I
don't have the opportunity to make this
mistake so we're totally sure that there
are three options for our role at
Coffield we said there was going to be
speaker and attendee and crew so Elm
let's just deal with this by defining
our own data types with custom values so
I can just sign this totally new type I
just say type role I say it's either a
speaker see what I mean by the spelling
um speaker or attendee or crew so now if
I want to do this I can just assign this
value this is now a first class thing
it's just a regular value just like any
other I can pass it wherever I want if I
want to do person info I'm going to need
to pattern match so I'll do case person
dot roll it keV of two the first option
is speaker they can say there's not name
just speaking we can get a little bit
more specific that go to CPH get rid of
this other stuff so also we can be an
attendee that name is attending go to UC
pH we could say crew person dot name is
a member of the go two's H crew and it's
upset at me because I haven't changed
this so in addition to using the value
down here we also have to declare it in
the type say this is now a role as
opposed to a string person info looks
good so if I say person info of Luke now
that's as I'm speaking
but if I change my role to be a 10 so
after this I'll just be an attendee I
can change that they'll be attending and
this is not the case but if I change
this to Cru it would print out the crew
message and if I misspell it now and I
try to compile it it's going to do that
same kind of helpful information it's
going to say I don't know what this is
but I found something pretty close so
maybe this is what you meant so again
we've we've totally cut out like weird
edge cases and spelling mistakes even
for things where you might have a string
in other languages to denote innumerable
options so we're just we're slowly
breaking down opportunities for for ways
for your program to crash so I change
this back everything will compile just
fine okay another nice thing about using
these kind of types is that if you're
like me you're impatient you want to get
like straight to the the cool visual
part of building that UI so maybe I only
want to deal with speakers right now
that's the kind of like piece of the UI
that I want to build so I'm just gonna
fill in the speaker part and then maybe
I'll come back to it later if I remember
and fill in the rest but I try to
compile this the compiler is going to
have something to say about that it's
gonna say that you did this case
statement your pattern matching on role
at conf but you're missing two values so
there's totally an opportunity here for
if this code were to theoretically
execute for you to pass something in and
not have code that deals with it so you
might return an undefined but we don't
do undefined an elm so before I even let
you run this code you're going to have
to finish writing the function so that
be a place where you can know or
undefined reference error sneaks in and
we just we can't have that so there's
there's a there's another way to deal
with null in elm
it's called maybe maybe is to find like
this so type maybe a so ace type
parameter meaning that maybe it's like a
container for a thing a is any type so
you can have a maybe int maybe string
maybe person maybe he's either just the
thing or it's nothing
this is incredibly elegant so this is
the same kind of custom type as up here
there's nothing special in the language
that defines maybe it's just kind of
around defined exactly like this and it
has all kind of amazing properties what
it forces you to do is deal with
emptiness before you deal with value so
where as null is kind of interleaved
with the idea of existence so you can
have some variable in Java or JavaScript
and it can it can be it can be a you
know a person or it can be null and
there's nothing about the name of the
variable or any properties of that
variable that tells you which one that's
going to be in elm since emptiness is
represented outside of value you have to
deal with it first
so just like we pattern matched on role
it can't we have to pattern match one
maybe in order to get at the value
inside so let's say there's a you know
we're going to represent the the person
on the stage so sometimes there's a
person up here and sometimes they're not
there's not that's a case where we there
would maybe be somebody up here so we'll
have a person on stage and that's a
maybe person
and so if we if we don't have anybody up
here we'll just say nothing is on the
stage not to refer to people as things
that's a little bit weird but if
somebody's up here so I'm up here right
now
we could say just Luke and so now if we
want to do a person info we can refactor
this code a little bit to accept a maybe
person will rename this to be more clear
now we pattern match on maybe person
it's a case maybe person of just person
then we'll deal with their info
otherwise nothing we could say no one is
up on the stage
fanni face great they will call this
person on the stage info if you look in
the repple we can do import we can do a
person on stage info a person on stage
so I'm up here right now tells you about
me otherwise if this is empty it'll tell
us that no one's on the stage and will
be really sad and so just like before
when I left off parts of this pattern
matching statement part of this case
statement if we want to be lazy like I
do always and leave off this part and
just get like straight to building the
cool flashy UI for the case where
somebody's there the compilers not going
to let us
it's a little bit for those but it gets
to the same kind of point it's saying Oh
part of me we don't need this because
it's built in okay so it's saying um
your case here on maybe person you cover
the jest but you also need to cover
nothing otherwise we're going to be in
the same kind of situation we have with
null and nulls not allowed in elm
because programs aren't allowed to crash
a gnome so you need to deal with it
we're also not going to compile your
code so we go back to nothing I'll just
undo for a while there we go and so now
we're all set again great
I got about 15 minutes left I think
awesome so we've we've been doing raffle
stuff we've been doing kind of data
stuff we've been looking at Elm syntax
and exploring how it keeps us safe from
from runtime errors but we've didn't
even actually like built a web app and
this is like the front ends track so we
should probably do that so we've got a
whole bunch of cool data stuff up top
now we want to actually get into
building an app with Elm we again needs
to start thinking about data in
functions and how they relate different
data together Elam has a few things
built in a few things that you can use
to create this paradigm that takes
advantage of that property of elm and of
those special types that I mentioned
before the special data types that tell
the Elm runtime wants to do and create
an architecture around it this is called
in the community it's called the Elm
architecture because again we have very
straightforward names so it's an
architecture about Elam that's the Elm
architecture it uses Elm HTML for HTML
things and it kind of works in this
paradigm of mV
you the people of MV things so it's
model model is like the the cohesive
unified representation of what's
happening in our program as a datatype
update which is the U and M vu is how
that thing is allowed to change over
time given different things that happen
in your app and you have complete
control over what that's going to be and
then the view is just a function of the
model that converts it to virtual Dom
that the runtime will then render just
like react kind of does or different
there's there's quite a few things that
use virtual Dom now so in order to get
started with this I first need to import
HTML so we've got HTML and then I'm
going to import HTML add I suppose a few
things from HTML so I'm going to say
like when you divs I mean we're going to
h1 and h2
we'll need text that's probably good for
now maybe we'll have like a horizontal
rule and then HTML 2 app is just going
to help us start our program so we will
do to start with a main the main is a
magical sort of function in element says
this is the stuff that we want you to
take from this module and display to the
user
you also have an HTML type so we'll say
HTML of a because HTML can can cause
things to happen and those things need
to have a type as well and we'll look at
that in a second so we'll say that main
is going to be a div all these things
appear these are functions so like I
keep mentioning everything in alamos a
function or data so for view stuff it's
all just functions and data again so we
have this div function the first thing
is going to be a list of attributes so
I'm going to give this a class I'd say
like class hello and class is also a
function that returns a datatype for
attributes we don't want to put any on
here so
give and they'll put it in each one and
in there we'll put some text looks
awesome demo and then underneath that
we'll have another div and then here
we'll put an h2 text person on the stage
info baby we'll put an HR in here and
then underneath here we'll have another
div and then we'll put in some text and
into this text we will render person on
stage info of person on stage so I'm
going to compile this everything looks
good so we'll use um reactor which I
glossed over at the beginning so what
this going to do is gonna start an HTTP
server in our directory that serves us
and some nice debugging stuff and when I
go to the to the site we'll see a whole
listing of our directory here so I
already created this index.html but well
while we're debugging we can actually
just click straight in to the Elm file
we're interested in and it will compile
it on the fly and render it right into
our browser so there's the HTML that we
rendered statically but that's
you know that's that's cool but it's um
it's static and we want to build an app
so we need to have this change so I
already talked about Model View update
and we'll actually just build those out
right now so model you know type alias
model the model this program is just
gonna be a you know maybe user we're
just gonna have an app that put someone
on the stage and takes them off again
so we'll do maybe maybe person rather
that's our model that's all the
information we need to display our
application to keep track of what's
going on the next part is the update
so update consists of two parts the
first is sort of a layout of the things
that are allowed to happen in your app
and we use a similar custom Union type
so we'll say type and these are commonly
called messages abbreviate it like so so
we'll say the messages that our
application is allowed to send to itself
our put person on stage and take person
actually let's let's do this it's it's a
little bit verbose let's do like come
back and go away so updates tend to have
a signature that looks like this
so we're going to take a message one of
those two things that we can pattern
match on later and we'll take whatever
the current model is and we will return
a new version of that model so given a
message in the model we can say case
message of come back so when come back
comes in will say the model is now just
me and when everybody gets sick of me
being up here you say go away then it'll
be nothing and this is how our
application is a lot of change so we've
described the entire domain for this
system and the way that it's allowed to
to modify itself in in like 18 lines of
code including whitespace and that's
pretty cool and then the last part is
the view
so we can take all this and kind of
refactor it into a function so few takes
our model produces it's an HTML which
sends our messages so given the model
which is a maybe person let's get the
person on stage info for that model and
then we need to actually send some
information back into our app so what
lets us do that is events so we're
interested in on clicks we're going to
do buttons so we'll get button here I'm
gonna have on click on those buttons so
we're in a separate div we'll have one
button that says one click come back the
text will be come back and another
button similarly let's just go away let
me click in and on text we'll say go
away so let's see that cover everything
I think it does and then the last step
for wiring all this up just say this is
HTML message sorry rather it's a it's no
longer just HTML now it's a program it's
a full totally legitimate program so we
could say this is a program with this
type never which means there's no
there's no information coming in from
the outside we also have the option to
do that but we're not going to do that
right now it said why are all the stuff
we say HTML to a beginner program which
is really awesome for demos like this we
just tell it the initial model will be
just me I'm up here right now this is
the initial condition for application
how it updates itself is just that
update function and how we view it
it's just the View Function oh haha so I
totally spelled program wrong and it
told me about it so back to reactor
let's recompile so I'm on the stage
right now me zoom in I click go away
little transfer to say no one is on the
stage and we can go back and forth just
like that so we've defined an entire
domain model to its model people and
their presence to represent the stage
and then we've built an interactive
application complete with a nice layout
with with HTML in just about 100 lines
of code including whitespace so really
concise totally free from runtime errors
and totally great for for building
awesome front-end applications so that's
all the code that I wanted to show but I
have a bunch of things you can look at
to start your journey of getting
involved in the community really quickly
and then I'm just going to take like one
minute to tell you about myself at the
end sure ok sounds good
so this is el mango work there's a bunch
of examples you can scroll through here
and learn more about Elm you can try it
interactively in your browser at Elm
lang org slash try there's a meetup here
in Copenhagen so you can just go to meet
up and find that there's some great
people there and you should definitely
join the slack it's the most helpful
aspect of the whole community you can
get immediate feedback from from
community members and ask questions and
answer questions and so that's Elma
Heroku app comm and so really quickly
I'm Luke and I work at a company called
humble spark where we build user
interfaces with JavaScript and elm and
we are accepting a new client we're
looking for a new client so if you need
help building a thing we will we will
help and you can find me on twitter at
luke underscore underscore Jas and
that's all I have so I'm ready for
questions
so a quick one the type system is very
similar to typescript can you paranoia
the benefit from using a functional
language for web development which
typescript
isn't I'm sorry I think I missed like
the middle of that can you point out the
benefit of using a functional sure so
the benefit of using a functional
language is that it kind of it gives you
this paradigm of designing with
constraint so you don't in typescript
you have types but you still have the
option to not have types if you use the
any type which is really just not a type
and you can you can do whatever you want
so Elm kind of restricts you it says
these are the things you're allowed to
work with you just have stateless
functions that can't create side-effects
and you have these kind of types and so
it kind of answers a lot of questions
for you about what your architecture is
supposed to look like just by being a
functional language so you don't have to
think so much about how to like put like
wire things together you just say okay I
have functions and I have data and
that's all I have and that that helps
you to focus on the the problem that you
need to solve instead of figuring out
like okay like how do I use typescript
and how do I use that to design a nice
system good don't think we have time for
anything more but thank you Luke right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
