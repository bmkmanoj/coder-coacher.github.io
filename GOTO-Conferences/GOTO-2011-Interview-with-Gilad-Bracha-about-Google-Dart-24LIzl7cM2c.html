language it's pretty conservative
compared to say Newspeak so it's more
like small talk because there are static
variables which are like glass variables
he will eventually have mirror based
reflection very much like strong talk
but it doesn't have that yet so right
now it's kind of missing it certainly is
JavaScript like syntax oh right now the
privacy model is different there's we
have this notion of library based
privacy which is sort of like package
privacy in Java but a little different
and that's very different from stronger
it's one of the things I personally
would like to change but probably
unlikely to change we might add object
privacy as well because if you don't
really contradict but it's too early to
tell we're also waiting a lot on
feedback from people once we put it out
there we'll see how how people react so
that's probably the biggest difference
from the basic Smalltalk model
what else I guess we have accessors
built in which we didn't have in strong
coats of fhe of an advanced in a way a
small that's what a fairly crucial one
so i'll attribute accessory yeah
essentially yeah basically the same as
in javascript actually
necessarily the only way to do it but
that's the way they're set up right now
we have this factory mechanism which is
kind of nice decoupling the
manufacturing of objects from from the
actual class or instance implementation
type that you're doing which is very
important that's also kind of neat
and so when you you know we think of
strong talk or standard small talk those
are actually some things are slightly
better but we're the optional types
behave a little differently of course
but that's getting very very technical
that's kind of approach forgotten
something with that you feel about
mixing we didn't hear about Nixon's at
all oh there aren't mix-ins ya know
there aren't mix-ins at this time the
thought has crossed our mind we have
heard of this idea okay but we'll see it
would be really nice for libraries to be
able to mix in parts and stuff to manage
the hierarchy but so far we're sticking
to very very conservative stuff because
that's one of kind of very successful
things in say Ruby questions mm-hmm
buying mixing is very widely award you
won't get much argument from me but so
far they're not there ok they just say
one person yeah to all the people who's
not here today could give us stop and
hid lights
darling headlines come over to the dark
side
I guess if you want more of a summary
it's a pure object-oriented language
single inheritance class-based
optionally typed and if you don't know
what optionally type means read all
about it on the website basically a
dynamically typed language with types
you can use when you want them and don't
get in your way when you don't and a few
subtitles as well volume 6 of the dart
language specifications know you have a
dart is designed for programming to the
web there are essentially two
implementations right now there's a vm
and there's a compiler called artsy that
compiles dart to JavaScript which means
that you can run dart on any modern
browser it better be a modern browser
right we're not targeting backwards
compatibility ie6 or something but you
know a nice browser like Chrome will do
very nicely and so you should be able to
run it anywhere oh you should be able
it's very early now it's just the
technology preview but the goal is to
let you write programs entirely in Dart
so you don't have to worry about gluing
server and client code and such has
actor based concurrency that's another
difference from from strong talk
and how many subtitles do you want I
don't want to get I didn't want to give
any doing this under duress tocho
so I know this is this is very early but
when due to what according to our like
rope map what is your what is your plan
but we do think this is like a
production will of Allah I well are you
not I'm not I'm not I'm not the one to
ask exactly but it's at some point down
the road in the future I will qualify
that is in the future as in the past it
will become a product how about that
that I can safely say and you know we're
really waiting to see what the feedback
is like it's very early the language may
change the features may change we're
really trying to take a data oriented
kind of googly approach to this to
actually find out that's a nice thing
about the web we've actually started to
do this sort of thing looking like what
features people use in JavaScript and
how popular they are and that can help
us sometimes with our decisions because
at Google we can we can just find out
how many people are doing X in a
JavaScript program on the planet it's
there's a guy who sits next to me who
can do wonders with that sort of stuff
and so we can actually base our
decisions on data which is kind of scary
because if what if the data doesn't
agree with me well it's obviously wrong
but we're going to see how it plays out
and i'm not sure what the timeline is
how about the android story how does
this connect
how does all this dark stuff connects I
enjoyed it does it have anything to do
with this upcoming android release
called Ice Cream Sandwich
thank you for that question I really
glad you asked that question because
obviously I'm going to tell you all
about ice cream sandwich no I I can say
this oh right it'll run on Android just
like it runs anywhere else because it
runs everywhere and anything beyond that
you can speculate lots of things might
make sense but I'm not going to talk
