talk with you about delivering customer
value most organizations think that they
deliver a fair amount of value it's
tough for us to work in positions and
think we're not delivering value but I'd
like to challenge you a little bit on
how you think about value and how you
decide whether you really are or really
aren't and that you take the whole cold
hard look and face the music whether you
are or are not delivering value so back
I'm going to take us back almost 20
years actually 20 years to this month
this book was released it has a 1996
publishing date but it was actually
released in the fall of 95 and Lean
Thinking by Jim Womack and Dan Jones
began the whole lean management movement
in the United States and in the West all
over the West and in this book even
though it's 20 years old there were some
key principles that really resonate
still today and there's also a fair
amount of information that was not
included in this book that we now
understand about lean management that we
didn't understand back in 1996 when
Womack and his research team went to
Toyota to study what Toyota was doing
that was helping us basically whip our
butts in the automotive industry
so let's cook look at some of the basics
one of the basics that Womack and his
team discovered was that there were five
principles that define what lean
management was first you had to be very
very clear on what your customers value
and then you have to figure out whether
or not you're actually delivering that
or not so looking at the work through a
value stream and looking at the whole
system and the interconnected
departments and functions and people and
entities that are delivering value is a
way to start determining whether or not
you're in fact delivering value or not
and then I won't go through these last
three very much but you want to flow
work to the customer you want to pull it
whenever you can't naturally flow it to
the customer and then always seek
perfection but let's talk a little bit
about value
the problem with value is that customers
don't always agree what they indeed
value so if you're an organization that
has a
a very large customer base you're stuck
with trying to figure out well you know
these customers want this and these
customers want with that what do we
actually deliver and there's just you
know a myriad of different kinds of
features and traits and and aspects that
customers will say that they value is
that some customers will say they do not
well there are some things that are very
stable that you can hang your hat on
first of all customers value quality and
they value it quite quite intensely and
in software quality is very often the
way the the elegance of the application
that they're interfacing with the ease
of user use of that of that application
and the thing about quality is that it's
really no longer a tremendous
differentiator between organizations
because quality is so expected today
that if you're not delivering quality
you're probably going to lose market
share rather quickly and you won't be
able to thrive in the marketplace so
when you think about quality it is it is
about a elegant easy to interface with
application or whatever product you're
producing the other differentiator that
used to be a much greater have a greater
weight than it does right now is money
how much does the product cost what
we're finding now increasingly is that
people are very very willing to pay more
money for higher quality so being the
cheapest game in game in town isn't
necessarily a differentiator even though
sometimes we're tempted to think so
however we want to find a way to be able
to produce high high quality as cheaply
as possible so that we're able to meet
both of those needs the one thing that
is lift left for us to look at that is
really the big differentiator is speed
now that doesn't mean speed in absence
of quality or low cost it means speed
with all three of those present so speed
becomes the primary differentiator and
when you start looking at any system of
work it's not just software development
but it's very much so in software
development you'll start seeing some
tremendous opportunity to reduce speed
to market and still have very very
high-quality at a very reasonable price
now that's where we're going to agree on
value and what value is to a customer
but now we look at well what is the
value stream and what are we going to do
with the value stream in order to make
sure that we're delivering the amount of
value that we think our customers
actually want so the value stream you
think of it as an interconnected linking
of all of the people that are involved
in delivering value to the customer
all of the functions if you outsource it
includes the outsource entities anybody
internal that supporting the delivery of
value all of those entities are part of
the value stream and what we do all too
often and we've done this for decades
and decades and decades centuries I
would argue is that we've tended to
operate in silos within organizations
within actually government agencies
within society we tend to think about
everything in silos the problem with
that is that usually when you have this
prevailing thinking in an organization
there's no one person no one entity that
can really describe how you actually
deliver value from beginning to end from
customer requests to delivering on that
request so if you have not one person in
the entire organization who can really
define how you're delivering value this
puts you at a bit of a disadvantage for
making any kind of improvement over the
- over time so in 1999 a book came out
called learning to see it was a value
stream mapping book the first book that
was produced by John shook and John
shook and Mike rather their take on
value stream mapping was from a
manufacturing perspective so this is
back when lean was very big and
manufacturing and hadn't spread to all
the other services that it has now and
in learning to see what they decided was
that we needed to visualize the work in
a unique way and the Japanese were very
very handy at drawing on everything now
kids placemats and drawing pictures of
how work moved or didn't move through a
system and so that began the way that we
started looking at value stream mapping
I was fortunate to be introduced to lean
in 2000
and because I did not have a
manufacturing background I looked at
this manufacturing stuff and said how do
we tweak that for services because
that's the world I operate in and I took
paper a decade or so of practicing and
exploring and tweaking and everything to
figure out how to apply it in the
services area and it resulted in value
stream mapping last year with micro uh
my cough sterling my partner-in-crime on
that book and it's not remarkably
different but there are some
fundamentals that are different from the
way that you think through a process in
manufacturing which I'll introduce you
to today so when you think about a value
stream and you think about how do we
analyze how we're currently operating
because that's where you want to start
you always start with a customer the
customer is the one who's requesting
some sort of a service it could be
internal or it could be an external
customer we tend to look at more value
stream Maps from an external customer
point of view because you will see
opportunities for improving value that
you don't see if you have a very
internal point of view
so we start from the outside all
customers have some sort of a need and
then this this animated value stream
it's gonna be a little bit high level
and it's not gonna be how the world
actually works but more or less you've
got some sort of a linear flow in how
work is being handed off as you're
developing in this case software and
then at the end you deliver back to a
customer and I think it was Dan
yesterday that said you know the goal
should be shortening lead time - thank
you so I added it a little thank you
there now that we have an idea of what
the work is flowing through the value
stream how its flowing now we have to
look at a little more detail so these
value stream maps are done at a very
very high level and they're typically
done with high level leaders not
frontline people doing the work because
there are strategic decisions that need
to be made and only leaders are
typically in the role of making
high-level leadership decisions so what
we start doing then is looking at the
way work is flowing through and how long
in total it's taking to flow through the
whole value stream in this case you see
the number of weeks it takes from the
homework is passed on to a next area
until it's picked up by an area to carry
on the total of this is 16 weeks more or
less now if we look at the actual work
time of each one of those areas what we
find is the process time where the
actual touch time work time to do each
one of those processes is significantly
shorter so in this case we have 16 days
of total time being spent over the
course of 16 weeks so then the question
is what are people doing in that other
time are they playing solitaire or are
they you know doing something else well
no they're typically juggling a
multitasking quite a few projects but
this is a problem and it's a problem
that we're going to solve so then one
last thing that we take a look at after
we look at the fact that only about 20
percent of the time is that customer
requests actually being acted upon the
rest of the time eighty percent of the
time it's just sitting around then we
look at how are we going to fill those
gaps and how are we going to get work to
flow far more easily through the whole
value stream and there are different
tools and solutions you can use which
we'll talk about in just a moment the
third metric so those are the two time
metrics that are classic value stream
mapping the third metric is a quality
metric that's more about information
quality than anything so think about it
think about the work you do and think
about what percentage of the time when
you receive work are you able to just do
whatever you're going to do with it
without having to do anything
no rework whatsoever and rework isn't
just correcting what you received rework
is also adding information that should
have been supplied and rework is also
clarifying information that could have
been or should have been clear to begin
with so what we want to do is not read
move entirely the need for we don't want
to remove clarification if you need to
clarify you need to clarify but we want
to remove the need for clarification and
when you get better information flowing
through the system so when you think
about work systems like this much
the time people downstream have not
articulated to people upstream what it
is they actually really need in order to
do their work and so you put
cross-functional teams together to do
this type of analysis and discovery
and gaining clear on the current state
so that you can finally have
conversations about what the needs
really are and then you start bridging
these gaps between different functional
areas and they start playing well
together in the sandbox you're able to
shorten time and this quality metric is
one of the most powerful metrics I've
ever seen because it's basically saying
you know what percentage of the time can
you do your work without having to
correct add or clarify and the numbers
are bhisma abysmally low much of the
time so when you and this is back to
something that I believe it was Adrian
Collier yesterday talked about he had a
one of the papers two had these X's and
the the graph he was talking about how
you don't have to get precise with
information this is one of those metrics
that you don't have to get precise on
because if someone reports that fifty
percent of the time they have to correct
out or clarify and then someone else
says well in my case it's only 70
percent of the time that you still need
to make improvement so we're making kind
of higher grade course decisions about
prioritization and improvement needs
based on reported quality versus taking
months and months to try to measure it
and get precise about it we're able to
make decisions and move on and get
improvement going so then what we do is
take a look at what are we going to do
to get these numbers up how do we get
these numbers from say you know a 75%
quality up to someone receiving all of
the information they need it's complete
and it's accurate 90 percent of the time
that is what is going to allow you to
start shortening those timeframes and
get rid of the delays because of all the
rework so this that looks like a simple
a simple map right this is an actual
value stream map of a full software
development cycle and if you notice here
this green I don't know if this is going
to show up but this green arrow going
back to the customer that's the closure
of the loop and then there's a whole
kind of training and billing cycle
the end some value streams are extending
beyond now beyond delivery to a customer
to include some of the finance cycle on
the rework cycle those types of things
and in redoing and you know further
development and all of that so it
doesn't necessarily stop exactly where
the customer is so you don't need to
read this I just like to you know it's
kind of small but like to note a couple
of things you'll notice up here there's
these little rectangles I don't know if
you can read them but they are all the
different applications or systems that
are being used to track work as it's
going through the value stream and you
can see that it looks rather complex
there are a lot of different systems at
play here and a lot of inputs and
outputs from those systems so it's just
at a glance we have a visual now of how
work is actually flowing or not flowing
in this case and then you also notice
that there are a couple steps here where
there are parallel activities going on
at the same time so this is more or less
linear going across here but you have
some parallel activities at the same
time in the current state this is a
current state map and what we notice
when we take a look at this map is that
it is a fairly visually complex looking
map and sometimes it takes the visual
look at a process just to even get
people to understand that there is
opportunity to streamline it and to make
work flow more easily now rather than go
into the details of that oh wait one
more thing you will see here also
there's a VA and there's a n so these VA
stand for value adding the team
determined that these were the steps in
the value stream that truly added value
to the customer and there's a couple of
them here but many of them are marked
and as necessary to the business at that
time now the question is how do we make
some of those steps not necessary so
let's take a close up here's the close
up of the front end of a development
process and this is you see here's when
they're going to begin development this
is current state so everything beyond is
when the development and test testing
actually occurs and you'll see again
there's two VA is only only two steps in
the current state that were deemed value
adding in the eyes of the customer and
what we notice is it's 23 days but only
six hours of actual work time
for those 23 days so it's a
significantly large amount of delay
that's happening from that client
requests or customer requests all the
way through the system the other thing
you'll notice is it says AR 1% that's
called activity ratio so only 1% of time
is work actually moving through this
value stream and that's very common to
see it in the 1 to 5 sometimes 10
percent you get above 10 percent your
office world class these days for
current state so it's a significant
thing and then you'll also notice this
rolled percent complete and accurate the
quality metric we talked about is only
at 7 percent that's current state this
is what gives people the foundation from
which to design a better a better world
so if we move on to the better world
well how do we make those decisions well
you have to really challenge your
thinking so in this case roles and
responsibilities were rethought a lot in
this case there were a couple of issues
with project managers that were kind of
getting in the middle of the process
that didn't need to be there they needed
to be maybe more front end and maybe
back end but not in the middle all the
time so they were removed from some of
the steps in the middle there was a
business analyst involved that was
involved in the front end and all the
way throughout and causing some
back-and-forth where developers weren't
allowed to talk directly to the client
the customer the customer that was going
to be receiving the product and so there
was a lot of delays back and forth with
roles and responsibilities the other
thing is is they had tried pair
programming and they had abandoned it
because they felt that it wasn't
effective but they hadn't really tried
it in the the right environment so they
needed to go back and take another look
at that then the other thing is is that
batch releases we heard a little bit
about that yesterday but there were very
long batch saw or very big batches that
were being released shortened that up as
well the other thing that you'll see
here is switched asking how many of you
have heard of the switch tasking
research professor David Mayer at
University of Michigan did about maybe
eight years ago now where he talked
about good about switch tasking so
multitasking is a myth
you can't multitask to cognitive
activities you
can multitask a cognitive and a non
cognitive but not to cognitive and David
Meyer found that 20 minutes a day was
wasted or I'm sorry 20 minutes with
every switch tasking happened when
engineers were switched tasking during
the day and they were switched tasking
anywhere from five to eight times and it
was skewed toward the eighth a day and
when you add that up over the course of
time in a you know smaller organization
that could be up to 15 full-time
people's worth of switch tasking that's
going on so it's a significant drain on
productivity and it is also very
stressful to switch tasks it takes a
long time to ramp up very stressful not
great for the workforce so what another
fix in this whole world of slower lead
times than you would like is to do fewer
things at once and it seems
counterintuitive we want to juggle a lot
and it's the world that we've kind of
gotten used to but you have to break
that habit and just start working on
fewer projects at one time wrapping them
and then move on to other projects
you'll get significantly more done in
the course of a year if you do that so
here's an example of a client that
before we instituted this type of focus
and fewer things at once were able to
produce about 24 complete 24 projects a
year and after introducing a focused way
of working they were able to produce
with no additional resources much lower
stress in the work force 73 projects
with the exact same number of people per
year so it is a significant gain in
productivity to do the most
counterintuitive thing which is just
don't do so much at once and it works
personally as well so now here is the
future state of that same map and with
all of those changes that were being
made they got their lead time down to 12
days and they got the process time the
actual touch time down to five hours now
that's one hour savings which seems like
a you know that's not much savings but
this was 90 projects a month coming into
this organization and when you add up
that one hour over the course of that
volume of projects over the course of a
year it's actually significant time and
the work force reported much much higher
satisfaction
with the work because they weren't being
pulled in so many different directions
and that type of thing
also quality remember was at 7% it's now
38% long way to go to get it up into the
70 to 80 range but significantly better
than it was in the current state the
people that mapped this involved there
was a scrum master
there was one developer on the team the
CTO was on the team the VP of what his
official title was but oversaw quality
and testing there were a couple people
from the business side on the team it
had about about nine people on the team
that did this mapping over the course of
about two days two and a half days to
get the mapping done and then it was a
third day to create the implementation
plan for how they were going to execute
this future state they got the future
state done in about five months so it's
not easy some of these big changes take
time but it's about you know a three to
six month cycle is what we look for to
make those kinds of big changes and then
you hit it again and again and again and
the kinds of changes you can see are
represented by this great blog post I
know how many of you have seen this blog
post from is it Kell Sato Phil casado a
couple of you good so this is a recent
blog post and is he here I think was he
here and that's fantastic
I tweeted him this morning but I didn't
get a response yet ah okay well it's a
did you okay well it's it's a brilliant
blog post yeah take it take a look at it
and so what he shows is how I think it
was four iterations that might have been
five how they kept going back and going
back and going back and he gives quite a
bit of detail on what specifically they
did every step along the way to go from
66 days down to 16 so I recommend you
take a look at that and the last thing
I'd like to mention is when you're
looking at work through a value stream
one of the things that surfaces when you
get these teams together is you start
seeing people you know they develop a
love for the wrong thing they develop
love of code they
developed love of their project they
develop love of the way they work
you know they develop all these things
that kind of want to they want to keep
close and what we want to do is instead
turn that into falling in love with
customer value and getting very clear
that time means a lot to customers and
the way that you go about your work if
you can get more of those blocks along a
value stream map to say VA on them and
get rid of anything in between then
that's when you know you have really
kicked the tires
you've innovated you've done as much as
you can to get high value deliver to the
customer all the time and that's the
goal of value stream mapping it's one of
the most powerful methodologies I've
seen in my I think 30 years now in
improvement and I never get tools happy
but this particular approach because
it's leadership heavy happens to be one
of the most effective methodologies I've
seen for improving processes so I
recommend you take a good look at that
nurse if you have any questions and
we're gonna have a Q&amp;amp;A after so please
ask some questions on the app and come
and visit us too
