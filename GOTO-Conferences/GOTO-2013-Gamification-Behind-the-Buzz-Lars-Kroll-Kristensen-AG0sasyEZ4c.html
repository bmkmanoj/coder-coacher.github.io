gamification behind the buzz um first of
all I'd like to ask you guys how do you
feel do you feel like professional IT
developers then I think that the go to
conference has actually managed to in
some sense gamify the conference because
that's what gamification to me is all
about is about emotion I'll get back to
that in a little while so first of all
who Who am I and who do I got represent
so my name is last call and I'm the
development director of unity studios we
are a a company that this if that is
based here in almost so I'm a local guy
where we have a mission to proliferate
the use of 3d particularly real-time 3d
and particularly interactive 3d that's
what we do that's that's what we love to
do so we do work for hire we're about 30
guys working on this we also we work
with an engine called unity we have a
booth down there at the at the stand and
recommend that you know come by and look
at some of the stuff we have there we
have some pretty cool stuff to show off
so what we really love to do at unity
Studios is to make 3d experiences and 3d
experiences is basically the shortest
way we can put it it catches that it's
about 3d it captures that it's
interactive I think because otherwise I
think it's a you know sort of weak
experience if it's not interactive
therefore it also needs to be real-time
3d and that basically you know one way
of doing that its cost to make games so
we have made a few games all the stuff
i'm showing here is stuff we've done
through the time some of it is our own
games some of it is games we've done
or for other for other parties and some
of it is has nothing to do with games
but unity and the 3d experiences runs
through everything we do and that change
that it turns out that I heard this this
word gamification some time ago and I
heard an explanation about what it was
and I went like hey that's what we're
doing and if I figured out that we'd
actually been doing gamification for a
while without really realizing it so so
what is it what is gamification to me
there's a lot of a lot of definitions
floating rolling around out there I am
luckily not in academia anymore so I
have the liberty of you know ignoring
definitions or making up my own as it
pleases me so that's what I did so for
me gamification is taking user
experience to the next level it's about
adding an emotional content and an
emotional context to the applications we
built so what do i mean about this and
what do i mean with with this emotional
content emotional context and some of
you might might be familiar with the
technique of personas a race of hand if
you know what what a persona is ok so
about half the audience I'll have to I
have to talk a little bit about what a
persona is then so the idea with a
persona design approach is that you come
up with some fictional persons during
your design process that I your sort of
target persons you know I am building
this game for Ali's Bob and Charlie and
alice is so-and-so and Bob is so and
Charlie's like this and whenever you
take a design decision or whenever you
have a design and you know thought
something you consider to to add your
design or remove from your design you
also ask yourself the question how would
Alice Bob and Charlie feel about this
addition to the design would they like
it and then with a bit of luck and if
you know what you're doing if you're
good at what you're doing you end up
building an application that is well
suited for Alice Bob and Charlie which
is great now to me gamification is to
some extent and an inverse process it's
a process of basically saying okay so i
have this particular emotion that i want
my players to feel or this role that i
want them to feel like i want my players
to feel like something and then i make
various decisions various design
decisions based on that on that goal i
want my players to feel like something
and that is pretty much what game design
is all about so to me gamification is to
some extent about using game technology
but it's also very much about using game
techniques game design techniques in
your work in your design work so that's
just to explain what I feel is
gamification and the rest of this talk
is it's pretty much exemplifying more
about this so this is the case we did
open by the way for those of you who
were here yesterday at my talk there
will be a little bit of reuse of slides
but the words are going to be a little
bit different this time so this is a
these are these are promotional images
by a company called Felix they say
little windows well that's what you
think they sell anyway what they told us
they sell is they sell light and it kind
of makes sense because you know
especially when you put in a window in
the Attic of your room what you want
from that what your goal that is to let
in more light to your room and then the
window is just there to you know prevent
the the rain from coming in and stuff
like that so we looks of cost promotes
their products and they do that with
pictures like these
which is fine these can are pictures
that you know ddd the marketing business
are very good at making the person that
watches something feel in a particular
way these pictures of course convey some
of that emotion that VX wants to convey
around their products in that brand but
the problem with this with this
particular way of showing of the product
is you can't see what does this do to
your room and this is where it gets
interesting again with V axis view of
what they do is they sell light because
it's not about the window we don't focus
exactly on the window here it's not
about how good is the quality and so on
you know well it's also about that but
it's mostly about what does the addition
of the window do to this room and okay
we can show it in this room but how
about showing it for your room for the
end-users room so that's what we like to
do so in short they basically asked us
to make an application that makes the
inducer feel like an architect anyway
that's what we came up with after having
talked about it for a while and some
coffee was involved as well but we
wanted basically an application that
makes the end user feel like an
architect yep it's difficult for for
most people to look at a room and go hmm
if I put a window in there the light is
going to be really amazing and cool in
here architects can do that most other
people not so much but so we wanted to
make a tool oil Felix wanted us to make
a tool that would help the inducer get
that inspiration and get that feeling
all the while feeling like an architect
so we made this this is running in a web
player it's a couple years old so it
might look a little bit dated Felix was
very particular about the the light
simulation being done extremely well so
we had a lot of technical challenge this
is this I'm not going to talk so much
about that
I'm going to talk about the the design
and the way that that everything is put
together here it was important for velux
and incidentally also for us that the
day was really simple to use so that you
know everybody who actually browsed to
to that web page would be able to do
something relatively easily so we put a
lot of effort into making you know into
making it easy to use and making
efficient to use and and solving that
case it was also important for velux
that there was this this brand quality
this this sense of this feels nice this
feels cool this feels glossy and looks
good and it's a high quality light and
so on because that reflects of course on
on the Vedic band so that was important
for them and on top of that we wanted
this we wanted this to feel you know we
were honest as I said the the user to
feel like an architect while they were
toying around with the with the
application so this is why the the
visual design you know looks the way it
looks this is why everything this is why
there's a very very little color why
everything looks like a drawing why
everything except i should say the light
which was very important for v looks to
get right this is all designed to help
the user get that experience of that get
that feeling of I am an architect
another thing we know about 3d as being
you know being being people that work
with 3d ourselves all the time is it's
pretty hard to grasp it's pretty
difficult it's surprisingly difficult
actually to make a good 3d editor people
have been spending a lot of time on that
and it's still not particularly
intuitive how to work with a full 3d
editor so it was a very big deal for us
to try and make something where you
could as an end user be
I haven't have an editor experience and
have some amount of freedom in building
stuff while on the other hand you know
still feeling like you know what you're
doing this is easy for me to do again
also because if the inducer feels that
you know this playing around with
building a virtual room and putting in a
virtual window and so on if that feels
easy then by extension it probably also
is easy to phone up a you know a
carpenter actually do it now whether
that's true or not is different story so
as I said 3ds how to grasp it's
difficult to to to work with and this is
just not a solution anymore solution
being read the manual is not a
solution anymore you cannot you can no
longer get away with just you know okay
I have a difficult program to use I'll
give the the end users Emmanuel my I
would pass it that if you are delivering
a product to induces and you need to
actually include a manual in that
product then you've messed up and you
need to look at your design again and
you need to make sure you don't need a
manual but still you need to teach
people how to use the application that
is a given that is also true for games
many games these days are actually quite
difficult in quite complex and quite the
complicated creatures you basically need
to teach people how to use them the way
we do in games is we do a tutorial so a
tutorial tutorial levels are basically
dead easy levels that you cannot
possibly fail in where some character
some entity in the game asks you to do
certain things you know jump over this
jump through this hoop please in order
to save the princess or whatever I
actually would have liked for us to to
actually have a character go through
this this narrative that we designed for
the velux case so we do
the narrative for the velux case where
we basically you know take the user by
the hand and guide them through the
experience of building a particular
building and we could probably have well
it's it's it's hard to say we might have
been able to make it more effective
bye-bye sort of having a character that
asked for the help of the of the of the
user and rewarded the user with a nice
thank you at the end of the walkthrough
I'm not sure because the other hand on
the other hand that might to some people
feel to none too too gamey and to none
architetti basically so we fell back to
the original vision which was make
something that makes the use of feel
like an architect so therefore it's more
like a set of instructions that leads
the the user through the rebuilding
experience the important point is of the
core of it this is that it's basically
all about the emotion the emotional
context now some of you may start a zero
is beginning to sound too religious and
so on so I'd like to sort of help point
out the the possibly obvious but anyway
i'm going to point out any way that an
application that that you're building
you know an application that that solves
something that is a tool or that solves
some sort of some sort of task needs of
course to be efficient as is almost a
mass lothian pyramid of needs at the
very bottom is it needs to be efficient
your tool needs to do whatever it is
it's doing in an efficient way and you
know preferably the most efficient way
in the world preferably you have to be
you know more efficient of what you're
doing then the next guy around there
when you got that sort it and you know
what you're doing on that part then you
start looking at ease of use it also has
to be easy to use
the ease of use cannot compromise the
efficiency it has to be built on top of
the efficiency a good example of that is
if you're building you know a very easy
to use programming language which is
very very easy to use because it doesn't
have any loops for instance yeah does
make it easier as you use but it also
imposes a wall that makes it you know
less efficient less usable and so fix
the efficiency first then fix the ease
of use then it needs to be pretty and
this is actually something I think has
changed over the past maybe 5-10 years
or something back in the day nobody
cared that you know all all applications
will gun metal gray and you know
everything looked horrible basically but
now people actually care quite a lot
that applications are pretty this course
has been true for games also for for a
long time I think that what comes on top
of that is this emotional content I'm
talking about but again the prettiness
and the emotional context it can only be
built on top of the other stuff and must
never be at the cost of the other stuff
the other stuff is still more important
so to me gamification lives up there in
the top in the emotional part and what's
interesting also about this emotional
content and context I was talking about
is that this this adding of emotion this
if you will manipulation of the end user
and manipulation of the end users
emotions to make the inducer feel
something particular that you want the
induced to feel is you know there are
group of domain experts out there and
those are game developers and especially
game designers now I'm going to take you
somewhere else because the emotions you
want people to feel aren't always pretty
you may actually have some good reasons
to want to make people feel something
else so
this image is a ship called the Costa
Concordia pretty sure most of you have
heard about this a number of people died
during this when this ship sank and the
reason it sank was because of horrible
horrible risk management and very bad
leadership aboard the ship we were part
of a research research effort called
team safety this was a project that
actually started way before cuz the
Concordia and costa concordia happened
during this project it was sort of a it
was a humbling experience experience for
me to work on this project because as
you know i have seen myself as game
developer for a long time but suddenly I
found myself working on something that
actually you know saved lives which was
nice well I haven't as such saved lives
but which actually attended to save
lives rather than just kill time and
that was say a nice experience but also
a humbling experience so the idea with
team saved he wants to build a
multi-user application and a simulation
a multiplayer game if you will in which
the trainees the the users players if
you will were the crew that the deck
crew and the and the bridge crew of a
passenger ship so that was of course the
emotion we wanted to put into people
want to let them to make them feel like
these characters want to make them feel
like the deck crew the bridge crew and
also the sort of service crew of a
passenger ship now that was quite easy
because our users were in fact bridge
crew cabin crew and and they that crew
of a passenger ship but that was also
sort of the challenge because we were
going to put that emotion into them in a
virtual world so that mean that meant
that we had to replicate that virtual
world in
hi pretty high fidelity for it to feel
right for the for the for the crew also
as I said it was about safety training
so this multi user application also had
some some some bad stuff happening
during the during the exercise or doing
doing during the simulation a fire will
break out at the car deck and it is the
the job of the crew to fight the fire
and to evacuate the passengers if it if
it gets as bad as that and to coordinate
those efforts also from from from the
bridge and all do all that in accordance
with the safety protocols about the the
particular ship and this is something
that that it turns out this is actually
quite difficult and quite expensive for
for the for the ship lines to to
actually do this kind of training so
they only do what they really really
have to so the idea here wants to do it
in a virtual environment and thereby
caught the costs dramatically because
you didn't have to park the ferry which
is really really expensive now in such a
situation the the great enemies apart
from stupidity is these emotions so
stretched confusion panic fear as I said
before it's not always about making the
use of feel something nice and fluffy
this case it was it was our job to try
and induce as much stress confusion and
panic and fear into our users as we
could and it was also our our our job to
give the the instructor a tool to to
help him you know dial up the stress
confusion and panic and fear as he
pleased as he needed in order for him to
sort of also dial up the ddd
on the amount of pressure he would put
on the on the crew so the instructor was
able to join in on this simulation and
he could do all kinds of stuff he could
put fire on the ship he could put out
fires on the ship he could set off false
alarms he could block doors he could
even he could even possess the the
non-player characters ai-controlled ngon
Tay occurs as the passengers and become
an obnoxious passenger basically I will
not leave this very until I have my wife
by my side help me find my wife and this
this is the kind of thing that can you
know again add to all of these negative
emotions so we don't want to put these
negative emotions on people because we
mean we want to put them on people on
the bridge crew so that they are
prepared prepared for these emotions and
so that they can sort of figure out how
do I react and just as importantly how
do my team mate react under these
circumstances and how does our
communication breakdown or function
under these circumstances so that was
the goal within with team safety and it
ended up looking like this oops this is
also a demo that we have down at the
booth so you can come a come have a look
at it one of the things we also did
during that project was to add VR
goggles to the project in order to sort
of add to the emotion level
unfortunately the oculus VR hadn't come
out around the time of this project but
afterwards we we also poured this 22 to
oculus and that actually that actually
made a difference because that actually
made it feel much more immersive and
thus you're easier for us as game
developers always application developers
to sort of imbue this sense of no panic
confusion fear that we wanted
and by the way some of you might be
sitting here thinking okay but this is
just a serious game isn't it and maybe
you're right I don't know that it
doesn't really bother me because I also
think that serious games is gamification
of something in this case gamification
of training a cohort could also be
gamification of education or
gamification of maybe even news coverage
who knows so enough about team safety
now the next case I'll talk about is
outer stat so outraged that is a sort of
a theme park for Volkswagen in in
Wolfsburg in Germany it's a place for a
fox wagon to show off their brand it's
also a place for you know int consumers
to come and experience that Brandon to
come experience some of the things that
that Volkswagen there either have
produced or are the values that works
one wants to project to the world it's
also a place where you can sit and have
a sauerkraut while you're waiting for
your car to actually literally run off
the the end of the assembly line so it's
a pretty cool place and they have right
down here somewhere think in in that
building right there there's a there's
an installation or a set of
installations called Moby which is about
mobility not mobility as in mobile
phones but probability is in driving
around in a car and one of the this this
set of installations was made by a an
architect firm an active company called
Essaouira Shaffer they had a long-term
relationship with another company called
shift control and they wanted to resolve
invite us into the into this into this
collaboration work with working with
them because they came up with night
with an idea and they said
now this connect thing that sounds cool
so is everybody in is anybody in here
not familiar with Kinect Wow everybody
knows what a Kinect is great awesome
i'll explain it anyway it's a device
it's an input device basically that
record the movements of the user so
they're thinking was how about if we
integrate a connect into one of these
installations they already have had
something touch screens and so on could
we do that and we were like well sounds
cool Connect is cool it's it's a cool
technology we like to work with cool
technologies we know we knew there was a
nice integration with unity so the
technology part of it sounded
interesting but it was also very
important for us and this was new one
early days without cooperation with with
with so I schaefer so we weren't sure I
just wanted to make sure that you know
they had seen a few examples of how not
to use Kinect so I showed them this and
said let's not do this I usually don't
diss other people's projects in public
but in this case I will make an
exception this is an actual game that
came out in I don't know when paste on
connect so this is from the time when
when you know everybody was flocking to
connect and going oh let's let's make a
Kinect game because Connect is cool and
then they hire a guy like this too
enthusiastically demonstrate how cool
this game is and he obviously doesn't
even believe it and why doesn't he
believe it now he doesn't believe it
because he doesn't feel like a jockey he
feels like an idiot
so I it was important for me to show
this to soil Schaefer and going no guys
let's not do this right let's do
something else let's be a little bit
smaller about this let's be very let's
be very clear about what kind of emotion
is that we want what we want is this I'm
not talking about the usability part of
this because i know that in usability
circles this movie Minority ball is
being dissed by a lot of people so I'm
not talking about the usability part of
this I would like you to be very I'd
like to be very clear about that I'm
talking about the emotional part of this
I'm talking about Tom Cruise standing
right there looking manly gesturing in
in the very assertive ways and obviously
feeling extremely cool about himself
that's what we want and the reason its
extra important for this for this moby
installation as i said it this is a
public place this is sort of a theme
park there's a lot of people coming
there we're already asking people a lot
when we're asking them to you know to to
to feel confident in trying to interact
with something where they don't exactly
understand what it is they interact with
because they just see that the screen
reacts to their movements so it's hard
enough to make that intuitive and easy
to use but if we on top of that also
made feet people feel like idiots or
feel uncomfortable while they were doing
this you know they would not leave with
a good experience so therefore it was
very important for us that that the
emotions you used felt right and made
you feel like you know Tom Cruise in
Minority Report so this is not Tom
Cruise in Minority Report but close this
is actually one of our out of office at
the time and so notice the way that he's
noticed the way that the movie is now
posing
why is that okay notice the way that the
application actually reacts to him
walking up to it automatically that just
happens you can see down in the right
corner of the of the screen you can see
there's a white outline that shows how
he moves this is our way of telling the
user you know we can see you we can see
you move so that's all the hint at doing
what what you want to do and now notice
that the movements he's making he's a
he's his pointing and he's you know
assertively he's moving his hands and it
feels natural when you stand there it
looks easy believe me it was not was
very very difficult to get the the
calibration and everything for for the
kinect right this is something we worked
on for a long time the huge screen thing
was easy in comparison but the huge
green thing itself is actually also part
of this experience of feeling cool you
know making you feel like this is this
is pretty cool this is actually can this
wow wow is that possible behind that the
wall there is a room in which there's a
pretty big computer with a pretty big
graphics card actually quite a lot of
big graphics card that runs the the the
rendering that goes into this huge
screen and that isn't interesting to
show off then below it there's the
Kinect which is sort of a very very very
cheap device actually which is actually
the thing that's running the whole the
whole experience is crucial with kingpin
technology for this entire experience
that I've caused the design now the
final thing how am I for time perfect so
the final thing I want to talk a little
bit about is scrum and that starts to
get a little bit weird why why am I
talking about scrum now what does scrum
have to do with gamification well I
would pass it that scrum in some senses
is a gamified process
and I'd like you to think a little bit
about that when you go home to your to
your company's maybe it's not just about
the products maybe it's not maybe
gamification isn't just about the
product maybe it's also about the
process so scrum as most of you know I'm
haven't even asked if everybody is
familiar with scrum I will just assume
that so as most of you know scrum has
has has had a very big impact on
software development and generally it
get its met with a little bit of
skepticism it's a little bit of them
this is sort of a circus thing but then
after a while people actually enjoy it
and and and like to use it then it's
also efficient and there's a lot of
smart things you do now an example of
what I'm talking about is the scrum
board so the scrum board it makes sense
to have you know somewhere common where
you can actually look at what what you
need to do in the backlog what you're
working on right now and what you've
done already that makes sense that's
usable this is about efficiency and it
makes sense well we're not really there
where we're making pretty scrum boards
and but we are there where every day we
meet around our scrum board again partly
this is about efficiency and about
utility but there's also a very
satisfying feeling in this act of moving
you know a post-it note from in progress
to done it just feels nice this feels
good and if you look at the scrum board
over and I know the cause of your sprint
you'll see all the tasks moving from
backlog to in progress to done it's a
scoreboard it's a high score it's its
progression it shows you your going
places it shows you that what you're
doing actually works and actually has a
real positive consequence shows that in
a very obvious way to me the scrum board
is partly very very practical very very
useful very very
but it's also a high score it's a level
its rewards which is something that's
good in gamification planning poker
formal set of games rules which has
again some efficiency aspects of it but
which is also just fun well okay it gets
old at some stage of course but there is
something still something you know
pleasant and nice about having these and
you know to me I think that's that's
actually a serious reason why scrum has
has succeeded as well as it has because
not only does it actually do something
efficient and smart and well which is
very very important which is the primary
reason it also feels nice maybe if there
was a process that was as efficient as
scrum but just not as pleasant to use I
doubt that it would have been successful
so does that mean that I advocate
gamification everywhere again as I said
I don't normally dis other people's
projects this case I will also make an
exception this is the fabulous product
the 3d mailbox which i think is from the
mid 90s or something I'm honestly not a
hundred percent sure what the hell is
going on here but I think I think that
the hot women are emails and the fat
guys are spam and i think that the shark
is a spam filter now how that in any way
enhances you know anything in your life
I don't know but somebody came up with
this at some stage and felt that this
was just Nate 3d makes everything better
and I this is coming from a guy that
does you know interactive 3d for a
living I would love to be able to say
the 3d makes everything better but
clearly it doesn't so so again use with
caution
um and basically I would say that that's
game over unless of course there are
some questions which I suppose you've
had time to you know text me questions
and so on but it
for you scrub yeah
ah can I come up with examples of that
I'm sure there are examples out there
i'm i mean i know that there are
companies out there that label
themselves as gamification experts by
saying i will make sure that your users
get rewards and stuff so i mean i guess
in principle in principle when you have
sort of a stamp sheet you know the stamp
sheet thing we have going on here at the
the go to conference go around to
everybody get a stand and then you can
win something to some people that will
be gamification to me if it was fun
doing it then yes it would be game
vacation and to me i think that's that's
probably the thing that sometimes well
not even fun if it gave me an emotion
you know while i was doing this if that
made me feel more like a software
developer right then cool excellent
wonderful then i would call it
gamification as this now i don't know
i'm not sure i don't i don't feel that
it's very good gamification anyway but i
don't think that's the point of it
anyway i think at the point of it from
from the go to conferences point of view
is to you know get everybody out and
looking at all the booths and that works
so yeah for some games winning is
absolutely you know the essential thing
to do but you know there is this is this
cliché that it's not about winning it's
about playing the game or it's about
being part of it what is it in danish
it's a yeah the killer Movember you go
move in it it's about being part of it
not winning in some games particularly
you know computer games where you can
have at the series that are computer
controlled it makes actually a lot of
sense to have collaborative games and a
lot of games are collaborative games so
winning plays a part in competitive
player versus player games but it's not
the only way to make it game in case of
reviews
shown us that you are thinking about
going an avatar animated person to
tutorial we use it how to use the system
yes these days is not about heavy
designs were rising and very positive
emotions how do you see that in
comparison to be very conservative and
having that and professional look how
about you take that well I think it
depends extremely much on your
application so if you're building a tool
for database managers for instance they
would probably know analyze your analyze
your audience but my guess offhand
without being a hundred percent sure and
without wanting to to you know insult
anybody I think the database programmers
would prefer something that is down to
earth and makes them feel efficient and
professional more than something that
makes them feel happy you know it's not
about as I said it's not always about
making the use of feel happy it might as
well be about making the use of feel
professional make the user feel in this
case like a software developer make the
use of feel well efficient can be may be
enough sometimes right as an example
when I bought my previous phone the one
before the one I have now well I should
want before the one before the one I
have now I got a very big box and I got
my little feature phone with a lot of
you know buttons on it and I got this
big fat manual and i was looking at i
was feeling like but i can't be bothered
to read all this and that also meant
that i felt like an idiot for the first
you know a long time while I used that
phone eventually I figured it out and I
probably figured out about ten percent
of the functionality of that phone and I
was happy with it when i bought my next
phone i bought you know an iphone and
the box was classy and cool mmm nice i
open it and oh there's my phone and it
looks cool and looks nice and i'd pick
it up and there's this little leaflet
and I pick it up and look at the
leaflet is like wow I don't need this
Wow and you know a couple years down the
line I know about ten percent of what
the iphone can do but I feel better
about it right so it's about that that
emotional context you put into it and
it's about knowing whether that emotion
is something your your users appreciate
how would you describe the difference
between working on an abstract
experience project like the the alto
stop the project compared to the ones
with a very specific purpose like gonna
do well I would say that the clearer it
is what the what the goal with the
application is the easier it is to you
know to follow up on that goal but I
mean in the case of a wolf wolfsburg so
artist at the case was actually also
quite clear it might seem abstract but
it was still very very clear volkswagen
have have these particular values that
we want to you know to show and to admit
to the end user we want to use a kinect
and we want the end user to leave with
an a feeling this this new car smell
feeling in their nostrils and we don't
really necessarily want them to stand up
there and go yeah i wanna know that was
fun i had a lot of fun but we wanted to
leave with the feeling this feeling of
ours that was new car smell right that
was something that was important to us
why we while we built this whereas with
the other one you know that the wii
pretty quickly identified that the big
challenge was to make that simulation
immersive and believable for the target
audience and the targeted audience was
pretty damn particular because they
spent their daily work lives on that
boat and we had to sort of convince them
that the virtual version was as you know
as real as the real version and as scary
so it for that project we actually send
our own graphic artists to the boat and
spend some hours there with the crew and
took about four thousand reference
pictures that we then spent the next two
years modeling about thirty percent of
the ferry based on that so it's it's
that was that was a lot more difficult
even though just in to some extent it
was more clear but what we wanted to
achieve in my triangle of needs
well in the bottom because most I mean
in the case if you can actually solve
what you want to solve in an efficient
way by showing a video then that's
probably a good idea it's probably a
smarter idea than making an application
and as I said the this the sufficiency
element is more important than the other
elements on top of that also the you
know the usability is to me less
important than the efficiency or well
it's also important but it can't
compromise the efficiency so any other
questions then there thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
