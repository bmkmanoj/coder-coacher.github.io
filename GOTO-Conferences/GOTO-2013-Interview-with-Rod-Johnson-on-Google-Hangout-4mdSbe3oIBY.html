with Rod Johnson the creator of the
spring framework and former CEO of
spring source Iran good to talk to good
to talk to you too how are you doing I'm
doing pretty well I went for a beautiful
run this morning weather in San
Francisco's fantastic yeah I'm feeling
pretty good excellent glad to hear now
since so as far as I mentioned your the
the former CEO of spring stores since
leaving springsource you've gotten
involved with a variety of different
companies and projects technologies in
etc one of those is neo4j what what's
your why are you involved with neo4j
what kind what's the landscape there
well I guess before I speak specifically
din ayo technology is probably good to
think about we'll talk about why I'm
involved with startups in the first
place and you know I certainly love the
idea of building something that we did
with springsource building a technology
I loved working with the team of
talented people and you know that's been
really big driver for me so I think with
neo technology the initial driver was
meeting at all actually I met an alert
um what would have these days been
called the go to the conference in
office a few years ago and I was just
really impressed by the guy I was really
impressed by the way that he thought
about databases as a whole lucky you
know seemed very very well aware of the
different technology choices that users
have and you know I think for me being
involved in just about any company I
have to believe them in technology and
also have to believe in the people and
then you know if there's something I can
do to hopefully help that's that's great
and it's usually a lot of fun I was
reading something the other day I was
talking about investment and at the
angel vs. the series a loved one it was
talking it was saying someone lines of
as long as you have an interesting
challenge and a team of dedicated people
that's basically enough for angel
investment but then once you get too
serious a then you want
I proving out the market etc so I guess
is is that does that agree with what
what you're thinking like what you do
are you doing angel investing or serial
CA or I've done a mixture of both I'm
probably more involved in companies that
are kind of series-a or / series a than
really really early stage angel
investments ah but you know I think it's
difficult to talk about today's software
investment climate because it's changed
a lot so there is a proliferation of
angels out there now and they're
actually seems to be a lot more angel
funding the available and say there was
when we started out with sprinkles
whether or not that's a good or bad
thing time will tell but certainly I
mean right now the funding environment
is fairly fairly positive for
entrepreneurs and also a really
interesting thing is the companies are
consuming less money in general and so
they would have ten years ago so you
know techniques for developing software
are more productive than they used to be
the cloud gives you an opportunity to
you know set up some service without
going and buying racks full of servers
so you know actually I think we'd both
the proliferation of angels and with the
fact that companies don't need to burn
money as fast it's actually a pretty
pretty interesting time for
entrepreneurs I think yet there is
potentially though a crunch where yes
there are definitely angel investors who
are less demanding the series a
investors and that can be a problem
because you know that can need to lead
to a nasty reality check when
entrepreneurs need to raise the next
round of financing so you know I think
as we've always known there are good VCS
and less good visas I think the same is
true with angels you know there are
highly sophisticated angels who provide
tremendous value to companies and there
are angels who are less sophisticated
and potentially you know set up
situations that aren't going to work
very well letter
interesting now you had mentioned that
that companies were doing basically we
were kind of able to do more with less
on the money front now is that because
the solid rubber band landscape has
changed through things like AWS being
available to reduce costs throughout the
clouds being able to reduce costs or
what what's your sense of that I think
it really depends on the nature of the
technology for example if you are doing
what neo technology is doing and
building a database that's not that much
different from so doing it can you spot
yo fundamentally you're wrestling with
some really difficult problems around
storage and algorithms and locking and
distribution so you know you're dealing
with things that are simply hard and
don't magically get easier but let's
imagine for example that you're
developing some kind of consumer facing
up unless you're dealing with insane
levels of volume like Facebook or
Twitter you have a range of technology
choices that are pretty productive these
days you don't have to go and buy racks
and racks of service you can very
cheaply start off with Amazon or Roku
yeah you might want to think about how
that cost adds up as you go down the
track but initially your setup cost is
going to be pretty significantly lower
and yeah I think I think that is
actually a very positive thing it's
interesting that you mentioned that one
of the one of the other projects
companies a ser that you've worked with
is elastic search and I know
elasticsearch is one that both from
anecdotal evidence and industry and also
from my own work it's really easy to get
going it's really easy to set up it's
very glad for injury it's just it just
seems to work really well and just
automatically scale on etc so it what
are the reasons that that you're working
with elastic search well a guy and I
think it comes down to belief in the
technology and the people like with
elastic search I've known shy for a
number of years I mean I think the guys
you know remarkable technologist he's
created a fantastic piece of software
a great community around it and Stephen
Sherman of course is the CEO was one of
the cofounders of spring sauce so you
know I Steven and I have been colleague
colleagues and friends for years so
elasticsearch was a pretty easy decision
also the lead investor is peter fenton
at benchmark who was our lead investor
and spring sauce and another person that
I love working with and have a lot of
respect for but yeah I think probably
the single biggest factor with elastic
search was the size of the community in
the rapidity with which the community is
growing it really is all the scale and
level of growth food is comparable in
fact I think slightly exceeds where we
were at with spring sauce and that's
that's unusual there simply aren't many
things that achieve that level of growth
and adoption in the open source
community and that just gives you a
tremendous opportunity to figure out how
you can add value to your users that
enables you to grow a really significant
business and I think you your point
actually about the fact that
elasticsearch is easy to use I think
that also reflects that change in the
world that I mentioned because obviously
elasticsearch is attractive to startups
and in a world where you can get going
more cost-effectively in terms of your
hardware utilization etc yes you're not
going to expect that you have the
project plan for installing win skier I
remember actually probably to show how
much the world had changed I was working
probably i think was 2000 @ ft.com which
at the time was one of the highest
volume web sites in Europe and we were
evaluating app servers IBM would not
give me the software they told me that
they'd have to send a consultant on site
to install lives yeah Wow we ended up on
weblogic and I got weblogic running you
know in half an hour
but you know I think that that back then
was obviously not considered that
strange admittedly I said well no thanks
please go away but clearly enough people
accepted that back then that they were
able to get away with it where is now
you know people are not going to have
the project plan for installing the
application server yeah back then people
did a lot of waterfowl software
development as well I mean they you know
had project plans for producing uml
diagrams for eventually producing coat
my favorite ever quote from any of my
work experiences probably 2,000 let 2002
and it was an architect to work for a
very large in national software
consultancy and I expressed concern that
there hadn't been any code deliveries in
the first mile step and of the project
was june six weeks and he said that
there are complete uml diagrams what do
you hope to see from running code you
can't see from your mail diagrams hope
man I how about running code I actually
laughed in the meeting I mean I guess it
was actually very great but I couldn't
help it it was like I mean how do you
react to that it's like wow yeah just
that's completely different mindset Wow
yes and actually perhaps unsurprisingly
they never wasn't he running code from
that consultancy on that project they
were parted before there was any code at
all actually another aspect thinking
back to 2000 I know that one of the
things that seemed to be a common
although certainly not good at that
point was I know one of the projects I
was working on it was emitting HTML from
the servlets with embedded JavaScript
which I mean the num levels of hurt
they're crazy now one of the other
things you work with is meteor Jas and
that's i'm assuming making web user
interface is just a little bit better
well I think it's a lot better and I
think that web interfaces are something
that really haven't been addressed world
by traditional technologies I mean if
you look at the technologies that have
been dominant building web interfaces
they're not very well adapted to a
modern world where there's all these
different devices users expected greater
rapidity of interaction they really
don't expect the old paradigm that you
make a request and you get a whole page
so if you look at the kind of things
that people do with Java or PHP or rails
it's all the same kind of model where
fundamentally it's geared towards a
request goes to the server and brings
back page and what they do is they you
know retrofit a bunch of JavaScript kind
of stuff that you know is not really
core to the model and they end up with
something very complex I mean I think
actually to be honest one of the better
jobs of retrofitting is what they've
done in spring MVC I think the more
recent work in spring MVC is actually
quite nice but nevertheless this is
still in the long term it's not a viable
solution in the long term you have to
rethink the way web interfaces work and
the fact that you know they're now about
different devices potentially concurrent
use of different devices and the old
notion of the pages know is just
meaningless and where I think meat-eor
really have a lot of potential is
firstly they unify the programming model
in terms of JavaScript on client and
server and secondly they really focus
directly on the data synchronization
challenge so how do you keep what is
happening on the client how do you push
out to the client the very easy way
without you know having to write a bunch
of kind of costume polling code or
whatever that's pretty unnatural
resting and typesafe is another one now
when I think of types if I also think of
the play framework and how they've got
similar ideas for how they're kind of
updating how web interactions happen and
there they're primarily Skala and
typesafe has a lot of scale what's
what's the what's the involvement
interest on type safely how do you see
that going I mean there are sent to be a
lot of interesting things that can come
of that I'm curious to hear to get your
thoughts on a big fan of scholar is a
programming language and I'm also a fan
of the actor model so in terms of what
akka does in more efficient and less
error-prone use of modern computer
resource so you know with typesafe I
guess the biggest driving factor was my
love of the scholar language and also
again the fact that I know people that I
mean mark brew or is someone that I
worked with for years at spring source
and I mean if you look good Martin and
Jonas and then you know they've got some
literally rock stars in terms of the
technology stack uh I think that skull
is a big part of the future of the JVM I
think it's I think it's a really really
nice language and I think it actually
provides some of the benefits that
people associate with dynamic languages
while retaining strong typing and I
think that's a very interesting benefit
now that kind of relates to another
question which is the future of job of
the language versus Java the platform so
what do you see what you see happening
there so in Java the language mean like
it was there's some pain trying to get
java 8 out the door because of language
features and there's been just talk of
back to the future how it's including
things like lambdas which have been in
other languages it essentially through
Jaine Bolton there's there's some
concern that I've heard anyways that
Java language might be starting to kind
of reach the end of its in the end of
its useful life or do you think that's
true and do you think that other
language like Skylar going to pick up
from there on the basis that is the JVM
and the api's nasarah that hadn't built
up over 20 years or what do you see
going on it's an interesting question i
think the jbean has a value that is
greater than the value of java and you
know it's a very very robust piece of
code it performs extremely well and yeah
i think that when people dismiss java
they often forget that so after example
you know with obviously the Ruby on
Rails crowd were very anti Java and the
fact is that in reality they have had
some very very high-profile failures of
people who had to get off their platform
and ended up on the JVM I'm not saying
that room is bad but I'm staying that
you know there is a core strength in
Java and the JVM the needs to be
understood and respected so having said
that is Java going away no I don't think
so I mean Java is currently roughly with
C equal most popular language I don't
see that changing dramatically anytime
soon but yes Java has probably picked I
mean we're yeah we're not going to see
the level of enthusiasm that we had
around on Jarvis 18 years ago and that's
probably good because it looked actually
like the industry was heading to a
monoculture where the solution to every
problem was jut I think we've actually
got a more rational balance now where
people are willing to look for the
languages and Toulon that are
appropriate to solve
particular problems so i think that java
quite possibly will be the last language
blockbuster I don't know that we'll see
another language like C or C++ or Java
that has gotten that massive lip level
of adoption I think instead we'll
probably see greater specialization I
think Java will probably go into a long
bit very slow decline and I think on the
JVM other languages most notably scholar
will start to take up some of the slack
I think the you know the JVM is going to
be a dominant technology in the
enterprise for many many years but I can
envision a greater percentage of those
applications over time gradually you
know moving more towards scholar and
introducing more scholar in place of job
and it's interesting you had mentioned
the JVM you mentioned Ruby now one of
the Ruby implementations which seems to
have gotten very popular as JRuby and
like with Charles neither and with Tom
and Abel and all the work that they put
into it it seems to everyone I can tell
that's becoming a very very popular ruby
implementation so that seems like an
interesting mix of here's a language
which has gotten some of the popularity
and yet you have the JVM which is this
solid really well proven piece of
software that's been around for a long
time now and you you get the two
together and that becomes I guess it's
involving ongoing platform yeah I think
it clearly the case to JRuby is really
important because it shows that you can
have a language that isn't java like
successfully on the JVM is platform and
there are numerous benefits in that one
benefit is that the JVM is pretty pretty
heavily optimized so there's a whole lot
of work that's been done around that but
another benefit is that generally
organizations don't want to put in more
runtimes so you know the if they have
the JVM they probably have the ability
to manage
that Joe van they have the tooling
around at monitoring etc and if you go
and put in a completely different
runtime that's actually something that
can be more problematic so there's
definitely a benefit in you know having
a fewer number over on times I mean I
think that one of the really really nice
things of the scholar is that the
interoperability with Java is so
amazingly good I mean it's no it's
similar to groovy it's in the sense that
you really can extend objects written in
Java you know you have a very nice and
natural way to interoperate between the
two languages obviously that gets more
difficult if you have a language that's
not java like and not strongly tired
mmhmm yeah when you stroke it into a a
real mismatch between the capabilities
of the two languages I imagine well I
guess you're partly looking at the
interoperability being in the JVM
through things like King to invite
dynamic rather than you know necessarily
more in terms of the actual language
model but I mean there's obviously still
a value in that so you mentioned you had
mentioned acker and with scholar with
the actor model and that seems like a
model which is far more intuitive and
far easier to debug from a concurrency
perspective so do you think that's going
to be one of the things that helps to
drive skala more is akka being i guess
most most at home in skala I mean
there's this java implementation which
seems most at home and scala and is that
going to help to drive the adoption of
Skala as we get more and more of these
multi-core thing basically as cpus
continue to scale out a number of course
as opposed to raw power I think the with
respect to acting yes it will help to
drive Scala but I think it's actually
frankly good thing for a current for the
java community in general the java right
will obviously be nicer to use akharin
than java 7 when you know you have some
functional support in the Java language
so I think yes
definitely of people fall in love with a
cur they're going to I think you're very
likely to look at Stella and similarly
people who are in love with scholar are
probably more likely to be aware of the
actor model and you know find that very
interesting but with Java rate the
ability of Java developers to benefit
from app from the actor model in a coup
will be greatly improved because it will
certainly it'll look more like using a
cur in Scala when it looks like using a
cur in Java 7 I mean I still don't think
that's going to cause people who are
like it's not going to cause people who
like scholar to switch to Java I mean I
think you know you're still still
looking at a pretty big gap there so one
of the other discussions that I've heard
coming up more and more frequent last
couple of years talking about kind of
like ongoing industry-changing tuning
practices i I've heard discussions about
how dependency injection is now in many
ways considered an anti-pattern I
because know what your thoughts are on
that I think obviously the applicability
of dependency injection varies between
different apps and different languages
so maybe if you start off with the
assumption that any technology is
universally applicable you're setting
yourself up for replying in ways that I
could look good however I think if you
look at the basic problems that
dependency injection souls like for
example externalizing certain concerns
like configuration from business logic
to enhance testability you know I I
think that has proven its value in many
many applications and i know i think
that's equally applicable today so one
of the one of the talks I saw you give
at kick on San Francisco 2011 was there
was a keynote say about things you wish
you would know now given that the
industry has changed so much since 2000
if you were at the point again where you
were
30 and writing a book and creating a
framework given what you know now what
would you do the same and what would be
different it's actually really difficult
to answer that question and 10 the
primary reason for that is that what I
did with spring and in my books really
came out of what i was doing every day
for many years so you know I think like
a lot of open source technologies have
came out of a painting or you know
scratching an itch so it's kind of to be
honest it's difficult to answer that
today because they don't spend all day
every day writing code and therefore my
assessment of the level of pain and how
to potentially improve the developers
experience you know i'm not i'm not in
the same place if that makes sense if i
were to distill it kind of sounds like
the advices find the thing that causes
you the most pain and solve it because
there's a good chance that a lot of
other people are experiencing the same
pain yeah I think I mean it really comes
down to a question of authenticity
particularly in the open source world
it's really hard to say hmm okay let's
have a look at scholar well let's have a
look at cloud computing and let's find
an opportunity for an open source
project and then we'll start a business
on I don't think it works like that I
think typically the things that really
resonate with developers are things that
come with a profound sense of
authenticity because people didn't just
say hey I want to create some open
source they said well this thing about
my job sucks I'm gonna fix it oh by the
way maybe other people like the way I
tried to fix it and I think you really
need to have that level of authenticity
actually I should I should kind of
phrase authenticity through suffering
and I trademark that city to suffering
that's the true meaning of open source
nice authenticity through suffering I
like it
hmm yeah I'm kind of skeptical about you
know sometimes you do encounter people
who've just seemed to be sitting around
thinking or what open source
opportunities can we create a business
around and yeah I think to me that feels
you know a bit a big fight hmm or like a
tee off discussed a technical co-founder
I have an idea and i'm looking for a
technical co-founder yes hmm this might
not work out for you yes ok at least I
is no it's the pitch in the iOS mock up
with so one of one of the things which
so springsource was acquired by VMware
and one of the big focuses that VMware
had after spring source was acquired was
cloud foundry and there's a lot of cloud
focus it seemed what are your thoughts
on how the cloud is changing software
development and does the term the cloud
even make have any real meaning anymore
given that it's been used to sell
everything from servers to breakfast
cereal yeah I honestly think the time
has come to get rid of cloud while i was
in terms of getting rid of terms i would
love to get rid of cloud and no SQL both
while we're at it because they're both
they're both misused and there's also so
much difference in some of the different
technologies they encompass that you
know using that word to lump it all
together as misleading yeah I think it's
gotten gotten totally ridiculous now
with respect to cloud computing I mean
what is not describing it self is cloud
computing anymore you know I'm surprised
that I've am actually decided to kill
off one two three I don't know whether
didn't call it one two three cloud
addition there's almost nothing that's
not cloud and with respect to the impact
on development though I don't think
we've reached the potential that we we
could have done and I frankly don't
think there's been a huge amount of unit
in a particularly in the pan space and I
think I think daddy's a beauteous I
think more more could be done another
question I have is what are you working
on now I I know the answer to one of
those is Scala because I'm seeing you
discussing that on where some of the
scale stuff that you've done Oh what are
you working on like what from the scalp
perspective what are you building are
the other things you're working on so
from a scallop perspective and really
writing code for my on a hobby project
basically one of the goals was to learns
go and that's something that I've found
very satisfying I think it's it's really
healthy to learn a different programming
language and I'm glad I chose scholar
because I think it's very nice one what
I'm actually doing is in the financial
space so I've always had interest in
algorithmic trading so it's completely
different from anything that I've done
in you know my previous career mmm
interesting and there's been a lot of
interesting stuff that's come out of the
financial space like I think of l max
and disrupter and some of the stuff that
they've done and how lot of those become
open stores it seems like that drives a
lot that drives a lot of work drives a
lot of innovation and now is turn to
drive open source stuff as well but l
max has been pushing a lot of their
stuff into open source and martin
Thompson as well as become Christmas can
walk there I think I think it's actually
interesting as an example of how open
sourced growers that there's been a
greater awareness in the financial
community that the competitive
differentiated doesn't lie in that kind
of infrastructure so you know it
actually makes sense to contribute and
hopefully get other people to contribute
to some of the shared infrastructure and
build competitive advantage for the
business on top of that so I think I
think we'll see more of that and I think
with the financial space one of the
reasons it does tend to drive
interesting things like this rough
the easy it's immensely
performance-critical so if you look for
example at a range of things that you
need to do say back-testing it really
doesn't matter how fast your software
runs it's got to go faster so for
example if you're building you know even
if you're building an incredibly high
volume consumer-facing business maybe
it's different if you tweet it but you
know if you're running a very very
successful business there it does
typically come a point in time where you
can say you know what this is fast
enough i'm looking to waste more time
trying to optimize it whereas the
financial space tends to be very
different and it's not even limited to
places like hft i mean obviously hft
latency is going to be an enormous issue
but even if you look at trading
strategies that are not using hft time
scales typically they need to be back
tested and they need to be back tested
with you know optimization of a very
wide choice of parameters and so
instantly you can you know look at tens
of thousands of back tests so I think
one of the reasons that it's been the
financials face has been a big consumer
of technology and one of the reasons
that it's now starting to generate some
interesting open source projects is that
it just has this pretty dramatic demand
for better performance hmm it's
interesting when you were talking about
that I was suddenly reminded of Nordica
I read very recently he was talking
about multi-variant equations that were
being solved using a d-wave quantum
computer and so where you have something
like a four hundred and four hundred
eighty four ninety qubit quantum
computer i was able to find optimal
solutions for a multi very and quadratic
in pretty much constant I'm was like
half a second and that yeah it's
interesting that that might be one of
the things that drives forward quantum
computing huh well I mean take for
example let's suppose you want to do
back testing a trading algorithm and you
want
to say run on every tick on say the
Russell 3000 probably looking at around
1500 ticks per second so you think about
the trading day every trading day 1500
ticks per second one in the market so
open you know 200 days a year for 20
years okay you might mean practice want
to go back 20 years that even if you
want it to go back say four or five
years the volume is incredible and
you're going to want to test even the
same algorithm you're going to want to
test it parameterised in different ways
so yes I would imagine that if quantum
commute computing becomes commercially
viable you will find that the finance
guys will be all over thank you tend to
be early adopters I mean we found in
particularly in the early years of
spring source most of our sales by
dollar value were in the finance base I
mean this was this was something that I
remember is he I gave me a bit of
concern in lake 2007 when things nearly
two thousand and eight when things
started to go wrong that I can get the
time about seventy percent of our
revenue came from the financial space
predominantly in London and New York and
we ultimately diversified very
successfully where we were you know
accessing a very broad range of
customers but it's interesting that here
the large banks and if it particularly
investment banks were amongst the
earliest large-scale adopters of spring
so they are willing to adopt technology
early because I think because what they
do tends to be very complex and because
they need to develop a very large amount
of code they really need to get the next
technology pretty soon so you know when
they see something that can lead to
productivity improvements for their
developers you know that is something
that gives them potentially more
immediate benefit than it gives to the
majority of organizations and it's
interesting because when i think of
banks or anything of financial
institutions they're usually this
typical example of where something moves
slowly and two-phase commit and
laborious processes and so it's
interesting to think of them as being
one of the drivers on the frontier on
the frontier of software development
well I think it really diff is between
banks restart retail and investment
banks are very very different
organizations and you know if you think
about for example what people are doing
in investment banks they're generally
open to you know new approaches they
typically actually want to avoid things
like two phase commit because they want
to you know try to have a simpler
architecture but yeah I mean they've
definitely some very talented people in
that space and fortunately they are
quite often allowed to do interesting
things because you know the business
knows that it has to be able to move
fast thank you very much thank you Ron</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
