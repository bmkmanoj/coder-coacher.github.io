I've got a couple of questions for you
guys
now I was going to ask you to raise your
hands but government these lights are
pretty bright and when I say to get a
bit more actor so first of all can you
stand up if you are working as a tech
leet or in a technical leadership
capacity just now Wow
okay if you've ever worked the tech lead
even if you're not doing that role just
know if you've ever worked as a tech
lead even if you're not doing it right
now
however if you would like to be a tech
lead there's a lot of people here we'll
get to that pattern okay yeah so yeah so
yeah so that's if you would like to be a
tech lead but everybody can keep sending
who was that before okay so a lot of the
population here so what we're going to
talk about today shouldn't be too
unfamiliar to most of you we're going to
talk about what a name some of the
patterns known to pack you take a scene
again myself
thanks that reading are separate some of
the patters and antipatterns and
technical leadership so first of all
I'll just like - okay first of all I'd
just like to introduce myself so my name
is Laura Patterson and I've been
delivering software for about 15 years
now endless I have always been
fascinated by the impact that technical
leadership can have on team and on the
cold and an architecture that comes
about and since I first started as a
Java developer about 15 years ago
actually there's a chance that my very
first ever tech we'd make some crew in
the audience but I won't ask you to a
color just in case and I promise none of
these that Pat antipatterns are about
you ok anyway so since I start is the
Java dev I have worked at Tech we've
done various industries various
technologies and some of the lessons
that I've learned in that time that I'm
looking forward to sharing with you
today and my name is Patrick qua
and I guess what's kind of interesting
maybe for some of you is I've also
recently sort of published a book which
Laura is actually inside
and it's a collection of stories about
technical leaders and one of the
interesting things is when you go on
this journey from being a developer to a
tech lead there's nobody really there
that's generally helping you on your way
you're sort of going from this world of
writing code and dealing with computers
to certainly having to deal with people
and you're forced into this position of
dealing with people and you're not
necessarily ready so what's interesting
about this some of the lessons that
we've learnt in sort of the stories that
we've sort of taught through and we're
going to share some of those things in a
sort of talk today okay so today we are
going to tell you a story we're going to
tell you a story that probably won't
seem that in common to many of you we're
going to tell you a story about a
developer a good developer who's been
known for doing things right so we'd
like to uh we've already introduced you
we'd like to introduce you to Hayden and
who's going to be our first time tech
lead so Hayden works for a company
called copper in pin nice and hipster
it's about a new media content company
and has been working there for the last
two or three years and like any sort of
sort of technical person he started his
life working as a developer and he
started on sort of the public website
side of copper and pin it's a growing
organization and so it's sort of getting
bigger and bigger and it's is if you can
imagine how media and sort of something
like quartz or something is growing
bigger and bigger they've had to split
some of this and he's moved away from
the sort of public website team to deal
with sort of content API so as the
organization is moving towards mobile
and tablet as you probably might sort of
relate to in your organization's he sort
of moved to this sort of back-end team
where he's supporting a lot of the
different content okay so it's been
doing a good job he's doing a position
for a while and all of a sudden today
you're a tech elite okay okay and so the
question is well actually before the
question let's introduce you to the team
that take that hidden is going to be
heading up fairly typical back-end
structure of T of a team here we've got
a business analyst who acts as the
conduit between business and the team
also a response for reporting and
tracking progress that kind of thing
we've got a QA who appears with the devs
on automated
we've got a grat who only joined a
couple of months ago so we're fairly new
to the team balls have got a senior day
of problem it seems like seniority is
ADA as hidden but he only joined the
team about six months ago and we also
have another two developers I be on the
team for a couple of years okay and now
what's the tech lead actually do well
this is what we're going to find tonight
I don't know
so for the first few weeks nothing much
changed
they continued yep they continued on at
mostly as they are so making
enhancements to the api's building at
some infrastructure for the monitoring
system fixing production issues and then
all of a sudden they got tapped on the
shoulder there's been a big product
management meeting and they wanted to
have a chat with the being hidden okay
so one of the key revenue generators for
copper and pin is getting premium
account signups and the product managers
had done some user testing and realized
that if they added a social media
element to their to their offering
they'd be able to increase the signups
by 20% however this was going to require
two new AP is for the content API team
to create and they wanted to launch it
and to coincide with Fashion Week which
was only two months away so finally
something for him to get his TV teeth
into quite exciting okay so Hayden's got
lots of ideas he's absolutely brimming
with them he's got some new things that
you wants to try with how to design API
eyes he's got a couple new libraries
he's looking to take looking to check
out so it goes into his daily tech card
only speaks Latinos like hey guys I've
got these ideas then what do you think
and they've got a couple of questions
and a couple of concerns but to be
honest he's kind of only got two months
we're just going to go with this this is
my decision so now that it's kind of
told the team what they're going to be
doing it's right we better get on we
better get started on decoding but it's
not quite convinced that the team really
get all of these new ideas fully so we
decided to roll this for this work I
know what I'm doing with it I better
take onto myself so it picks up more and
more work it cuts away it doesn't let
the team in they're kind of stuck doing
the plumbing code yeah as long as hours
get longer and longer
so they managed to actually deliver this
API but Hayden is sort of feeling burnt
out has been working really hard as the
lead has felt really responsible about
taking care of the solution and
investing himself in this and they sort
of take a breakpoint and he's in this
sort of Tea Room making himself a cup of
tea and in this sort of Tea Room he
comes into touch with a sort of old
colleague of his called Bobby
now Bobby is actually a seasoned sort of
technical person in the organisation so
where Bobby we're sort of Haydon sits in
the sort of content API team Bobby is
actually sitting within the architecture
girl team and she's overseeing quite a
number of different sort of products and
what her what sort of her background is
is that she worked with Hayden when he
was working on the public fronting
website but she's been with copper and
PN for a lot longer so she's been
leading for the solution architecture
for a very long time and she has some
things to say in terms of giving some
wisdom to Hayden so they sit down and
they sort of talk through some of the
different things because they worked
together and have a really good
relationship and they have very similar
interests in sorta API design and she
wants to see Hayden get a lot better now
if you've been in a situation like this
it's really nice to actually talk to
somebody who's been through some of this
before and it's very rare you get this
kind of opportunity so Bobby asks Hayden
you know can we have a bit of a chat and
you know there's some things that she's
noticed about the way that he's been
leading his team that she'd like to give
back to him so he's not quite sure where
this is gonna lead to feedback but you
know we're gonna try it anyway so she
starts talking through some of the
things that she was actually gonna talk
through and she talks through the things
you know you've been working really long
hours I know that you're a really
dedicated person who wants to solve the
right technical solution and the way
that you seem to be doing this is by
collecting all the sort of decision
points and deciding to make the the
solutions yourself and this is kind of
one of the things as a tech lead you're
kind of feeling maybe this is the right
thing to do because you've been given
this position of authority and you want
to sort of take care of that there was a
discussion in the team that she
overheard and there was an argument
where one of the developers want to have
a particular JSON structure in their
taxonomy structure and one of the things
that Hayden wanted to do was actually
override that and say well this is the
way that we're actually going to do
things
and she was kind of talking about how
this transition is really hard and it
seems like you're taking all of this
work so the questioner she said I asked
him is what are you developers thinking
and feeling so you yourself have your
own sort of ideas what is it that your
team that you're there to lead how are
they actually feeling hmm so let's go
back and look and see what's happened to
our team of happy smiley faces that we
started with just a few slides back so
you can see up in our top corner here
we've got our senior death now he was
the one that was proposed in the Jason
structure and he was kind of shot down
on it he was also a bit annoyed about
the fact that he hadn't been listening
to need to read some of his initial
concerns so he's a bit demoralized and
he's basically spending half of his time
on Hacker News I've got the dev and the
QA over here the Curie's actually gone
ahead and implemented our BDD framework
this devs not happy about they've been
having a bit of an argument about it
so the curia guys quite happy however
the dev not so much we've got the grads
who's obviously quite junior and one of
the more junior devs there in the bottom
two looking quite getting the thing here
but they've been doing quite a lot of
gold plating and in fact we're working
on some of the plumbing cords they've
not been able to push it through to
completion because they've been doing
all this addition of gold plating there
is actually the Judas tree factored in
the first place so that's what the
team's looking like just now not quite
so happy
so let's take a quick the light step out
with narrative for a second and let's
look at some of the labels some of the
ante patterns that we've pulled out from
heedless behavior the mall so this is
the one that's characterized by the
heads-down coding that we solve in
hidden first got in it's it's focusing
on your own contribution rather than
focus on the team's contribution and the
idea that you just have to keep on
delivering in the same way that you did
before you're a midtech cleat and the
lack of realization that you're actually
your team's deliveries the thing that
becomes important rather than your own
contribution once you're into that
position you become so engrossed in you
and delivery that you actually feel to
see the big picture and you feel to put
your head up for this and to see what
heard the rest of the team are doing and
in the meantime the team are working
with their leadership so things like
tensions can go unnoticed and get more
damaging you might miss opportunities
renovation for refactoring for
improvement and you may also find the
coroner's beam cutting quality the
dictator so this was when he leaves that
no law no I appreciate your concerns but
this is where we're going to be doing it
or actually probably not even
appreciating this is just the real
you're going to be doing it so the
dictator wants to make all the decisions
for themselves and is either going to
not listen not ask or just completely
override anything that said it's in
opposition to him the team becomes very
motivated as they feel that they don't
have any hand in shaping the solution or
shaping the codebase and in that well
alongside this who else is the tech lead
it's tempting especially the new tech
lead it's tempting to want to make all
the decisions yourself by not evolving
the team you actually as well as
damaging the morale you're actually
missing out on the opportunity to add
the ideas and the knowledge from the
rest of your team into the codebase
final one I'm going to talk about in
this section is the hero now I think
this is a fairly common community
pattern I've seen it in a quite a number
of different places and it can manifest
itself in a few different ways so you
either have the hero who wants to do all
of the interesting or maybe the
high-profile work themselves it could be
the person who's working all the errors
and picking up every single production
issue
could be the person who has the key not
so all the knowledge of all the key
areas so this become the parish that
people have to go to there also will
struggle to delegate the common symptom
of this pattern so again okay and
similar to the more pulse you might get
some personal satisfaction if we're
enacting some of these behaviors it does
it does come the damage to the team who
become bored and become demoralized
you also have risk of burnout like Pat
mentioned and you as I said before you
have you become the single point of
failure in case something goes wrong in
that area so let's go back to copper and
pin so havens done his sort of first
term they've delivered the API and but
the question is at what cost
and his reflecting on some of the things
that Bobbie mentioned to him and he's
thinking about what are the things that
I might do differently in my role as
being a tech lead and he's thinking well
I should definitely commit to actually
doing something differently so he's
going to try a few things which means
he's going to try to avoid the mole and
being a dictator and being the hero in
taking all of that okay so yeah so first
of all I didn't cut too much I need to
look up from the court I need to see the
bigger picture it's one of his first
lessons I need to leave the team to make
their own decisions you picked off he
took on the feedback the Bobbie had
given him that he was over writing him
too much
so his lesson is taken from that is I'm
gonna leave them to do it and for
themselves and I need to give everybody
a chance to work on interesting work so
that kind of goes alongside the previous
one I'm going to give people a chance to
work on these areas so the API delivery
was successful and he's going to commit
to actually trying to give the team a
bit more space and in this phase of the
project the sort of API delivery has
been successful the user base is growing
and it's starting to actually cause a
few problems on some of the content API
so mobile growth is going tablet growth
is is continuing to skyrocket and
they're starting to get into new markets
and one of the things about new markets
is that there's new traffic on their
website and this is bringing in some
performance problems but this is the
challenge that Haydn has for his team
about
and to sort of look at their sort of
performance problem and he's going to
ask them to sort of fix the the problem
themselves so rather than sort of take
an ownership himself his give his giving
them some space to actually do that
based on the current rate they're
expecting in about three weeks time this
is where performance problems going to
become the critical point but his
confident his team can actually take
care of it and so he's signed up to go
to a conference and he's decided to
leave his team to it and say you guys I
trust you all and you're gonna solve the
performance problem so he goes away to a
conference and at this conference he
kind of comes across the sort of tech
radar and he hears about different
things to sort of try adopt assess and
try and to perhaps put in hold and
there's some interesting things like you
go to a conference you hear about
interesting things and one of the things
he hears about at this conference was
the idea of about performance testing as
a first-class citizen and he goes this
is completely related to the problem
that we have and he sort of comes back
to his team really excited and tells the
team I know that you guys are solving
the problem but we're gonna do
performance test driven development so
regardless of what you're doing we're
gonna actually write a performance test
we're going to make it fail and then
we're going to drive out all of our code
solution through all of this I know that
you guys are using our tools but you
know I saw this really cool tool called
loadrunner and you're going to use this
tool for our performance testing and
this is how we're gonna actually do it
there's a lot of chaos in the team and
there's a lot of frustration because
they've been looking at this performance
problem and one of the frustrations is
that they've already been using jmeter
for such a long time they're really
happy with the way that they can
actually automate tests with it and
they're being asked to learn a new tool
called loadrunner which is proprietary
and they've had troubles adopting this
so some of the team have been trying to
look at how they actually use loadrunner
effectively the other team was still
actually trying to diagnose what the
performance test problem is and other
parts of the team are actually trying to
work out what does it mean to do
performance test driven development
fortunately one of the developers
stumbles across the core issue in this
sort of phase and finds out it's a
sluggish SQL query isn't it always and
they managed to actually fix this sort
of problem but in the process
you know there's been a lot of
frustration so that they deploy a fix
and the performance skyrockets and
they're all pretty happy with the sort
of phase so Hayden goes back to his sort
of Tea Room break and Bobby comes along
again and sort of asked him how it's
going and he goes I'm really proud you
know the team has been picking up this
performance problem they've solved it
themselves and she has a few other
things to perhaps feed back to him so
while he was at the conference he was
Bobby was talking to Hayden's team and
then also talking to Aiden's team when
he got back and found there was a bit of
a discrepancy and so she has a few
things to sort of feed back to him such
as you know the imposing of a tool
although the team had already picked a
tool that they Derek chosen and then
sort of coming back and telling people
to do a completely different approach
which seems really out of context for
what the team was actually solving oh it
was kind of Hayden's response so let's
take a look at what's really going on
and the team and just now so not so many
happy faces I'm not sure Hayden's got
one at all either at the moment after
his chat with Bobby
so everybody's feeling a bit demoralized
like Pat said they've had their initial
choices overridden the work that they
proceeded they put in their joy that we
got from actually movement moving
forward with their own solution
basically been wiped out by Hayden's
decision to impose his own choices after
the after the effect the tensions
between the Kure in the dev they've kind
of got to hostility rates now it's a
soul getting a little bit touchy there's
an uncomfortable atmosphere across most
of the team room the dev stopped looking
in happier news which is kind of a good
thing but unfortunately is updating his
CV which is a bad thing so yeah he was
he was taking elitist hidden was out of
the over the office so he's just feeling
completely done with this the BA is also
utterly stressed because well as the
website had grown a whole she was having
to deal with marketing the sales every
single day on the doorstep isin has been
done why's this happening so the team
kind of broken down completely at this
point so again let's pop back out from
the narrative and have a look at their
anti-patterns it we can see
this in this section of the story so the
first one probably not so unknown to
most of you ivory tower or ivory tower
architect now this is obviously the the
hidden story this is where he comes back
from the from the conference and tells
the team to suddenly start doing
something completely different
so everybody who stood up would I ask my
first question just just the entity clue
so the problem with this is that the
team gets demoralized as I said that
already
sorry sorry wasn't a piece of it oh yeah
so what the biggest issue was the ivory
tower is the fact that it doesn't have
the context in order to be able to make
the decisions so if when hidden had
stepped out from the team for that
period of time perhaps the solution that
may have worked when he left the team is
no longer the solution it when you come
back so it's not enough to just to have
known the team in the first place you
also have to keep on checking of the
team making sure that this thing is
going to work now they're better in
Hayden's particular example and what he
missed was a the progress that we made
of the existing tools but it also failed
to appreciate the investment that people
had put in which is why the team brought
down so badly
the next antipattern we're going to look
at in fact the last antipattern we're
going to look at is that of the outsider
so their cider is very hidden had come
back
he dropped his performances test-driven
development bombshell onto the team and
then he disappeared and you're leaving a
team without guidance you're separate
from the team you don't have any hands
in the court any am and he's getting the
game really and the team is basically
left that leadership yet again so this
is this is I think of all the patterns
is probably the one for me is the
biggest danger to cut quality into
architectural integrity because at this
point the team is are making their own
decisions they don't have any guidance
there's not necessarily any big pool
that the individual decisions together
to help actually create a cohesive whole
attack leave can't really understand the
problems are happening in the team or
the drivers that are driving the team
unless they're actually part of the team
okay so let's go back from the
anti-patterns back into the story and
see what's actually going on so Haven
works out that in his sort of first
phase he was maybe two heads down in the
code and he was taking care of
everything making all the decisions in
the sort of second phase he kind of sort
of had a very outsider approach and he
decided to have decisions but not
necessarily in the right context for the
team and he tried to give the team some
space but he may be accepted with a
little bit too far away from that and so
with bobbies feedback he worked out that
he needed to do things differently again
okay so now we're getting and the good
stuff I need to be there for the tea I'm
sorry I need to get to know the team now
Hayden decides on the basis of this
feedback that he needs to actually
understand the team better and also just
to be with them more and there's various
ways that you can do that so one of them
is actually just to be available so you
know you can't be disappearing off all
the time you actually have to be there
another thing is if somebody comes
through the question it's important to
drop to make space and what you're
currently doing to actually answer that
question rather than again it comes back
to individual contribution well unless
they're like oh wait a minute why I'm
doing is too important you need to come
back tomorrow or next week or something
like that once once or another good way
of getting to know the team but the
probably the single most effective way
to get to know the team is actually to
get in there and be writing code with
them pairing with them every day the
next lesson that Hayden's going to take
back to the team back to his team is
that around encouraging to be
encouraging technical debate now this is
one of my own personal personal
favorites because technical debate in a
team that encourages innovation it's an
opportunity for everybody to share their
knowledge but it also really engages the
team and the decisions that they make to
take clamp to take their product forward
one well sort of three rules to debating
as a tech leader I that out Jota the
first one is ask questions and really
listen to the answers hold back on
presenting your own opinion until you've
ensured that everybody else has an
opportunity to speak because as tech
weeds you can know sometimes comes the
sort of any authority which may prevent
other people seeing something that is
called
three two what they wanted to see but
maybe what they wanted to see it was
important and finally don't go into a
debate with your opinions fixed you
going to to be prepared to change your
mind and the last lesson that Aaron's
going to take and take forward now is
that as fearing knowledge so I already
mentioned you can share knowledge during
technical debate you can also share
knowledge and a day-to-day basis with
pairing panel and convention before but
the other way is about journeys so
whenever Hayden's talking about our
ethically sorry is talking about a
technical decision needs to be made
perhaps arose a time for you has to say
hey guys I appreciate your opinions
however there's a reason why I'm
suggesting this it's important to take
the team on that journey so that they
truly understand the reasons why the
rationale behind and they'll then learn
from that as well so not only will they
be bought into the solution but they'll
also be learning from your premier
solution as well okay so we're gonna
sort of close off this parable and one
of the things that Hayden has found when
he reaches this sort of point of
enlightenment is that his found balance
being a tech lead so he's found a way of
still staying in the code but not being
too far removed and he's been helped
along the way with getting some feedback
from Bobby and understanding what is the
team state and for you here I challenge
you to sort of think about what is the
state of your team as well and what you
can take away in terms of getting that
feedback around tuning yourself as a
tech lead am i spending enough time in
the code am I giving them enough space
to make the decisions and am I sort of
still keeping an overriding sort of
guidance of where they're going as a
sort of group and keeping them all
aligned so going to step back from this
and have a look at some of the learnings
that we have so we've sort of covered a
lot of the different anti patents and do
you wanna oh sorry
yes yes so what we've covered off is
actually some of the antipatterns that
first time leaves are likely not
definitely but are likely to fall into
I'll beat with the very best intentions
it's not that people are going out their
way to do things and they're not quite
positive way so just to quickly recap
through that we've got them all who's
the head down could are we've got the
hero who takes all the interesting work
is putting in all the hours
we've got the dictator who wants to make
all the decisions the ivory tower
who's making all the decisions but or
making some of the decisions but from a
very high vantage point without
necessarily seeing the detail of what
lies beneath
and finally the outsider you'll leave
the team alone without guidance to
muddle on as best they can but there are
a lot of things that we can say to avoid
doing but maybe what's more interesting
for all of you here is also what are the
things you can do to focus on being
effective as a tech lead and this is
where we're going to talk a little bit
more about the patterns so we're going
to introduce a set of things where these
are some of the good behaviors that
would see in tech leads who are being
effective or they're doing I think what
Laura was talking about before was the
first one about being a teacher so one
thing about being a tech lead is that
you have authority in your sort of role
and one of the things is that we can
often innately in abuse this authority
and meaningfully but one of the things
that we want to do is as a teacher is
actually ask questions and get people
thinking about the whys so we have a lot
of experience in our sort of roles being
architects or tech leads and we have an
opportunity to sort of amplify and grow
the people on our team so that they're
also capable of doing things we're
probably not going to be a tech lead in
this team forever and so one of the sort
of responsible things we can do is
actually grow the skills in our team to
the same level that we're doing things
it helps us sort of prevent the hero
anti-pattern whereas if we have more
than one person who is capable of doing
some sort of skill then it means that
not we're not dependent on that single
sort of person for taking care of that
and as a tech lead you'll always
struggle if you're the person who is
taking care of that because you'll want
some time to go back into the code so we
can sort of use the tech lead the
teacher pattern so it sort of grows
skills in the team so that everyone can
sort of contribute and that you have a
little bit more time to actually work in
the code as well the next pattern is
really around sort of coaching and this
is an explicit sort of stance that
you'll want to take us as a tech lead
because part of it is about the growing
and understanding the people in your
team so Laura talked about using
one-on-ones
to get to know your team a little bit
better and in your one to one sessions
you can actually focus on sort of
coaching skills so there's a model
called groan which is around helping
people establish sort of goals working
out what the reality
of the situation are finding options of
how they might achieve their goals and
then helping work with each person to
work out a ways so that's the W of grow
of how you might actually get to your
goal given your current sort of reality
in your options and this is something
that Aztec needs we should be sort of
sitting down with each person in our
team and saying what is your goal
some people will you know maybe you want
to move in direction of sort of
front-end development and sort of
JavaScript other people may want to get
better at sort of database development
and more sort of infrastructure related
things so docker and and sort of
continuous deployment sort of tools and
unless we actually sit down to us people
about what's their situation and what's
their goals we won't ever really get
there and so this is a sort of stance
that we can take to sort of help our
sort of team and as a team actually
benefit from that as well so as people
are growing they can also contribute
those skills back in to help us solve
those problems that will come along as
the team sort of progresses the third
pattern is really around a bridge and
these are one of the tensions that
you'll probably have as a tech lead
which is the connection between the
technical world and all the things that
pull you away from the technical world
which will be the people side in terms
of your team that you're working with
but also the business constraints so in
our sort of parable there was the
demands and sort of marketing and if
you've been in this role you'll know
yourself you get dragged away into
planning meetings and sort of talking
about what new initiatives that what new
innovations a business would like to
have and therefore what sort of capacity
and how do we achieve that from a
technical perspective and this is where
as a sort of tech lead we're trying to
balance out these things and one of the
great ways of achieving this sort of
bridge pattern is really trying to
involve other people in these tasks so
that you can also not necessarily depend
on yourself so one of my favorite sort
of practices uses part of this passion
is an idea that comes out of feature
driven development and it's the idea of
feature leads so you have people that
are sort of dedicated to focus on one
area and you work with them so that they
have ownership of that sort of area and
they may need a little bit of assistance
and so this is where you're starting to
delegate some of those things but you're
acting between them and the business
conduit and you can sort of work as this
bridge it's also bridge not
necessarily just the business problem
but also what things people are
interested in developing and giving them
those opportunities so this is a really
powerful sort of passion that I think
Tech leads should take I think the other
side of this is the flip side so a
bridge isn't necessarily the one-way
street from business into the technical
team but actually it's the other way
around as well
so it's a two-way bridge so we want to
make sure that our team has enough time
so that they have time to learn so if we
don't sort of champion for time to
either spend learning or innovating or
playing around with new tools that we
might use where do we find that time who
is going to champion for that and this
is where us as tech leads can use this
bridge pattern to also talk about what
are the benefits of if we spend time
learning how we might use that in our
new products going forward so this is a
two-way bridge the next partner is
really about vision and unlike sort of
the ivory tower architect who's
dictating from above I like to think of
the champion of being within the team
but leading the way forward and I think
this pattern is really about helping
people in your team understand what's
the direction in which we're heading in
what's the key problem that we're
working as a group to actually achieve
and not necessarily dictating the
solution but really clearly articulating
what is the vision that we're trying to
actually deliver in this progress you'll
have lots of people who have different
opinions about what that is and one of
the skills that you need to have playing
this pattern is really about that
resolving conflict within the team so
where do we spend the time what
solutions do we end up picking and we
sort of sort of commit to once we've
sort of asked people about what things
that they would like to actually try and
I guess also making sure that the goal
is a noble goal so it's not just that
we're achieving something because we
want to play around with it for a
technology's sake but we're trying to
align the interests from the business
side what works for the team and what
we're responsibly able to deliver from a
technical solution and so this pattern
is a really powerful pattern for making
sure that your team has that consistent
way of sort of moving forward the final
pattern no sorry the sort of fifth
pattern is around being a team member
and this is kind of the color II to the
outsider so one of the things about
being a tech lead is sometimes you have
to do the dirty work
and in this case it's actually a really
powerful thing because your team will
respect you a lot more for it if you
start to take all the interesting
challenging problems like Hayden did in
some of this story you'll find that the
rest of your team will get demotivated
they'll sort of say why am I here if I'm
not here to solve interesting problems
if you keep taking all the interesting
problems on the other side to it is that
as a tech lead your time will be split
in lots of different directions and if
you take all these complex problems your
flow will probably be interrupted a lot
more all the time
anyway and so actually by being able to
pick up some of the other tasks you get
a good sense of what the codebase is how
easy some of that stuff is where there
are opportunities to maybe automate or
or make things better and that makes
everyone on the team's life a little bit
better and I think this is really about
that reporting so I think if you can't
really lead a team unless you have if
you don't have that respect from the
team I think if you could demonstrate
your commitment to the team by doing the
same things that they do you become a
lot more respected from the team and
that wins you a lot of sort of brownie
points and the final pattern that we
want to talk about is not really a
pattern that Hayden was playing but it
was actually the pattern that Bobbie was
playing and this is about that mentor
relationship and it's something that we
probably don't really talk enough about
in our sort of sort of technical field
and one of the things about you of being
a tech lead is that it's a bit of a
lonely role it's just you and then they
have the rest of the team and you'll
have concerns about am I getting the
right balance between technical and
non-technical times right are we
spending enough time and improving the
codebase or working on delivering
features as well and there's a lot of
things that it'll be very challenging
for you to share with the rest of your
team and this is where you want to
actually find a mentor and so this is
where other tech leads and other teams
or other experience people so like a
like Bobbie was and the architecture
guild can drop in and actually can
bounce ideas off and sort of talk about
how do you improve yourself as a tech
lead and and help you on your journey
okay
so we've talked about various patterns
and anti patterns and there's many many
more these are just things that we can
start to show the behaviors that we can
try to look out for and behaviors that
we can try to incorporate to
counterbalance those behaviors that from
the outset a pattern an anti pattern can
often be at either sides of the scale
like we mentioned before so you've got
the outsider at one side and you've got
the team member at the other now when
you're talking about these patterns it
can quite quickly you can actually go
from one side of the scale to the other
so for instance you can go from being
outside to being a team member and then
potentially you might go to being them
all at the other side of that so there's
a lot when we're looking at these
patterns it's about working out what the
balances between the patterns and anti
patterns in order to help you succeed
and if you're wondering what happened to
sort of people at copper and pin we have
a bit of an epilogue for you
so Bobby who is this sort of architect
and who had helped Hayden on his journey
had been with the company for over eight
years and she decided to end up going
and starting her own startup Hayden had
mastered his sort of finding balances
being a tech lead and he was actually
asked to join the architecture guild and
sort of step outside of the content API
team but what this kind of meant was
that there was a bit of a gap in the
content API team for a tech lead and as
a result we have a new player in that in
this sort of story Jesse who steps into
the role of Hayden being the tech lead
and Hayden acting as the mentor for
Jesse thank you
