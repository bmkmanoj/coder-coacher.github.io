the Platinum so looking at a react
lettuce so lurid spark which is a
relative the common stock these days
free minute reductions of Who I am so
when its brightness with passion
technologies flight services engineer do
not just look at two years so doing that
role is or giving you a very it's mean
it's a behind I Aaronic in terms of
looking at how people guilty of John
occasions and you know I only reached a
certain level of scale of my own efforts
and I can see how people do it on a
really big scale back binary temple on
twitter and github so various
repositories if they're mostly
repositories that are formed of where to
changes put a couple of my own as well
correct so what we're looking at is a
middle viable product so I mean this is
kind of ideologically correct up to the
moment and then the comparative excuse
never refactoring the code so you start
watching out it written in PHP or shell
script apparel or whatever it is you
solve problems as they arise to
typically demands menu features limited
resources too many you get to the point
where you can scale and use more
scalable solution usually incrementally
you just post a bond as you go
okay so take the example of something
like best buy one of our customers
humongously large one of the top 10 in
10 retails kind of similar to our boss
the US version of that I don't you see
at some point in the past he must have
started out as a tiny little web store
before they threw or reject last night
meant venture capital so we take a look
at kind of the evolution of a site like
this and how to go from something which
is quite small to something that
ultimately serves hundreds of millions
of customers property currently perhaps
I'll be an exaggeration ok so we've all
written these who has ever written a web
store here in this room what what what i
have here looking ones in this room
started the courage but is it is it a
programmer audience or what kind of
split is there here who used who writes
cut ok I oh what do the other people did
you x ops
is UX when you xk and everyone else
development it's acceptable as you who
here is ever heard of react now have you
have you used it now a little a work in
the case of those Abused it would it be
used important just on your own laptop
messing around seven day this database
in seven weeks no you haven't who has
good fair enough okay we'll get to what
react is a little bit later at a
presentation just good because it makes
that the content which I'm going to
share more interesting start to the
point of them nothing okay so so
basically looking at this example it's
pretty straightforward you could written
in PHP Django remember Al's agenda or
whatever the million ways is if you want
to use social distorted imagine cooking
a really ugly way of doing this is to
store the user sessions into a
relational database as well as the
modified it's a great way to go to not
to scale and in this case the card is
mutated ripped database so what you
might do is you might have a certain
amount of infantry for a given item you
put it into the shopping cart you send a
right to the database transaction say we
started out with 100 items now
somebody's put it into a Carson is 99
items available and at some point in the
future to abandon your abandoned carts
the time out the exact logic for doing
that would probably be a big old see in
query an order to return to the
battery so it's similar to perhaps if
you are ticketing sirs them or if you're
reserving seats and cinema or something
like that have you ever is rid of that
type of code do not as only is this
implementation but everyone's bulletin
speeding creating something like that
it's on Stranger so dinner / a system is
there's two outcomes one is failure in
which case we don't need to write any
more code and you can move on to the
next job in a project or whatever and
the other in the other consequence will
be success and success is double-edged
sword makes plans toward makes more
money attract more venture capital and
your system slows down you have to look
for ways to speed up okay so scale is
not a couple of years ago to scale
something that happened you're hugely
successful but these days a lot of
companies are generating a process a lot
of data well there's still in a very
small size startup size so for example
tomato rh company they may be based in
dublin if not nobody's perfect they've
they've created a smart be revises the
idea is to to reduce the maintenance
costs of other repairs and stuff like
that so that's the core business model
you go millions of users 10 million
meters into you have very small dev ops
teams it's about four people for each
meter that they got for traditional
meter you've got maybe four day 25
points per years you know automated
readings and whatnot oh there's 35
pounds of data points and years measure
more time today it is this a very common
use case which many companies doing this
type of stuff but what's notable is not
collected as many companies but there's
many small companies doing it and there
are limited resources okay that all make
sense it's broadly true or anything
highly contentious i might have said
okay so more users or more data equals
are slowly performance so the typical
thing that you do I've done it before
continue with your job developer that eh
cash terracotta there's a bunch of
products around that's based and you
will never use hibernate or a jpa okay
so it's easy to hook into those type of
API using object relational marker
plugin and cash into it how easy did you
find to use the hibernate cash you
through the JK catchment systems to
configure it dilkash know that
everything
yeah so so good two scenarios you at
this point okay because a recent update
is not cached the caching there there's
different ways to skin this particular
cut you can read from the database
yourself and manually populate some kind
of cash some people refer to its cash
norming no longer contact with those
people you need tax validation logic so
you pull data into cash and the data
underneath is mutated so you have to
write up to poke or something like that
is difficult right hook in a relational
database unless it's Microsoft sequel
which goes out does something not
necessarily a good thing I and it
instead starting to get a little bit
more troublesome ok so then at that
point uh so he said well we've got our
webstore that's great everything now we
need to support our mobile clients so it
stage you'll reach for some oj s or
something like that boo Python depending
on how you've already dated and you
write yourself a little micro service
typically for you just use a huge
application server it's up to you so
this stage you go to demand are you
supporting not only web client and the
mobile client it increased the
complexity somewhat how do you
coordinate caches I mean you go to
microservice here and Mike reservist
here the bone using some kind of caching
mechanism being in family or whatever
and go to relational database do you
write an API layer on top of the caching
system to ensure this consistent it's
pretty unlikely because human nature
being what it is rather than refactoring
that products the sport something like
that you're probably just writing
service running fear from the existing
code it's it's entirely possible and
right box was still an issue
okay submitted at this point something
comes along and they say we would like
you to make the data search I've
implemented this myself in the past back
to hibernate days there was some
integration to hibernate loose and loose
and the gosh Solar solar b'gosh
elasticsearch it some idea where endure
that is and it's kind of tricky of
sometimes writes fail sometimes indexes
aren't generated concurrency can be an
issue as well but it is something that
you know proper diligence and attention
you can you can you can implement this
okay but it's not it's not the easiest
thing to implement well I mean in the
scale of problems here being the hardest
problems and hearing the easiest
problems it's you know it's not a
therapist it's time-consuming
nonetheless okay so it could take
several weeks to implement this feature
depending I mean depending I mean it's
entirely possible you guys just like
codifies for me
highly possible ok so this point we're
at the stage of growing pants we start
to entertain and there are some kind of
indications so they get a nasty rash
around your neck I'd say this could be a
symptom of disease and their symptoms
for this kind of situation as well you
start reaching for a sequel profiling
tools my sequel I'm not sure heard that
where they're out at the moment but you
know you can get some some reasonable
results there obviously if you've got a
large budget and you know you like a GUI
microsoft see conservative quite some
very nice functionality there for a
query profiling don't use microsoft
myself but it looks good the searches
are separated maybe runs as a standalone
service populated so you have to develop
some kind of system for every time the
data is updating the database new
products are outta dere or perhaps
you've got a series of comments which
are added after each product index or a
product listening but that that data is
indexed as well so we want to make it
searchable but that's not the easiest
thing in the world to do with over
previously experienced working with
Sphinx which is kind of a sequence plus
GPL equivalent to solving I spent a lot
of time creating those indexes building
up the incremental indexes building up
the long-term indexes merging them
thread sometimes you would fail or
quadrature rules in the index
daisya solution then is active again and
you kind of get into the stage as well
where there will be some kind of queries
in your system perhaps the query that
populates the index and you never want
to run that query ok that sound familiar
anyone ever reach that kind of plateaued
level of sophistication in the product
do you never built anything this
complicated now no this is it yeah Corsi
oh alright so this stage to the kind of
feature part of 10 years so it's the
situation where in addition to all this
kind of stuff you've also got to deal
with scale and availability so you know
debate server crashes or you have some
kind of problem to network switch or
somebody is connected maybe some
BitTorrent clients do never a good kind
of irresponsible administrator behavior
that I've never seen heard about friends
and friends you started come to deal
with scale and availability so fast
requests consistent level of latency so
that not only hear you've got a high
throughput of requests but also that
individual questions time so you know
it's no it's no good having like a five
milliseconds response and every once a
while it takes 30 seconds to return
something to a client
not good so I'm going to show you a
couple of reasons why we act would be
good choice for the course of our home
and you can kind of decide for yourself
it sounds same so what is we are we have
new generation of database relatively
new no sequel movement as it's being
around for a little while now it's going
to master this architecture which ever
you know that cluster is capable
observing read and write requests to
traditionally with relational dev rumors
of a master server and your transaction
logs of every insert every update of
italy's de fed end of your sentence
plain text and they're coated in some
fancy way but fundamentally transactions
come in reach into the might of
databases and typically you're not going
to be performing updates on the slaves
because then you could get into a kind
of weird situation it's kind of
self-evident have you set up systems
like that before experience running a
bit standard stuff it's react slightly
differently though we have you created
cluster of notes by default to replicate
the data 23 notes requests come in kind
of responsibility of your data is
charted or partitions across the cluster
typically into 64 pieces partitions be
increasing too much larger numbers and
any note of the closure will be capable
of servicing on request is in the case
where request comes in here say this is
the notice which multiple forgiving
partition to determine by hashing the
cave that object affects the data for
itself and
also merge two copies of two other notes
compare them ensure the data is
consistent of the same tank with the
missing values will be written back to
the appropriate place and say for rights
you write a couple copies so you lose
the machine or use two machines
potentially on this nicera I still have
one machine its able to provide a copy
of that data and that data we want next
slide this brings us on to the top side
this brings us on to the topic of right
variability consistency I are they
mutually exclusive poll hands either
don't think about it or anything party
view if you can play you would always go
into the cluster and it's able to accept
rights and the event that some of the
machines are down that could mean the
jug two copies your data so back to back
to the question would you would you
consider that the mutually exclusive
might be prized product mix the first
right answer I said you might okay so
the answer is doing it off they are me
child they aren't mutually exclusive if
you're in the situation we can write
more copies of data there's no kind of
system coordination incurring
guaranteeing that they're all written at
the same time it is impossible to
guarantee either they'll be consistent
you've got multiple copies of the data
okay does anyone ever dealt with this in
any other system does anyone ever used a
marvelous kind of database system like
this before elasticsearch show so what
you going to do in that situation and
this is this service kind of rotates
with like an assumption that people have
more people
prior knowledge react but you do deal
with conflicts okay do you've got to
cogs you data so let's say you loaded in
some contacts when you're found and
maybe you loaded in some contacts from
some other device and maybe you modified
some of the same contacts and maybe the
network that not all the machines where
I was talk to each other I might have
taken in Joe Bloggs i'm going to put in
his phone number on one entry written it
off to the cluster and i might have
taken his email address and his name and
another card we've all got this new
mobile found the ability to marriage
conflicting address book entries maybe
nobody else using a blackberry that's
where say with this situation like that
will react to do is that will generate
siblings will say well I've got two
copies of data up and no idea how to
resolve okay what it does man is that
the next time that date is requested
reread it ready returns both puppies to
the client the client will decide that
marriage the data it's in that case it's
a pretty simple and just making unit of
the data okay set those attributes that
make sense reason so a relatively recent
improvement that we made nobody else got
this just us is react data types rear
data types are a series of data
structures that rather than taking the
entire data structure you mentioned the
reactor was a key value database it's
just an object is to block run taking at
our blog down it's the client mutating
it when you want to add something into a
list or you want to resolve a conflict
you can now you please react data types
what they are again it's still blog but
it's stored inside the closer and you
send operations to cluster so you say
add some twists at I'd
to a map increment a counter diplomatic
counter and react resolves all that
stuff inside question for you to make
sense does anyone have any questions Oh
sweetie cluster reputation so he used to
be the case that Microsoft Amazon BBC
big big organizations of data centers
remember the location there's no longer
the case of diet observers just running
my personal account all over the world
it's it's gone from being the unusual to
being the norm do it who else here is
God servers in another country I really
expected more maybe the others are
hiding something okay so another thing
that we act does is the multi cluster
replication so shooter data is one of
these clusters network split or no
networks left got all those resolutions
that going on Anna copulation with us
for in another location yeah you know
datacenter d whore who else use line
hood so you can have a data center in
new york company some data into their
say it's your product catalog parties
both the london data center do you go to
data to the data center do you go to
data to move closer to where your
customers are obviously i mean most
presume everyone is notice that there's
a big difference in latency between
making on West to say UK or london data
center and one
on the west coast it's pretty you're all
kind of familiar with that you've
painted some stage never test his feet
okay
I most commonly notice on Netflix so
dealing with search scale so you go to
distribute full-text search to support
that support the index synchronization
so just as multiple copies of your data
or written around and we have closer so
multiple copies of the index written
around the club so you have three copies
of your index if one of those machines
fails then your next gets needed it can
still serve requests from the other
duplicates and it will also it's going
to automatic healing futures it's based
on feature we article octoman thp or
know back in the day we use that food
pairing missing objects now we also use
it for repairing index entries that are
missing scan through periodically we see
what's in index we see what's in the
corresponding react partition and what's
not there right keep that up to date and
auto restart reactors written in airline
which is esoteric but has some very nice
features to be around process
coordination starting processes
transparently on other machines and
process supervision is one key feature
to very life we extended that process
ignited be a process inside the virtual
machine in this kind of an operating
system process because we're running a
JVM it's solid we didn't reimplement it
in airline this time get any questions
so far
making this easy so at this stage we've
improved search who's relatively easy to
do and we're one step closer to success
so this stage where we could be and this
is kind of transition you seem
relatively frequently if not always your
legacy infrastructure you get your
product catalog stored in relational
database or it could be some kind of
advantage we system God how are you
running socks somewhere you go to
pipeline so stuffs getting updated the
warehouse or as it arrives whatever are
you putting that in some middleware
which is either in this case we've
specified Python Ruby node will extend
this list almost infinitely using it
include java Scala and second et cetera
some people are going to do in peril
successfully which is astonishing
indifference 2015 10 units the
middleware transform you into JSON are
your community to react babies react
clustering and it's indexed and searched
by the integrated into the solar
supplied to web and mobile the thing
that's missing out of this picture is a
catchment solar results okay so we've
gone am i doing on time
I took okay so actually data platform
okay so let's move a little bit faster
so the bachelor data platform want to
provide action there so what date basic
Redis is intensely popular I've used it
before very very nice to work with has
anyone else here at Venice user great
it's this is the simplest thing in the
world to run it's trivial incredibly
easy to write client purpose and it just
little text messages if you could write
time for smtp pipeline for Betis easier
all right one thing about it though is
that it's it's kind of difficult to
scale it up runs really well if you go
running on one machine provided I mean
in my experience I found that adding
items to a list you keep pushing items
into a list eventually when it grows
large becomes very slow to pop them out
on the other side configured to read the
dogs there so what we want to do is buy
a is use passion there automatically
indexed search you go down the solar
edge right scalable model your own
systems they're simple reality trivial
it's just there and simple pipelining
data analysis will take a look at how we
structured this ok so the fundamentals
of what's in there servcorp you'll react
obviously we make it are quite a serious
management system so that would be
providing some function audience a
little bit similar to suit zookeeper
I don't know is any new zookeeper is it
easy no okay I got the new book couple
years ago but it's like chapters
continue so service manager in
conjunction with react ensemble reaction
Saunders the system reviews about to
light strong consistency so provides a
pack socks like algorithm the original
intent was for particular mentioned this
is eventually consistent the idea was
eventually consistent the idea was that
you could have particular objects and
ticular Vulcan figured in a particular
way and you have guaranteed to reach
around rights so in this situation we
are in a partition if there wasn't the
majority of nodes available on your side
of the partition would be able to do
right the object it's a long story short
that's that's the essence of it so we
use this by the leader election service
spark spark is anyone used it yeah
Sparky's haha is the next hot thing
basically people are moving howto on to
spark it provides a kind of standard way
to query a bunch of different data
stores by partitioning over data sets
fights integration unload machine
learning libraries it's quite easy to
use and very easy to use scarlet is any
scholar developer here it's good so the
three years like spent learning scallop
was placed no not a function journey
it's good so it's 22 kind of ways that
you spar the first one is to just a fire
spark I didn't pendency startup scholar
Rapoport but whatever the way you do I
don't know there's Python as well has
anyone worked with spark with fighting
like I was driving on ice bar I need to
find out more about that I remember
talking to United you can I to do it
that way and you can say taking in some
arbitrary data sources so it could be a
CSV file could be associative array
whatever it is or you can even also run
like a spark cluster where it
distributes work queries and operations
you performing around a bunch of worker
knows okay one of the features of that
is that you have you have the master and
it's basically becoming job for nation
hi lady the results etc and good let you
work or notes now I didn't give it time
you only want to have one master matter
so traditionally new zookeeper there
the idea being between the idea behind
zookeeper being that of a one consistent
view certain values opposed to an entire
cluster okay zookeeper little bit
difficult configure set up people
believe there's a certain operational
overhead there so that goes away okay
the service manager will go back row
gratis so partial Redis proxy so what we
do is we apply the same kind of
partitioning logic which we use for
react so the way that distributes data
out amongst the cluster nodes or you
play that to read us as well so we can
put radisson how it kind of hide it out
very little operational overhead is
basically you deploy a bunch of reddit
services and group and monitor stomach
if they fail restarts them it also moves
the data around between different
instances so you get a more reliable
access to your data at the moment it's
limited in the operation performs it's
basically we're using it as pull through
cash which you can also populate
yourself as the result of them from the
result of spark as you take your spark
results at updated directly to react we
populate it directly into the reddest
captions okay does that make sense
okay running a little bit low on time
try to play through these next slides so
this goes caching so discuss caching and
reddit why okay so why use Redis with
data platform what led us to this
decision okay so our stories always
being one of high availability Redis has
always been stories always been a
blindingly fast three important unless
you write the code yourself it's very
difficult to get a higher speed than you
get from reddit status cool that's way
there's not it's not particularly built
to scale I know from reading the website
logo recently they have made some steps
towards a high-availability setup of
some kind of system of master-slave
synchronization whatever it's not really
at the core of what they tried to do
reactors being built very the very first
instance is being built as a distributed
highly available database and that's
being the to use a terrible value
proposition is what it's all about with
the actual data platform are only these
nodes are funny because you're always
going to find the speed of the cash
hedge is disproportionate to the speed
of raw access to the underlying data
store but you know some numbers
basically if the data is cached it's
going to be a lot faster it's also got
pull through caching as well so if you
if you if you want to you can warm up
the cash predefined series requests and
pull through the data from react
behind-the-scenes one
na Wei Zheng here is anyone here ever
gaged cash warming okay
okay so go to Google slides justify this
fits together so the service manager
concurrently there's just two services
that we support to read us and spark the
implementation itself it very simple to
certainly will be within capabilities
most of the people in this room to
deploy their own services there as well
basically it's we talk about that as
much fundamental level just a little bit
of watchdog code is the practice alive
did not started up and beat a little bit
figuration into the clusters there's no
point in launching a bunch of Redis
notes I don't know what IP address
important to visiting on that's some
good so yeah it's basically it you do
the closer you run a simple command you
deployed 12 reddish nodes into group and
then pass your data popping react
monitoring the truth roof resilience
when those goes down is that will be
available in this cluster state would
restart nodes you can also configure in
such a way that say I don't have a
minimum number of nodes running at any
given time so yeah by potential
instances but I want 2013 of them to be
running okay to get some resilience and
then kind of feature set around that
characteristics of Redis 2.8 version is
anyone using Lua scripting Loretta's
stuff curiosity truth
okay of the people in this room who are
reddish users I'm used up do you think
the Lua scripting is a good idea
indifferent every user driven think
about it yeah I really didn't like the
fact that the liver went in there okay
okay so you can you can use the basic
set basic operations get set set uses a
TTL avoided TTL to cut lettuce with the
winning features you'd also use a couple
of clients to expire data PX wire info
monitor straightforward stuff you've
done before and then the batch of data
property is written and say it's a
read-through cash in 1.0 version right
through cash is a future product to be
true you're going to implement or
pretend it's e omniauth notes it's an
enterprise feature on pre chardon
connection aggregation is built in okay
so we take a really quick look at the
analytics I kind of covered this already
actually sparked mind provide that
that's an open source projects you can
actually just used against an ordinary
react pleasure moment it sort of get up
but really to get the value from now you
want to be running a spark flustered
it's kind of quick diagram of how that's
the play later a high-availability story
that we've got friends mark cluster and
the comparison of spark and spark plasma
manager so this manager is shift is
jarring bdp x occurences two packages
there's the PDP package i'm mr. PDP
x-trackers PDP contains the curve and
the bbp extra package contains things
like drivers library stuff like that you
might want to have on the server you
don't strictly speaking me to download
it separately but it can be handy if you
need to jump on a server get on a wrap
on the start issuing commands where is
yeah and again we could in fact that it
stores is metadata use the reacts from
consistency mechanism water storage
cluster metadata to your guarantee that
there's only one true version of course
the closer you can either access true
version of the data or you have accident
access to the raw if using strong
consistency as the fight guarantee that
it gives okay I'm back again
look at the match by website how could
potentially look now somewhat simplified
so you can blow up on your web client do
you use the cash crop see make use of
renter's what might you go through to
you brk-b and populating if need be your
search is integrated through time to
update your data rather than have to do
it at the API layer as a software
developer you just fired into the system
there's a hook there which gets an index
the index is diary creates them know
he's done how to deal with it and
finally analytic services with spark so
you've got your spark customers also
