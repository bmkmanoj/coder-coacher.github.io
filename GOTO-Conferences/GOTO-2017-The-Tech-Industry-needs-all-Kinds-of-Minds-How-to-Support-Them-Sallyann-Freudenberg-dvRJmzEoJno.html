about 25 years for my PhD I looked at
the psychology of collaborative software
development so I kind of had this
slightly strange blend of IT and
psychology and about three years ago
maybe a little bit more my oldest son
was diagnosed with autism and because I
liked facts a lot as soon as he got his
diagnosis I was like I need to be autism
person I've got to find out everything
there is to know about autism so I went
and read every book I could lay my hands
on I looked at every I looked at every
kind of a bit of bit of talk that
somebody given I went to meetings I did
training courses and all that kind of
stuff
and the more I looked into my son's
autism the more I saw mirrors of myself
the more I saw behaviors that I thought
I hang on a minute I'm a bit like that
um and so I'm pretty lucky my sister's a
clinical psychologist not an autism
specialist but she is a clinical
psychologist so I phoned her up she's
very sweet my sister and I said yes got
this diagnosis I've been doing all this
studying about stuff and I realized I
think I might be autistic do you think I
am and my sister paused and very
politely said well you know hmm I don't
know if you'd get a diagnosis or not
because that's not my feel but you've
definitely got traits so now I kind of
self-identify as somebody Asperger core
with high-functioning autism and I quite
like facts so having done a lot of
disclosure and now calm myself down with
some facts there are some tests you can
do yourself on this kind of stuff these
are diagnostic tests they're just
indicators so here's my numbers it's in
case you think I don't seem very
autistic um alright so this is the
autism quotient test created by Simon
baron-cohen at Cambridge the dotted line
is your neurotypical control group
and the the dark line is people with
diagnosed autism and that's me
and this is the ripple diagnostic scale
which is sort of preferred because you
get really good interrater reliability
with it so you can see here threshold
values for suspected autism 65 and I
scored a hundred and fifty-five I like
that you're taking a photo of that like
wow anyway so so that's me I've never
had anyone take afraid to that before um
so why should you care why should you
care why should I care why should so the
more I looked at this stuff the more I
thought part do you know what some of
the best people I've worked in I've
worked with in IT share these traits
some of the finest minds I've worked
with show some of this traits and
obviously people are you know different
to each other and all that kind of stuff
so even drawing back from the whole
autism thing let's explore that a little
bit so even in knowledge works this is
true I don't really like the phrase
knowledge work sorry dan I know you use
it yesterday but because it kind of for
me countries up this mental image that
you've got people on a conveyor belt
somebody goes well I know what I'll put
my knowledge in and I'll get to Union
you can put your knowledge in and then
if we add your knowledge at the end
we'll have a brilliant product and that
doesn't really sound like what I do when
I'm doing idea what other teams do when
I watch them doing have any kind of
stuff um so I think you're also an
artist and your medium maybe isn't paint
or music or sculpture but it's actually
something even less tangible and even
more ephemeral than this kind of art by
necessity when you're creating products
when you're solving problems that are
tricky you're being creative and just in
case you don't believe me this is one of
the standard definitions of creativity
from a classic psychology textbook okay
creativity is the tendency to generate
or recognize ideas or
turn ative or possibilities that may be
useful in solving problems that sounds
like the kind of thing we do every day
and if we're creative then we probably
need to understand the creative process
a little bit so this is been around
since 1926 this model of creativity and
it's still really relevant today so we
have these different stages when we're
being creative when we're solving tricky
problems we have preparation where we
gather lots of information where we
understand the problem space and then we
have my favorite bit with it which is a
period of incubation a period of
incubation which is that bit when your
subconscious keine works on the problem
without you directly thinking about it
and it's incubation that's in play when
you've been up till 10:00 11:00 12:00 at
night
almost batting your head against the
screen because you just can't work out
how to solve a problem you go to bed you
go to sleep you wake up the next morning
you're in the shower and you go oh so
obvious how did I not see the answer
that's because of the incubation process
then we've once we've got incubation we
have illumination that like yeah I've
got an idea and then we can verify it
this picture by the way is called a
Luminarium it's a pop-up space that is
specifically used to help people
creatively incubate so you can walk
around it you can project colors on it
you can project textures on it you can
have sounds and smells inside it and the
idea is that it takes you into more of a
creative mode by moving you away from
that direct interaction that you're
having with the problem space I love
incubation I think it's that's amazing
so I was thinking a little bit about you
know different people have differing
things that help them with incubation
that help them with creativity and even
from just one single person that can be
pretty complicated so I sent out to my
lovely online community of friends and
colleagues and said what are the things
for you that applied tension on
creativity and I particularly want to
say apply attention so a little bit of
these things can help you be creative
but if you've got too much of them it
can break your creativity okay and these
are all like knobs you can turn up and
down for different people at different
times to give the right kind of
environment for creativity and I just
couldn't believe the amount of things
that came up but just some examples
well not things like deadlines you know
I've got no deadlines at all maybe I'll
get directionless but I've got a
deadline that's manageable I can be
creative if I've got a really harsh
deadline then creativity is out the
window process sometimes that could help
me sometimes it can restrict me
distractions could be helpful or
difficult people and the kind of social
stuff around me movement be at your desk
and look busy busy or me very own as
much as you want as freely as you want
repetitive physical activity we know
helps with creativity go for a walk go
for a run do some juggling helps you
solve the problem sensory environment
asking politics player blah blah blah
blah all of these different kinds of
things helping to show us that
irrelevant of neurodiversity if we want
to creatively solve problems that's
quite a bunch of stuff that we need to
be thinking about so this kind of
everyone's desk is the same here's the
one environment we provide you to work
in and you stay there doesn't really
help us with this creative process and
that's just one person and we know that
diverse teams solve problems better than
teams that are the same so this is
obviously this is just intraday
diversity isn't just sound social policy
policy it's the engine of invention and
obviously that's a politician and you
know you know necessarily need to take
that as read although it does seem to be
heaven knows a good kind of moment to be
discussing that in the world but there's
heaps and heaps of research that shows
that this is a good idea is that I
called Scott Page who has shown that you
can actually
model this with computational models and
proof that if you get a diverse group as
long as it's a tricky problem and their
groups smart smart but not the same the
diverse group will almost always
outperform a group of experts so you get
a group of expert accountants working on
an accountancy problem and then you put
in somebody from a different discipline
they're more likely to come up with a
good solution and they've been some good
recent studies on that too
so some people were tested for cognitive
preference different ways of thinking
about things in a study recently and
then they were asked to come up with a
strategic solution that they could then
go ahead and and execute towards a very
specific goal and the groups that were
homogenous the groups that were similar
very similar not only didn't come up
with a solution or strategy when they
were asked at the end of the day if they
wanted to go home they said no no no no
no no we can solve this stayed well into
the evening and still weren't able to
solve it whereas the the groups that
were more diverse was significantly
faster and not only coming up with a
solution but being able to execute that
strategy as well one more example in
2008 a study was done with
murder-mystery scenarios so a bunch of
interviews with potential you know
perpetrators of the crime were typed up
and given to groups and these groups
were fraternity groups now I don't
understand what that means too much
because we don't really do that in the
UK but my understanding is they're
little cultural groups that support each
other that maybe help each other
understand their social norms but also
help each other get on get on at work
you know find opportunities for each
other within both the community in the
workplace from that canister so they got
same fraternity groups of people and
they let them read through these things
these scenarios and come up with a
hypothesis on who do you think
think he doesn't committed the crime and
for half of those groups so a bit later
a newcomer I came to each of the Greeks
for half of the groups a newcomer was
from a completely different fraternity
group and for half it was the same
fraternity group and the accuracy and
likelihood of coming up with the right
answer more than doubled for the diverse
groups okay so that's interesting in
itself but my favorite thing about that
is this happens even when the newcomer
didn't have a different viewpoint didn't
offer any additional information
whatsoever so just by their very
presence they made the team more
successful and the thinking around that
now is that it's because the
collaboration wasn't quite so easy
because it had to slow down a bit
because it had to be done a little more
carefully that outcome tended to be
better in the diverse group okay and we
know that's true as well
so googled I'm sure some of you know did
a big project called Aristotle when they
were trying to work out what is the sort
of magic ingredient for our really
successful teams and they looked at
hundreds and hundreds of teams and found
that the teams that were most successful
were the ones where everybody's
contribution was valued okay so that's
diversity in general and there are many
types of diversity of course I'm
interested in gender diversity we're not
going to talk about that or racial
diversity or LGBTQ staff or age or
whatever I'm specifically going to focus
now on neuro diversity so neuro
diversity is a word that was coined out
of kind of autism awareness and the idea
of the word neuro diversity is that
rather than thinking about things like
Asperger's autism ADHD etc etc as
illnesses as things we need to solve
as things we should try and eventually
get rid of we really should do better to
think about them as just natural
variations in the human genome they've
always been there they're not new and
that rather than trying to solve them
like that problems what we actually need
to do is find environments where we can
support neurodiversity and in case
you're thinking you don't know what
that's got to do with you if we just
look at their numbers for autism so the
latest research in the States one in 68
people has a diagnosis so heaven knows
in critically those that aren't
diagnosed so is pretty likely that if
there's not someone in your team there's
someone in your department or certainly
someone within your organization and
even neurotypical people can struggle
with some of this stuff that we're going
to talk about and again if you like the
hacks and numbers because I know I do
there's loads of compelling evidence for
this and this is just a little
smattering so you've got some examples
again Maren Cowan 98 autism occurs more
often in families of scientists mothers
of autistic kids are more likely to be
technical if you take two different
regions in the same kind of area you're
more likely to get autistic children in
the IT rich region and autistic spectrum
disorder students are more likely to
choose STEM subjects and other subjects
at college so definitely seems to be
this link and I think that's probably
not news for most of us so why why so
why do I think I don't think this is a
good thing why do I think you want
people on your team so this is Steve
Silberman who wrote this great book
neuro tribe's about the history of
autism and he also does a great TED talk
and he says that by autistic standards
the neurotypical brain is distractible
is obsessively social and suffers from a
deficit of attention to detail I kind of
really like that so he's flipped it
around and said
you know rather than looking at autism
are struggling with these things let's
look at all the great things that though
the autists find simple there but for
other people are tricking so well how is
how is do I think this has helped me in
my career so you know this is for sure
this stuff I struggle with I struggle
with unstructured social situations like
cocktail parties and stuff I'm never
really sure when it's okay to leave a
conversation and you know join another
one without being rude I struggle in
bright or dark sometimes environments I
struggle with certain kinds of textures
I don't like these things very much
around my ears when I'm trying to talk
I'm trying to do my best for you today
um okay so was it helpful in sec well um
one of the things we know for hang on
this this is my I need to say this
person these are all gross
generalizations there is more a
characteristic like this is an autistic
person they're saying in what is autism
circles is you meet one with a person
with autism you've met one autistic
person so they're all sweeping
generalizations but often what's his
like repetitive tasks I really enjoyed
making that slide for example and I
think that's been really helpful in my
career so one time I was working on I
was I was working on a CRM system for a
bank I was a small talk programmer which
is still the language I loved the most
so as a small talk programmer and I did
some work on a narrow monitor and we had
a bug keyword effect ques that's at
around 120 240 things most of the time
and everybody would sort of taken on
themselves and when I finish a bit of
work I'll just try and pop a couple off
the queue to keep it down a little bit
but nobody really liked working on the
bug key apart from me I loved
I loved it you could see the number
going down as she solved the problems I
kind of got a bit obsessed with the
number going down and it was like
solving these tiny little logic problems
which I've always loved so when I finish
my error monitor I got put on the boat
pleasse a night food everyone else
thought I was insane
like can I glue it on a bug key and when
I left being on the bookie over key the
defect he sat out and it never been this
low before well presumably when they
first launched a product it was button
but not that I can remember fare around
two or three non reproducible errors so
the fact that I liked that repetitive to
ask and also the fact that everybody
else on my team didn't assume oh we hate
doing that we're not gonna let cell do
that because it's tedious so I was like
no no no no I really want to I love it
so the diversity was really good there
specialist interests so often autists
have specialist interests that they can
intensely focus on so this picture this
photo is from comic-con in extra in
England last year I walked past this
table with all of these I thought at the
time photographs on and I stopped
because I quite like Doctor Who so I
stopped I was looking at the Doctor Who
and and the guy behind the counter said
oh these pictures that my son Drew and I
was like wow I thought they were they
were photos I said no no no my son drew
them my son's autistic so obviously we
got talking and I said oh oh yeah and I
sorta CT I think I might be a bit
autistic he said yeah my son then we
started ballooning the education system
in England because it's really not set
up for children who have different kinds
of minds so he said oh yeah my son at
the age of about 14 was being so badly
served by the education system but he
just stopped going to school the
teachers didn't mind they couldn't cope
with him anyway so he stopped going to
school
he hid away in his bedroom
and he drew any tree nej nej any tree
and he didn't show anybody particularly
what he was drawing for about two years
and then it still makes the hair stand
off every time and then his dad said two
years later his son walked out of his
bedroom with that they had just drawn
now for sure this is somebody who has an
innate skill actual ring you can see his
work and buy his products by the way
there's a link an innate skill and ends
definitely the artist was in there
anyway however that repetitive ability
to focus deeply on what he was what he
was really fascinated with and wanting
to get it right would definitely have
served in helping him to do that another
thing that is often the case so
specialists and specialists in autism
think that you there are different kinds
of autistic mind and Temple Grandin who
if you haven't heard of I recommend you
go look up that she thinks that and
there's some evidence to show you that
the special kind of autistic brain
that's drawn to IT it's very very good
at spatial awareness it's very good at
spatial thinking physio spatial thinking
so rather than having that photographic
memory that's like I can just look at a
piece of text put it to one side and
read it off the sheet in my brain which
is what temples bring us she says the
figures seem to be drawn to my T are
people who are really good at thinking
about where things are in space and
probably my all-time favorite bit of
research which wasn't particularly
anything to do with autism as by a lady
called Marion Petri and a guy called
Alan Blackwell again at Cambridge they
took a bunch of expert designers both
self and peer rated experts and they set
them on a really really really tricky
horrible problem and they said to them I
want you to talk us through how you're
solving the problem
just tell us what you're doing you know
I just talk to yourself as you go along
and so this is I'm has talked and talked
and talked and talked and then after a
little bit they always went quiet and
when they weren't quiet the researcher
says what's happening now which must
have been a little bit annoying I think
as I said what's happening now and found
that the designers started to describe
these amazingly rich mental images that
they had but they weren't even aware
were there they said things like it's
like a great bristling multicolored
scaffolding of pipe work and gadgets
floating in space they said stuff like
it's like describing all the dimensions
the problem in 2d but then there's this
third dimension where I can sense
closeness to a solution they said things
like that happens over there and I can
fly over to it so it seems like we're
dealing with these Vizio spatial
representations of the problem that
maybe we don't even know about but
they're helping us to problem-solve when
we're working on tricky problems and
we're in this creative problem-solving
solving mode all right so that's autism
I just want to briefly are less of an
expert in these areas my son does have a
side order of ADHD three to four percent
of adults in the UK have either ADHD or
a DD without the hyperactivity and I
think when we when we think about ADHD
we think about people who find it very
difficult to screen out detail and focus
don't me they need low distraction
workplaces and all that kind of stuff
what I didn't realize until relatively
recently was that people with ADHD have
this total superpower called hyper focus
so if it's something that somebody with
ADHD is interested in they can focus in
for longer periods of time and more
intensity than your neuro
typical person so I would definitely
want that person on my team the other
thing that people with ADHD are
well-known to be able to do is really
good time gentle thinking and pretty
much my favorite example of that is the
idea that if you're if there's a group
of schoolchildren learning about
photosynthesis in the classroom your
ADHD kid is the one that's looking out
of the window going I wonder if it still
works in the rain and I want that person
on my team as well I want that tangental
thinking if we're gonna come up with
creative products and solve the world's
trickiest problems we need these brains
on our teams bipolar disorder so my
mother has bipolar disorder she just
come out of a hyper hyper manic episode
and is just into the depressive episode
at the moment she's a slow swing I say
with bipolar disorder
the idea being your neuro typical brain
will swing between you know I'm happy
I'm sad I'm happy I'm sad I'm really
happy and then with bipolar disorder
those swings are much more extreme and
you can cycle through them quickly which
some people do or in my mom's clothes
very slowly in the hyper man in the in
the manic state which is the one I'm
going to talk about separately so
depression you get huge surges of energy
you really don't need to sleep very much
at all lack of sleep extravagance
spending lots of money
my mom died her eyebrows pink last time
actually so you know you're just doing
this not really not caring a job for the
conventions of society and being able to
make links between things that to the
neurotypical brain aren't linked to all
so often but again we're always people
with bipolar disorder do this thing that
people in the trade called clanging
which is like playing a word association
game with yourself
yes a word a word a word
a word a word and to my brain I'm like
how are these things release it right
but to heaven that's really really
annoying it's like keep up keep up why
can't you see the links why can't you
understand so I asked somebody in our
industry if I can scroll down to it now
who I know is bipolar he's very well
respected and said how do you think
being bipolar helps you in your job and
they said exactly that they said that
when they're in a manic state they can
make links between things that other
people can't see and they know that
those links often aren't reliable so
they learn they've taught themselves to
test them out with experiments and so
now that's what they do even when
they're not manic they try and see
unusual links and test them out with
experiments I want that person on my
team depression this is my birth people
who come to my talks like to see the
progress of my birth over time so there
is a point to having a bus on the
depression screen I promise so oh I've
got statistic 20% of people in the UK
have experienced depression I don't know
about would worldwide numbers but
actually gonna be similar in a study of
a thousand eminent people seventy-seven
percent of artists 54% of fiction
writers 50% of visual artists 46% of
composers had had at least one
significant depressive episode in their
life okay so you know it's hard to think
isn't it how Howard depression be
helpful on my team how would that help
however there's a great piece of
research about depression so um if you
take a bunch of people a bunch of
neurotypical people or general cohort um
and you ask them how good at driving
they are do you think caring the top 50%
or not what do you think that she I've
never done this what do you think hands
up if you think you're in the top 50%
for ability to drive your car
yeah there you go
which pretty much bears out what happens
in the research right
93% of Americans think they're in the
top 50% brilliant statistically
impossible and yet me do and so there
was some research done that said let's
take that even further let's only ask
people who are hospitalized because of
driving accidents that they've admitted
were their own fault and still more than
50% of people thought they're in the top
50% for driving ability which is crazy
apart from one group one group who had a
balanced view of their driving ability
which is people who are clinically
depressed so I don't know what that says
about the fact that people who don't
have depression are maybe going through
the life with this rose-tinted kind of
attitude but it seems to me that I want
that person on my team because they're
the person who's gonna be saying to me
why hang on a minute hang on a minute
this seems a bit risky hang on a minute
if you thought about all the things that
can go wrong I want that person on my
team oh that's the inside alright so um
we know everyone's got different
creative needs
how can they be creative right we know
general diversity is good for teams
hopefully I've started to show you that
neurodiversity is good for teams too and
yet I keep hearing this oh you know we
recruit for cultural fit hmm you're not
like me and and I say you know okay the
cultural fit that you're in danger there
of having a homogenous monoculture
everybody being the same and when I say
that to people they go oh no no no no no
no no I don't think I don't think you
understand what I meant by cultural fit
like I didn't mean that we only recruit
white middle-class well-educated males
who aren't very old
well you know maybe that's true or maybe
it isn't and I don't really want to go
there in this talk but know that if
you're recruiting for cultural fits
you're playing right into the hands of
some of your cognitive biases all right
so here's just a few that are relevant
and there's more but here's just a few
salience salience is the fact that we
notice thank the thing that's relevant
for us right up front and then we can't
get past it so say someone comes into an
interview and they look different or
they sound a bit different or they don't
make eye contact with you it's very hard
for us to get past those things that
have sort of smacked us in the face to
the other stuff that we want to find out
about we can't I can't get past the
initial thing in-group bias so this
one's obvious right and you can see how
evolutionary kind of point of view it's
been really helpful right we're going to
protect the people in our group more
than the people outside right we're
going to give preferential treatment to
the people in our group makes sense I
love this one though out-group
homogeneity via bias okay so algorithm
omajin e-ma genetic I can't say I'm so
tired
homogeneity bias is the fact that I
perceive my group to be much more
diverse than any other group okay so for
example let's say I go home tonight and
I meet up with a bunch of mom friends
from you know kids from my kids school
and we sit we're all really different
you're kind of career person and I'm a
stay-at-home mom blah blah brother isn't
it funny that all men like doing
practical jobs and drinking beer right
and whether you think you do that or not
we all do all the time we consider our
group much more diverse than the other
groups that are out there and I hear
that all the time in my coaching oh and
I T we do all different kinds of things
we're interested in different tools you
like doing business analysis I like
doing testing but the business like
they're one mind melded blob
right there business only care about
making money really ha
and if you didn't like that one you'll
love this one blind spot bias so not
only do we have these biases one of our
biases is our inability to see our own
biases so we all think everyone else is
biased but not me ok so what do people
say when I say tell me about cultural
fit and they say it's not that gender or
race or anything else they say things
like no no no no no what I mean is I
want a flexible team player who's
cross-functional and likes a challenge
ok well what am i if we took on some
people who weren't like that what
benefits would we get from somebody
who's not flexible or maybe they're hard
to convince right maybe they really make
us think it through
maybe they help us avoid confirmation
bias that Linda talked about yesterday
and what about someone who's not a team
player well maybe that will stop us kind
of all polarizing together maybe it will
stop risky shift which is even more
concerning than polarization in groups
it's the fact that if you've got a bunch
of people together and they're all sort
of mildly right-wing and they all sit
and talk about politics they make these
extreme right-wing decisions so the fact
that the groups or similar makes them
make these extreme decisions and maybe
having someone who's not a team player
would help us with that maybe they'd be
the person that come up with some
maverick ideas that might just work what
about someone is not cross-functional
well maybe they're the person who's got
this deep encyclopedia acknowledged and
this absolute almost success almost
obsessive interest in something we would
definitely want on our team all about
someone who doesn't like a challenge
well maybe they hung out risks maybe
they're careful and they think things
through so take care when you're
thinking about these things take care
when you say cultural fit take care to
think about the people that you're
screening out of your team alright so
and yet
talk about cultural fit and yet we
create environments like this one size
fits all I teach it a bit this is a
newsroom or something somebody else
spoke to about three weeks ago told me
that they begged their directors had
decided they should go agile and I said
how was that what happened and they said
well they moved us to an exclusive
reopen plan building there's noisy and
horrible and we all hate it anything
else happened
no thank you no nothing else that's what
they've done moved us to a noisy noisy
open plan office crazy so here's some
neurotypical friends of mine and
Catherine struggling with these work
places we created so these aren't even
people with sensory issues or whatever
this is my friend Zoe
she works in an organization where
everything was modernized yeah we're all
gonna collaborate this have really
bright lighting and open spaces she's
like that's great but I get migraines
her team made her advisor out of post-it
notes so she could function at work I
don't want an environment where I can't
get away and have to do that this is a
friend of Catherine's had to go and hide
between two moveable whiteboard boards
to get some peace and quiet so she could
work I don't want to work in an
environment where people have to resort
okay so what can we do we can help be
more inclusive when we interview people
by not having panel interviews by giving
people really clear instructions about
how to get to where they're going how
reception work Souter asked for by
taking a photo of the room and the
interviewer so that there isn't too much
to be shocked about when they turn up by
having the interview in a quiet place by
suggesting that it's okay if they want
to bring props and things to fidget with
if that helps and when I started
thinking about this I realized that
actually what I like to do is TDD or BDD
even my interview process as soon as
somebody walks through the door what
other thing as I've been looking at to
help this person succeed
okay I'd want them to shake my hand or
if they're uncomfortable just to know in
advance they didn't want to shake my
hand I'd like them so maybe I need to
give them two tips about first
impressions like dress code plenty of
places today you'd be more out of place
if you did wear a formal suit and if you
didn't that's easy to get wrong and then
I feel awkward is that okay to have a
cup of tea or not or whatever so trying
to think of these things in advance
keeping interview short maybe having
multiples of them over time then rather
than one intensive day and there are
companies out there doing all kinds of
experiments with different kinds of
interviewing methods and approaches that
are had that are kinder and more useful
to people who aren't neurotypical so
continually busy noisy open-plan spaces
with nowhere to hide might not be the
best option for everybody please offer
alternatives provide a safe and
forgiving environment that pays
attention to people's individual needs
without singling them out is strange
think realized that people will have
different sensitivities to bright lights
or sounds to textures taste smells
unexpected things happening keep your
meeting structured publish an agenda up
ahead of time have a clear purpose let
people know who's going to be there give
people the opportunity to contribute by
email or a written form or we'll have
somebody else be their voice if you want
to during the meeting and some other
things that we're doing now with the
inclusive collaboration we're helping
people just stretch and practice using
that muscle that psychologists call its
executive functioning which is what
happens between us having that urge to
make an all these make my presence known
let everyone know I'm in charge and
something coming out of our mouths so
we're getting groups of people together
in workshops to do things
absolutely in silence to practice being
quiet so that we don't stifle each other
a little less
oh that's fuzzy I'm sorry um and what
we're doing is making prosthetic hands
because that's nice and tricky and a bit
stressful because they're really going
to be used by somebody so it feels like
it's similar to a thing you might do at
work obviously it's a lovely thing to do
as well but it is quite expensive you
can run a science experiment with Lego
or anything else that you'd like there's
a book of experiments that you can do
which the science experiments just
one-off it's on lean pub it's completely
free you can slide the slider to zero
and I won't mind okay because I really
want it to be out there the thing with
all this stuff often after talks people
say I've got this one guy on my team
what should i do I don't have all the
answers for you I'm sorry okay but what
I do have is some examples some tools
some experiments you can run and some
knowledge that you can go away with that
you didn't have before or maybe you did
right so so amazing things that I saw
yesterday that I've kind of wrangled
into here because maybe you didn't go to
all the talks on the ITN Society track
yesterday it was really cool so I loved
this quote and I think it's really
relevant for this because we're trying
so hard to move fast maybe we've
forgotten some of the load-bearing walls
that help us do this stuff in a
democratic kind inclusive way so that
was from Jonathan and Steve's amazing
yesterday Dan I made your name even
brighter on the screen Dan look at there
so Dan talked about a le Goldratt and
how to adopt a new technology using
these four things so I thought I'll
apply that to inclusive collaboration
just in case my audience haven't got the
message yet so here we go
what's the power of the approach
inclusive collaboration unleashes
people's potential what limitations does
it diminish limited creativity and
problem solving and blandness what rules
helped us manage the limitation before
well what was perceived
miss Scalia no it's too hard to be
inclusive no one else is any good at it
either so we don't need to be good at it
yeah and what new tools are we going to
need we're going to need to collaborate
more carefully and that's going to give
us a competitive advantage and a humane
advantage even if it feels a little bit
harder to begin with we need to
experiment and learn together about this
stuff okay
Linda talked about that's moral
foundations theory and how to give the
message to people who aren't like you I
know if anybody missed that talk go
looking at it it's really good so I tend
to be you know a bit a bit on the
liberal side so I'm talking about care
and harm and fairness and cheating and
stuff like that so I thought I'll
experiment with some other ones loyalty
inclusivity provides everybody with the
opportunity to help the organization
that we're proud to be a part of succeed
inclusivity means we can all play by the
same new rules inclusive collaboration
upholds and supports everyone's human
right to work I've enjoyed playing with
these things I only learned them
yesterday go play with them they race ok
so here's some studies you can go look
at join the campaign have a badge have a
sticker find out about what we're doing
go experiment have the book let us know
what you find out I think it's a
fascinating journey that we're all on
