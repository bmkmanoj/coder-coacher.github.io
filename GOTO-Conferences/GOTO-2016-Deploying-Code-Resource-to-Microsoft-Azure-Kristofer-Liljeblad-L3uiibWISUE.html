enough to have the session just of the
lunch so I hope you stay awake so my
name is Christopher I live here in
Stockholm I but I work for Microsoft
Corporation so I report directly to
redmond where all the developers are I
work in a team where we specialize in
helping a big partners succeed on Azure
my specialty is working with gaming
studios see if ya if there's anyone from
you from any kind of games to do sout
there I'd love to talk to you later on
as well so my daily work is to help with
big big games running really well on a
sure before I begin how many of you have
heard of Microsoft Azure how many of you
know how to pronounce it I don't either
so I say it like to do in redmond so
that is a sure you can say I sure as
sure anything that's fine we understand
anyway so go ahead as long as you say it
in any way so actually is our computing
platform for you our cloud platform for
you to use if you want to it runs on
several data centers around the world
and right now I had to change this slide
I think it was yesterday because it just
took two other data centers live in
Canada so we are live on the 24 data
centers and I think we have more than 30
that we have a closed going to be live
so there are data service building all
all day long and we have so many
computers coming into those data centers
every second so it's kind of cool if you
ever had a chance if you ever have the
chance to come and see one of those data
centers you should sign up for them we
do take tours especially here in Europe
to Dublin so make sure you express your
interest if you are interested in going
there right now
live right now in Europe we have two
data centers so that is in West Europe
in Amsterdam and north Europe in Dublin
but there's at least four that I can
talk about coming soon in Europe and in
many mores coming so this talk the idea
behind this talk is to to tell you about
a sure it's not going to be telling
everything about a sure it's going to
tell you something in the water and I
want you to have seen some of the things
that i'm going to show you so you can go
and ask questions you can look for it
later on this is not going to be this is
how you do exactly because i don't think
there is such an answer so if you want
to build micra services and you want to
host them on anywhere and people will
ask you like what is the best platform
to do that i don't think there is such
an answer Asher is probably not the best
answer for everyone Google is not either
amazon is not on your private data
center is probably not either the best
so from time to time is it's going to be
different anyway in our data set we have
the infrastructure of course and those
are a whole lot of computers I don't
talk with them we have the
infrastructure services that you can use
if you want to see if you want to have
full control if you want to have your
computer's your virtual machines you can
have your infrastructure hosted on those
I don't talk about those we had other
platform services and it's becoming
quite a lot of them right now so to
speak of some of them that I'm not going
to speak about today so for example up
in the right corner that we say we have
a lot of data and analytics services so
we have Hadoop as a service and and
that's something that's kind of strange
to Microsoft in a Microsoft world that
that's actually they had oak it's a
Hadoop this region running in our data
center run by us but it's nothing
special it is Hadoop so any kind of tool
that you use for Hadoop would work there
so if you want to write a Java job it
would work there okay I'm not going to
talk about the data legs I'm not going
to talk about this dream and analytics
that do real-time analytics of incoming
streams of data but it's there if you
to what I'm going to talk about instead
is this services and the end these are
the names for these kind of services
that we have I'm going to talk about
these services and these are the
services that would be interesting if
you if you are vowed to build in
Microsoft's architecture and you are
figuring would I should be a good fit
for that these are resources that I
think you would be using to host your
code ok how many oh you do run anything
retro right now some yeah how many of
you have full automated deployments of
that workload that you're running right
now now 11 to really put up your hands
I'm going to show some example how you
can get there and how it can be can be
done really good so how should I pick
what what what kind of service I added
this slide yesterday because there was
an internal thread on Microsoft LS that
I'm following and someone said I have
this app it's written in summary and I
wanted to be able to connect to a couple
of tables that I have in a database
what's the correct tool what's the
correct frameworks you used to do that
and how should I hosted in Azure and
what would be the answer to that kind of
question there is no such answer you
need to figure out so much more there
are things like what are the
requirements around it so how fast
response do you need how much money do
you have how much time do you have do
you have time to build a full micra
services architecture around those
tables or do we just want expose them is
that good enough for security etc etc so
there's no such easy answer you need to
have much more information and i would
say that these kind of answers comes
from experience so having a really
experienced architecture architect in
your team is really valuable and also
having experience from
these platforms are also really
important I'm pretty sure that you could
build anything that you would build on
Amazon on a sure if you wanted to and
anything that Google has built can also
be built on actually if you want to or
anything that we build could probably be
built on Prem if you wanted to you just
need experience on how to do that ok and
also keep asking the right questions so
the right question would not be what
tools should i use to expose my tables
to Anna summary nap the other quests are
how long time do we have what kind of
data is is that we're shuffling from the
date from app to the cloud etc and
sometimes the answer to these questions
are that your data your app should not
be in the cloud at all it might be
somewhere else and it might be in your
own data center and the Microsoft
solutions to that would be to run what
we call Asher stack so you can run a
sure on your local data center if you
want to and you could have the same kind
of guys same services but you would have
to have your own servers but but you've
heard today that you could put out our
frameworks on top on top of our services
as well if you want to then there's the
choice between infrastructure or
platform as a service so if you want to
go full control yourself if you want to
build everything using a hammer and a
nail then you can do that using
infrastructure as a service if you want
the service if you want someone to say
well here's your database it's always
going to be out it's going to be up to
date with the latest version then you
can have that using platform as a
service we have all these kind of
services in Azure we have well not all
but we have plenty of services and you
can choose from made of them and you can
mix them from time to time some of the
biggest workloads I'll be working with
are on infrastructure as a server so
running really big multiplayer games or
not sure quite often runs on
infrastructure as a service you spin up
virtual machines you have your own kind
of control plane and you control the
virtual machines
and you you start your oh sorry about
that so I should probably have shut down
link so let's do that that's my
colleague from Spain where was I was
talking about yeah the big workload so
some of them are just like thousands of
virtual machines that you control
yourself and you use api's to make sure
you have them when you want them and you
tear them down whatever you don't need
them the pricing for many clouds and as
fracture is that you pay for what you
use so it's really important to have
scalability come since you want to scale
out as as in the last minute and you
want to scale out scale down as fast as
you can and all of that could be done
using api's and i'm going to show you
how to do that but in order to make
these decisions you need to know what
what what you're choosing between so i'm
going to show you some of these features
now and the first one is going to be
around virtual machines so i'm pretty
sure Avery of you have span up virtual
machine I'm pretty sure that not
everyone has been up a virtual machine
in Azure and I'm really sure that not so
many of you have used what we call arm
templates so arm is not the CPU arm that
stands for actual resource manager and
the one that Microsoft I decided we
should call it arm should probably be
fired but Microsoft is not really known
for its good naming conventions but arm
templates anyways as your resource
manager templates and they describe
whatever you want to deploy and we
deploy it according to that template
later on we have some something new that
we call virtual machine scale sets or vm
scale sets those are for if you ever
want to set up your virtual machines
several of them in the same way so for
example you have one virtual machine to
represent your front end server and you
want to have thousands of them you can
just say I want thousand of them and we
will scale out two thousand and then you
say i want 99 100
99 and we will bring down one of them
for you but let's go to demo so I'm
going to start here so I want to deploy
something to Azure and I've gone to get
help and that's also something that is
kind of new for Microsoft so a lot of
our stuff are on github and a lot of our
stuff are open sourced so this is the
repository of the arm templates that you
can choose to start from if you want to
you can even put your own templates
there and help the community if you have
a have anything that you want to
contribute with and we're going to look
at one of these that are called simple
linux er well I was introduced to say
that is it going to run on Microsoft
platform well yes it is but I'm still
going to show you a Linux virtual
machine here if you look inside the file
called asier deploy and i'm going to
show you in a bigger hang on so this is
a template this is how it could look
like and it they always start the same
way so you have a schema definition up
there and you have the content version
so the controversia need to match
whenever you deploy a template then you
have the parameters to your template so
these two these parameters can be reused
these templates can be reused by just
and providing different parameters so
I'm going to provide admin username
password and their dns label and what
kind of a you going to verse and i want
to run here and then later down here i'm
going to skip to some part we have all
the resources that we want to deploy so
deploying a virtual machine in a sure
would mean that you would have to have a
storage account because the storage
account will save your virtual hard
drives so you describe your storage
county in there you're also going to
need a virtual network so the virtual
network will be used to connect your
machine to the world and you want to
have a virtual network card you can have
more than one if you want to but this
time I need one
and and you just define what kind of IP
address should i have to this one should
it be public or only internal you can
define different subnets and then you
define your virtual machine down there
all of this is documented if you want to
dig into this yourself but I'm going to
just use this template as is a really
easy way to deploy anything using these
templates are by by linking back to the
portal so if I click on this button here
it will bring me back to the azure
portal where I deploy stuff and it will
download it template from this time from
github and will start asking me
questions what kind of valleys do you
want on the parameters that were
specified in the template but I wouldn't
be so fun but if I wanted to I could
just say I want to admin username to be
Christopher the password to be something
there and my dns label something and
then click ok and that would deploy this
virtual machine but this is about doing
it automatically so we want to do this
fully automatic and perhaps we want to
do it like thousands of times and we
don't even want want it to happen we
don't know when it's going to happen so
I'm going to do this using the API is
directly so all they price in after our
rest base so you can connect to them any
in a bag you want to using rest and
everything that you see that we do in
the portal in the azure portal in the
controlled portal you can also do using
using the api's I've started post months
postman is a plugin for chrome here that
you can use to send rest request and the
first thing you need to do is authentic
eight so before I did this talk I've
gone into my subscription and told I
sure that my computer that this
application here is an authorized
application to otha k authenticate
against I sure again my against my
subscription so when I authenticate I
get back a token here and I'm going to
reuse that token for the rest of the
request okay so everything I do here is
secured and as a matter of fact that
authentication
against a sure active directory so if
you have any business and you do
business with anyone using office 365
that would be the same kind of
authentication mechanism and by the way
most of my gaming companies don't
integrate with office 365 so it's kind
of fun to to say that once in a while so
a simple thing here that I could do is
just to get against this URL here and in
the headers I send in the token and also
content type Jason and as a result back
i will get adjacent file showing what
kind of subscriptions i do have access
to right now right now i have access to
my internal subscription and i can then
go on and say i want for example list
all the resource groups and this is
something that's kind of different to
how we at microsoft to cloud gaming and
the google and amazon us so everything
is centered around resource group to
nature so you deploy stuff to your
resource groups and you you kind of
create virtual containers of resources
inside a resource group anything inside
a research group can communicate out to
other resource groups but you can think
of it as an easy way to contain any kind
of resource that are for that kind of
application and if that application is a
single micro service or multiple
multiple microservices that's up to you
to choose so right now I all have one a
resource group and it's called go to
back up because I have done it back up
here but I could create a new one so I
could just say so I do put against the
URL up here and say I want to have a new
resource group in the location and I've
already specified some environments
rebels here inside so I'm going to have
it in West Europe and I want to research
group to be named a resource group named
sorry I should have looked that up
before here so the resource group name
will be go to so if i do that now i send
I'm going to provision a new resource
group in West Europe and if i go back to
list all resource groups i will see that
i have to resource groups so now i can
deploy stuff into that resource group
and one thing that i want to deploy is
the template i show you the Linux
virtual machine that was described as
the template on github so i can say i
want to create a template deployment
here and and that is against the URL up
here you can see that i'm targeting my
resource group you perhaps you can seed
but the URL up there is i'm going to
zoom in so the URL says i'm targeting a
specific deployment i'm going to i'm
going to create a new deployment with
this api and in the body here let me
zoom out again i'm going to provide
parameters to the template that's going
to be on github so it's going to
download the template from github
provide the templates and then provision
a virtual machine using them so just
send this one and back I'll get a result
saying that well it's on the way it's
it's ongoing so if I now go to my portal
experience here and I say have a look
inside a resource group I would see that
I'm currently have a network interface
card deployed I have a public IP address
and a virtual network and it also says
it's deploying right now so I I'm now
deploying a new linux virtual machine
that will subscribe using a template the
template was is based on github right
now and I deployed it using it the rest
api okay this seems kind of complicated
but sometimes you need to use the API
and if you want to it's quite easy to do
that another way of doing it would
definitely be just using the come online
so will it work on Microsoft yes it does
but the tool i'm going to show you right
now it's implemented using node
so you download it if you have note on
your computer you download it using NPM
install globally and then you say asher
CLI so that's the come online interface
pressure i don't i'm not going to
install it because i already have but
once you have it installed you can just
say a sure so everything i did now could
be done using the command line here so
if you want to automate it and have it
run easily from the command line you can
just use the command line interface we
also have powershell c'mon let's for you
that our windows developers and are used
to partial okay so back here so i just
so that was deploying the the linux
machine using arm as your resource
manager and the template but sometimes
you want to have stuff on top of your
machines so you don't want to handle
virtual machines yourself you you want
to use containers and we've heard
several sessions around containers the
virtual machines are natural support any
of the open-source container solutions
that are out there so you can have any
of them running if you want to we also
have something that we just announced
called asier container service or
sometimes abbreviate abbreviated acs so
as your container service is a cluster
of machines that we manage for you and
you select what kind of open source
tools you want on on them so that could
be marathon and D cos or dog it's warm
right now you just tell us how many
wishes do you want and then we provision
them for you they're ready for you to
host your containers on top of you
connect to the to the cluster using any
kind of open open source tool or any
kind of tooling that you use today and
you provision your containers on that
but we talked about micro services and
I'm not going to dive into exactly what
a Mike Rosario sees you have total
control of that right now but if you
want to host microservices on or not
sure there must be a better way is there
a
even a right way to do well as I said
there is no right way but but of course
that Microsoft we have thought about
Mike reservist as well and to the left
you can see the old approach where you
build an app and you then distributed
that app or the layers across several
machines and to the right you can see
the Micra services approach where you
build an application composed of several
small small services and you deploy the
services in your cluster and those small
services could be distributed in any way
across the cluster and you've seen
already some tools today that shows how
to do that for you automatically if you
want to manage state traditionally you
build stateless servers that scale
really well if you want to and you have
the state hosted in the database or
something like that behind the scene but
in a micro services approach it's up to
each and every of the Microsoft's to
decide for themselves so some of them
might be state full service services and
some of them might be stateless with the
database grand is seen you want to be
able to mix and match that so
traditionally once again you have the
load balancer you have some stateless
front ends and you might have some
stateless middle tier and then you
connect to the queue so you connect to
some databases and you in order to scale
that layer you need to have many
databases or shards and you need you
probably add some cash in order to to
get a responsive service another way
around would be to instead host the
state on the services themselves so you
have state full services and inside what
we call service fabric we have a new way
of building services to be that that
uses the actor based framework style of
services I would act 2 based style you
could build actors and actors could have
States and you then distribute the
actors across the service fabric cluster
we will take care of spin up the actors
whenever they are needed I will we will
also put them to sleep if they don't
need it anymore I usually think of
service fabric
as as the revolution revolution when we
had when we went from c to java or
anything like that away and we go to
garbage collection so this is similar to
that but you have garbage collected
collection in the data center so instead
of saying i want to connect to that
service on that machine and then i want
to make a change to to that specific
object you just tell us I want to
communicate with for example in my my
sonorities of an gamers or game players
so I want to connect to the object that
represents player number two and I want
to change the state from alive today and
if you just call into the reserves
fabric cluster and say give me a
representation of player number two and
change the state from live to that and
we will take care of that service fabric
is available right now you can run it in
a sure as a service if you want to you
can download the binaries yourself and
host it on your own cluster if you want
to there's a linux version coming out
soon there's a private previous let me
know if you need to access to that you
can build these kind of activate
services using the net or java right now
and more languages are coming but you
can actually host any kind of service on
service fabrics so if you just want the
the pieces of service fabric that help
you distribute your services across at
least three or more notes then service
fabric could be for you even if you have
built your services using any other
language we call these three kinds of
app reliable services apps or reliable
act wraps or guest executable apps so
the reliable service app or apps I heard
a question so what is a nap and what is
the service so sometimes we told to talk
about web apps we talked about services
as apps so it's not apps running on the
phone right now but if you talk about a
reliable service app that could be
website that could be a rest endpoint or
a rest service but you could use service
fabric to distribute and make sure that
your app is constantly up and running
you could if you want to you could use
the reliable collections that we have
those are right now queues and
dictionaries that automatically
replicate state across at least three
divided three different nodes and make
sure you never lose stayed ever i would
put ever in quotes and then you have to
rely reliable actors as already talked
about and against executable apps or
apps that you run no matter what
language you have built among if you go
if you want to go even simpler and and
automate your deployments and just have
somewhere to put your rest endpoint you
don't want to use any kind of containers
right now you're not ready for it even
though i would recommend you to look at
it and we have other services and we we
have them under an umbrella that we call
app service so i'm going to show you to
them right now and those are the web
apps and actual functions and i know
there was a session about EWS lambdas
and Asha function is basically the same
as that so let's say you have a web
application and you want to have a fully
automated deployment on that to Asher so
how would you go ahead and do that so
what I've done just before we started
this session i just created the super
simple node application i just told the
command line tool that i want a simple
express app that build on node and
that's everything I have right now here
so if I do mpm start I would start a tap
on my machine and I could then browse to
local host port 3000 and that would be
my machine and it responds response back
with express so I'm running a node
application on my on my machine here so
normally if this were normal Microsoft
session you would probably just drag and
drop that to the cloud or something and
you forget about everything everything
else but I don't want to do that because
I know that's
the way you're going to do it I also
know that many people should or are
already using build servers I'm not
going to use a builder for this one but
we have integration with them but what
I'm going to do right now is integrate
with get anyway so everything that is
inside a git repository locally here and
I've also set up a git repository up in
the at github so next step that I want
to do is just push my code up there so
if i go back here and i say add remote
and then i say push to github so it's
been pushed it there and if I update my
repository here we should now see the
code up there okay so that's nothing new
that's how you normally do day-to-day
work if I now go into to the portal and
now i'm going to deploy this manually
even though i could use arm I could use
a template for this one I'm going to say
I want to have a website this could be
web app but it but this is going to be a
web application with the user interface
but it could be rest application or
anything else and I want to deploy it to
my resource group called go to in West
Europe and I want this one to be called
now to go to and crate and the session
before we've said that if it ever takes
more than a couple of minutes then it's
too long and this should not take so
long at all so let's see
so we already have a website up and
running here so so the website is there
and if I go to that URL you would see
something like a page that says well it
has been successfully created but
there's nothing there so what I could do
now is I could just tell I sure I could
hook it up with it we'd get up and say
whenever i deploy something to github
whenever i push something there it
should automatically be deployed to this
web app but i don't want to do that
exactly like that because i would have
some kind of staging environmental at
least so what I'm doing now is that I'm
set up i'm going to set up it the
deployments lot and i'm going to call
this v next as for a version next so i'm
now going to have two slots so i have
two slots that i can deploy to him i
have my regular website but i also have
the next version of the website and it's
done so i can go into that one and i can
now configure that one to fetch my
application from github so i'm going to
go down there and say a deployment
source for that one would be github you
can see that by by default we have
built-in support for which is duty
online onedrive git repositories locally
or get how big but bitbucket dropbox and
some other reporters as well but i'm
going to use get over here and it will
ask me what repository do i want to use
so i'm going to say this product is the
go-to node project do I want to master
branch yes I want that please even
though I probably shouldn't but I'm
deploying to to the staging environment
that's fine and if we give this a couple
of seconds more it should start the
deployment from github to this
deployment slot
so let's see if something happens there
it is it's coming so first commit
let's give it a couple of minutes a
couple of seconds more but basically it
is downloading and it's also version
version in controlling the deployment to
the deployments lot and I'm sorry I'm
even looking at the wrong page here it's
not it's to be next I I mistake yeah
there it is so now it's deploy to
address it it's live now and you can
continue to do that whenever I push
something to github now it will then
automatically be pushed out to Azure
running out of time here but i just want
to show you that what i could do then is
I could just say if I want to do is swap
I can just say swap the V next with the
production environment and they'll click
ok and that would swap these
environments live without interruption
from further service if anything goes
wrong I can just hit this what button
again and as I told you before all of
these can be done using api's and you
can have full you can have full out
scaling if you want to I'm not gonna
have time right now to show you the
Amazon lambda D equal service that we
have this collateral function but it's
there and it's really easy to integrate
with the github as well so I was going
to go with them over I integrated so
whenever someone put a comment in github
I would get some function call here but
let's do that next time so that that was
what I wanted to show you and hopefully
I open your mind that we can run a lot
of things on a more natural and
everything that you want to run there
can be automated if you want to and
please remember to rate the session and
that's about it great thank you thank
you
so we've gotten a couple of questions
the first one here is why would I pick
as your rather than one of the other
cloud providers what is in your opinion
the main reason to pick a sure yeah so
surprising wise would be there
surprising we're going on between the
three big ones and so surprising is not
like the biggest one the partnership
would probably be one of the most
obvious reason so Microsoft is there we
are we have we have emphasis in almost
all countries around the world we can
help you drive your business if you want
to there are some marketplace options
that would help in incentivize our
sellers to sell it someone else solution
if we want to a really big benefit that
we have is office so if you have any
kind of enterprise solution that
integrates with office in any way and I
active directory as the integration as
their authentication mechanism would be
also some of the really big drivers okay
so one of the things that you showed us
was a template yep the one that you
should have seemed rather long several
you know screens worth of JSON yep is is
that just a very complex template or is
there a way to provide saying defaults
for these values so we're having some
sort of inheritance or something like
that so there's there's no support for
inheritance inside the templates and
that would be quite a simple template
actually the one that we solved the one
we saw is one of the simple one if you
want to set up like a full elastic
search cluster on several machines that
would be much longer so the size of the
template really scales with the
complexity of what you're trying to do
yes so a simple circuit would be as
simple yeah to some fun but there there
are also very simple solutions if you
want to just deploy a Linux machine you
could do it as a one-liner you say make
my line tool if you want to okay so last
question here is that you mentioned
assure functions yeah what is the
defining difference between
AWS lambda and as your functions in your
opinion ah I I'm noted super expert on
that amazon product here but our our
solution is just out there so it's quite
new so i can't really tell you what
what's the exact differences are good
language reported that kind of thing so
we support with support c-sharp
javascript that is node we support bash
we support powershell we support mainly
languages and many more coming f sharp
as well so there's many more coming and
there's currently only a couple of
triggers there's the HTTP trigger
there's the blow the trigger there's
there's like 10 different triggers that
you can trigger on right now but it's
the same concept it's server less
services services here okay thank you
thank you much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
