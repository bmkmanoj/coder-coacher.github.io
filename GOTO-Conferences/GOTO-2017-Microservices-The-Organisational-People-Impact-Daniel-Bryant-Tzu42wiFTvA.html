this talk was actually only added to the
program I think on Sunday after I bumped
into ketone she asked me to do this one
so appreciate everyone turning up and so
those of you don't know me before I'll
excuse myself bit more in a second but
usually I do quite technical talks this
one is gonna be more around the kind of
strategy and leadership stuff so if any
of you saw me and Sunday I was talking
about Specter who I work for there but
this is based on her on a number of case
studies I've done a number of companies
I've worked with as a consultant over
the last say five years or so now I've
been working on what we call micro
services I was a CTO at one company
where we adopted micro services I then
became a consultant for Oakland credo
and then I ended up doing work with
Specter as well so I've been sort of
permanent and contract worked on many
different micro service projects and I
what I'm gonna try and sort of take try
and convey today and I'd like you to
kind of take away is that often with
micro services and the architecture
seems super interesting or the tech
seems super interesting but often lots
of problems follow from trying to adopt
those things and more often than not I
find it's actually a people problem now
ever hard wolf anyone knows ever heard
he tweeted the other day that the second
law of consulting is it's always a
people problem yeah doesn't matter what
you need before you doing and I
definitely found this as much as I like
to be a techie I identifies a Java
developer primarily and a lot of stuff I
do these days with consulting is
actually dealing with people issues and
I'm gonna try and share some stories of
projects I've worked on and mistakes
I've made successes I've had and so
forth the ideal goal would be if you
were to take away some things that you
could work with you know with your
company out with clients you work with
and not make the same mistakes as I've
made yeah we're all gonna make mistakes
this is why we do technology we love
learning and stuff but if I can
short-circuit some of the mistakes that
would be a win for me for today so many
problems appear problems but this is
good news because a lot of our business
friends have been working with this
stuff a longer time than we have Martin
opened the conference on Sunday software
development is a relatively new field
yeah
68 kind of came into being business has
been going on for much much longer so I
think
we can borrow stuff from the business
world and kind of bring it into our work
our workers technologists where whoever
or however you identify you know team
lead architect QA operator take your
pick
I think there's things we can learn by
looking at our business friends very
quickly this is me at Daniel Bryant on
the Twitter's I love getting involved on
Twitter's hashtag go to your CPH here as
well I work primarily as a consultant
I'm also doing a CTO role expecto as
well which I won't talk about loads
today but if you're looking with for
microservice training or products around
and Michael Cera is testing we're doing
that kind of stuff I primarily do Java
staff bit of ops as well a lot of
architecture these days really into
continuous delivery I really see this as
a genuine enabler in projects regardless
of technology or or regardless of
architecture continuous delivery is
really key and I've actually I've
written a book that's available free on
the left there there one with container
izing continuous delivery in Java and
for my sins I'm working on a full book
that will be out next year and that kind
of tries to capture more the technical
lessons that I'm gonna be sharing with
you today and sort of the technical side
of these lessons let's jump straight in
it's important to note that any
technology goes through a series of sort
of adoption phases and they call this
the diffusion of innovation now people
familiar with diffusion of innovation at
all sort of see a few nods but yeah so
basically what it says is typically
pioneers you know innovators that work
on the technology then sort of early
adopters pick it up and then this is
moment where things cross the chasm now
whole lot of Technology never makes that
jump it never moves into the early
majority the late majority that's the
kind of mainstream yeah
with micro services you could say
Netflix were pretty much the innovators
Adrian we saw earlier today they were
pretty innovative early adopters kind of
companies I've worked with and now I
think microservices are very much here
they've crossed the chasm they're pretty
much accepted as a pattern but it's it's
sort of it's interesting to note the
journey we're going on as kind of the
industry looks and sort of picks up the
thing it picks up the actual concepts
around the thing which is micro services
in this case one of the challenges we've
got is we're taking technical cues from
people in the innovator and early
adopters they
like Netflix and so forth and then not
always suitable those things for where
we are at now and we actually seem
vendors who are kind of in the late
majority trying to pull people in with
micro service friendly tools so there's
this constant pull and push from both
sides here we are firmly in I think the
early adopter space but our problems are
different than when you're in the kind
of innovative space where you're making
stuff up as you go along compared to the
late majority and if anyone was in
Adrienne's keynote Adrienne talks about
Simon Wardley stuff which I like a lot
and it's basically pioneers settlers
where we are now and town planners come
later yeah so we are very much settlers
most of us working on micro services now
are settlers but that means there's too
much information
too much too many products and this
makes our job as technical leaders and
I'm assuming doesn't matter if you've
got the leader in your job title but the
fact you're at a conference is you want
to learn more you're leading to some
degree yeah so you know I think all of
us are technical leaders we have to bear
where we are in this curve in mind key
things I'd like to sort of share today
around this and you know case studies
and stuff is the three key things I
found super an official one was crate
and share the strategy and the tactics
we're implementing to was optimized for
feedback yeah and three was defined
responsibilities particularly around
who's doing what and particularly around
the platform because micro services push
a lot of complexity into the platform
into the communication we're taking
complexity that was - no it's it's
needed complexity but it used to be in
our monolith or sowe're or whatever and
now that that complexity doesn't
disappear it gets pushed typically into
the platform into the orchestration into
the coordination these kind of things so
thinking about responsibilities of you
know I'm a developer am I responsible
for that your QA where's your
responsibility these things are really
important it was a great talk on Sunday
that talked about situational awareness
and I'm a big fan of this kind of
strategy is really important you know
even if we identify purely as
technologists strategy is really
important you've got to ask yourself you
know if it getting excited about micro
services doc or whatever it
really a good fit for our organization
yeah
our Mike reservist is good and I've seen
a couple of antipatterns on projects
I've worked on where middle management
have kind of latched on to this buzzword
yeah micro services and their managers
have asked them you know are you now
doing micro services and if you say like
if they say no there's gonna be problems
so they kind of they co-opt things they
you know they say I'll just chuck it in
docker that'll be a micro service yeah
put an API on it that'll be no micro
service and it's what we say in the UK
it's lipstick on the pig yeah
fundamentally it kind of you know it
looks it may look a little better but
it's still not great behind the scenes
yeah from an architectural practice I
see a lot of people that don't really
understand
Micra services are not just smaller
services yeah you know building around
business functionality is critical with
micro services if you haven't looked at
domain driven design totally recommend
checking that out I think it's really a
key principle of building self-contained
systems you know systems that are and
services that are based around your
domain model boundary contexts as they
often referred to in the domain driven
design world bear in mind this whole
platform thing you you really don't want
to create mini monoliths and we'll
explore this a bit more in a minute
but bear in mind things like the 12
factors Heroku created this guideline
for deploying services onto paths called
the twelve factors there's a whole
website dedicated to it very interesting
gent based in the US I think called
Kevin Hoffman has got a very nice a
Reilly book that's free called beyond
the 12 factors and he talks about three
other factors that are really good when
we're building kind of cloud native
which is a another buzzword I appreciate
but when we're building these kind of
services that are going to be deployed
in the cloud and stuff and with
containers we need to bear things like
the the new architectural practices like
12 factors in mind and lastly I see in
my travels a lot DevOps is a another
massively abused buzzword yeah I see
DevOps meaning everything from a
developer with root access to production
pretty much yeah which can be quite
dangerous I've been there and but also
through to massive change control where
people are kind of you got to fit all
these forms out before you can get stuff
in DevOps is big almost like micro
services and best things is becoming a
little bit watered down
but the practice the principles behind
DevOps are really important to micro
services particularly from a technical
leadership point of view so ask yourself
you know our micro services you know
goodness solve your problems are they
gonna help your business this is a
really critical question and it's
something I've struggled with him as my
role when I was a CTO as a technical
leader I really had to think hard about
these questions I had to take ownership
of this because I've been there when I
started my career I was always keen to
learn the latest tech and the latest
fads but now I'm in a technical
leadership role I'm more responsible to
the business I have to look for the
business value as well as the technical
value whereas hinting at their is one of
the anti patents I see is the kind of
micro silver bullets yeah you know we
think a bunch of things collectively in
our industry are silver bullets
sometimes and I see this kind of you
know there's no well-defined goals or
strategies but micro services must be
the answer yeah and this is you know
know we need to think about things like
defining our business growl goals we as
technical leaders need to communicate
that down through to our teams these
kind of things and we need to choose
hypotheses and create metrics and
validate and cheat you know this and
choosing the tech is a big part of that
so what are our goals well you know this
wind it down a little bit clearly as a
business we are delivering some form of
value to our users yeah and Adrian
Cockroft talks a lot about this but
velocity is a key thing or business
agility it's a key thing being able to
react and compete our competitors in
terms of change it's pretty much where
it's at today
net net flix and Adrian are really the
poster children of that kind of stuff
yeah they did so well because they had
completed blockbuster who by all
accounts should have basically you know
walked over Netflix with their kind of
capital investment and their people
involved but Netflix just stormed ahead
because they had business agility for us
that's pretty much safer and more rapid
and safer and more rapid changes to
software systems I think we can agree is
this you know technical leaders as their
forth we will ourselves and help our
team to do more rapid changes but in a
safe fashion this is really key and I'm
gonna be no bit controversial maybe but
I'm gonna say before you even look at
things like micro services think about
continuous delivery
that for me is the first thing to look
at can I get ideas quickly into
production safely I can do it with the
monolith let's see do it
Stack Overflow it's basically a c-sharp
monolith yeah with a couple of really
meaty databases on the backend I'm sure
we go to stack overflow daily pretty
much as tech people yeah but a lot of
problems can be solved really nicely
with the monolith but they've really
invested in the CIN CD Etsy and Stack
Overflow are really awesome of this
stuff think about you know shared
ownership DevOps and think about
something called value stream mapping
I'm not gonna go into that loads today
another slide in a minute but think
about the journey basically off idea to
adding value in production where really
is your bottleneck is it in architecture
yeah or is it maybe in design or is it
maybe in it's getting things signed off
look for where your bottlenecks are and
target them once you have identified
these things things like situational
awareness knowing what the landscape is
of both our technology internally and
the industry we're working in in general
is super critical and adrien colleagues
that are fantastic and slide deck here
based on some assignment Ward ease work
about the pioneers and so forth settlers
and town planners and Simon Worley does
a lot of what's called mapping Wardley
mapping and hadrian basically has mapped
out here what the micro service and
container ecosystem will look like
potentially over the next few years
where are the signals in the market
where are people investing in tooling
where are people investing in
architectural practices and I'm not
gonna do it justice by going into it
today but if you're interested in
understanding at a big picture from
where the industry is going and where
technology is going
Simon Worley has got a really awesome
blog and several awesome techniques that
I use Adrienne uses a bunch of
interesting people use value streams are
this Phil cansado who used to work at
SoundCloud now at link addy and buoyant
and basically said the reason SoundCloud
went to micro services is they created
their value stream they realized you
know the agility was being blocked by
certain processes that micro services
could definitely help with and therefore
they went all-in on micro services we've
got to understand where we are and
they're map it to where we want to go
where we want to go and I'm not gonna
spend a long time on this but we need to
think about defining goals you know both
on the business point of view and
point of view and there's plenty of
documentation on this online you kind of
know SMART goals and pick you sort of
pick your strategy but the key thing I
want to share is something I've worked
on a lot of companies where my Cristeros
transitions or migrations haven't gone
that well it's because they've been
driven by one side and not the other and
when I say one side I mean they've
either been driven purely by development
or they've been driven purely by
management yeah and there's been a
massive disconnect in the middle
particularly around architecture and
technical leadership so what I've often
worked with companies this is actually
I've Obvious skated it a little bit for
privacy reasons but this is based on a
genuine map I worked with people on
where we basically got key stakeholders
from the business you know c-level
people from some technical leaders and
also from people who are in the trenches
coding as well and we said what's our
overall business goals you know Labor's
basically you know a supporting entry
into new global markets and supporting
innovation these kind of things and then
we mapped it down into an architectural
level and we realized that by breaking
certain things out we could deploy them
independently so micro-services would
help us on this goal and then the team
were like well we want to do everything
in Ruby and there was some debate we'll
do we really want to invest just in one
language to fit solve every problem and
some other people expressed interest in
learning Java and JavaScript and there
were some people that were already
experts in that so then we said will
actually create a small lightweight
architectural council and when a service
kind of comes up we want to pull some
functionality out of the monolith will
actually have a very small controlled
debate on what language we should use
and it's only going to be it like a
couple because we're not going to
support loads of languages but basically
the developers could look at what we
sort of agreed as you know design and
delivery practices and they could map it
up stream to why they were doing what
they were doing and vice versa now when
we heard things like in the management
suite like you know docker and
kubernetes and met micro services they
knew what that sort of meant they knew
it meant independent deployability I
knew it meant independent scalability it
helped with the communications yeah it's
kind of like if you were familiar with
domain driven design there's a concept
of a ubiquitous language being able to
speak the same language and this is
really critical speaking the same
language and things like empathy and
I've heard that in the other track
they're herding cats track empathy super
super important
but communication is closely related to
that but you need to have a common
framework to build that empathy build
that communication I think the role of
architect is is changing and I take a
lot of my cues from Pat Cooper who's
actually at the conference and also
Simon Brown around this stuff and when I
play the role of an architect now it's
more my mind technical leadership and
that's promoting shared understanding
coming back to the communication stuff
again it's about risk management if I'm
building docker stuff and do I want to
bring kubernetes in the stack maybe I do
maybe I don't
but it's all about risk management and
there's this very nice notion that Dan
McKinley talks about called innovation
tokens and basically you give yourself a
number of tokens on your each year and
you spend them when you bring new things
into the stack so it stops you bringing
in all amounts of crazy technology so
that's one way of sort of doing risk
management just enough upfront design is
something I've struggled with throughout
my career
to be honest I've over engineered
systems and I've under under engineered
systems at times with microservices you
need to do just enough upfront design
and that typically revolves around the
boundaries the interfaces and the
domains your modeling and the glue
between them that's if you're gonna
spend any time designing you know maybe
you've got a greenfield project or
you're migrating a brownfield project
spend a bit of time doing things like
context mapping it's a really nice
technique from domain driven design
context mapping you can also do things
like event storming there's a whole
bunch of different techniques but they
help us as technologists understand the
business domains better this is really
key for you know the upfront design
Conway's law as web bingo Jack you know
comment got a say Conway's law at micro
service talk but it's well accepted it
come with you know it's almost become a
bit cliched what's not so clear is where
architects sit in this role in my
experience some I've had some projects
where they've done the kind of you know
squads chapters and all that kind of
stuff and then they still have
Enterprise architects up in the ivory
tower I think the really for me the best
use of architects in this role is it
more of a consultative role many product
teams but consulting architects helping
people another key thing I've seen in
the couple of migrations is we're a non
tech person is leading the team
that's very popular in a lot of squad
models you have like a product owner who
is typically non techie and we're a
migration the technical stuff often gets
deferred because the product owner is
incentivized based on business outcomes
which is great but there's a constant
friction business outcomes typically a
short-term staff and architecture is
more for the long term so my
recommendation is to have architects in
a consultative role that kind of move
around the teams and help these things
but pair product owners with technical
leads and they have the same weight
these things are really critical so
basically if a product owners saying we
need to get this business thing out
tomorrow the tech lead might have a chat
and go yeah I agree we'll get it out
tomorrow that that's fine but sometimes
the techne lead needs to push back and
say no if we don't invest now two months
down the line you know we're gonna leave
you doing a massive rewrite you need to
balance the product ownership and a
technical ownership and it's really hard
I'm not gonna lie but definitely pear
tech leads with product owners in scrum
like team squad like teams otherwise it
kind of leads to this anti-pattern it's
a bit of technical insanity I've been
brought into some projects where it's
got a bit messy with a monolith and they
try to do micro services but six months
later it's exactly the same with many
more things yeah because we're applying
the same kind of patterns the product
owner is in charge
the product owner always wins we don't
invest in architecture the micro
services kind of get a bit crafty we
need strong technical leadership is the
key takeaway not easy to say not so easy
to do sometimes in organisations
shifting gears a little bit but I found
this and this stuff really useful so if
you're bringing in micro services to an
organization often you're bringing in
new technology to some degree and you
might be carving your codebase now into
many different repositories many
different things and the concept of open
source I'm sure many of you nearly all
of us have hope a really into open
source and things like you know github
and Apache and that kind of stuff
there's a very thing from PayPal and
PayPal took the ideas of open source and
brought it into their Enterprise and
they've called it inner source yeah and
I think Diana forgotten her surname
apologies Diane but she's really awesome
speaker she's created some wicked and
PayPal resources there's a free
look you can get now and it talks about
how to adopt some of the open source
ideas into your organization and I find
them really useful with working big
enterprises who are suddenly you know
carving up them on lift and bring in new
tech some of the things from inner
source and I'll call them out a stuff
that you we probably take for granted
because we're at a conference and we're
interrupting source and stuff but many
enterprise developers and I totally
respect this they nine-to-five job and
they don't read the perhaps external
stuff don't come to conferences or not
allowed to come to conferences but
sharing these kind of things these kind
of models really help and it's stuff
like and you know you you code basically
in the open
you know you code like in a repo and you
allow other teams to look at your code
as silly as that sounds I've worked in
enterprises where one team was not under
how to look at the code of another team
so break down the walls and share you
know all the things that the principles
cuz open source is distributed by nature
you rely on open code you rely on
constantly running see ICD because you
never know if a patch coming in is
genuinely gonna work
so bring all all these things in to the
enterprise under the banner of inner
source so there's some fantastic
resources I can't really do it just this
in this time this presentation is a
little bit of a brain dump of stuff I
found useful in my my journey of the
last five or so years and in an
enterprise in a source can be really
interesting to gonna drive a lot of
change drive a lot of collaboration now
within an enterprise that might not be
there another problem I bump into quite
a bit is evaluating tooling and I've
been in quite a fire had to referee a
few em discussions over docker versus
rocket go versus Java tabs versus space
that kind of stuff yeah and for me like
Jessica mentioned this in a keynote
yesterday I where I'm at my career I
really don't care about tabs and Stacy's
anymore I care about consistency for
sure and same with technology I'm a Java
developer but I do go as well like you
know whatever pick the right tool for
their job but we often get stuck this is
a very interesting model I bumped into a
couple of years ago at a conference
we often get stuck at dogmatic
conversations you know I identify as a
Java developer therefore I can only do
Java you know these kind of things and
this model you can look at it more
online but it talks about if you
recognize as a technical leader your
team again
stuck in the kind of tooling area where
we as humans are very good at tools yeah
you need to walk up the spine until you
can identify what the real problem is so
with the jaw for example it was such a
veces go and like then we sort of walked
up a stack and we looked at the
practices and principles and the
organization actually really valued a
very strong tool chain just the way the
developers were really into like heavy
IDs and lots of processes and that's
what they valued and we looked at the
kind of current state of tooling in Java
versus go and to the jar jar the tool
chain at this time we were looking at it
was much stronger than the go tool chain
yeah but I've worked on another project
where they were looking to do and very
resource like a very lightweight
resource driven their business model
based was based on how much resource
they were consuming in the cloud and
their go was a perfect fit because we
could compile it down to really small
binaries and run it run you know
hundreds of go processes on it on an ec2
instance so but you need to go up the
spine and make sure what we're really
optimizing for here what all right what
is our organization organization good at
bad at and you know often it goes right
the way up to the needs what do we as an
organization need we need strong tooling
therefore Java as an example these kind
of things it's a nice model I found too
it just jogs me when I'm having these
conversations that I see we're getting
stuck I suddenly go moved up the spine
and that's our jobs as leaders I think
be aware though there is it it's very
easy to fall into things like
confirmation bias yeah I realized I am
but we're having a discussion around
Java and go here I like Java so you know
I might be googling is Java still good
in 2017 well that's a biased query
basically yeah you know if I example if
docker bad in production I get that
article if I search for is docker good I
get that article yeah
confirmation bias is is everywhere I've
got a whole presentation on bias
actually and and it is easy to be
tricked yeah so if I was to get a little
bit of audience participation if I was
to give you three choices and say and
which line is bigger top line bottom
line or they're both the same size and
who thinks the top line is bigger quick
show of hands got a few cool who thinks
the bottom line is bigger no one new
things they're both the same size so the
majority thing about the same size I've
actually tricked you in that this is the
top line is their gear and because a lot
of you've seen this before it's a
classic op
illusion yeah and again we are clever
people we like silly technologists we
like to identify as clever people and
I'm no no different yeah but it's so
easy to be tricked you know think about
vendors are doing this stuff all the
time like it is what it is I've been a
vendor and the vendor now I guess but be
aware of these things be aware of your
own biases Lee it's a bias II can't
completely eliminate it but just be
aware of how you're searching for things
how you're evaluating things this is
really critical and I don't say this
lightly I read a lot of books I love
reading and I had a long commute to my
old job but I bumped into this book
several years ago now and it was one
book that genuinely changed my life not
just development changed my life yeah it
talks through the way we humans think it
talks about system one system two you
may have bumped into those concepts and
like system one is he kind of you fast
reactive brain your reptilian brain and
you and the system too is your neocortex
the human bits and they're constantly in
conflict and it's just a fantastic read
and I suddenly understood myself a lot
better and I understood people I was
working with a lot better so this is a
fantastic book and it gets getting some
cheap laughs at conferences which is
great as well we good for comedy but so
wrapping these things up the ante pan
here is is you know not thinking about
all these things I've just mentioned and
perhaps as an example blindly copying
tech from companies that appear
successful without doing your due
diligence without thinking what you know
where are we in that kind of spy model
and you need to learn about the
principles practices and cultures that
have driven those tech decisions now if
you chat to Adrian he'll freely share
this stuff with you in terms of Netflix
they were optimizing for a certain bunch
of problems in speed autonomy these
things and it led to the Netflix OSS
toolchain but if he was optimizing for
something else it may have been
different what popped out at the end in
terms of Netflix stuff so and Netflix
are very awesome they've actually this
culture Dec if you haven't looked at it
check it out you can get a flavor of
what Netflix value and when you
understand what they value you can see
it often in their tools yeah so just be
aware and Twitter up to optimize very
different things in Netflix say so if
you bring on the finagle stack be aware
you're bringing in a bit of Twitter into
your organization that can I think so
moving on into feedback a visibility and
constant learning are super super
important
anyone who's them looked into this or
the devops stuff you get the three ways
a DevOps handbook and the Phoenix
project talked a lot about these things
but in my mind feedback is vital on many
levels but definitely today we're going
to discuss business architecture and
operations there are the things in my
journeys with micro services I've sort
of struggled with a bit from a business
level sometimes just making things
visible is genuinely revolutionary I
worked on some startups where we this is
called dashing framework is for the open
source framework I I create some real
simple graphs with my team and we put
these on monitors on the wall and and
the CEO that has changed the business
overnight he could now he was a lot more
focused he could understand you know
impacts of his decisions on revenue you
know in real time and all these things
and it just changed the connection
between the CEO and the dev team so
simple things but making these things
visible in real time can be really
empowering for technical and
non-technical people and I think micro
services if you're going in that
direction yeah it's quite a big
investment in in terms of tech and
architecture you need to you know there
should be business driven and you need
to bake in the tooling that allows this
upfront so metrics and signals baked
into the services and baked into the
platform kind of from day one yeah it
allows validation of hypotheses are we
getting to market quicker are we am
earning more revenue when we pushed out
this new check out these kind of things
and and I saw a few so I'm sure a few of
you saw
yonas Bonaire talk about like Bend and
this is like an awesome presentation by
them they talked about at Walmart's how
they saw a revolution in terms of
business impact when they started doing
things they all they migrated to micro
services but they started monitoring a
lot of things they started adding
metrics and being a much more
data-driven organization now if you chat
to anyone from Amazon and AWS I always
enjoy talking chancay do best people the
two things that you'll you walk away
from any conversation with them is they
are massively customer focused everyone
like from you know from right from the
way up bottom to top super super
customer focused and not only are they
customer focused but they're metric
driven
yeah they care about the customer but
they care about measuring their impact
yeah this is from Jeff besos all the way
down kind of thing and
super valuable you need to share these
things throughout the organization so if
you're working in a corner on
microservices and some other business
units thinking are they're wasting their
time playing with docker letters stuff
you need to share the hypotheses share
the metrics of success and these kind of
things same thing from an architectural
point of view and so as you were doing a
migration it's really important sort of
keep the lights on or you know keep the
monolith or whatever ticking along and
you need to make sure that the
architecture the monolith is not
degrading and also the architecture of
the micro-services is not degrading as
things move on as well excuse me one
second hmm so it's really important to
look for feedback in many different ways
now on the left is a fantastic book atom
torn hill if you haven't seen him speak
please try and find his stuffy zetas a
TED speaker he's done TED talks he's
done I'm very lucky I've met at many
conferences he's talked of awesome book
treat your code as a crime scene which I
think says it all done it but many of my
codes have been crime scenes so but what
you look at it what that diagram that
taught me look like is it made it like a
city block yell at in New York or
something that's actually a code base
yeah and the blocks the city blocks are
modules or packages the the high-rise
things the width is the amount of code
and the height might be the complexity
the cyclomatic complexity and the color
is the churn from the get logs you can
look in the get logs and see how much
people are committing to the code base
yeah so you can see there tall buildings
that are wide and dark blue are areas of
a lot of code high complexity and high
churn these are the areas that we spend
all our days hacking in basing it yeah
so you might be candidates for micro
services you might want to pull it out
figure out what's going on there or you
might want to stay well away yeah but
the point being is you've got that
feedback you know what's going on in
your code base things like code climates
sonar cube pick you know whatever
language that you're using pick some of
these chuck them in your build pipeline
get that feedback are we introducing
more coupling as we're going along these
kind of things it's really important to
monitor this stuff all the way through
and lastly look at your architecture
overall I don't watch them
Krissi's talked earlier on about lambda
and he was talking about using things
like x-ray ad breast x-ray and Zipkin to
understand your architecture please do
otherwise it does tend towards the death
star yeah
and Netflix and you know and guilting
Twitter can probably get away with it
but they have whole departments
dedicated to running this stuff most of
us are not that lucky yeah so think
about things like an architectural
complexity you need to set up the key
takeaway from this slide is set up
things to allow monitoring of
architectural quality of code quality
and of the architecture in general the
anti-pattern I see even you know silly
without feedback we even with feedback
is that what I call the Trojan mono
service it's all too easy for a monolith
to creep back in somewhere yeah and a
big hat tip to Matthew Skelton fellow
Londoner and he's got this fantastic
presentation online which I've linked to
and he talks about the four types of
software monolith there's the first one
the application monolith we all know and
love or know and hate and joined at the
data base I've worked on many projects
there where as effectively a monolith
because have you changed the database it
rippled through the entire application
but he also talks about monolithic
releases yeah that's you know your
couple basically if you have to deploy
several services in one go it's pretty
much a distributed monolith yeah and not
only are you're not getting benefits
because you know of going to micro
services because you have to deploy them
all in one go or many in one go but
you're paying what's called micro
service tax you're communicating over
the wire you're defining your network
network boundaries so it's a watch out
for those kind of things and the last
one I didn't didn't get it until I saw
actually the company but there's
monolithic thinking there's taking all
the mistakes we've made collectively
with previous projects and applying it
to the new ones so the one I see quite a
bit is people creating the perfect micro
service framework yeah
they spend all their time they've got
spring but I do love spring boot work
for example so they've got spring boot
and they layer on all these things
because the previous projects failed
because you know there was some problem
and they kind of take their learnings
and apply them and they spend a lot of
time making this kind of perfect system
but it's very monolithic in its thinking
although it sort of looks loosely
coupled from what micro services it's
monolithic thinking and again if I
haven't been super clear there check out
Matthew's talk he's a bit clearer than I
am on this stuff when I saw it was a
really good talk but the key thing is
continually retrospect on technical work
using supporting metrics
yeah are we reducing coupling are we
getting faster
are we deploying quicker these kind of
things operational vision changing tack
a little bit but an operational
visibility is super important allowing
for operational feedback if you're not
into em logging on monitoring I think
our jobs has developers these days you
kind of have to get a bit more familiar
with that you have to know how to log
things effectively and monitor and a lot
of companies are moving to things like
dev on call where we as developers are
responsible for on call support and I
actually like that it's not super
popular organizations I work out but I
like it a lot but these are tips I've
found these articles really useful for
understanding or I'll share the
presentation later I think the guys
already got it actually but check out
these and these things but having this
sort of feedback is when bad things
happen people are always involved yeah I
personally like to be this person when
bad things are happening yeah I
personally like to be good oh yeah got
under control a beer down yeah um jokes
all jokes aside this is fantastic if you
haven't seen this it's actually in the
Google sre book now the site reliability
book but I bumped into it a few years
ago where Mikey Dickson did a fantastic
talk at one of the Q cons and he talked
about monkey Dickson came in and saved
an healthcare.gov people familial
healthcare.gov in the US was crazy bad
when President Obama was president good
times yeah back in the day and what he
was president unfortunetely
healthcare.gov didn't go quite to plan
so they brought in a bunch of experts
from Google and from man a noreagaaa
Keenan when in she did a fantastic work
Mikey came in from somewhere else a cat
remember and it basically he formed you
know they helped save healthcare.gov and
he formed this much like Maslow's
hierarchy of needs
you know Maslow's hierarchy of needs you
have like food and water all the way up
to self-actualization he basically said
you know you need monitoring in the
bottom you need the basic kind of probes
into your system but after that it's all
people yeah how do we handle when fire
alarms going off how do we react I think
is leaders how do we how we react
influences our team massively massively
so we need to think about things like do
like Adrian said this morning I really
like Asians pitch of doing game days a
lot of companies doing this stuff now
like Google Earth the inspiration and
these kind of things nori talks about
this stuff a lot but game days are
really a good idea just this you know
trigger stuff and see how people react
because I know myself you can plan in
your mind how we're gonna react but when
stuff really goes wrong then you really
get to find out google apparently like
normally said this at a talk actually I
saw that Google do genuinely do
real-life cows monkey they go into a
data center and start putting at cables
and they check the right person gets
paged they check people follow through
their drills all these kind of things
if it becomes customer affecting they
put the cables back in really quickly
but in general they they really like
real-life cows monkey stuff to check all
these things yeah you know it's all
about the people
baseline monitoring understanding system
but then how do um react to it you need
to do honest post mortems
yeah on these kind of things and then
testing and and so forth I think I know
one story out well
finally story I would let's say let's
share that Mikey told us is that he went
into Internet to the healthcare.gov
system like when in the first day and it
was all like you know the system was on
fire it was the healthcare.gov was
constantly crashing coming back up and
he went into the team and he said to
them um you know I need to get a handle
on this monitoring stuff how do you know
when the system is down and then the
Perrineau the dev team like looked up in
the corner and pointed at this monitor
in the corner of the room yeah Mike he
was like awesome
probably got Nagios or some kind of
graphs and he walked over to the monitor
and he realized it was CNN was a news
channel when they reported it was down
they went and rebooted it yeah it's a
bit a pocket all that one but I think
it's a great story yes and you know the
not the norm becomes the norm and it's
bad stuff you need to get proper
monitoring in a little bit of
standardization does go a long way now
automation is always the goal micro
services are about numbers about scale
but we need to figure the problems out
we need to have these responses and
these post-mortems and all these kind of
things and these are my references for
this and I like checklists when I'm
looking to automate things I like to
build checklists to see what I'm going
to automate Susan's book is fantastic
it's so it's not so well known as
perhaps say Sam's book but it's a really
nice book it's more of a conceptual she
was actually working at uber at the time
this book was written and it's really
nice and model of how they did
checklists both from an architectural
point of view operational point of view
and and for me and it's a great talk she
did at the micro services and summit and
providing some level of standardization
not going so far as we're doing kind of
monolithic thinking but some
level of standardization helps us figure
out you know two processes helps us
figure out what to automate and how to
automate the take over this bit of
section really is that micro services do
enable agility when they're done well
yeah and we need to build measure learn
bacon signals both from a business point
for my business point of view from an
architectural point of view and
definitely from a operational point of
view as well because if you don't
collect the data take action and change
the way you're working you're probably
going to have the same thing built but
smaller yeah the same problems you've
got are going to be in micro services
but you need to build measure and learn
and these things are all about defining
goals metrics and recording and you know
the data excuse me and taking action on
the data it's a really key so about 10
minutes left so yeah final section is
responsibilities now the phrase in
American phrase is the buck always stops
somewhere and I hear this a lot of my
own as a consultant I go in and I say
you know people want help with their
technology and I say great I'd like to
look at your business problem though and
your team organization because it's all
in my mind it's all one thing as a
consultant and you can say it's just a
technology problem I don't trust you so
I want to see the whole thing but they
go no no it's okay we've got the people
thing organized we decided to reform our
team around squads chapters and guilds
I'm sure people recognize that there the
phrase yeah it's Spotify and I love
Spotify dearly but beware of what we
call cargo coltan yeah and if you're not
familiar the reference Google it's worth
having a little read about this but
beware of blindly copying yeah repeat to
yourself no we are not Spotify yeah we
are not Google if you look at the
principles practices and values buying
Spotify and they are very generous they
have shared their values and principles
and buy a couple of awesome videos you
will realize that Spotify are optimizing
for innovation yeah if you can
out-compete a fellow music streamer
innovations good and they're optimizing
for and autonomy as well if things fall
over see music streaming service
whatever you know long as we're kind of
were loosely aligned and innovating we
probably win in the end now if I'm
building a nuclear reactor or building
software for a nuclear reactor the last
two words I want to hear our innovation
and autonomy yeah I want standards I
want people following
yeah so you've got to think a bit of a
trivial quip I'm making here but I
genuinely see this in organisations
where they've just picked Spotify stuff
without any thought as to whether it
fits to their organisation and it's
crazy that sounds it happens it's really
true
DevOps kind of maps into this as well
and the Spotify thing often Spotify
don't talk much they have started more
now she but they don't talk much about
their platform team and if you're
building micro services there is always
a platform involved and I like the idea
of having a platform squad or a platform
team and I found Matti Skelton stuff he
talks about some anti patterns in the
red and some good patterns in blue of
how to do DevOps and DevOps is primarily
around at least in this model and shared
responsibility and part of this is where
does the platform begin and end there's
so many different models popping out
there is DevOps there's sre from google
as best different things but if you're
looking at the Spotify model and you're
looking about how to and support your
micro service migration think about the
platform you're probably going to be
deploying on to a kubernetes or an ECS
or something and then this notion of
shared responsibility is vital so as
anyone affected by sort of riffing on
the same theme but anyone affected by
the gitlab issues it was like January
time get lab basically it's like a host
did you know and github kind of thing a
Enterprise one they've got a public
offering it went down in January and
they actually lost data not loads but
they lost a bit of data yeah and there
was super honest there post-mortem hat
tip to them it very graphically
describes what went wrong and why they
you know the mission critical system
yeah build systems people are trusting
them with their code it's like we say in
the UK it's like trusting someone with
your crown jewels it's like super
important yeah and and one of the things
they put in there in there and post
mortem was a key thing here why is so
basically system went down and the
backups also failed the backups you know
failed to cut in and it says there why
was the backup procedure not tested on a
regular basis because there was no
ownership no one owned the backup
everyone just assumed the backup would
work yeah and that for me I've seen this
many times before
what kind of knocks me a little bit
annoys me a little bit is they've got
their recovery procedures and the
remediation steps they're taking a
number 14 number 14 is a sign and owner
that for me is number one unless I have
someone owning his stuff it's gonna
happen again
probably in there so think about as in
giving people appropriate ownership
within DevOps is key to often I do see
DevOps as being a bit of a free-for-all
I joked at the start about don't you
know developer with root access
but DevOps is about shared
responsibilities but it's about
responsibilities they need to be you
know clearly shared but people need to
be accountable otherwise it's a
free-for-all
yeah and you know I'm poking fun a
little bit of gitlab but also the you
know they're very generous for sharing
the post-mortem and I really appreciate
that
but these things you know it just shows
if you if you don't assign ownership
stuff slips through the cracks when
you're starting your kind of Micra
service journey or your DevOps journey I
often use things like racy racy is a
old-school project management technique
but it and in the racy stands for
responsible accountable consulted and
informed and you basically can go
through your organization and des sort
of discuss who is responsible for the
platform who is responsible for the seei
CD pipeline who do I need to inform if I
change these things who do I consult if
I want to change the build process it's
a slightly strict way of doing it it
doesn't seem that DevOps but it can be a
nice way to get started we we're not
looking to blame people what we are
looking to understand who is accountable
who is responsible for various things
within this within the system yeah and
RACI can be a good start is something
you hopefully grow out of and you we
know move into bigger systems but RACI
can be an interesting way to understand
DevOps and start increasing the shared
responsibility so in terms of you know
DevOps and defining responsibility focus
on what matters in terms of endeavors
and I really do think that all the
develop stuff me starts with continuous
integration and continuous delivery
continuous delivery pipelines add so
much value and they kind of quip I like
to use is how much value does
non-deployed code provide to users
how much Manning's non-deployed code
zero yeah and that is a universal unit
of value yeah if your code is just
sitting there is not providing value to
users be careful you know then the need
to kind of iterate and so forth and
sometimes tempting to want to create the
perfect thing yeah before getting
feedback before pushing it out there and
particular people are not responsible
they can often be in their own little
silos building the perfect
I've seen people try to create perfect
kind of platforms Sassy's perfect
documentation and and they're just
building continually on under ployed and
untested assumptions and because they're
not accountable responsible it just
happened I've seen genuinely I've seen
projects go on six months a year where
they've made really no progress because
the individual silos are just building
platform building a micro Service
chassis documenting stuff and there's no
kind of overall holistic ownership the
mindset change is key so looking at
things like continuous delivery Dan
North talks about the dancing skeleton
basically dancing skeleton is getting
the simplest thing possible all the way
from dev to production Dan's got some
great talks on it you can have a search
on those they're really good but this
notion of responsibilities and
continually testing our assumptions is
really valuable so final couple of
slides as microservices my experience do
create a lot of change and I think we as
technologists can learn a lot from from
business people and over the last few
years I've started reading things like
HBR Harvard Business Review and for me
as a techie they're quite digestible but
there's some really nice and papers they
write and really nice articles they do
that talk about how we need how to
manage change because fundamentally if
you're bringing in microservices devops
docker kubernetes you're changing things
yeah and my experience early on in my
career is I didn't know the impact of
these changes I didn't know how to how
to lead them how to manage them and I've
learned a lot from from these kind of
references so I'd highly recommend
checking it out and my sort of final
book recommendation is is this by John
Kotter it's about leading change I've
seen a few micro service systems kind of
micro service migrations start up and
then die off and start up and die off
and the book is it's a more generic
approach to leading change but I can't
directly map it to a lot of projects I
worked on you need to establishing a
sense of urgency create a kind of group
of people they're gonna be responsible
for developing the strategy and pushing
it forward and then you empower people
on the front line you kind of iterate on
success is these kind of things and
appreciate am dumping a lot of books at
you here but wherever you are on your
journey as an individual and within your
company try and pick one or something of
them and if you're on a micro sized
migration starting one think about how
much change your company is going
through
and if the company's struggling might be
worth reading some of these things just
to understand you know businesses have
been doing this stuff there's a whole
management consultancy practices doing
exactly this stuff so wrapping up
strategies kind of the takeaways are
insure smart goals and accompanying
strategies are defined and communicated
this kind of stuff is about big
strategic goals empathy with your
customers empathy within the
organization but then communication why
are we doing this
start with why it's really important I
think architecture is now more about
technical leadership and risk management
so if you're a classic architects you
might want to rethink your role a little
bit communication now is super important
being hands-on is super important you
know architects must code in my mind to
develop that empathy choosing tooling is
you know it's really key but again if
you're a leader think about where you're
coming from think about the spy model
are you choosing tools based on the
practices based on the needs of the
company rather than what's cool yeah we
all get sort of suck it into that
sometimes feedback is vital feedback you
know from a business point of view from
an architecture from an Operations point
of view optimize whatever you're doing
in micro services for visibility and
learning yeah
and it's throughout the organizational
stack there and responsibilities you
know DevOps is a little bit
misunderstood sometimes I think we can
learn a lot from Conway and Netflix and
Spotify but don't just blindly copy what
they do look into the principles
practices look into where your
organization's at these kind of things
and and then take away what you will
yeah don't cargo cult don't blindly copy
I think DevOps done right is a
prerequisite for micro services Martin
Fowler actually has an article called
micro service prerequisites it's great
article but for me a lot of what he
talks about is basically what we
understand as DevOps yeah platforms and
continuous delivery and monitoring and
but you need if your classic sort of
enterprising Pepsi not so familiar with
working this way need to understand
things like who is responsible for these
things who is accountable who is driving
the change that's the kind of core
message on that note I think I'm like
almost bang to time I should say thanks
for your time
how're we doing first time guys pretty
close I'm guessing is it there's no
questions through the app at the moment
so it is like late in the afternoon so
does anybody have any questions
very good I was just wondering if you
have some thoughts on because as you say
the complexity in a micro service system
is much in like the cooperation or
communication between the services do
you have any tips on where do you store
say that the configuration that you need
for the services to communicate between
each other I mean like URLs and database
stuff and container names and stuff like
that you have any tips yeah good
question so um well it was a couple of
technologies to look at a lot of the
things like service discovery and config
Management go kind of hand-in-hand as
you as you alluded to so in the past
I've used things like console quite a
lot Ashi Corp console is very good
there's a bunch of other ones as well
that do very similar zookeeper do
similar things but I find things like I
love the hash table stack I lost and how
she got its a single you know binary a
lot of their stuff and compared to
zookeeper is a bit more tricky to read
and so I con saw was really awesome I
find is it kind of was one thing to look
at as many others around that and for
secrets a hash Eagle have got a vault
so vault is and it's really good in
terms of like providing certain
cryptographic guarantees around storing
data and many of the platforms now like
kubernetes are popping up with things
they've got a notion of config maps so
config maps in communities allows you to
map say a file or a file system into the
pods directly and you can put data files
in those config maps so and I think ECS
has got similar staff ezs you can do it
through user data and bootstraps so a
lot of the platforms are realizing it's
an issue console have got a head start
on them but there's a lot of platform
specific stuff what a shameless plug
here what I would say is and have a look
at something called service meshes as
well it's for the communication point of
view there's a thing
called sto it is proper hipster ho I
will say that now I did a talk on it
earlier in the week actually I did at
last I'm getting confusing my days last
week I did a talk at cloud natives and
so you can have a look if you go to
skills matter website and search for
service meshes and you can see me
talking about how the platforms are
evolving so maybe not something you want
to pick up today maybe consoles better
but if you want to have an idea of where
sort of HTTP like communication might be
going and how service discovery and all
these things are done service meshes are
basically where all the big companies
are at now Google youtubers here AWS and
people have started talking about it so
I at least want to look what they're
doing
to see some inspiration anybody else</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
