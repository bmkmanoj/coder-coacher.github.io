I'm a software developer I'm very
excited about this news that Google are
launching dark because I've been
struggling with JavaScript and
large-scale programs for a while so I'm
really excited to see what's happening
in a minute I'm going to show you some
dark samples and show you how you can
evaluate those in a special web app that
Google made and we look just look at
some code so this is a Darkling org
where you can try our dart in the in an
interactive way so dart has a main as
opposed to JavaScript where no just
execute says it's as its parched and we
actually have a main you and art and the
VAR construct just as in JavaScript
introduces a variable and then just as a
javascript in this example you don't
have a type associated with the variable
but later we're going to see that you
can actually type the variables as well
so string literals in single quotes here
and you can have string interpolation
using this since X construct here so
this example is actually just hello
world for dark and in this web
application you can actually explore the
language by pushing this button which
actually runs sends off the dart code
executes sits and sent back the result
here so we get the hello world an
interesting thing here is that you can
apply typing so instead of writing bar i
can write string and we can run it again
see does the exact same thing and as
Kristen was telling you this doesn't
actually affect the runtime semantics of
the program it's just a way to put more
information for the compiler about your
program so an interesting aspect here is
if I put a wrong type here say int which
is actually also type the program still
runs but you do get a warning from the
compiler and it's highlighted here
string is not assignable to end so this
is a the point with optional talking and
dart there's also a contract con final
which is an unchanging variable so in
all rooms here so this is the hello
world of dark you see here in its
current section you also have a notion
of classes so let's try and look at that
so dart has classes and single
inheritance so when you use the class
construct to create a class and this is
a greeter class and here the bar means
instance variable and methods are
defined like this greet a name and you
print class instantiation is done with
new just as we used to with many many
other programming languages like Java
and C sharp so this actually creates a
new object so we can try just for fun to
put typing there which is like this I
could be interesting to see what happens
if i write something that's not a type
here ah we get an actual warning so the
compiler can give I mean the compiler is
a compile and there are errors in the
language for instance a classical
example in javascript is making a global
variable without using the var statement
this will actually give you an errand
art as opposed to JavaScript with this
just creates or maybe or writes a global
variable so hopefully this is really
going to make our lives better and make
it possible to do a structured
programming ok so there's inheritance as
well this you don't have to do this but
you can do stuff like this this is the
default so all the old classes extend
object but we can produce you explicitly
if you want how we can do subclassing
you for what ok another thing interfaces
so dart has interfaces and which are
sort of the smarter wish you know the
things we're used to sorry about that a
smarter version of things we're used to
in Java and and you right so this is
actually a class that implements an
interface from the from the library
called comparable and that forces you to
implement a compared to and this syntax
here I haven't introduced this and
this is functional closure syntax which
lets you give the implementation in line
just like that so this this is a greeter
class that is comparable by its
instantiated with a prefix which is a
string and then you can just compare to
a greeters based on their prefix so it
just delegates to the string compared to
four prefix so um I think that's it you
should go to this website and and play
with dart I just want to show you that
the google has also some some larger
examples that are intended for web
clients so if you if we go to the code
samples here and you follow this link
you actually get a number of
applications that are written in Dart
and that you can run as you see the
extension is that dart and in the
keynote google actually showed this
swarm application which is a newsreader
that you can run on the modern browsers
and the iPads and stuff like this and
also included in that distribution is an
emacs mode that lets you do syntax
highlighting for dart code so this is
actually the app which is like the main
for for this swarm application and you
see we have browser programming here
document that ready state and this
unload so this gives you a taste of what
that looks like when we are going to the
browser and doing a browser-based
programming this is actually the unload
method that's actually a method on a
class and we have some some event
handling as well that's all build into
libraries that come with dart if you
want to try dart you should go to Google
Code come stai speed let's start and
there are instructions on how to get the
source and we're very excited about dart
I've struggled with with you know
thousands and thousands of lines of
JavaScript code and you know Google is
hitting the spot on because it is a pain
it is a pain to maintain large clients
in JavaScript and actually google has
has done stuff to make this easier for
us in the past for instance their Google
closure tools exactly what i'm using now
to manage large code bases and it has
javascript and then you put in an
optional type system but you put it in
comments around your javascript code so
i think the dart is actually it takes I
mean it's a workaround right you add
stuff in comments and JavaScript and and
then you make a compiler based on that
but this is like the real solution the
closure compiler is good and but it is a
workaround so I'm really excited about
this for client-side programming and if
we don't know this but if it turns out
this is going to be a platform for
Android programming and for server-side
programming and you can have these
isolates at talking from the client to
the server then this is going to be huge
so I'm very excited since you can hear
about this stuff so I'm am just one more
thing I wanted to tell you this that if
you go to dartlang.org you can download
the language pack and it's only 78 pages
you can actually read this stuff as
opposed to the Java language
specification which is huge so I think
this has potential to really take off
and we're going to to help all we can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
