next point the juncture or that moment
when we have a breakthrough evolve and
potentially move forward now like all
great transformations it's not easy of
organizations have challenges evolving
most people here are properly trapped in
some sort of system of work that they
feel that they've no influence over that
they have no autonomy over they probably
even don't understand the purpose of it
and then the rest of these organizations
wonder when there are these changes
where did it come from why didn't they
see it why did we anticipate the future
so what I'm going to share with you
today is my experience of being tired of
that system of work of being fed up of
those organizations to try to change but
don't really want to change and show a
new way a new model about how you can
drive continuous transformation in your
organization and this is what exact camp
is about now the fortune 500 there most
of my clients and they are struggling
fifty-seven percent of the fortune 500
have disappeared over the last 20 years
that's a shocking statistic what's even
more shocking is the way that they
actually think how they're going to
survive forty-nine percent actually have
activities designed around cost
reduction to grow now this is one of the
most antiquated ideas what organizations
focus on cost cost actually goes up when
they focus on quality costs go down but
this is the sort of issue and yet only
twenty-seven percent of them have ideas
about how they can grow their business
by investing in new products and
developments so when you look at this
behavior these cultures what does it
turn you about these or
asians are they defending are they
exploring are they pushing themselves
forward are they trying to protect what
they've got so this is sort of the
dynamic of the industry that were in and
the types of organizations were up
against the other question is actually
what business are you in I'm going to
get really loud mouth and the
interesting thing is that most people
when you look at these organizations you
can only see what they're showing you
most of the businesses that you point to
or wondering about how they're doing
innovation are probably somewhere in the
region of three to five cycles ahead of
what they are showing you and yet we
point to the examples of what they are
showing us from what they did yesterday
as the way forward with their cycles
ahead Netflix great example started in
the sea CD shipping business that's what
they did no sorry they didn't they got
into the idea of going to declare and
distributing thing's virtually no sorry
no they didn't they got into the
business of creating content that they
could strib you to the cloud oh no sorry
they got into the business have not been
taking the distributor rights as well so
now they know and end-to-end from when
they have an idea until it's in front of
you on your machine and they distribute
the rights for other people to buy their
content just to give you an example
Apple make thirty percent of every other
lot of their profits on just
distributing content through itunes I
know the funny thing is Netflix are
starting to sell cds two people again of
their own content and funny is that but
then I go in and I talked to executives
and they're like don't worry don't worry
we've got a plan we're going to change
we're building an app it's going to save
our business and then I have to tell
them again well I'm sorry apps are dead
because people like Google just inject
content straight into the search results
now you don't even
need enough anymore there's another sunk
cost that's going to save your business
that's going to fail yet this is the
idea right this is what people think is
change in their organization I'd
meanwhile back at base were all in this
little silo pod locally optimized little
systems of work while the overall system
suffers right up here at the back this
is like the dream everyone's trying to
get here if they get there to get the
hell out of the cubicle farm and you
wonder how can collaboration happen in
this space but then there's a different
challenge when you're a large
multinational because every single idea
you have it's the same old song it's too
much too little too late the lead time
for business impact has done North
mentioned today in large organizations
is orders of magnitude different than
what you consider some of the smaller
innovation companies even the bigger
ones they make the cost of
experimentation so cheap that people can
run multiple experiments and learn all
the time but if you're in a large
multinational it's too much every idea
two hundred million dollars I've got an
idea two hundred million dollars to do
anything and if you're lucky of all of
that idea you'll get half of what you
expect for your two hundred million
dollars and in even worse than that
you'll probably get it in two years time
and then you're wondering when you have
these ideas a cost so much that you get
half of and take twice amount to deliver
why they don't achieve the outcomes that
you hope most organizations if you're
lucky will have maybe two or three ideas
that they invest in a year and they
might be lucky if they'll even deliver
in that year and this is the challenge
that they have but then they've also got
cultural challenges about this you go
into every CEO browse briefing and we
need to transform we need to transform
what are they saying well they're not
saying that they need to transfer
they mean all of you out there the great
unwashed and this is fundamentally the
bigger problem so what I was looking at
was ways to address these things how can
I get the people with the most influence
in the organization to actually
experience transformation how can I
dissolve the problem of too much too big
too little too late and change the
ability to experiment at speed and
that's why I created exact camp and what
I've done is take leading executives and
I mean from the CEO itself to leave
their organization for four to eight
weeks with the goal of launching new
businesses to disrupt their existing
business and I've done this with one of
the largest airlines in the world I've
done it with one of the biggest banks in
the world and also one of the largest
airports in the world this is happening
these people see the future and they
want to influence it now the benefits
about doing this is you actually get
executives out of their comfort zone
they start to get back in front of
innovation again secondly they start to
learn by doing every executive is read
every book you can think of about
innovation they know all the theory yet
that very few people have actually
practiced at what does it like to go
through a learning cycle the benefit
dinner when they do this is they
actually come back to the organization
and become coaches for people in the
organization to have experiences like
they've experienced they understand how
to create systems of work to allow
innovation to happen they also get to
test numbers of ideas hundreds of ideas
see the interesting thing about
innovation is it's not how many good
ideas that you find its how many bad
ideas you discount quickly is the
measure of progress and finally when
they step out with the organization for
a while it actually creates a safe to
fail experiment for the next generation
of leaders to take the leadership
of the organization for a short period
of time and experience what it's like to
run large multinationals sound
interesting how does it work well most
of the time when I tell people about
this especially executives this is what
happens what are you talking about I
can't be possible so to make people feel
better I made a nice diagram that
Wiggles and goes up to the right so
everything's going to be okay well I get
people thinking about there is method d
things you need to prepare them you need
to help them understand there is a plan
you need to get people to immerse
themselves in a different environment I
d8 as much as possible and then innovate
teste ideas as quickly as possible to
find out what doesn't work and then have
impact by those leaders bringing that
information back into their organization
and championing it through then you can
start to scale these ideas because what
I do is I use a method of see one do one
teach one so the executives actually see
how these things happen the first time
then they get to lead one and I help
coach them and then finally they become
coaches for other people leaving this
see repeatable scalable model so this
leads us to the exact camp manager which
is big think big learn fast and start
now thinking big your new mobile app is
not thinking big one of the largest or
Airlines companies in the world had an
executive mandate the sponsor of this
was a CEO of the actual organization
they understand that if you are going to
drive change in your organization they
need to be the person to support it not
to do it to support it so what we did is
get a 20 billion dollar organization to
get their executives to leave the
company for eight weeks with the goal of
trying to launch a new business to
disrupt their entire business pretty
a big if you're asking people to think
like that who thinks that their
organization would allow that to happen
no hands you're all behind already so
when you build these types of teams you
don't have time to mess around you have
to hit the ground to be performant from
the start so we took loads of measures
about how you could reduce the
uncertainty of not achieving high
performance from day one from the stars
we started to look at building
cross-functional teams from the start
people understanding the different
skills abilities capabilities that we
would need in the organization in order
for us to be performant and we all
needed to know that about one another so
how do you do that how do you created a
culture where you can trust one another
for anyone who's read about the Google
our startle project about creating
high-performance teams the number one
thing you have to do is create
psychological safety so I'm afraid to
put my ideas out there and you won't
check banish me because my ideas are bad
will challenge the idea you're safe in
that environment we did things like
lunar spark where we got people to
understand their biases who's a big
thinker whose detail-oriented why would
they struggle to collaborate with one
another quickly when someone wants to go
into the detail and someone wants to
talk about the big picture so you start
to actually build empathy for one
another but also understand the
strengths of the theme and where you
have gaps and how you can start to
manage them which means you can start to
collaborate in a much more effective and
timely manner but to achieve great
product delivery there's a number of
aspects that you need to take into
account the first is ideas but ideas are
really cheap the thing you have to
actually optimize for is discounting
them as quickly as possible if someone
has an idea great what's the quickest
smallest thing we can do to test it to
see if it's true or invalidate it and
move on in organizations if you're doing
up three times a year at the cost of two
hundred million dollars are an idea 200
people to do it and to but your is to
deliver it what do you think your
chances are of getting that right the
first time what about the second time
what about the third time test hundreds
of ideas then you'll get some good ideas
demand doesn't the most important thing
about a product when you build it is not
how beautiful it is it's not how much it
costs it's not how quick it was to
deliver it's actually will anyone use it
you need to find out as quickly as
possible by getting your ideas into the
hands of your customers do they find it
usable or not tactics we'd use like that
I'll show as we go on the talk but every
time we had an idea is how quickly can
we test it and who's the right customer
we need to test this with building the
ability of the team then to understand
the strengths and weaknesses starts to
enhance the way you can collaborate and
then drive those ideas forward who's
going to champion that idea who's got
the best context and abilities to drive
it forward and then finally execution
how can we reduce the lead time to
finding out information how quickly can
we find out if this is a good bad or
indifferent idea and we need to do
something else every experiment is an
investment in information it's actually
an economic decision if you're making a
multi-million dollar bet you want to
invest a relative portion to that idea
to reduce the uncertainty of that number
so when you start to do these types of
projects it's actually about setting up
goals how do you run a good experiment
what's the first thing you have to do
Arden hypothesis yet how do you create a
hypothesis you make some observations
the understand well actually what do you
want to learn you observe the world you
formulate a hypothesis and there which
is a theory and then you need to
formulate a way to exercise that
hypothesis to invalidate it or validated
and also before you do that you need to
define a measure of success an indicator
that will tell you if we're moving in
the right direction or wrong and then
you run the experiment so when you start
to think about these programs defining
transform
targets are goals that you want to shoot
for before you start is really important
so we would sit down with the team and
ask them what is truly transformational
for this idea a good techniques you are
used there is like sit there thinking of
like zero to one hundred percent to set
boundaries zero percent of our customers
are going to interact with us in a
manual way what would it take to do that
one hundred percent of our customers are
going to have their problem solves the
first time that they call us what would
it take to do that it's an interesting
way to push your mind forward and get
out of the day to day because people
just want to come up with point
solutions and this gives you an idea
about starting to create interesting
laze about outcomes that you want to
achieve not I want to build a mobile app
I want to change the way we interact
with our customers much more powerful so
what we do is then take people out of
their daily and hourly environment so
they actually get to experience a
totally different way of working we take
them out to see a different whole
ecosystem of people that they could work
with spend time with feces spend time
with thought leaders in education people
spend time with startups so they can
actually be inspired by some of the
methods and techniques that they're
using not that they want to become a
startup that they want to use some of
the behaviors and tactics and strategies
that they use to get information quickly
it also provides them an opportunity to
build relationships and partnerships
when you're trying to do innovation you
can't do everything best-in-class in
every aspect of it you need to partner
with people so what we would do is start
to me introduce them to all these
different types of companies so say
you're in the travel business you
probably be interested with some of
these companies are doing up here
they're probably interested when you're
20 billion dollar organization about how
they could work with you you actually
have trusted partners you can start to
work with flyer is a really great
example does anyone over Florida's it
tells you when to buy a ticket any
ticket say the next time I want to fly
from London to San Francisco I just
punch it in give it a date range and
it'll tell me the
zach day to buy that ticket at its
cheapest price that removes all the
liquidity from the airline they've just
become a commodity like that the Machine
knows more and better when the price is
going to drop into humans who actually
drive to economics for the business
that's pretty scary so what do you want
to do make friends with that person or
have them as an enemy i want to i give
them home to go out there is these cards
right people are in a very generative
space term eating loads of people you're
discussing ideas you're debating things
so what I do is give them these cards
that they can quickly as they're sitting
down there just start to sketch out
ideas because you're inspired your
hearing constantly different information
from different domains different ways of
thinking how can I apply that in my
business how can you capture those ideas
quickly at speed so at the end of one
day this is how many ideas you end up
with and then you can bring them back
and you start to sort them increase the
transparency about what's going on put
these up in your entire organization
this wall anyone who have the idea they
just stick it up it's in the main
hallway of the organization you can
actually see what people are thinking
about they prioritize some of the ideas
which they need to get more information
on which they're going to test how far
much they're testing what they're
learning anyone the organization can see
this happening and contribute to it
build accountability ownership and
engagement most people when they try to
stick up a post it note their told the
facilities don't let them do it this is
the company's future on the wall and
what's interesting about it is these
companies understand that the capability
is not the idea it's how much they're
learning how fast they are learning
that's the muscle they're developing
that's why Lee Elon Musk laughs at
people and publishes all the content
about how to build any car you want in a
public domain
because they know they've already
learned four or five cycles as soon as
they've published that Toyota used to
invite GM into their buildings to copy
and take photographs of everything that
was happening because they know two days
later the system of work will have
changed again take as many photos as you
want copy it yeah sure that's what's
happening because they're learning fast
when you learn fast in an Information
Age whoever has the most knowledge wins
so how fast are you learning on a scale
of one to five with five been the
fastest you could possibly learn and one
being the slowest you could possibly
learn let's all throw and see how fast
we think we're learning in our
organizations ready 1 2 3 hold your
hands up so you can i'll see ya say I I
think twos and threes let's say Don
rynason principles of product
development flow required reading for
everybody on this planet fifty percent
of time is spent at the fuzzy front end
the fuzzy front end is that time where
executives sit around in a boardroom
have a bit of a chat on the golf course
make sure that you've got that 700-page
PowerPoint deck done for me come and
pitch it to me I'll give you some
feedback that you need to go from 700 to
800 pages because it's not resilient
enough didn't like the numbers have
another meeting get another golf round
in now we need to talk about the budget
that only happens once every quarter
then I'm going to pitch at the quarter
that didn't work now I'm gonna have to
wait for next quarter what's happened in
the rest of the world they've moved
forward so you actually need to stop
writing and you need to start learning
so what I do is get the executives in a
cross-functional team understanding
their capabilities and skills and
learning together at speed sharing the
information and the knowledge that they
have with one another and building upon
us giving them simple models that they
can communicate their ideas this is the
business
model canvas by Alexander osterwalder a
very simple way that you can map out a
business model in three seconds and the
thing about this is they know the first
time they map out it's wrong they
actually optimize for it being wrong
because what you do is get an expression
our hypotheses and then you start to
test it and refine it and that's where
you get resiliency not investing all
your time in trying to get the
hypothesis correct it's testing is what
matters and then you can quickly map out
these business hypotheses and start to
test speed and this is what I effects
you let me know our call hypothesis
driven development actually seeing
everything that you run our phrasing all
your ideas as experiments or outcomes
that you actually want to achieve and
this just isn't in the context of
products this is in the context of
products process changes tools you might
select we believe by having a
cross-functional team will result in
higher collaboration across the team
well no we have confidence that this is
working when 710 people in the team say
we're collaborating better that's an
experiment well no this is true when we
run it for a week product experiments
think of any when you start to phrase
these things in experiments you actually
build more resiliency into the way
you're thinking about these ideas what
does success look like how could we get
there much more interesting way to view
the world because their target
conditions that you are shooting for
what does not start to look like in the
team's well I build these small little
canvases for them that they create like
little expressions of their idea who's
there for what's the little journey that
will happen what could be so more
detective they might need what would be
some of these idea cards turn into
canvases they get waiting mechanisms
they're collaborating with them they're
challenging each other about what works
and what doesn't they're starting to use
the Socratic process of back and forth
that a conference functional team offers
to start a build resiliency enter the
idea prioritize the things that they
want to learn and then start to test
them with the people that matter most so
when Eric Ries Rose the lean startup and
made lots and lots of money the idea is
not what's this amazing measure we need
to come up with what's the thing that we
want to learn what's the thing we're
going to build it's actually how fast
can we go through a learning cycle
what's the smallest possible investment
we can make to actually give the most
amount of information that we can learn
the most important things and that was
the idea behind what Minimum Viable
products are it's not to create a small
version of a product it's actually to
reduce our exercise your business
hypotheses as quickly as possible to
reduce the uncertainty of building the
wrong thing but sadly this is one of the
most poorly understood and most
ambiguous term in our industry who calls
the Minimum Viable Product the first
release of their product how long ya and
take six months one hundred million
dollars and 300 people to build that's
not an experiment well it is but it's
expensive one and this is why I talked
to the execs about getting out of the
building when you have these ideas you
have to go and talk to the people who
they are designed for not the idea of
who you think is going to like them this
is an extremely expensive experiment it
cost 10p to print the piece of paper and
this extremely complicated example of an
iphone is a piece of cardboard stuck
between two bits a laminate total cost
four dollars and that's how you use it
you can start to experience what it's
like to use this applique
for the grand total of five dollars and
get feedback on what ideas and what
don't and you can put them then in front
of the people that matter most customers
now what's the hardest thing for an
executive when you're used to doling out
ideas pardon listening yes what else
normally they're used to heard these
things everywhere do did everyone get a
hippo when they came in so there's a
great culture hut by a guy called Ronnie
Kovic e who set up the experimentation
platform for amazon and also then later
for Bing and he used to give people
hippos when the executives came up with
great ideas that they thought we should
do because they're the highest paid
person's opinion so when they came up
with a great idea and we're like this is
going to save the business we only have
three ideas a year we can do remember
most of them have to be the executives
favorite idea Ronnie would go up to them
and go that's very nice to you go here's
a hippo for you now let's go and test
some real ideas and this is really tough
right like one of the times when I've
zoomed is that one as CEOs of the other
one of the company's livery sits down
I'm like okay you've got this idea yeah
it's brilliant it's going to save the
business I've just never been able to
get it through the funding process okay
great what is it it's the idea is to
another food photo taking up that's the
idea brilliant let's go test it with a
customer what let's go test it with a
customer okay so I sit him down much
like we see here I asked them to draw an
example of what the product does and
show it to a customer the customer is
like I have no idea what this thing does
what's the executives response yes
is the idea the problem is the customer
the problem who's this customer that's
not the customer I do but get rid of
them get me another customer in here
same scenario again sit down show the
picture ask the customer to use it
customer says I've no idea what this
thing does what's the executives a
response get me another customer so
seven million customers later now I'm
only joking the only way you can break
people's mental models of the world is
they have to experience something you
need to create an experiment for people
experience feedback from people to say
that I don't understand this idea we
need to do something different and the
testament to that executive that they
actually became they had the
breakthrough they realized that the
ideas weren't about them it was about
the idea and that customers actually
were the best people to give them
feedback on whether that was a good idea
or not they actually became the best
proponent of this because they realized
that to succeed it was about learning
and they wanted to learn fast and they
started to see not only the product
ideas that they had but even the ideas
they have for their organization as a
hypothesis and the people that they
would test those ideas were would be for
organizational ideas employees what do
you think about this process what do you
think about this performance management
F exercise that we're doing what do you
think the way that we have incentives
set up in your organization biggest
transformation or the people themselves
so this is why it's important to stop
talking well obviously not when you're
doing a presentation but actually start
testing stuff and getting people out in
front of the customers the real people
that are going to use it all the time
again another super expensive experiment
this is an iphone with a peg a rubber
band and a USB camera recording somebody
using the application in a coffee shop
total cost of experiment of $15 that
includes the coffee as well the coffee
shop and then start putting the ideas of
what you're learning back up there green
it's worked red amber not understood red
we need to do something totally
different and then constantly evolving
your ideas and just distribute them to
other people to give feedback and keep
learning even got to the stage that the
teams were actually setting up devices
in their areas where anyone walking
around the whole company could actually
go up to screens that they set up facing
externally to the team where you could
actually use the next version of their
product and give them feedback on it
they had a feedback box with these green
and red app cards that you could just
write your what worked what you didn't
understand at the end of the iteration
teams take the boxes dump them out soar
through the ideas loads of feedback
anonymously people not afraid to share
what they really think getting everybody
sketching is one of the most important
things you can do when you start to talk
about ideas first thing when you tell an
executive to draw a picture that idea
they say I don't know how to draw and
then you go that's great you're going to
learn the idea the point is not to draw
a perfect drawing the point is to
express your hypothesis in a way that
other people can potentially understand
debate and engage on when you get
everybody starting to sketch it actually
creates a really generative environment
where everyone is sharing their mental
models of how things could work how you
could be better you pull all those
together and you start to get even more
different concoctions and mixes of those
things and then keep putting them back
in front of your customers every week we
would do come up with an idea on a
Monday draw it on a Tuesday tested on a
Wednesday refine it on the Thursday
tested on a Friday learning cycles as
quickly as possible so people can
actually understand what's working and
what's not you start tearing through
ideas hundreds of them all the time
resile building the resiliency of the
idea but learning exponentially
over four to eight weeks it's
frightening and this is the challenge
I'm laying down here three of the
world's largest organizations are doing
this you can't sit around you've got to
start now because great leaders actually
set unreasonable expectations of
individuals Elon is known to be
unreasonable about the vision that he
wants to go to Mars the prime purpose of
SpaceX is to get people to live on
another planet namely Mars so every time
they make a decision what he thinks the
first question that they asked will this
get us to Mars quicker so whether you're
going out to buy a box of post-its or
you're going to have a company dinner
with your friends the first question is
will this get us to Mars faster will it
help us achieve the mission that we're
shooting for and one at a time of
experiments we can start to run to find
out if we're getting there and this is
the important thing about when you start
to run experiments you need to create
initially safe to fail ideas put your
cross-functional teams together have a
big vision but think about the first
small steps that you can do to get there
testing that with the people that matter
most your customers enables you to make
an evidence-based decision based on
their feedback about whether something
worked you should do something different
or move on now the challenge about an
environment where you put people in a
room together for a long period of time
is everybody starts to fall in love with
the ideas it's only a matter of time so
what you constantly have to do is start
challenging your thinking so what we
would do is three times a week we would
either invite in another startup we
would invite in and a thought leader a
venture capitalist a business leader to
challenge the ideas every idea we would
stand up to build more resiliency
to get feedback about what this would
work to turn ideas to make them
bulletproof not have bullet holes in
them and this is the thing again about
people being afraid to share the idea
when you're in an organization that
you're locking yourself away not only
from your customers but the people that
can help you bring it to life you have
no opportunity to grow that another
thing that was counterintuitive about
doing this is actually the funding model
so normally when you're in a large
organization because it's so painful to
go through your budgeting and planning
process what do people do when it was so
hard to release software what did we do
well we patched it up into a huge big
process because it was easier to do one
release every six months with all these
changes in it rather than try and
release things frequently in smaller
batches based on outcomes and then we
came up with the concept of continuous
delivery where we said we're going to
deploy every change that we make into
production and people said you're mad
and now we do it if you don't do if
you're crazy and yes in the business
world we batch up our planning processes
to do them manually once every year one
release a year where we say all the
things that we're going to do all the
things that we're going to deliver how
much it's going to cost how long it's
going to take you need to break your
funding cycles down into smaller
iterations too and this is where the
economics come into play you're paying
for information relative to the upside
how much do I want to invest to reduce
the uncertainty of building the wrong
thing and then use the smaller
investment horizons to hold yourself
accountable to outcomes or if we're
going to build a rocket ship to the moon
what would we need to be doing in one
month's time to prove our give us a
sense that we're going in the right
direction
what's the smallest fastest possible
thing we can do to achieve that to work
towards that and then when we come
together in a month's time after we've
defined that let's hold ourselves
accountable to those initial success
criteria and use that to give us a sense
of should we keep going should we stop
or should we invest in another idea if
you don't design your governance process
your funding process to account for
decisions based on evidence or outcomes
over short cycles you're dead when
you're working in an area of high
complexity and uncertainty which
innovation is about you have no data you
have to favor shorter faster learning
cycles otherwise you'll be making
million dollar investments in ideas and
wasting money and time on things that
nobody's ever going to use and you'll
only find out when it's too late so when
we came up with any ideas and this is
what I would encourage you to think
about when you're back in your
organization these are the three steps
that we use for all of them when you
have a big vision think about in a move
and media proof point what's the
smallest possible thing what's what do
we expect to learn and who's our target
we're going to test it against as
quickly as possible when you run that
experiment while quickly what's the
speed that you can actually get
information to build upon it and then
think about how you would scale out the
next set of experiments you would run
over the next six months to bring that
idea not to life but to reduce the next
most uncertain part of it thinking about
your customers technology in the
Commerce Abed he'll pose together
because we're in a world now where
PowerPoint decks are useless nobody
reads them they go to SharePoint to die
maybe if you're forward-thinking you put
it in github to let it die there
this is what the new world looks like
it's a living breathing artifact the
changes as frequently as the new
information comes to life and you adapt
to it you outline your aspirational
vision at the top what's our moonshot
what's going to take us to Mars how do
we break that down into said of customer
hypotheses that we're going to test what
are the examples that we're going to use
to exercise our beliefs then we have
sets of experiments that we're going to
run and you can even see from this
picture the fidelity of these that could
be put are actually working code right
through to somebody just had an idea in
the back of a napkin so you actually
have design experiments constantly
running to exercise your customer
hypotheses turning them into a story map
of what you're actually going to build
and release and what data will tell you
if you've actually achieved these things
before you go now when you're working in
a multi-million dollar organization
who's able to run an experiment on their
own right now if you wanted to run one
person two people or maybe three when
you have executives doing this they
start to understand the benefits about
making it economic and easy to
experiment at speed to help people learn
what they want to do for them what we
were able to do was launched a new
product inside six weeks as the fastest
they've ever brought anything to life in
their entire history of the organization
they created a discounted ride-sharing
service so the three of us were going on
the trip from London to Madrid all we
had to do was email in our ticket
numbers and we all get a ten percent
discount on the flight how do you think
we started that project imagine you're
in a multi-million dollar organization
how hard would it be to do that
what's the first thing you do well you
don't automate it you don't build code
you test the system of work so what we
did well the group of us had to travel
between London and Madrid so we all
booked our tickets we rang up someone in
the back office told them all our
numbers and they manually pinned them
together gave us the ten percent
discount and we did the trip let's
reduce the uncertainty of the business
hypothesis working first not in any code
we can still adapt the quickest way to
run der experiment is not a bill code
because only when you start to see that
something actually works then it's worth
automating because if you automate from
the start you're removing yourself away
from the friction of the actual
transaction what's the first thing
people do when they have a great idea in
a technology organization they build a
mobile app correct that's my challenge
to you next time you have a great idea
try not to build a mobile app try to see
if you can manually serve that and
understand how it works and then
understand where you should automate
because as you quickly understand where
the process has friction and wear it
doesn't you can automate the repeatable
components and stay close to the
customer to learn on the friction as a
result of doing that they uncovered all
the obstacles in the system of work much
quicker than if they try to just build
the entire process and discover them as
they were building you understand which
you can automate which you don't next
thing you know even multi-million dollar
new product on the market and you're
beating your competition in six weeks so
conclusions well I'll obviously
everybody needs to go and do an exact
camp right
and this is what's really important it's
getting people especially the executive
team back on the front line of
innovation spending four to eight weeks
actually doing this stuff so they
understand how it works learning by
doing not really theory and then
exposing it and say yeah we're doing
agile yeah we're doing continuous
delivery yeah we're doing customer
development no you're not get them to
experience it so then they become
coaches for people in the organization
and they can help others propel their
test numbers of ideas but also give the
next generation of leaders a safe to
fail experiment to run the company these
are the testimonials of the people that
have done this program you can read them
develop winning ideas are pasted
influence stakeholders across the entire
organization to do things differently I
jelyn lean methodologies actually don't
work in startups they work in large
companies too here's a game-changing
program and the first test a steps are
proof points you can see that it's
actually working transformational for
people involved in this program and
transformational for the business to
move forward so when you go back to your
organization tell these people it's not
even a case of can I run an experiment
there's already multi-billion dollar
organizations that are running these
programs to change the way that they
operate a radical different approach
because a year from today you'll wish
you started today and go back and tell
your CEO they're already behind because
people have already started don't forget
to rate the session I've been berry o
Reilly thank you very much
I think of five minutes for questions or
so I don't have the app so I can't see
any questions yeah great so the question
was a most companies adopt scrum type
methodology and then this is a new
methodology does not mean have to throw
everything away and I guess the way I
think about these things is and a
methodology is just a set of practices
that people pull together that sort of
help them deliver all right which is
great but they're all tools and they're
really the most important tool I would
say is this idea of continuous
improvement like retrospectives where
you're constantly asking yourself you
know is this thing working for us or is
it not could we come up with an
experiment to try something different
and see if that helps us more or less so
you know often what I find with a lot of
high-performing teams is they they adopt
a methodology maybe to start but if you
go back and see them in a year it's time
the ones that are still fighting over
well the book says we need to stand up
and take orders every morning at nine
o'clock versus the teams that have just
you don't even you can't describe what
their methodology is because it's just a
way of working you know because they've
experimented their way to a process
optimized for their problems that the
way that they were and works for them
and their invariably much better as a
team because they're constantly learning
new ways are working and optimizing and
improving and I think Toyota's probably
famous for this is like the example I
said the Americans would come in and
take photographs of all the things that
they were doing and try and codify what
they were doing that day into a
methodology replicate the methodology
but not replicate the results where
Toyota were already seven cycles ahead
in a different process and the maze most
famous story that is the andon cord did
you ever hear that the undone cord so in
Toyota they have this thing called the
Undine cord which is M if anyone ever
experiences an issue on the production
line
they they pull this cord and it stops
the line and the manager comes over to
the worker and they have a debate and
say what's the obstacle can we come up
with an experiment and try something so
anyway when the Americans took all the
photographs the andon cord was in all
the photographs as they put it in the
factories right but none none of the
Americans actually knew what the cord
was for so it's just hang in there and
it does feel like working away you know
and I think we see some of those
problems and people just method blindly
adapting methodologies okay and maybe
maybe one more question or oh my safe
okay cool I'll be right stick around for
next half hour or so and they're nice to
me to Ruby thanks very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
