the blockchain and I consider different
titles for this thing so I picked this
one that's probably the one you you saw
in the program is scheduled and so when
you're here for I also actually
considered this one and an alternative
you have to make this disclaimer first
I'm not a blockchain expert right I I do
know something about the blockchain and
there's no the stuff that I've gathered
in the last year or so by playing around
with different things I find completely
fascinating so I'm going to try to share
my enthusiasm for the whole thing now if
you hear me saying something that's
wrong because you're a cryptocurrency
expert or a cryptographer please raise
your hand and correct me I'm perfectly
fine with that so please do that
that said I strongly believe that the
blockchain is actually more than just a
hype I believe that a lot of the money
now flowing into the startups that do
something with the blockchain is
completely misguided and there are lots
of people wasting millions and millions
of euros by investing in something they
don't understand which is probably the
way it has to be that's probably the way
of the world and we have to they
actually are taking that risk and they
hopefully know that and they invest in
100 companies one or one or two of them
will survive and make them a lot of
money so that's fine but still despite a
lot of skepticism and despite a lot of
people wondering whether this is
actually real after spending time with
it I'm firmly convinced it is so what
I'll try to do today is I'll try to talk
about the basic principles behind the
blockchain I'll start with Bitcoin as
the most prominent example I'm going to
use it to illustrate some of the major
features some of the poor workings on
the whole concept then we'll talk a
little bit about etherium as second
second well known instance of something
running on a blockchain and then we'll
talk about some other some other
applications and the possible use cases
and some benefits and downsides and
maybe we'll have a little Q&amp;amp;A session at
the end although schedule is pretty
tough
at any point in time feel free to
interrupt or just raise your hand or put
a question into the into the conference
tool so let's start with Bitcoin so who
here in the room owns Bitcoin anybody
here who does that's a reasonable number
of people it's not I'll put it at about
10% something like that so that's pretty
good I think probably in the overall
population it's more like 0.00001% so
you're good are incident so let's talk
about what bitcoin is and isn't so first
of all it is the first and most
prominent practical application of
cryptography to do the things that be
now associated with a cryptocurrency so
it maintains this history of
transactions it maintains the history of
who gave what amount of virtual money to
world actual money to somebody else it
does this with guaranteed consistency so
we know that this record we have about
all the transactions that happen in the
past is correct
and we know that it can be forged can be
manipulated you can decide that you
didn't actually spend that money on
something when you did in fact spend it
I mean and the key thing is it does this
without an intermediary so you don't
have a bank or any central authority
making that guarantee to you there is no
state no government no centralized
anything that does that it's the it's
the it's the the union of all the people
participating in this particular thing
which is the critical new innovation
about this about this whole thing it's
very resistant to forgery fraud I know
that probably all of you have heard
about all the disasters that happen to
people who lost their Bitcoin none of
these things actually happen to the
cryptographically sound core of the
system - does it the blockchain or
Bitcoin itself has been hacked at any
point in time all those at the
boundaries of going from one system to
the other and we'll get to that in more
detail and you probably know a little
bit of the soap opera history of the
whole thing so it was created by this
mysterious person or number of persons
he knows it definitely still is the most
successful cryptocurrency although in
the last few months the helium has
gathered a lot of a lot of Drive and
it's become very very important it's
pretty close now
who knows maybe it has half a year from
now it'll have overtaken Bitcoin in
terms of capitalisation so what does it
mean apply cryptography I mean most
people that I know here cryptography is
like oh my god this is always
complicated stuff we talked about in
fact don't worry about it because the
little cryptography that you need to
understand to understand how the
blockchain works can be understood even
by me so I'm sure you'll do fine as well
very easy you probably all know what a
hashing algorithm does is not I'll
explain it to you in about 10 seconds we
have this piece of data on the left then
we have an algorithm and that algorithm
produces some sort of fingerprint what
you put in the data and it'll it'll put
out some some hash value that actually
changes if you change even a single bit
of the incoming data you can make a
slight change the data changes and as
you can as you've probably guessed it
reversible register does not go in both
directions you can create this hash
value from the data so you know this is
the kind of data that actually created
that hash and it's a repeatable process
so if you have this piece of data you
can compute the hash again and you can
check with it the center hash that
somebody else claimed is valid for this
data is correct and that's basically it
that's almost all we need for the whole
thing now there's a little more to it
which is related to this public and
private key
I'm cryptography thing which I'm sure
you've also heard about also used it if
anytime you send us a sign email
encrypted email or any time you use a
TLS to negotiate an HTTP connection to
some server that's what happens
underneath in this particular case all
you need to understand is that we have
these things we have a private key in
the public key in fact we can derive the
public key from the private key we can
compute it so we essentially just need a
private key that's what you need to have
to get this public key then you can hand
this public key to somebody else and
then because these two words is because
one was derived from the other they have
a certain mathematical relationship that
allows you to do certain kinds of
operations so for example you can use
the private key to sign some data
essentially computing a hash and you can
use the public key to validate that the
signature actually came from the person
who has this corresponding private
so if I have a private key I can do
certain things that you can validate if
you have my public key which is why I
distribute my public key globally I give
it to anyone anybody can take can use
that key to make that check so that's
that's basically is it all the
cryptography that we need for for a
basic understanding on the blockchain a
little bit of a symmetric cryptography
and a little bit of hashing and that's
basically it
so how does Bitcoin actually work let's
take a look at the vocabulary and all of
the things that make up this Bitcoin
universe and you have all of those
concepts that are related in some way
and it'll sort of zoom in and talk about
each of them and a little bit more
detail so first of all we start with
Bitcoin itself so obviously Bitcoin is
the technology it's the first thing that
came up with this with this synthesis of
ideas that ended up being the blockchain
in fact this technology was of course
built upon earlier things for example
hashing is a very old idea and there are
other ideas like for example the proof
of work stuff they were going to get to
in a second that were inspired by
earlier work by other people but this
combination of the whole thing to build
an a a cryptographic ledger something
that records a history of transactions
without having to trust any single party
it's something that was only introduced
with Bitcoin about eight or nine years
ago I think was 2009 the coin is
rhinology Bitcoin is obviously also the
currency and as any currency it has to
be created somehow as as any any any
trying currency that you're aware of and
a fiat currency that you're aware of
bitcoins also have to be created and
they're being created following a
predefined process
it's called mining called actually
creating these coins through the process
of mining we'll get to that a little
later on and the amount of a Bitcoin
that can ever be created is limited by
the original algorithm sure you've heard
of that there can only ever be 21
million Bitcoin as a whole that's it has
never got to be more so there is no
central bank that can decide to print
more banknotes nobody can make that
decision because it's been predefined in
the actual algorithms there are more
information more information about this
unit Mille Bitcoin and there's a small
assume which is a Satoshi and obviously
coins are as I mentioned before it's not
maintained amazing obvious the coins are
not maintained as part of a of an
account balance it's not it's not as if
because I own some Bitcoin I have an
account and this account has a balance
of whatever 0.5 Bitcoin in fact the sum
in my account is the sum is computed by
looking at all the past transactions
every transactions that ended up giving
me some money that I haven't yet spent
and jointly makes up the balance in my
virtual account which is never explicit
which also means that it's not anonymous
if I'm careful and if I create new key
pair or any key for every transaction
that I do is hard to find out who I am
but it's not impossible
it's pseudonymous pseudonymous o is
actually a pseudonym that I'm acting
under and it's not enough so that's the
basic idea about Bitcoin so if there is
no account of the balance what actually
is a wallet that'll be the second thing
to talk about and a wallet it's actually
just a shorthand nerd name for to make
this easier for people to understand in
fact for a computer person it's kind of
the wrong word because the wallet is not
really a wallet doesn't keep my money so
while it actually keeps my keys so my
private keys are stored in the wallet
and because the private keys control who
can spend the money that I haven't yet
spent it's actually my way to access my
coin in the system so when I download a
wallet which is a piece of software I
can actually use it to create a new
private key and it will securely
hopefully securely store that private
key so that I can use it later on you
can imagine that it used to sort of sign
transactions a little more complicated
than that but it's fine for now and you
can imagine there are multiple
implementations for different operating
systems for different kinds of devices
most people I know actually use their
mobile device they use their smartphone
to maintain their wallets or they use
some offline or hardware solution
because the one thing that maybe is one
key takeaway that you should take away
from here is that an online wallet is
also known as a very bad idea
don't ever do that
and there are people who offer to keep
your keys for you that's very nice of
them but I suggest you don't do that I
don't suggest you ever do that with any
sort of private key because it sort of
defeats the point of the whole thing
because it's just a little bit of mass
and nothing more you can also have an
offline wallet it's just a piece of
paper because piece of piece could be a
piece of hardware specifically built for
that purpose that you maybe unlock with
the fingerprint and with some sort of
card or whatever it is that's
essentially the idea of a wallet so if
you have a wallet it'll have those keys
you can have multiple keys but kind of
analogy and in fact encourages you to
create more and more keys to sort of
make sure you can't be tracked that
easily because you know what you're
supposed to know how much money you have
especially if you have lots of them so
we talked about Bitcoin talking about
wallet let's talk about transactions
transactions obviously are the most
important thing in terms of what you're
interested in you want to actually
transact with the system it's a little
little little convoluted maybes and I'm
not necessarily expecting you to
understand all of the details right now
but essentially the idea is that you
have this unspent transaction output
every transaction has an output and some
of that output hasn't been spent yet so
it's still available some other part of
that output has not been spent right so
what does that mean it actually means
that it's like unlikely like a bucket
cash transaction if I pay for something
using a Bitcoin transaction what happens
is that I happen to have the unspent
output of ten other transactions like I
had one that gave me ten little 10
million Bitcoin a little bit gave me two
another one that gave me four which adds
up to 16 and now I need to pay for 15
that's the price I have to pay for this
particular thing and I don't have the
exact 15 amount unspent so obviously
when I input that to the transaction the
output will be will 15 will go to the
person I'm paying and one will go back
to me sort of like change that you're
getting back when you're paying scouring
real physical coin or bills make pretty
sure that I'm the only one who can spend
that stuff right there the easier that
trying to exactly actually the actual
spending is control because of the
things because the things are sort of
signed with the
thing so you could call the wording they
used a sort of encumbered with the
recipient Pierre I make sure when I do a
transaction that the output from this
transaction is cryptid less
cryptographically secured so that only
the correct recipient can use them as
inputs to the next conducts next sense
hopes so that is essentially the idea of
a transaction and because we have this
this complicated peer-to-peer system
it's a very good question to ask what do
I do with this transaction I mean I can
create this transaction if I if I know
the the recipients public public key to
actually their address that's the
terminology if I know their address the
address they want to receive the Bitcoin
app I can create this transaction I
could even compute it by hand if I
wanted to
it'll take me a long time and I could do
that but what do I do with it
I now have this data structure this
thing and in fact I send it to one of
the nodes so the nose in this
peer-to-peer system are all the
participants who collaborate to create
the joint Bitcoin system so I publish
the transaction to one of the nodes that
I happen to have a connection to and
then I hope for the best
so what is that thing what's what's
supposed to happen next
obviously the transaction has to be
checked maybe I spend somebody else's
money maybe I made some other error
maybe I created a bad data structure so
what happens there in fact this
transaction is now being validated and
the result of that validation is
happened as part of something called a
block so you can see that we're slowly
approaching what a friggin blockchain
actually is so we're getting closer so
what's a block a block essentially is a
larger data structure that references
transactions right so you have this
block and in my model that I just
described it'll reference maybe a
thousand transactions those transactions
will be included in that block and then
that block will somebody who creates
that blog that will be one of the nodes
will actually validate all of the
transactions and then they will sign the
block as a whole so they make sure does
they have database they sort of make
sure they everybody knows that they
correctly validated this thing now in a
if you were to design such a system
scratch how would you go about making
sure that you that you know this was the
correct answer I mean anybody could
Forge anything there right so typically
what we do in other systems that we know
is we trust that person for example when
you when you do a an HTTP connection
then you implicitly trust the whole CA
process which is a bit of a stretch that
we tend to do that right so we trust the
fact that in our browser there's a
hierarchy of certificate authorities
relationships to certain certificates
and when something comes they only know
that they let's press is probably okay
but that's seen explicitly not with any
of the blockchain based systems to list
the public blockchain systems do instead
they rely on something called the proof
of work so as somebody who does this
validation as somebody who creates a
block who minds a block that's the word
when I'm ina lock I'm I have to prove
that actually did some work I have to
prove that actually spent some money on
energy on electricity to operate a CPU
for a while to come up with a hash and
the trick they use to do this is is kind
of kind of ingenious which is that the
hash that is computed for the block as a
whole has to start with a predefined
number of zeros if you know how a hash
works damn hard to come up with a hash
that starts with a number of zeros
because you can't predict what it'll
look like you have this input stuff and
you change the input stuff you'll get a
new hash and it'll very likely not start
with a Bureaus so you'll try again and
then maybe we'll so how do you do that
in fact there is one value in that block
it's called the nones
sort of the value that you yourself as a
miner can change and you continue to
change that value until you get a hash
that validates with that hat actually
starts with a number of zeros and
validates the whole block so this is a
critical thing so think of this block as
this data structure that includes
references to all the transactions right
it has this this nonce and the
computation of the hash for all his
information including some others it'll
get to has to create a value that has
this starting thing right so it'll take
you a long time to do that in fact when
Bitcoin started you were able to
participate in it with your laptop right
you just
you know you install the software and
then your laptop started mining coin
unfortunately probably none of us
actually did that to significant degree
otherwise we would be sitting in some
holiday resort in the Caribbean instead
of wasting our time at a conference so
where you would have been able to make a
real really bad amount of money but
probably none of us did so what people
do these days is they operate
specialized hardware in fact people say
that the could the most current advances
in hardware in computing power are
driven by Bitcoin miners specialized
Hardware explicitly created for the
process of computing hashes over Bitcoin
blocks because this is now something
where you can make money from now why do
we talk about blocks and what are we
talking about the blockchain well one
thing that I haven't mentioned before is
that any block references the previous
block so the the address of the previous
block which is actually attached to that
doesn't matter the reference to the
previous block is included in the data
that's being signed with that hash so I
can I don't only prove that this block
is valid I also prove that the
connection to the previous block is
valid which means that the previous
block is in self valid which proves of
the previous block as well and so on up
to the Genesis block the original block
that Satoshi put into the original
Bitcoin software which is why the whole
thing forms a chain right so we have
this chain of reference blocks all of
them are validated and you can possibly
see how the number of blocks relates to
the level of trust that you could have
in the whole thing so if if you should
consider how hard it is to forage
something then to forge the very latest
block you only have to compute a new a
new version of this thing right where is
to go back six or seven or ten blocks
you would have to forge all the others
as well that is a very expensive thing
actually you'll end up spending more
money on on forging things then then you
would on actually playing by the rules
which is a great way to make people play
by the rules if it's more expensive to
cheat then why would you do it so it's
easier to just you know follow the rules
and make money doing that
those two using all of the powers that
you have or the hashing power that you
have to try to defraud someone a thermal
lens that's actually something you can
see when you do a Bitcoin transaction
what happens is that the transaction is
transmitted to the network gets
distribute distribute it and then the
the miners create a block and if there
is the first validation of the
transaction you can be somewhat sure
that it was okay because at least
somebody has validated it but you can't
be really sure but if you wait for the
number of time it takes to mine six more
blocks then it'll be so hard to change
that outcome of that transaction that
you can reasonably start shipping goods
but you can ship a car if somebody pay
for it using Bitcoin and you're six
blocks into the validation chain after
that transaction that's kind of okay
that's what people do it's perfectly
fine to trust anything so this I know
there's a lot to take in if you haven't
heard of it before but hopefully if you
hopefully some things at least start to
clear up a bit so we have these blocks
and I mentioned they're there their
chains to form this blockchain so now
we're talking a little bit more about
mining as crude work kind of thing so
the Bitcoin miners are those who
actually invest computing power into
coming up with these new these new
blocks right that's what they do and
they do this by doing this proof of work
thing which is actually you know meeting
this difficulty target that's actually
the number of zeros simplifying here but
doesn't matter so the number of zeroes
determines how hard it is how many how
likely or how unlikely it is that a
random hash will start with that value
if I say just one zero at the beginning
that's much easier than a limit if it
has to have ten do you mentioned that
array the difficulty is actually
adjusted over time so over time it gets
more and more difficult because the
hardware capabilities increase all the
time so we do that and the system
actually works in a way so that it
maintains a certain amount of time that
it typically takes for a block to be
mined it's around ten minutes and been
increasing recently for complicated
reasons but that's about the idea so
after an hour you've got six blocks six
blocks is considered a reasonable amount
of blocks to trust something that
happened that sounds like a long time
you can only trust your coin being
I actually spend or received after an
hour but in fact that's much better than
what you get from your bank because with
your bank if you get a statement they
couldn't break in take it roll it back
on the next day or even the next week
but you cannot be really sure you have
to wait and a number of weeks to make
sure that nobody can still roll back
that transaction this you can every roll
back a committed transaction on the
blockchain the mining process where you
actually invest this amount work
obviously it means that somebody's
spending money this person or company or
organization actually doing the mining
spending significant amount of money for
creating a box so why would they do that
it's another very cool idea about this
whole sole scheme which is that mining
creates new coin so every time a block
is mined a reward is given to the miner
who mind that block I believe it
currently sits at 12.5 but I may be
mistaken it has a rave every few every
few months it was something like 18
months it has it started with 50
bitcoins moved to 25 moved to 12.5 may
still may still be at their door at six
whatever four years thank you very much
so that so this is the only way we get
new bitcoins and that is a very good
motivation because a Bitcoin is now
worth a significant amount of money
right at vidcon sits at about I love
2500 dollars something like that these
days
so getting 12.5 Bitcoin means you're
getting a little 30 I can't cook late
whatever 30 something thousand dollars
which is probably reason enough to to
invest some time there also is an
optional transaction fee so if you want
to if you want your transaction to be
processed faster you can say that some
of the output or one one of the outputs
will be a fee given to the miner and
that's actually the rest of the room the
remainder if you spend all the uppers
and whatever remains is automatically
given to the miner and you can adjust
that you can say well I'm willing to pay
$1 to $5 or $10 for this transaction
because I really care about it being
processed quickly and the miners will
actually take into transactions that
have a higher fee with priority because
obviously they're motivated by money to
do that which in turn also means if you
don't spend that transaction fee it
might take a longer time for doing that
right for actually reaching this valid
step
so let's go with the rest quickly so we
have those nodes I think I mentioned
them before they form this peer-to-peer
network right the whole collaboration
thing they relay messages that's one of
the rules so they pass along the
transactions to the others they validate
transactions and blocks and say actually
if they're a full node so called solo
they maintain a copy of the full
blockchain so everything that ever
happened on this blockchain is contained
in their in their data storage it's
essentially huge and or maybe a few
hundred gigs maybe a little over 100
gigs right now is actually stored on
your disk when you when you run a full
node so you better have some time
downloading that stuff what did I meant
what what did I fail to mention one
thing that I didn't mention and I could
be a reasonable original thing you're
wondering about is who actually decides
who's the one who creates the BOK right
and that actually is an interesting
question we'll get to in a second right
so it's it's actually a race between all
the participants who are into mining
blocks they all compete for for coming
up with the first one who is able to
create a new block that that is valid I
think I mentioned the block chain linked
list little dumb in fact every node will
validate all of the blockchain wants it
downloading it which is why it takes
some time so let me get to this because
this is a key the most important thing I
want to get to which is the consensus
thing so how do the participants in this
distributed peer-to-peer network agree
on something how can you make them agree
that this is actually the correct
history and as I mentioned this is this
this thing of being in a in a race right
so we have this these blocks we have
this immutability and consensus
essentially means I need to have the
longest chain right so if I have if I as
a miner get notified as a new block then
I'll take a look at that block and see
well it's actually it actually
references 500 blocks before it that's
so that's a good thing
somebody has found this new block I can
actually start mining my new block and
making this the previous block for my
block now somebody else notifies me that
there's a longer version of the chain
that has more blocks that's actually a
tempting thing so which of those do I
pick and the general idea is I pick the
one that's the longest because
that is the one that has the most
consensus and if I'm mining a block I
want to be the one who creates the next
block and the whole thing right but if
somebody has overtaken me by already
finding that I throw away my work and
start doing that so essentially after a
little while even though the even though
the chain may split a little bit it'll
converge again that's the distributed
consensus by means of the longest chain
of the proof-of-work approach you got
that you got Bitcoin and blockchain so
we're of multiple parties competing
about finding the next block and then
everybody takes observes the others like
a race where all the runners look at
where the others are and decide on their
strategy and once you know that you've
lost you maybe I don't know the analogy
fails in here you start a new race or
you wait for the next the next
tournament - - how could it makes May 10
so far any questions right now this
would be a very good fun yes yes yeah so
that can happen what can happen is
you've made a bad investment you wasted
some money calculating that block you're
in the middle of that calculation you've
already wasted energy for a thousand
euros or a thousand dollars and then
somebody else comes along with a block
yes that can happen to you so it's kind
of like any other investment right you
you measure your returns and you decide
whether you're really you're succeeding
with a reasonable amount of probability
and whether you actually make money from
this thing or not
I'm not sure I understand understand you
from
yeah so actually that the question is
are there groups of winners and groups
of losers in fact there are something
called mining pools so people mind their
their resources you can actually
participate in a mining pool instead of
setting up your own thing and you have
all of them competing with each other
globally right there's a lot of mining
horror in China one of the reasons that
this is true is because in China
energy is pretty cheap because so I've
heard they don't care that much about
the environmental effects so I'm
starting to wonder if other countries in
the world to care that whatever so of
course the cost of energy is one factor
that determines how good Jared you are
that another factor is how fast is your
network for example is your is your
network inhibited by censorship right is
there some great firewall that makes it
hard for your blocks to get to the other
people so it's it's really a complicated
thing and in fact you get to forge
anything by the power you have you would
have to be able to get more than 51% of
the hashing power of the whole network
so you have to be you have to become as
powerful as half the world that's not
happened so far if it ever did that
would be a real problem but at the
moment the distribute distribution make
sure this for economic reasons doesn't
happen as quickly so one more question
and then I have to conclude yes
sorry I didn't catch them well it allows
you to Forge because you can essentially
make a fake history the correct history
right you collaborate you combine all
that hashing power to change history for
example erase the fact that you had
spent all your millions on this
particular thing while you still have
whatever you bought with it right so
that would be one thing so I have to
continue otherwise that won't get
through so one of the cool things is
Bitcoin that I'm going to leave it is
that it actually isn't this isn't a
static as it seems in fact it has
something called script Bitcoin script
that is actually what's happening
whenever you do one of those
transactions in fact Bitcoin script is
intentionally limited scripting has the
power of a very limited stack based
language like force and I'm going to fly
over this essentially what you do is you
encode a script when you do a
transaction and somebody has to provide
the correct parameters for this script
to arrive at solution that you pre
computed for it to be valid so it's
programmable programmable to a certain
degree now the this allows you to do
fancy things like for example make sure
that multiple recipients provide their
their private key to spend something so
you can pay to multiple people at once
maybe some heritage some legacy kind of
thing where you pay to multiple people
and this is a very cool idea in fact
this idea this concept of a programmable
blockchain led to the next big invention
I'm going to go over that next which is
Assyrian so Assyrian also is based on a
blockchain but aetherium is different in
one specific regard so let's go over the
commonalities first if you remember is
Bitcoin blockchain and both of them a
slightly different currency called ether
doesn't really matter blocks are a
little faster maybe once a minute
it's also proof of work-based although
that's supposed to change in the near
future sometime this year to proof a
stick that I'm not going to get into
that the cool thing about a cerium is
that it is a platform for arbitrary
contracts that's the so-called smart
contract you might have heard of that is
a pretty cool idea the idea here is that
you make that program something that you
can put on the blockchain
and that program can be the recipient of
transact or the target of transactions
all the state is maintained as part of
the blockchain and that now means that
you not only have your classical
recipient like in Bitcoin you also have
this new kind of thing so accounts can
be externally owned that would be like
in Bitcoin right I am the recipient of
some unspent conduction output so I can
use it as input to some other
transactions but recipients can also be
code it's like an agent is I put some
sort of aging on the blockchain and now
that agent will act according to its
program I'd like a company acts
according to its statutes right to its
to its founding statement whatever
whatever it is so the contract here that
the the agent program specifies all of
the rules for interaction and by means
of a special kind of transaction you can
actually put code on that blockchain and
then it sits there in ways for others to
interact with that code and do something
predetermined like for example give you
a small fee and maintain some sort of
record or maybe interact with a
different system or do some computation
your running code on the blockchain in
fact what you're doing is you're running
code on all of the nodes that validate
anything on that blockchain because
every node will have to now run that
program that you put in there which
seems like a like a pretty crazy idea
because that essentially means I'll give
you code and ask you to run it for me
that is something that anyone who's even
remotely familiar with security will
have some doubts about what do you
really want to do that I'm not so sure
so what what aetherium does is it
defines a way for doing that and then I
define the way for you to pay for it so
there's a concept concept of gas on
material which is essentially money used
to pay for computation so when you when
you invoke a method when you do
something you have to pay for the cost
incurred by the system for that and so
you determine that sort of like you you
know you fuel you put that amount of
fuel into that transaction and then
that's all you can spend no more if you
do and if you do a loop that doesn't
return it'll run out for only as long as
you have gas to spend or money to waste
so the execution of instructions
consumes gas
make sense so you can you can prevent
somebody from running a query that never
returns one of the classical problems if
you open up the sequel endpoints to the
to the Internet the theorem for this
purpose has a different programming
languages is a low-level language a
low-level bytecode like the JVM or the
CLR it is called the theory MVM multiple
languages target this thing in fact the
most important one is solidity which is
sort of like a typed JavaScript language
you can use that to write your contracts
there are nice development environments
or command-line tools or integrated
visual environments you can download all
of that stuff from your theory under the
hood and you can essentially program
something that acts as if it were a real
entity a real company or organization
that actually does something smart that
is not doing justice to etherium right I
just spent three slides on the whole
thing and we could probably do a two or
three day workshop in fact I think
yesterday there was a one day workshop
on a theory I'm alone the one the thing
I wanted to get across is that the
blockchain thing has its root in the
Bitcoin world and even the Bitcoin world
included the script ID and aetherium
essentially takes that script idea and
makes it a general-purpose kind of thing
which is a very very cool concept so
we're now taught looked at a boat at the
two big things let's briefly look at
some of the alternatives so that you
know where to put those words there are
similar in their implementations of
similar ideas so for example there are
lots of alternative kinds scoring based
systems with a special purpose or a
generic all derived from the same ideas
more or less at least essentially this
is just research right it started nine
years ago the research in fact started
nine years ago right this is really
really brand-new and very immature stuff
it's not at the end of its lifecycle at
all it's really just starting so those
are some of the things namecoin for
example is something that explicitly
targets at a chain at disrupting DNS
right the idea is that you actually
register domains with this system and
that you get it you do away with the
intermediary necessary for maintaining
all the mappings from names two
addresses
that's something name kind support and
there are lots of ways and we're not
going to detail on des those are all I
think all of them are in general public
like a cerium and
well his hearings changed like recently
but like Bitcoin is Bitcoin is a public
and open blockchain anybody can
participate you don't need permission
from anybody which is if you're look at
it from a political standpoint a very
critical important thing what if I'm
living in a third third third world
country or in some country where the
where the where the government is a
dictatorship and the economy is in ruins
I can still participate in Bitcoin I
have a very little chance of getting a
Visa card or an American Express card
but I can participate in VidCon that is
not true for permission Ledger's a
permission letter requires permission
for you to participate in the whole
thing so in addition to all of those
public things that I mentioned there is
an incredible amount of private Ledger's
or closed group Ledger's similar
technology with some variants in in
terms of scalability and speed and all
of that stuff and all of them actually
have the same goal they're used
internally or with trusted partners they
allow you to maybe as as a bank
collaborate with other banks yes as a
bang together with other banks to maybe
create your own closed blockchain for
some internal use case lots of startups
Markham they've all maybe I mean I refer
to this one open source initiative hyper
ledger which is pretty well known these
days
it's open source at Apache and has some
very very well-known people has IBM
behind lots of other companies who you
want to use this to actually disrupt e
or to participate in the disruption that
this whole blockchain thing is about to
bring in fact aetherium recently got the
etherium Enterprise Alliance or the
other way around
Enterprise the serial Alliance which is
also looking at use cases for the same
software in enclosed or more closed
groups and that has actually given a
cerium a lot of Drive and a lot of rays
in their actual currency value so
what's cool about this whole thing let's
do this very briefly one very cool thing
is that you have this distributed
consensus thing right you don't have the
central authority you have pretty
immediate
mostly unbreakable trust in this whole
thing so nothing well of course it can
be broken if you have enough power but
it's highly unlikely which is a very
cool thing it's open anyone can
participate and there is no centralized
control so it's really truly globalized
depending on your political leanings you
either like that a lot or you hate it
right depending on your view on what the
role of the state should be and we can
discuss that at lunch but essentially it
is open to anybody at least if it's an
open blockchain like those so we're
skipping the detour into politics here
the key idea is that you can disrupt
intermediaries every time you have
somebody who is responsible for
providing consistency as a service you
could potentially disrupt them using a
blockchain approach because that's what
a clearing center does that's what a
bank does that's what all these people
do who maintain a registry or something
that many people depend on all these
intermediates have a risk of turning
into the monopoly of charging ridiculous
prices think of the financial networks
think of the cost that a transaction one
of the goal of credit card networks
actually incurs and think of your power
to change that thing if you've ever ever
interacted with some of the more
well-known payment companies on the
internet you probably know what I mean
it's possibly influenced by politics
right if somebody decides that we want
to have more of that then of course you
you just have to play by their rules
because your influence is very linked
the blockchain has the potential of
cutting out the middleman in the still
same way so that is that is one of the
key disruptive disruptive and disruptive
ideas here reduce the cost for the whole
thing we have everywhere where somebody
relies on cost reductions for this stuff
we actually can can reduce the cost by
just relying on this distributive model
what you can do is you can even we can
reduce the cost of the blockchain if you
look at Bitcoin Bitcoin is under
criticism because it wastes a lot of
energy you could argue whether it's
actually wasting it because it is going
to screw it's creating some value with
it right the value of having this
network
still it creates a lot of heat to do
this proof-of-work kind of thing and
that feels bad because it would be nicer
if we didn't have to do that
specifically if we have more trust I
don't trust a random person on the
internet so I'm happy that this approval
work thing protects me but if I have a
contractual relationship to some other
companies in a country where rules and
laws are reasonably enforced then maybe
I need a little less trust so the
permission model could be an interesting
and interesting way to go about this so
those are sort of the good parts of the
whole thing but what about the bad parts
what about all those things that you
heard of that really are are pretty bad
so one thing that I have to mention very
briefly is the Bitcoin fraud discussion
I think I mentioned that before every
Bitcoin except every time something bad
happened to any of those things always
at the exchange it's always at the
boundary when you go from bid calling to
something else because when you do that
currently you have to interact with some
sort of exchange and if you make the
mistake of leaving your money there as
opposed to transferring it so that it
resides on your private account
all the stuff is encumbered with the
keys that you only hold privately you
have this risk of being a being a victim
of fraud that can happen and that is a
really sad thing but it's not a systemic
not a technical description it's in fact
much less vulnerable dynamical currency
this is true for Bitcoin right it's
because it's you know exactly what what
it can't happen you had don't know the
the economic effects it's going to have
on society you don't know the trading
value it's going to have to with the
outside currencies but inside it's
actually pretty pretty reason another
another thing is often mentioned as the
etherium a vulnerability specifically
the DAO
so if you consider that that was
actually one of those smart contracts
that allow people simplifying very very
strongly here it allowed people to
invest money into this company that some
people just created they created a
contract and so it wasn't a company was
an incorporated company it was just a
contract that you could send money to
and that contract then would spend this
money on investing and return the return
on investment to its owners right the
kind of input of a joint fund of things
which is a pretty cool thing because it
all all ran very very fancy a lot of
those things on this one I think
gathered up to a hundred million dollars
in a
out a month 100 million dollars of value
was put into the DAO and then about
sixty million of those were stolen they
were stolen because it was a bug in the
contract code now that is one of the
risks right one of the risks when you
run this code and trusted is that
there's a Bachelor in fact people knew
about this bug for a few days before but
nobody actually sort of expected that
somebody would have enough incentive to
exploit it although I have to say that
60 million u.s. dollars sounds like a
pretty good incentive to me whatever
somebody did it so what do you do then
what these human people did was dated a
hard fork a hard fork is eight a fork in
the in the chain that allows you that
happen requires you to update to a new
version of a software to participate in
the in the new blood the new block
validation process and they essentially
rewrote history they rewrote the DAO and
all the related transactions out of
history and continued as if it had never
happened which brings our very
interesting philosophical and political
questions was that a good thing to do
was it correct losing it that the bug in
the code is actually correct because
that's what everybody agreed on in fact
we now have to eat cereals with here in
classic and aetherium that's because it
was a Forex some people decided to stay
with the old one which create also all
sorts of very interesting problems so it
in its interest of time I'm going to
skip over a few things and talk about
what I what I believe today yeah let me
do that so after spending time with this
whole thing I've come to believe certain
things one of the things is that I
absolutely strongly firmly convinced
that this thing is here to stay this is
not going to go away this is not
something that is just overhyped and
stupid and unnecessary I'm not useful I
would be pretty careful in risking my
life savings in any of those currencies
right I know people who do that but I'd
be pretty careful because I care about
my life savings maybe you don't maybe
you can have a little play money that
you could put there that would be okay
but it's going to play a significant
role because it's really a new way of
doing things
second thing that I've come to believe
is that it's a bad idea to dismiss the
public block change many people do that
it's so if you look at the typical trade
magazine and sort of pop science IT
magazine they'll say well yeah the block
chain is the cool thing bitcoin is just
this bad thing for hackers I'm not sure
I've heard the same things being said
about the internet a while ago because
we had all those much better networks
and is actually the Internet the public
internet that we now do everything on so
I think there's a certain chance that
one of those public block chains will
actually because of the network effect
end up being the backbone of whatever
else happens mainly permission Ledger's
this closing is the future but maybe
it's just a stepping stone to something
that like like an intranet or extranet
if anybody remembers those words right
like oh people like me do this is a kind
of idea because there before everybody
committed to doing stuff on the internet
anyway also a pretty new development is
that you can actually connect that stuff
you could actually now have sort of a be
directional bridge between one of the
public block block chains and one of
your private ones so that you can
actually profit from the network effect
while still having full control over
your own destiny in your own chain and I
think the barrier to entry has never
been as low as I've played with this
stuff and it's absolutely amazing that
you can download the software write a
program and then be online with a
business actually making money without
talking to anybody without getting
anybody's permission this is really
amazing I've never seen such a quick way
from having an idea for they get into
code and I'm actually having it as a as
a business running and this is sort of
what this whole thing is about this
ruptor be disrupted it wrongly my
opinion I think we do have little time I
don't think it's going to change
everything next year but I think it's
extremely important and it's something
that you definitely should take a look
at and with that I guess I'm out of time
and maybe have time for one or two
questions if you have any</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
