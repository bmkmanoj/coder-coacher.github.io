a little bit inflammatory a little bit
challenging and almost an extension of
what I was talking about this morning
whereas talking this morning is very
much more about architecture design and
technology this is going to try to
rebase ever so slightly are thinking
around agility and what we will do so
it's almost become something that would
fail them not test these days to say who
in the room is an agile software
developer the majority of you will
probably raise your hands it's not
something that typically is goes on the
CV as being something that's a
differentiator for you although I
remember when it was however I think
part of that commoditization of agility
has to a certain degree removed us
several degrees sometimes from what we
were trying to do in the first place and
even to some degree the agile principles
don't keep us particularly honest to it
we can still probably take most of the
boxes and still not get some of the
benefits that I think that we sorely
need okay so who's seen me talk before
who's in talk this morning cool then you
know what's coming to a certain degree
you knowing that you know when things
happen what's happening okay but it is a
different story okay my name is Russ
miles I do these sorts of talks a lot
and my main mission is to help people
develop software that is not just
simpler but that brings the advantages
of simplicity which is I think more
adaptable software okay what does that
mean on a track primarily talking about
process well hopefully it's going to
bring a bit of rebasing into the room
and perhaps but a bit of a shift in our
thinking to understand some of the
reasons we're doing what we do so I call
this without simplicity there's no
agility slightly inflammatory I was
going for a bit of a punch after lunch I
then moved on I said it could be let's
stop polishing the process turd then
we'll know what hurt is
I'm familiar with yeah okay and I
thought that maybe going a step too far
so let's stop it let's start polishing
the process turd quite so much okay I
would like to just remind us of what
we're trying to achieve and hopefully by
the end of this session it will have got
you thinking a little bit differently
about what you do as a job as well as
what we're all trying to achieve in
software development I don't aim low I
did have a more politically correct
answer though I did decide to say on
what matters which I loved because it
was very echoey of Bertrand Russell my
favorite philosopher at the moment
anyway and that he didn't pull punches
easier either and I like the fact that
we can talk I can talk up here because I
get to be on this massive stage about
what I think matters in software
development but you might be asking
yourself aren't we already there yet I'm
who's a who's an agile software
developer give me a give me a raise of
hands who who would say they're not an
agile software developer who would say
they work in some other facet of
software delivery but would never call
themselves a developer okay that's
that's about the base of thinking okay
yes so arguably there's a lot of
thinking out there and I encounter this
a lot with clients where they say we've
gone agile it's done and I try to
understand what that means for them I
losing my first job is so I understand
why they think they're done and why
being done was ever actually pile of the
reason they were there in the first
place and it usually comes round two
they've adopted some process which are
all probably familiar with several
processes perhaps or approaches and I
often get a bit of a shock because I'll
turn round and say so you've organized
your work how's that working out for you
is that all you've done and that does go
often get a little bit of a comeback but
that's essentially what you know you're
scrum ban techniques are its means of
organizing work as effectively as
possible and that's great
it's a really long distance to have come
from where we were I do remember the
several year projects that resulted in
nothing being delivered but so we've
come a long way but have we just really
organized our work better and that's
what I would put you is I think that
we've spent a lot of effort probably
quite rightly on getting our process
better getting better at how we organize
the work we have to do recognizing some
of the features of what software is all
about but without recognizing them all
so those are the sorts of features I
want to leave you with today is the
features of software delivery that still
matter and that are still a challenge
and that deserve your thought because
the answer isn't always going to come
off a stage it's going to come very much
from the sorts of people that come to
these sorts of conferences okay so if we
could just darken the room completely if
we can aha this is so much better in a
big room Wow okay hopefully no one's
sitting next to someone they feel
uncomfortable with right now and that
hopefully isn't completely nervous
laughter okay because what I'd like to
do is tell you a little story another
little story I told another I'll told
one this morning this story is about
possibly the best client I ever met so
this morning story was a bit kind of
depressing I think for everyone so this
story is more of an uplifting story my
best put yourself in my shoes close your
eyes if you will we started I was
brought in everything was good I met my
client they turned around and said we
want you to help with our team I started
to help the team I had the worst moment
that any consultant is likely to
encounter I couldn't help them they were
that good already they were already
using great techniques great practices
great processes they knew what value
they were trying to
deliver they were in a safe place and so
I had the unfortunate moment picture
yourself in this moment this is why I've
darkened the room you are that person
now walking up to your major stakeholder
and having to say the words no one wants
to which is you don't need me I'm
basically you're done I can't think of
anything else to do here I wasn't just
turning something small down this was
two years worth of effort ahead of me it
was a lot of money to turn away but I
did the next words were amazing they
were okay we're good enough why don't
you go and check that we're doing the
right thing so I did and that's what I
want to talk about today is moving past
the process and practices and into doing
the right thing and to do that we need
to rebase what matters in software
delivery so lights back up please well
that's quick whoa that's bright okay no
one left cuz i was watching the doors
that's pretty good no one could see the
stairs okay so the story hopefully puts
you in the mindset of trying desperately
to figure out what could it be added to
this team his teams were doing amazing
things they were using the right
technologies I was amazed that the
plethora of technologies they were
experienced an expert in and I was
trying to help that's my job and I
couldn't give them anything new so I was
sent off to see the value that was being
delivered and it was appropriate but it
was completely the wrong thing okay
so why was it the wrong thing what were
some of the forces that could work
against them they were using a good
process for managing their work they
were using all these great practices
what could have gone wrong well the
force is against them first of all they
were slowing down they were good but
they were slowing down okay you've
probably all experienced this yourselves
where you get to a certain points
whether it be sprint tens for in 13
sprint 30 whatever there's usually a
moment at which things are getting
slower and people start talking about
taking a few Sprint's to alleviate
technical debt or they start talking
about how we need to do some refactoring
for a few days part of this is because
we're not recognizing the natural
emergence of the problem space we're
working in we're not working in
manufacturing by any stretch and
although we have work management
techniques processes that help us with
with many of the aspects of running our
lives and doing the right work we aren't
necessarily helped in the fundamental
unknowable ness of software neil for
this morning talked about the unknowable
unknowable this is really a tragically
difficult part of what we do we don't
really help ourselves with entanglement
whether we're working in the top four
develop teams we're talking about
communication structures between teams
we don't help or control or in any way
manage these sorts of entanglement that
again slows things down and one thing we
seem to have forgotten even though it is
said many times in the literature is
that human comprehension is the single
biggest restrictions the one that can
really stop you going any further we all
laugh about it when we hear someone say
okay we're going to take you know I know
you've got these ten people what we're
going to take those 10 people get rid of
them and bring in different 10 people is
that okay you know they're all software
developers roughly
same level pass the same interview are
you good are you feeling confident
probably not that's because we recognize
that someone's comprehension of the
problem and comprehension of the
artifact that we create in software
which is the code itself is incredibly
valuable and important to our
productivity important to our progress
and we too easy we tend to confuse it
because we tend to push this particular
problem into the background we still
desire to build software like we were
building parts on an assembly line and
we also have our assumptions every
probably everyone in this room is it
very successful at what they do orly
planning to be and one of the issues
with what we do is we tend to expose
ourselves to the possibility of things
going wrong all the time as a consultant
we get very good at backtracking we get
very good at being able to say our
didn't know that that's different now my
knowledge is refined now this is my
advice not easy and you can tell an
experienced consultant from a non
experience one them and their ability to
do this the problem is we're making
assumptions all time and we're making
them hidden away we're hidden bit we
hide those assumptions behind either
authority in which case we point at a
book and say it's what it says in there
therefore we should do this this way or
we hide behind strength of statement our
forcefulness of will who's a scrum
master in the room who likes that master
bit all right power no I actually
changed the name of scrum masters in my
particular 10 medical organizations i
called him scrum facilitators I've got a
low-resistance okay but essentially that
was mum a majority of the workload that
they were conducting I do have an issue
with the master part
think the implies Authority and answer
that I don't think it's fair to push on
other people I have a similar issue with
the definitions of agile coach agile
software developer agile and you have
you had that experience where you go to
I don't know some social gathering where
there are other agile ists and you ask
them what agile is and if you're lucky
you get a point to point it to the
manifesto if you're unlucky you don't
get anything like that you get several
answers and so my problem is that
there's a lot of assumptions we build up
and with a lot of things we don't know
and we hide them behind some authority
or we hide them behind our strength of
will or our roles and it's actually
aunty this whole learning thing we're
trying to do is we build software so
what are the now the problems are
software development what are the issues
I see today in what we do well first and
foremost overproduction quick shower
hands who knows what overproduction is
and has seen it happen okay asked quite
a few hands okay overproduction just to
give it a characteristic is building the
wrong thing right actually having built
something potentially done it in
extremely effective way but it happening
to be the wrong thing would it be too
much or too little we've overproduced
the analogy I like to give who's married
in the room or got a partner right now
but they're living with a living with
parts important okay right okay so
picture the scene you've just come home
you're tired you spent a long day being
a scrum master and you've come into the
your house and you can sense this
something wrong aren't you you've
forgotten something but you don't know
what it is by any jet you can't even
imagine what it might be so what do you
do you run around the room you do all
the tidying if you've got kids you put
them to bed
okay you picked the movie that he or she
will like this evening you go and cook
the meal that they love you do
everything you what you clean right you
clean the place and you set the dinner
with the candles the music they love and
you detest and you've said it and you
sit down and you can still see it in
their eyes something's wrong and you
start to feel a little bit hard done by
and so you have to ask what's wrong and
then you get the answer and the answer
could be something in his often as
trivias why didn't you give me a hug
when you came in boy have you over
produced so in production despite having
it being a fun story is not something we
want to be doing and it's a source of
massive waste in the industry and I
think we've spent the last 10 to 12 13
years getting to a point where we can
achieve over production because in the
past we couldn't produce much at all I
don't know if anyone else has had
similar experiences to me but I've spent
several years sometimes almost decades
with companies never delivering any
software and yet we were a solutions
delivering company so I can see the
improvement I give I certainly endorse
and understand the improvement that
we've achieved and I do think the
processes we applied have helped a great
deal but it's still there and now it's
almost like we've tuned the engine to
the point where we can now fire all
cinders head off into the sunset and hit
a brick wall we're now capable of it in
the past we could even get the engines
died so we were having that problem for
now it's all about where are you going
and getting there in the most effective
way so Oh production building the wrong
thing but potentially building it right
and the next problem is how do you build
software that adapts to the fact you
don't know yet what the right thing
okay this is an essential problem in
software it's not that it's not that
we're I'm indecisive we really don't
know what the answer is yet I'll talk
about why we don't know in a moment so
we need techniques technical techniques
that help us create software that can
add at that can in breakthrough Lee
embrace change we've got techniques that
should help tdd continuous integration
and degree continuous delivery clean
code these are techniques that help us
create code that can adapt but I would
suggest that we are not going anywhere
near far enough so it's no good looking
at these things in isolation is no good
saying should we fix over production by
thinking about these things this way and
then ignoring the fact that we can't
keep up with our software delivery in
the first place I suggest no I would
rather not spend the next 10 years
solving one problem and not the other
because frankly I've probably only got
another 20-30 years of my career and I
would like to see a better world at the
end of it okay or some time beforehand
okay so these are not just problems out
of thin air these are problems I've been
writing up into a book that I'm working
on at the moment and the primary goal
list book is to address both of these
issues and bring these two threads
together because there are a lot of
smart people addressing either end of
the scale and trying to bring the two
together and so I put to you that I
think the problems of software delivery
and you as scrum masters project
managers testers have a massive part to
play here okay it's about for me it's
about overproduction and it's about
somehow keeping my software adaptable
okay those are our problems by the way
I'm an amateur philosopher so once
you've got problems you start to work
towards axioms and if you saw the
actions this morning I apologize i run
through it and relatively quickly the
axioms being your software's first and
foremost should be useful I don't know
many people who would argue against it
slightly utilitarian perspective on the
world
but we aren't here to make beautifully
crafted things we're not here to
necessarily create art we're here to
create something that has value and is
useful okay arguably it's possible that
some software could be so beautiful even
if it didn't work it could be considered
art and valuable I haven't met it yet if
anyone has I would love to see it but I
have met for the course of my career
something that could be considered
beautiful code and when I hear that
phrase a little part of me dies because
it's usually beautiful code because
somebody smart is telling other people
that it's beautiful ok this is the UT
what you mean you can't understand it it
is and I'm smarter than you so therefore
whatever you want to do to this amazing
piece of code this is awesome and I
experienced this when I was working with
O'Reilly on the beautiful code book and
I thought I'd to in the end come away
from it a bit because this was not my
definition of beauty I wanted code was
very different from what then something
that attracted the intelligence here
only I wanted cartoon code right I
wanted a level of code that was as easy
to read as the funnies in a newspaper if
I could achieve that I think I'm winning
and I'll explain why in a minute but
that aside just getting it useful is
probably gate one gate to the best
software is the software you don't have
to write at all otherwise known as they
make yourself redundant rule okay what
does this mean needs to be explained
going back to our story we had I had the
best team great tech practices great
techniques even a valuable problem to be
solved i noticed when i went to observe
what was going to be done with the
software they were building that they
did not need to
what they were doing there was a much
easier answer and a simpler answer all
that was actually required with some
post-it notes and a wall they were about
to embark on a 10 man team two year
effort to build a piece of software ins
well one of the things with scala but
also several other languages as well for
no good reason and so when I approached
my stakeholder and said think you're
probably doing the wrong thing I think
we could do something else unless I'm
oversimplifying it she actually turn
around and said I know but we need to be
delivering something and we're going to
deliver that so I couldn't no conscience
continue but interestingly enough even
in the face of doing such doing
something else that was going to be
ignored and that was the argument I had
which was it's not a question of deliver
software or make yourself redundant its
deliver something make a useful change
and if you can do it quicker a different
way why not move on to something else
why not do something else you're not
you're making yourselves redundant you
just been able to do more isn't that
better and unfortunately this didn't
work in that particular case but in
other cases since it has and people
recognize that if there is a non
software solution that's something we
should be considering it's a danger of
our industry I think that when problems
are brought to us they are brought to us
as solutions build this please you're
lucky if you get please build this you
know minion and do it quickly on project
manager here's a list here's a backlog
go forth and do this it's all understood
please just do it this is not a reason
why we have opened up over production is
this imply belief that we know exactly
what solution we're building by the time
it hits us it nine times out of ten the
solution is not
known and we're not asking the questions
that would explore that human
comprehension is king I've mentioned
this already once today your software
your artifact of what you build your
team's build if you're not developing it
yourself is the reason you're there I've
met teams that are the best teams I've
ever met and if they're still building
the wrong thing or the building at the
wrong way makes no good it doesn't
equate exactly that a great team will
build great software you can have
brilliant teams that don't so you need
that aspect of concentrating on who's
going to consume this thing we create
this code well first and foremost human
beings without a doubt other humans are
going to want to read this and they are
going to be the key limiting factor to
you continuing to be successful this is
where we talk about the slowdown in
projects we talk about technical debt
alleviation a lot of that is around the
fact that learning rate we made
assumptions in the past that now
disagree with us or disagree with what
we've got to do next people can't
comprehend what we've got anymore and
this is an insidious one as well it's
not always obvious that people can't
comprehend it you just noticed they
start to slow down mechanical sympathy
is the queen well this is kind of an
acknowledgement that of course every
piece of cobra writing needs to also
address the consumer that is the Machine
enough in wherever it's going to run so
that's important but it's seen if you
like as slightly secondary in a
patriarchal monarchy we're essentially
it's there in support of human
comprehension as well and this is the
biggie particularly for this session
which is that we do research and
development I've heard this a few time
from some very smart people but I don't
think it's out there in industry enough
that we are involved in research and
development we don't know what we're
building yet so everyone who works out
budgets based on yearly expenditure
needs to recognize that that money could
be spent to try to achieve some things
but we don't know what they are yet very
difficult cell layers some mechanisms
I've had success with is to turn around
and say think of it like a sweet shop
well you don't yet know what your fancy
and you can help to pick what you want
as you work over time rather than
thinking you have to buy it all up front
but it's a very tricky one to overcome
and I think it comes from a fundamental
misunderstanding salute research and
develop developers or solution research
and development people we've lost that
and it hurts us and I guess just to pay
a little bit to our ego just type
slightly is a software develop itself is
an extremely challenging pursuit I don't
think many people here would argue with
it would you it's wrong a turnaround say
it's the easiest thing they've ever done
if you have you've had a varied
interesting life it is an intellectual
pursuit it doesn't happen there I do not
understand and I still find it hard to
comprehend why we are infatuated by how
fast we can use a keyboard okay I've met
developers who are very impressive with
their ide to the point where i'm pretty
sure i guess like performance art I
can't see what they're doing anymore
it's brilliant you try pair programming
with them okay so but that's not
important that isn't where the value
happens where we contribute most well
for me it's here what no not to the
right the middle of it okay that's where
I do most of my software development in
the shower strange ideas come to me and
I I am sad enough to admit yes I do have
a waterproof white
broadband pen that I can sit there and
go hour before I forget that put that
down that's where it happens but how
many people who are working with
software development teams truly
recognize this and set up environments
that support it oh and some people do
their thinking there that's a different
game okay so I think there are three
areas for us to address and I would put
that to you this is where I think we
should be concentrating our efforts
first I think we need to get better at
exploring what is needed exploring and
delivering the right thing whether it be
a change in process or a change in
anything exploring the change we're
going to make any software delivery is a
change in the world okay it's a change
in someone else's hopefully their
ability to do perhaps their job or
something similar so we need to be much
better understanding we're about to
cause a change and take responsibility
as an agile software development team
that's important to us okay number one
number two a means of organizing work
don't embrace change I kind of think we
are there I think we have means of
organizing work we've got the cam bands
and the scrums this world and I think
they're doing very very well for us so I
don't think we need to spend a huge
amount of effort there that can be wrong
there's probably some research to be
done but by and large how we organize
ourselves and how we interact one other
is getting pretty good mitted lee there
are some organizations that are very
much early on the curve there but I
think what we're looking at is commodity
roll out rather than huge research three
though a means of managing the natural
constraints of your software so that it
can adapt because it's going to stop you
otherwise you can have the best
processes in the world with the best
backlog even the best understanding of
what you're going to build and your
software still
you down without taking it seriously and
that's what i call a doubt from software
that's my mission if you like is to try
to help people adopt tools and
techniques that help their software be
adaptable as i mentioned the prior
session it's not about configuration
okay it's not about whether you can
change the behavior of software at
runtime it's about whether when someone
turns around to you tomorrow and says i
need you to do X because X is now the
priority you have prepared yourself and
your software enough to say okay we have
a process that helps us embrace change
my software is going to take that on
board with me and not hold me back okay
so i was asking our session what is
simplicity so i thought i'd share my
definition reduction to the point that
any further reduction will remove
important value it's a continuum okay it
sits as a means of reducing entanglement
okay primarily complexity is just
entanglement okay in a in a system where
you're looking at technique to simplify
or not there will be complex they'll be
about right and they'll be overly
simplified i'll give you an example of
oversimplification one of my good
colleagues and friends graco a ditch was
asked to help an organization to
simplify and deliver some value to a
particular IT department the IT
department was simply stating they had a
goal and it was important to them as a
high value when asked what that high
value result was it was we're currently
running at 40 million a year we want to
be running at 80
to be fair to Greek oh he's a man of
principle his first instinct was to hold
out his hand and say let's go buy a
yacht we can increase your revenue
outgoings easily by just giving me 40
million right now okay what
demonstrating here is an oversimplified
goal there was obviously caveats to this
the 40 million couldn't be spent for fun
there had to be other reasons why it was
there so specifying those other reasons
exploring what wasn't being stated
exploring the underlying assumptions got
him to a point where they can understand
how simple an answer it could be the
other examples when I was working with a
team in London where they said we've
been tasked with removing the call
center okay is that all yeah okay we'll
just remove it then no no no no if we
remove it no the calls are coming and we
won't service our customers okay so you
want to reduce the cost of the call
center but with other things okay we
spent a lot of time over simplifying
answers we're all doing probably
iterative development here or some sort
of iteration boxing time boxing who's
doing that that sort of technique at the
moment okay how did you come to the
understanding it's a rhetorical question
huh how did you come to on staying of
how long an iteration should be was it
what everyone else was doing was it
following what someone else has dictated
we do too much this I'm not saying
anyone else here has done this but we do
it in the industry we take on doctrinal
authoritative answers without exploring
why they're useful to us and having a
tool like simplicity helps you to look
at these sorts of approaches and say
does it make things better are we
actually achieving a better impact okay
so it is this continuum of complex too
simple to oversimplified and we should
be in every decision we make whether
you're working is a scrum master whether
you're working as agile coach or any
manipulation to these complex human
systems that deliver software look at
what your dirty impact you're trying to
achieve and look at the simplest method
of getting there if the method of
getting there is so simple that actually
getting there is not going to achieve
what you want you've oversimplified so I
use this rationale this thinking process
in every single new technique that I
apply two teams I'm working with I
explore given a set of options what is
the impact I'm going to achieve I intend
to achieve and how could I measure it
and what assumptions is it based upon
and then I bring those new techniques
where possible to an experimental
scenario where I can look to see where
they truly will deliver that impact but
it's amazing to me and maybe I'm in a
room full of people that already do this
which is great it's amazing to me how
many times we fiddled and tweak with
these complex human systems trying to do
something useful without ever looking at
either the evidence that's already out
there or building our own volume of
evidence okay so simplicity need a
little bit more definition I started off
with five principles I grabbed them from
John Mader's book on simplicity which is
great wonderful book the laws of
simplicity he had five main laws which
is organized separate reduce hide and
adapt okay so guiding principles so when
looking at a change in process or
looking and changing the software can we
organize things but if we can't change
anything unless it's organized things
are a chaotic then changing anything is
going to be very difficult unless you're
trying to remove chaos so you have to
organize first that was his main point
separate things out make sure there are
separations are concerns the same thing
works in terms of software as it also
works inside that the activities
involved in teams make sure you
understand what needs to be done and
breaking it down don't think any that's
particularly argumentative reduce is the
hard one without oversimplifying
reducing what needs to be done because
sometimes you need to let go is
something very very dear to you
I was working with a team a brilliant
set of individuals who were struggling
to be a team and their issue was that
every sprint sprint on sprint they were
increasing their they are basically the
amount of work they were taking into the
spring because they felt like they were
behind every sprint was another big
batch of oh we had five things last time
we've almost finished five why don't we
bring another five in and then the next
one well we've we've almost finished
those nine why have you bring another
five in and so what you have is
incredibly demoralizing situation where
the project management in any form were
ripping their hair out quite literally
and what could they actually do well I
reduced the situation down I ran an
experiment and I reduced it down I said
from what really matters delivery of one
thing now is what you care about you
don't care about two weeks you don't
care about two months you do for your
planning I understand that but right now
nothing's working so what I did which is
controversial and worked and it's worked
several times but don't just do it take
it as something I've done and that you
might find use from is I broke that team
into pieces I had three people in the
end I have three people who could
deliver and I asked them could they
deliver something every day they break
up the work such that they were
delivering something ideally something
of value every single day and they did
in the first two weeks were hell okay
but after that sustainability crept in
and they began to know they're working
practices better and they will they were
actually starting to really hum then I
then I had a question why don't we had
more people into the team so that we can
do more now I have another team of three
or four people that will do this for for
me now this just sounds like team
structuring for agile teams but it was a
massive reduction at first in what they
were they conceivably was supposed to be
working upon
they'd measured work in progress as a
measure of measurement of progress and
there's a lot of people who still do
that it's about how busy people are not
how what they're delivering well I
completely disagree it's about what's
being done and that's what really helped
so reducing down the amount that's in
progress is something we're familiar
with the Kanban anyway so all I was
doing is applying that in multiple areas
across the technology stack as well but
I have to simplify these five anyway
because I thought they were a bit
overblown and so I have my principles
which are simply organized reduce and
encapsulate I've applied these three
principles to everything from process to
the software architecture and software
designed the code okay I have a number
of techniques are used to apply these
these principles but these are enough
for me to build experiments that make
things better but actually I can see in
the measurables where things are
improving or not and again I stress when
I run experiments I run through
experiments I look for the for an
hypothesis that can be disproved I don't
construct hypothesis that could always
be proved there look for ones that can
be disproved straight out of Karl
poppers thinking okay so what I'm doing
it will it be process all software is I
reduce this entanglement I make it so
that people can comprehend what is going
on and that's the important point the
comprehension it's very easy to separate
from individuals and people what is
going on in the progress of a whole
process even from what they can tangibly
see they're delivering it's very easy
for people and also potentially come
comforting so not comprehend the real
impact of what they're doing and so I
would argue that it's not easy to
increase comprehension it is in software
it's actually relatively trivalent
software but in human processes and
practices
as we're talking about in this track
it's one of the hardest things for
people to accept because they feel the
burden of responsibility okay so or is
the key its key principles and the goal
is very simply to beat the elephant in
the stand up I couldn't get a picture of
people actually standing up
unfortunately okay what is the elephant
and stand up its first of all every
piece of software you wrote yesterday
that is going to argue with you today
okay but that's not all it's also all
the assumptions around requirements
around the processes you're doing all of
the practices you might be applying it's
all of those that may prevent you from
re-examining those things today to get
better at what you're doing tomorrow so
my problem is that there isn't just one
elephant in the written the stand up or
one elephant in the room when you're
doing software development there's two
there's the one that is all the
assumptions and baggage and doctrine we
already have and the other is the actual
software we're delivering ok so my
employment to you I suppose is that by
thinking about simplifying what you do
the software you're building the
solutions you're coming up with the
change you're making you would get
better at doing what this drawings
trying to perhaps not perfectly show you
he is supposed to be pushing the
elephant it's not necessarily anything
else ah but the idea is again as the
software developers don't ever get them
to do drawings and this is a whiteboard
and you can get rid of it relatively
quickly so this was a drawing i put
together and the idea is we try to push
these elephants along and to certain
degree just identified that they're
there acknowledge that you yourself have
your own baggage i worked with in a
scrum environment for several years
before I realized that iterations were
entirely arbitrary as were stand-up
meetings which was a crazy thought at
the time I noticed that we were doing
stand up some weed
need them so why do we do them every day
now that's almost akin to saying father
Christmas doesn't exist to a child but
stand-ups are a wonderful technique for
sharing your but your load and sharing
your problems and hack getting some team
support how many people have seen it
abuse to make it status reports yeah
yeah and it's painful so I've actually
been the position of saying well we
don't need a stand-up today because as
far as everyone's aware the way the
tempos of these teams work we haven't
encountered problems we know we haven't
so why not do some tomorrow it's not
problem we'll experiment it and see if
it has any real effect in that case it
didn't and that taught me something very
important which are hoping I'm getting
across is that you as software
developers are working not only in
domains that are full of unknowns but
you're working and your ways of working
are fluid and open for your own
experiment okay you can change anything
you do and you might come across
something better and you'll come across
it better for your given environment and
that's absolutely key okay so let's
simplicity be your guide look for the
patterns in your own behavior sorts of
patterns I look for will count the
concerns how many things are people
trying to think about a given moment in
time okay ask people and you'll get a
fairly objective answer whether they're
doing a technique or part of the process
are they doing multiple things at once
if they are stop it we're human we're
not greater it the rule is 5 plus or
minus 2 i'm dubious about the plus i
think it's more like 5-2 possibly minus
another 2 ok so we recognize that human
limitation let's do things that allow us
to focus so count the concerns there a
simple pattern I've used a lot it's not
about cardinality it's not about doing
lots of different thing I'll be worried
about how many things are happy
it's about how many things people have
to think about at a given moment in time
okay it's about people and their own
limitations we're looking at code or
whether they're working within a process
we know simplicity when we see it in
software we can apply the same
techniques to our processes anyone
recognize this app this is back in the
day this is back when Apple wasn't
really sure what they did okay arguably
sometimes they don't now but here what
is supposed was X grid this was Apple
giving you a parallel processing
application that could work yeah you
could harness the power of all your
expensive desktops to run a piece of an
algorithm essentially and it worked
brilliantly it was excellent they did
one thing and they did one thing well
doesn't necessarily make it a commercial
success I'm afraid but it did that one
thing so we recognize simplicity when we
see it we recognize it why don't we
treat our processes the same way not
everything is up for grabs nothing is
taboo be brutal in your reduction and I
guess the message here is sometimes it's
Trixie because we come with our own
baggage okay being simply being simpler
in the what we do and building simpler
things is hard okay who's devoted who's
developing the room right Oh developers
who see code roughly every day okay
wonderful what's wrong with that code
shut out
first of all what is your UT absolutely
good question it's unit under test but
you weren't necessary going to know that
that's called that's slightly
conflicting isn't it but that's not the
biggest problem sorry no now check also
an issue not the only problem we wanted
to be equal to recommend off just
because we do yes we have a magic string
so that's at least another problem
absolutely it's something else no one's
seen the bug please string comparison is
part of it although you get away with it
to some degree but yes I can see where
you're coming from it's not quite that
there's actually a bug that would cause
this to be a bit of a nightmare to use
the parameters are the wrong way around
how many times has anyone ever
experienced that and you'll know Aaron
have written those assert lines and
thought is it expected or actual that
goes first and that's just in one line
of code so complexity is insidious and
nasty imagine it in a complex human
system for some techniques unnecessary
to overcome this and I need to figure i
need to close out now i'm afraid what
sort of options have we got the
techniques I use so the sort of
techniques I use to build the right
thing things like impact mapping now
when you're using impact mapping or look
it up wonderful technique works well
with specification by example so but I
also use impact mapping beyond where it
is originally keed i use impact mapping
just to evaluate technical solutions
because they're all of hypotheses about
how you could approach a given piece of
code real options if you haven't looked
into what Chris matches talking about
please do and as a quick summary
simplicity itself is there too it's a
tool for us to use to simplify our
processes and I put you it is a very key
tool in helping us build adaptable
software that embraces change and help
us to adapt our processes and practices
so they can also improve my guidance to
you is to use the three principles make
sure things are organized such that you
can comprehend them then you can reduce
and where there is complexity that you
just can't get away from because it is
part of the problem then that's when you
have to encapsulate hide it away as best
you can emergence is natural to what we
do its part of the underpinnings of
everything we do and I put to you that I
think adaptable software and processes
and practices that can adapt will win
companies that can adapt the way they
build software because their people are
able to look think outside of the bounds
and constraints of what they're working
with at the moment will get far better
quicker than everyone else and if the
software isn't holding you back then you
can deliver quicker anyway or used to
have the option to okay hopefully that's
can be a little bit of food for thought
thank you very much for coming to this
session I hope you have an amazingly
good conference and i'll be at the
conference party tonight if you'd like
to come up and tell me how wrong I am or
how right I am I don't mind which but
thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
