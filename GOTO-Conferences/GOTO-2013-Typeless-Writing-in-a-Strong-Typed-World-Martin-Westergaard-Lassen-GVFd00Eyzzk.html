told me that I can't do live demos while
well coding while doing live demos so
I'm just showing my IDE my name is
Martin westergaard lesson I work as a
software pilot forum trifocal in London
have its rid of handled as well mmm
sorry my voice is a bit flaky I've been
a bit of a hit tool fanatic for quite
some years and a Java developer have a
boring background in the right in JAMA
with a heck of a boilerplate code so i
always try to look how i can get the
tools to write all the boring stuff from
my in my code and if you look at a
typical java application is you have a
model which feels have a few getters and
setters and well for a reasonable to do
application you need eight layers of
abstraction and then a front if front
end of some kind and oh yeah by the way
you need some testing as well and that's
the usually order the things are being
produced as far as I'm concerned and I
don't think that is TDD testerone
development that might be development
event driven tests and so I want to show
you a few tricks on how to do the right
thing write your tests first seven
layers of abstraction and then a model
might pop up in the end and so the first
thing we need is the abstraction layer
so that is a of course we need a class
that is a can you see this lovely um and
if I was able to spill sorry for that
well fortunately you can just rename it
like that I think most people know that
today and the first thing we need is the
test case so if you're unfortunate
enough to use maven there are some quite
distinct ways of naming conventions for
your test cases and and most ids
actually follow these naming conventions
so just create a new test case yep that
is a task manager test it's a JUnit for
you need a setup method and here we go
yes we want to put that inspiration
through and left what we want to test is
the task manager just called the menu
and initiate it I don't know if you know
this and you that's ID I IntelliJ talk
later on and but one of the best
shortcuts in this area is the qualified
sorry I don't know the name of it anyway
the qualified completion so right now
there's only one thing I can actually
right there and if i type ctrl shift
space it pops right in try to use it
always and the next thing we need is a
test case so doona for will so we'll
store task in Dale layer like that
hopefully I can scroll a little bit so
the management needs to store something
it's a new task and the task has a title
oops quite a lot of errors here and
so this is where the dynamic developer
will just be able to proceed all that is
that's just done for him more or less at
least it won't get compile errors but we
do we want to work anymore and yeah come
to another word of it but intuitive
otherwise well the first thing you need
to do is just create that task so it's a
quick fix for that import well we don't
have it yet so create the task and the
the model put it into the model packets
and yeah that's right doesn't matter
we'll just create it for us and of
course the constructor takes the title
and that's it quit it and I saw that he
can yes yesterday fortunately there are
some that's a bucking an idea that's why
you shouldn't do it live demos I I've
heard let me see if I can do something
about it fortunately can't and just to a
quick restart so I really think that
develop should always try to challenge
the re just like your childhood friend
we always try to find the personal
borders of your best friend and today we
have version control systems and there
will always help you to get back into a
state where you know you you knew you
were so there's not really no reason for
not trying to it's really try to push
your fortunately i'll have to write
that again I'll do that let's see what
happens and Matt it's really screw up
maybe it's the font size
font
down a little bit see if that changes
anything so the manager needs to store
something that was the new task which
had a title like that so the next thing
we need to do is create the myth it and
the ID knows where well obviously no fur
it is already what should place it so
just do that again and yeah it's avoid
takes a task and the name of the
parameter is a task quit them it the
class again and we're back the next
thing we need is something to expect and
so we will verify that a task sorry task
do has been called with a store and we
need that again and the task a lot of
right things again let's see what the
idea ide can do so the first thing you
want to resolve is it's the task tail so
we will create a feel for that in our
test case that is a task day o.o another
red one see what we can do we can
actually create an interface so we'll do
that there yep and verify and the ID
constantly scans the whole class path
from classes and method and you name it
fields of all kind of stuff so he'll act
had access to a founder qualified method
we can use for this one a static method
so we'll just import that and then this
realizes hey sha mate you don't have a
strong method on that class I'm sorry
interface again
just create it yeah it's boy takes a
task and that's it so and we need to
mark that task Dale equals its mark then
you go to class exactly again it has a
qualified import for that and for that
which might want to use that in the in
the constructor as well so imported
great construction and neat little trick
here is quick fix on that claw on that
parameter you can actually have it to
create a feel for you just like that so
created the field popped it right in and
yeah the idea always starts to code for
you so Leslie the thing is here there's
list for you to concern about you can
actually see where to start to implement
your things and you have the test case
running in the background go back to the
test here I can run it already yep there
we go I have a few mistakes already the
store method wasn't I haven't been
called so yeah go ahead and fix that as
far as I'm concerned that is actually
real TDD I've wrote my test before
actually started implementing my seven
layers of abstraction and here the end I
want to show you a little dirty trick we
all know that we are you're still
sitting in our test case and then we
need to act at a new method on our one
of our layers of abstraction and
unfortunately we have
three different day less that's one in
memory that's one for sequel and an
embedded in the database so the code
won't compile and we can't run our tests
we need to implement all these methods
in in our day or less so what I'll do is
from this one I will create a new I will
implement that interface and we call it
mmm oops and put in a min packets yeah
unfortunately it's too well for us to
implement that one so we won't do that
so if i run my test again i get a bunch
of errors but that's pretty far from our
where i was actually working right now I
was still win my test case trying to
write a the first layer of abstraction
and I'm bothered with this one and I
really don't need that so the dirty
trick here is look at the enemy and
switch to the clips compiler and in your
run configuration you sure it's true
instead of doing a complete make you're
doing the third one which is complete no
error check ouch sounds horrible but if
we run the tests again I can run it no
context twisting so I'm still working in
in that test case and the first layer of
abstraction that I was actually unit
testing and that's about it any
questions
not yeah thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
