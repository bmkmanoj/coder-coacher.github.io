I'm part of bachelor mere team we have
an office in London now in Shoreditch
and this operation is based on all of
our customer base in Europe in and
around Scandinavia and Africa and the
Middle East and working with them to
build solutions with react hello I'm
Matthew Ravel I also work out of photos
London office and I'm community manager
for europe middle east and africa so you
can expect to see me at more events like
this and also setting up react meetups
across Europe and well I'll talk a
little bit about that guy towards the
end ok ok now can I get a vote like a
raise of hands for how many people have
experimented with two or more no sequel
databases I just want to understand what
the group is like okay and so the rest
of you have how many of experimental was
one okay and there's a few it looks like
have an experiment with any ok so in
1998 carlos trasi actually mentioned a
relay object relational database that he
built that he didn't build in a
structured query language as a mechanism
to interface to that database ok and he
coined the term no sequel at that time
but note that that was still a
relational database engine it just
didn't have a structured query language
so what happened was the term has been
reappropriation spread in such a fashion
that any database engine that it doesn't
have a structured query language is
determined to be no sequel even though
that doesn't necessarily mean the
database engine isn't still relational
in nature so what we now call no sequel
really wish as he says we should be
calling no relation of rules of its own
slippery because it I think it more
accurately hear it more accurately
conveys where no sequel solutions have
their strengths
okay a growing list of categories and I
think recently as recent as three weeks
ago there was the re-release of rethink
DB so the that was a dead base engine
optimized for SSD hardware and it has
been redesigned over the last three
years and is coming back into the market
again so almost on a monthly basis there
are new no sequel solutions aimed at
specific hardware problems or at
specific use cases and niche areas
within that data storage landscape all
of them are optimized for record storage
I say this because structured query
language gives you quite an expressive
environment to query your data and you
typically have to sacrifice that to some
extent to get the performance that you
need in these kind of modern solutions
that are for lack of a better word web
scale okay arguably the largest
categories are graph databases key value
and document databases there are a
subset of that that's column family and
there are some more exotic ones like
couple stores but those are the three
major categories as I've seen in the
marketplace at the moment now as I said
just a brief overview of exactly how
these fit in in my opinion okay so graph
database data is represented using nodes
okay and more importantly edges okay i
say more importantly because when you're
when what when the semantic value in
your data is in the relations between
the data pieces your note that's when
you want to consider using a graph
database okay so in this case typically
the standard example is your social
networks because you want to understand
friends of friends of friends it's that
graph traversal that you can do in the
most optimal fashion using a graph
database okay that it's m1
natural process in that environment
doesn't mean you can't do it with other
database engines but that's the use case
that I think graph databases fit very
well document orientated databases okay
I like to think of documented databases
is a sweet spot between your relational
model and something which is
denormalized to the point where it
eventually becomes a key value store so
you want document orientated databases
when you want a ski Milus structure a
flexible structure and that's usually
I've seen it in industry most
appropriate when people are
transitioning from their relational
databases so from them i see cool
they're postgres storage solutions okay
so because they give you still give you
quite a lot of expressiveness with your
querying you typically will be querying
most often in something that isn't a
primary key okay if you're doing primary
key look up for nineteen ninety-five
percent of your reads then really you
don't need a document orientated
database okay so right so it's not key
it's some other record fields kV pairs
that are part of that document that you
really want to do your query in by that
leads me to key value stores now I'm of
the humble opinion that any problem can
be denormalized to the point where it
fits into a key value problem okay at
the same time that doesn't mean that
querying over that data problem is going
to necessarily be as efficient as a
solution it depends on your data problem
of course right so if most of your query
is a primary key so use a session data
that kind of problem then pure kV stores
are your sweet spot okay having said
that with all of these solutions and
these categories databases fit into
those categories but they usually offer
any of that all of them do offer a
variety of querying mechanisms that
really bring them
outside of that the purest kv model or
the purest document orientated and so on
and so forth okay so if that's what
you're doing then you should be looking
at a key value store now I'm going to
hand over to Matthew so that leads us
nicely on to react ap buddies what is it
it's really nice 1 plus extra so I guess
most of you or many of you will have
heard the Amazon down my paper in a
subset of my group will of bread dollars
and dynamo paper so react is an
implementation of the dynamo paper plus
a whole bunch of extras such as advanced
query features so where you get on the
top of dynamo is MapReduce text search
you get pre and post commit hooks
multiple storage engines so we might we
work with we have our own storage engine
bit cask and we also use Google's level
TV which you can you can choose between
them on a per bucket basis 22 according
to to your horse to show you use case
best um the main thing to know that
react is though that it that it it's all
about scaling linearly very easily and
about availability so with with react
you can go from what we would consider
its starting point let's say between
three and five nodes and this as your
needs grow you can very easily add on
another note another one another one at
a time and react without any downtime
will redistribute the data across your
notes allowing you to scale on quality
hardware out rather than up so that you
can so the so the react grows grows with
you and in terms of fault tolerance
react is is is is based on around the
idea of always being available it's over
your dates will always be available
and it's open source of the apache
license which witch is which is
something that we're very much quince to
its you know where an open source
company we're all from kind of free
software backgrounds but on top of that
we also have a couple of enterprise
versions where we work we bring in
support and extra features and I've
interested to the sum and and a
practical value in implementation it's
written in their line and clear of
intervals are plenty there and then it
will be written to disk asynchronously
but what you're saying is I want a
synchronous right until I can guarantee
that that data is durable on disk okay
what I would like to stress with tunable
consistency is before you to consider
tuning react and tuning against your
query model stay with the default values
okay there's a reason that we've chosen
those defaults okay they're there a nice
sweet spot for assuming you're able to
cope with eventual consistency which we
believe most systems are able of are
capable of coping with and I won't talk
too much to eat about eventual
consistency because i'm pretty sure that
Pablo will cover it in more detail in
the dynamo talk later but when you can
accept some level of eventual
consistency so you know that some
replicas of your data might be stale and
we're not talking about stale four
seconds we're talking about milliseconds
and under certain conditions depending
on network partitioning it may be longer
okay something I want to mention at this
point is some of the very recent work
that's going into the 1.3 release of
react okay is a feature called active
anti entropy okay now under certain
conditions up until now under certain
conditions what can happen is if if
you've written and you've got an N value
of 3 you've got three replicas of your
data now if it's some stage or another
you have data loss on nodes that are
handling the replicas of that data it's
possible that if that data has not been
read again for a long time read repair
hasn't occurred now reap repair is a
mechanism within react
to push consistency of your data to
ensure that all replicas converge on a
particular value at that point in time
okay now with active anti entropy that
problem becomes more of a background
problem to you because it's part of a
rolling process that will happen within
react and within the underlying Erlang
vm to actually periodically chain
through your V nodes your data
partitions on that particular react node
and then run read repair on them to push
consistency so think of it as a
background process now which we are
almost well it's code freeze at the
moment so you can think that sometime
I'd say beginning of next quarter so
maybe january that will become an
official announcement and then it
becomes less of a problem of you having
to run read repair sequences of your
your data set if you've had some sort of
disk failure because react will do that
in as a background task okay so it
becomes even less of a devil DevOps
consideration when you're training your
your team your database administrator to
look after a react instance or react
cluster okay and the last thing sell on
tunable consistency is that you can
finish those values on a cluster a
bucket or even per operation basis so
I'm gonna yeah okay see ya bye Mitch
okay um I spend most of my day doing
data modeling with prospective customers
to help them understand their query
patterns and understand whether react is
a good fit for them there are
environments where I've said to people
this is not a kv problem this is a graph
problem but in many cases with some
ability to denormalize and accept some
sort of a data redundancy in your in
your data model on on some level you can
optimize your solution for read and
write and accept a key value storage
model ok
within the context of react react takes
a different approach to other dynamo
based systems when handling conflict
resolution so conflict resolution occurs
when you've got concurrent actors who
are trying to modify the same kv pair at
the same time what can happen is because
they come from two causally distinct
operators two actors on that data then
they can cause divergence of that data
so what can happen is they both accessed
at the same time how do you resolve
you've suddenly got two values that are
being updated to that same kV pair and
in it in a purely distributed system
with a almost a peer-to-peer network
style operation master master no no
master slave environment no way of
coordinating that you end up having two
copies now some systems give you the
basically do the I guess do almost a
naive approach of last right wins so
they look at some time stamp value and
determined that ok this value was
written milliseconds later micro seconds
later than than the previous right and
therefore that's more up to date now
when you're in a distributed system and
you've got things like hardware clocks
with a kind of clock drift coming into
play then suddenly those microseconds
that determine which one of those
concurrent rights is actually the one
you want to keep isn't so simple and you
can actually end up with stale data or
incorrect data being the data that's
replaced into that kV pair the way of
that we provide a solution to solving
that problem is through something called
vector clocks is it can I get a raise of
hands on anyone who heard about vector
clocks before and understands a bit
about vector clocks awesome okay right
so I like to think of vector clocks is
almost like commit hash git commit
hashes ok and what happens is when
you're trying to do when you have two
people working on the same code branch
ok and they're both working from the
same commit in time but doing different
work different code changes at some
point in time when you want to merge the
changes possibly into the main line
branch or wherever else then you'll have
to do some sort of conflict resolutions
okay you have to do merge resolution
someone has to sit down in front of the
code and actually determine which pieces
of the code you want to merge together
to to bring that state back into
synchronicity okay that's very much how
vector clocks work in react so what
happens is let's say you've got
concurrent writers are both acting their
separate actors acting on the same kv
pair that have a certain vector clock
they then diverge you have to separate
vector clocks way of identifying those
two sibling values so possible
resolutions to your next update okay so
what we then do is we actually well we
offer to mex isms to handle this first
is last right wins this is the approach
that some of the other dynamo systems
use again like I said it's a naive
approach but works in some data problems
based on whether your data is immutable
and in some situations it can be a
simple mechanism to resolve that so we
still offer that as a solution to
resolving that conflict so we'll look at
the time stamps that we maintained
within react for those bits of data and
pick the one with the latest time stamp
okay the other approach is like I said
back the clock so when we do get
divergence of dead and we get concurrent
actors we actually keep those copies of
that data okay and they become sibling
records thats it against that kick key
that kv pair ok those sibling records
are then the responsibility of the
application layer so the application
developer to on the next read operation
actually decide how do I want to merge
this data now I do a lot of data
modeling with customers and that is a
problem that seems to scare a lot of
people okay but I like to think of it
this way you are the person who is
developing your solution on react you're
the person who knows exactly what data
your story in to react so who is better
at determining how to resolve that data
and find synchronicity and handle that
is sibling merging of those sibling
records than the person who knows about
the date of their story
okay so there is depending on certain
environment like this particular
environment okay what we said what I've
actually seen these are some examples of
what I've seen people use in production
with react okay so you got your load
balancer and it's distributing to get
across your VMs and your VMs are sitting
on some big like HP blade server of some
kind so they're all it close enough to
each other that you can clock
synchronize using some sort of demon
process of some kind okay so they
actually store as part of the value in
their kv pair a timestamp what we like
to call application layer timestamps and
then because it's all within an
environment where you can control and be
aware of clock drift with in that entire
subsystem then it's more than possible
that you can just simply resolve using
your application layer time stance so
use siblings when you get siblings you
do your next read request for that data
you'll get yourself a conflict resolve
or object which in Java is some sort of
implementation of an interface and it's
similar in a variety of other languages
and then that has one method merge or I
think it's resolving Java and then you
get a list of of those data objects and
you can merge in yourself by looking
with the one with the latest application
layer timestamp ok that's a simple
mechanism that's what i've seen some
people use in production and it works ok
the other alternative ok and so in the
previous example and get back to it ok
in the previous example it this worked
because like I said you don't really
have to worry about a clock drift
because they're all under some the
similar subsystem that is all aware of
that clock drift ok so suddenly you
don't have the possibility of
inconsistency with your time stamps so
that's fine but if you think about it
this is on some level a single point of
failure in your architecture and react
is designed as a distributed
peer-to-peer system of dead accordin a
shin and data storage that is designed
such that you don't have a single point
of failure so what you kind of day
saying is I want to accept that single
point of failure somewhere else in my
architecture it's a reasonable solution
to the problem especially if your
application layer is handling through
some to the load balancer across a
series of fullback devices that you can
spin up in case of some sort of a
hardware problem whereas this approach
wait let me show you it here's a
actually in this case it might not
necessarily be on the same service of
running your react nodes but it's it
might be on a separate cluster
environment but you actually want to
maybe round-robin against your
application layer and those servers are
again going to be in a such a
distributed fashion that you will have
clock drift that is going to give you
the possibility of not being able to
resolve with timestamps at in that case
that's when conflict resolution becomes
a real business logic solution okay so
this leads me to the next point which is
a particular customer of ours which is a
company called SEO mods one of our
customers in the US for array properties
if you know you're only going to ever
add to that array then why not simply
merge those two arrays okay merge those
sets its asset Union operation on that
data that's a very simple mechanism in
business logic level to do conflict
resolution okay you can we've seen
people try and pick siblings at random
within the conflict resolution
mechanisms to try and sidestepped this
problem I prefer you use application
their time stamps okay it's a simple
mechanism if if at that point you don't
know how to resolve your data it's
really a concern that you need to
rethink about how you're structuring
your data it's certainly not the best
solution to pick at random okay so it
may not necessarily be an array
structure of some kind it may be some
sort of first name last name values and
in that case you could store a time step
against those fields and actually say
well this one I know is more up to date
because that one hasn't been
modify that subsection of that value
object hasn't been modified in in ages
so I'm just going to take the one that's
newest that has been modified of that
piece okay so there are there are ways
within your business logic and if if you
have a particular use case that you'd
like to discuss with me at the end I'd
be more than welcome to talk about it
I've seen a variety of different
environments at this point it is
possible to do conflict resolution in a
I'd say straightforward manner within
your business logic and yeah so that's
an engineer that we worked with to build
this so I'm going to pass it over back
to Matthew ok so just quick word on on
how you can use use react so the lowest
level we provide a rest in space and
also a priori bindings for laundry in
space to to to react which you know
basically you can you can choose them
according to what works best view but an
hour restaurant space you would probably
use if you perhaps want to put it behind
something like squid for a very high
number of reads or you can use the the
bar in space would be our recommended
option for foremost promote use cases
particularly where your not exposing a
service to the internet already steep
the reactor closer to that the internet
because it gives you much much quicker
of operations but most people tend to
use one of our or one of the communities
client libraries so we currently support
a Python Erlang java and Ruby clients
which will give you full access to to do
everything the react can do straight
from from your favorite language and
then because there's actually quite an
active community around react in the
open source world there are also
community supported libraries the
c-sharp load library for example
corrugate
is one of the best on titanium and
really quite well used and then we have
others for our whole range of languages
we've recently a community group of sets
up and taken over the PHP library for
example so you know whatever you pretty
much whatever language you're you're
you're writing an application in you can
find a library to access to access
reacting work with it and if of course
your favorite language there isn't yet a
react client for it then speak to me and
we can talk about riding one I'm writing
one for the D programming language at
the moment which is just a little bit
fun a side project so if you ever write
with B then you'll soon enough have
access to your react cluster with it
okay so react use cases this is probably
the real meat of what I want to talk
about today i want to show you that
there are people using conflict
resolution there are people using vector
clocks and there are people using a
distributed system to give them that
business edge okay so environments where
react fits well okay session data so as
well as in talks with a bunch of
prospects who I probably cannot mention
to you right now but we have a bunch of
customers I know that AT&amp;amp;T use react for
storing session data so for instance
you've got some sort of logging
mechanism into your web app of some kind
and that's going to give you your key
it's naturally going to be a
user-provided key it's going to be their
username and that gives you access to
the value object and then subsequent
requests to whatever other records have
become part of that response that you
want to use to render the data on the
page okay why don't you work your way
through the rest of these here sure
site shows another from the person we
have in California is a very serve huge
amounts of advertising both to the web
and mobile well the generic web clients
and also to mobile devices and they have
a huge number of read operations per
second and they use react to basically
serve out all sorts of advertising but
later so whether that's text dual or
binary blobs then in the form of
graphics bet they'd run out with that
log in sensor data now we have this
company in Ireland ulta Metro who are a
a water metering company and they use
react to they go around the country
round Island reading water meters and
they store all the reading the meter
readings in in react and we also have
company to do similar things with with
with so you know kind of time series
data from from sensors or or logging as
well yeah so boundary I don't know if
you've ever heard of boundary there a
company that produces kind of a network
demon that sits in your on your servers
and and you put eat one on each of your
service within your infrastructure and
it will stream information about network
topology and kind of limitations with
your network throughput and give you
graphs and statistics so it's for
network monitoring basically within your
distributed system and they stole all of
their logging data all of that network
topology information directly into a
react cluster and then do some form of
background analytics offline analytics
roll ups 2 then present that information
in a in a cache fashion to the next read
request earlier I mentioned we had a
couple of commercial products a week
bill total react one of those is react
CS which is an s3 compatible object
store based on on on react and so we
have a customer that we're working at
the moment who are who are building a
basically a Dropbox a Dropbox clone
on top of reacts es so we you know we
caught content addressing storage and
they can then run a redundant yes I work
directly with these guys to build this
solution and what they're doing is
they're taking advantage react CES is a
thick proxy that sits on top of your
react cluster okay and eat that thick
proxy lives on each of your react nodes
in the exactly the same distributed
fashion as as react okay and they're
taking advantage of both the underlying
react cluster to store like file
metadata and user account information as
well as take advantage of that s3 API to
actually do file retrieval and they have
I think it's written in java at the
moment and it's a little demon process
much of the same way as a Dropbox do
with their Python client that monitors a
folder on a customer's machine and then
allows them to asynchronously sink this
folder of data across into a react
cluster and they have somewhere in the
region of a typical user account has
summer in the region of 300,000 files at
the moment I think that's probably about
as much I can tell you about them so at
the moment anyway I'm very similarly
building of a private cloud datastore
yeah react CSS is is what we then
interested interestingly enough with
react CS and private tab because of that
s3 compatible API which at this point is
almost feature parity with what we know
amazon provide with their s3 client its
we cannot guarantee absolute
synchronicity of features because there
is no actual RFC there's no
specification for warden what the f 3
api is it's a effectively engineered on
whatever feature amazon are adding to
that that s 3 client and because of that
the protocol is is we're as close as we
can be every feature that you could use
at the moment we already have in the
client and people are using it in simple
cases even to run their own private
cloud to store files that they then
retrieved through sales for
right they have a massive sales team and
Salesforce allows you to hook in to ns3
API and store those files and and that's
exactly what they do they want to keep
those files under their own private
environment their own private cloud but
still expose them for access through
some sort of secondary system that did
relies on s3 protocol and ultimately
going back to the Amazon dynamo paper
one of the things that they make very
clear in that paper was that latency
costs money if you and this is this is
latency up to infinite latency when
things go very wrong but basically if
the longer it takes for data to say
shopping cart data to be available to a
customer the more money you lose so we
say the react is is suitable wherever
low latency increases your revenue so
where you need to be very very fast and
you need to be high placing very
available and we are playing a torrent
and react is more likely a good thing so
joy good some custom yes yeah okay so
these are three a mere customers
actually know Yammer is going to be a
u.s. customer but rovio and Amir
customer of ours we've been working with
them quite closely there everyone's
played Angry Birds I'm sure their next
generation of their gaming platform is
built on top of react and they still
gain session data so for every user
there in the purpose of allowing you to
log in and create user accounts and then
whether you're playing on through their
web front end which runs through the
chrome store or you're playing on your
mobile device you're able to synchronize
your game state and pick up the game
wherever you left off and they're
expanding to a variety of different
games all of that information is being
stored in to react so they synchronize
it across gaming devices and it's a very
straightforward key value problem
they've got an account a user account
key by user ID and the rest is your
value object
which is a combination of binary game
data objects and kind of Jason records
which store additional meta information
about about that user their game their
high schools and all of the rest of that
okay Yammer there a u.s. customer of
ours they are the enterprise social
network they were just recently bought
by microsoft and they use react for
storing notifications they have a nice
architecture service orientated
architecture similar to what you read
Twitter doing with all of their
infrastructure separate separating out
certain data problems to an RPC based
service orientated architecture where
they can pick the right database for the
right data problem and so for
notifications they store things like the
cursor so where you are in the read list
of a particular stream of updates so
think about Facebook and think about a
message thread you're going to know what
you've read up to at that point they use
a cursor item list and then the
collection of items themselves and
that's just a small example of there
there Jason records are just trimmed it
because it's extremely long actually a
lot of information and what you'll
notice in this case is the cursor itself
is keyed by user ID and cursor name so
remember when you're storing in a kv
data storage system your key becomes
extremely important it's not your fault
do it on incrementing IDs like I did in
my relational database your key is the
fastest way you can get your data if you
can put together a series of semantic
pieces of information that can combine
into a key that you can then do an 01
look up into a distributed system like
react it's going to be as fast as you
can make it and their particular service
oriented architecture component that
stores notifications is called streamy
you can read about it online if if you'd
like to know more mentioned SEO was
before they basically do web web ranking
of documents and
roll ups of statistical information and
ranking information that they can then
present the customers to give them an
edge in search engine optimization
within the well web crawlers like Google
and Bing and all of the other search
engines so ranking of web documents
their data types consisted things like
subscriptions ranking list ranking
history recent ranking reports which are
cached roll-ups of that data and look
look at the ranking list ok its engine
locale keyword URL fragment it tho tho
that combination of information is what
generates a key for that particular
ranking list ok so if you can make your
key if you can allow external systems to
provide you that key whether it be a
user whether it be through some other
part of your system and build that key
in such a fashion that you can d
normalize your data and pull everything
out in one request it's going to be as
fast as you can make it other users that
were there are prospects at the moment
or open source uses high availability
environments we're in the middle of
working with the NHS at the moment to
build a solution they're not storing
patient information but they're storing
geo location meta information about
people in specific counties to allow
them to efficiently look up their NHS
patient number when they're trying to
treat that patient and look up their
patient records so if they're
incapacitated in some way and they have
no way of knowing what their NHS ID is
they use react to I guess search through
their patient topology information to
access that data and I'm pretty sure the
creston we'll talk later on about the
Danish Health Authority which try folk
I've been working with another of a
environment where high availability is
extremely important we i mentioned
content addressable storage before we've
got some people who are using it to try
and build a competitor to what is it
we've got is it sparkle which is another
one of these there's an open source and
kind of castile dropbox sparkle share or
something like that and there's a bunch
of others
this environment where you can mix
access to your underlying react cluster
and the thick proxy that lives on top of
each node that acts as your cloud
storage layer becomes a really nice
sweet spot to building cast solutions a
bunch of other environments where I'm
all in the middle of discussing with
with a prospective customers and open
source users and how to model their data
now with any no sequel solution this
this steps outside of react consider
three things query patterns how
interconnected your data is and whether
you can build a polygon solution
remember not every bit of your data
problem is going to fit a kv solution or
a graph solution or a document
orientated solution service orientated
architecture is that sweet spot between
right tool for the right job and it's
something that if you've seen Yammer are
using it that kind of style of
distributing there a kind of
architecture across a bunch of different
databases to give them whatever edge
they need to retrieve the information
they need it as fast as they can and you
see Twitter doing it all the time with
the way they r ER katek their their
system ultimately understand your data
access patterns if you can do that
you'll naturally be able to know which
database engine to choose fasho amia
we've opened as I mentioned before a
London office and Matthew our community
manager can tell you more yeah so we
open the lot about this in May of this
year and what we're all about really is
is providing an environment in which
it's easy to make use of react within
within Europe so we want to we want to
be there for people are using it both
open source and commercially so as Chris
was saying through data modeling through
helping identify with the react is
correct for you and implement
other implementation issues that you
might have so you can find us by well
I'll show you in a minute but I'm you
can find us at various different events
around around Europe right now will be
basically all the tribal code events
that are happening around Europe will be
anything we're with you talking about
kind of web scale development and also
we're doing various community meet up so
we'll be in like last night we have a
community meet up a bit i'll break here
in city where it's well we know we have
a talk and then some pizza repairs it's
about kind of getting together and just
chatting about both what what people are
doing with react but perhaps more
interestingly because skip on to next
slide the next one this one we will come
to you wherever you happen to be if your
organization or your your your local
open source group or or whatever we'd
like to know more about react and
whether it's something that's useful to
you will come to your location and give
a tech talk so something that we often
do is we'll go and we'll do a lunch and
learn where we're a group of people from
an office we'll get together at lunch
and we'll get a talk but we're also
going to exert the source groups and so
on and giving the top bar area and then
we've get into some of the detail about
whether react is right your use case and
how to model mobile data with with react
so you go to bit ly / reactor tech talk
you can sign up there and we'll get in
touch and organize something with you
there'll be no cost to you will just
come out and give a talk and see it
reacts with you ok and of course any
questions
and ask about public relations yeah sure
to NASA's atomic move yes banner yeah we
because no some inside very boyish about
this why they are doing it and
especially apology it's about it worked
in the past with all those atomic clocks
and now there's been a fight well it's
very hard for me to comment on that
because I don't know their hardware
environments with enough detail remember
this is google so this isn't your
typical tech company they're far from it
so they can afford to spend money on GPS
units and atomic clocks in every data
center to synchronize their hardware so
they have no clock drift happening
within their servers and therefore as
you say conflict resolution is a last
right wins process but most companies I
mean react was built to scale on
commodity hardware we're not talking
about I mean I had a conversation at one
prospect at one stage where i find the
term commodity hardware is a difficult
one to use in practice because there we
spoke up they asked me for throughput
numbers on commodity hardware and i said
well what exactly what kind of hardware
are you using and they said let's just
assume commodity harder and they were
running at the moment they're running
MongoDB for their solution and so we
were having a talk and I said well we're
going to get you're going to get XYZ
throughput numbers and they said that's
extremely low we really expected a lot
more from react and then I not good like
I probed them for details I said well
exactly what is your hardware they said
192 gig of ram and I think was 64 cause
I don't call that commodity hardware it
really depends on the environment that
you're in what commodity hardware is to
you if that's what your typical DBA is
allowed to buy then i'd love to have a
chat basically but so whenever we talk
with prospects I typically like to
suggest that we talked about doing a
benchmark benchmark react on your
hardware it's the best way for you to
know real world numbers don't accept
other people's word for what throughput
numbers are like okay don't accept our
word go
we use a benchmarking tool and saturate
your network saturate your disk i/o
throughput and you'll see what your
cluster is capable of with react sorry
that didn't quite answer your question I
don't know enough about their their net
network infrastructure their hardware to
be able to comment on I just know that
Google the ones who can afford to buy
atomic clocks and and a GPS units in in
every data center most tech companies
can't</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
