any work on like a surrealist paradigm
using AWS lambda or other function as a
service right on and who here has done
any work in blockchain or distributed
ledger right on okay well so I'm gonna
bring both those topics together
something to know about distributed
ledger is on the Gartner hype cycle it's
at the peak right now but it's it's
buddy blockchain is in the middle of the
trough of disillusionment so we're gonna
kick it while it's down and talk about
just doing distributed ledger without
the blockchain server list is also in a
pretty good position on the hype cycle
so this might be the most buzzword e of
all the talks today my name is Chris
Anderson I'm the director of product at
fauna and whew my background is as a
co-founder of Couchbase and a technical
contributor to patchy couchdb so the
common thread through all that is
building technologies that are you know
super compelling easy and fun for
developers to be more productive with
I'm Jake Reyes on Twitter and you can
reach out to me there or email me at
chris at fauna comm whoo so my screen is
not twitching so the blockchain it's a
data structure it's essentially a linked
list where every item in the list has a
pointer to the previous item and it's
not just any pointer it's a pointer with
a cryptographic signature so what that
means is that for any given head of that
chain you can validate that the history
all aligned
and works together so it's not
particularly useful in and of itself
except for to validate you know the
history of data set now blockchain has
been combined with some other stuff
proof of work specifically to make
fighting over who gets to decide on that
next head of the chain into the sort of
process that means that that the whole
data structure becomes immutable because
once you've added a few links to the
front any deep link the chances of it
changing is very slim so the blockchain
doesn't really you know get us much
except for some guarantees about
immutability if if you wanted to build a
distributed ledger you know you might be
able to you know do it just fine without
the blockchain and so hopefully I don't
know about you but myself I think also
that the the Bitcoin and blockchain
world could be more imaginative is these
things just look like the money that
we're used to so but that's that's on a
side either way let's see what we can
get done without the blockchain and the
hashtag for today's talk is no
blockchain so if you want to if you want
to tweet about that then we can all we
can all join the hype cycle together so
a ledger alleges a very simple
accounting concept it's just the idea of
a table of transactions you know from an
account to another account and bankers
can look over the ledger to see who has
how much money so ledger is an old
technology it's kind of one of the
reasons that humans invented writing so
it's it shouldn't be too surprising but
the question is sort of you know how can
we get from there to a distributed
ledger
without a blockchain so what do we need
is we need a consensus we need all the
replication sites of the ledger to agree
on the same data and if we have that
then we've got a distributed ledger
there's nothing in the definition of a
distributed ledger that says it has to
be immutable there's nothing that says
it has to use a blockchain it just needs
to be the same account balances at all
the replication sites so with Bitcoin
everyone who has a copy of you know the
full Bitcoin database has has the ledger
in the architecture that I'll be talking
about anyone who's running a database
cluster has the ledger so a distributed
ledger I think that the it doesn't like
photographs it's just too much data but
a distributed ledger again will be where
we can all agree on the same column of
numbers no matter you know which site
we're at so if we're gonna add a
transaction in one place we need to know
for sure that it's gonna appear in all
the other places at the same time so
I'll talk about how to build this
distributed ledger outside of the
blockchain world and the idea that it
gives me that you know it might be kind
of obvious at this point because you've
talked to me at the booth but this
ledger that we looked at just the plain
simple ledger it looks like a regular
database application it just looks like
a database table and it turns out that
when you go look at how people
implemented Ledger's you know for the
history of computers until now they use
the database it's the right tool for the
job so my idea is like well if you have
a distributed database maybe a
distributed ledger there's just a
database application maybe the ledger
itself doesn't need to be concerned with
the distribution mechanism so we'll talk
about
how we can achieve that and specifically
in the context of fauna DB so our logo
is a hummingbird but I like to look at
real hummingbirds so this is a you know
just a chance for us all to be happy
about the glory of nature and relax and
look at hummingbird now how are we going
to build this distributed ledger on top
of a distributed database well kind of
before we go actually before we get into
that so what I did is I thought hey this
is a super easy idea like it's just a
database application using you know
queries to maintain account balances
I'll make a demo and so I made a pet
store application because you know if
you're gonna do transactions we all
start with a pet store and this this
should be a video of the demo but what
and what you would see if the video is
playing is essentially there's multiple
players and they all have account
balances and you can put an item for
sale and you could buy an item and you
know when you buy an item the money goes
from that player from the buyers account
to the sellers account and when you you
know try to buy an item and you don't
have enough money in your account then
you get an insufficient funds error so
it's very simple basic stuff just kind
of an e-commerce or banking application
and the the underlying table that
supports it or the underlying you know
database looks like this it's a you know
here's the the prices of the purchases
and the buyer and the seller we're
listed in the table so you can look at
this distributed ledger and browse it
like you know like any other data so
this demo is kind of a toy I mean I
built it in a weekend it wasn't designed
to actually be a fully distributed
ledger application it is distributed but
some of the security concerns are not
completely implemented
what we'll do in this talk is go look
about how you would take that demo and
make it serious
so the first thing that we want to do is
take a look and understand how fana DB
implements global consensus and what
this means for a distributed ledger
application then we're going to look at
the actual transaction query and the
code that implements checking account
balances and moving credits from one
account to another and changing the
ownership of an item and so that's all
run in a single transaction that gets
submitted to the fana DB cluster and
runs and returns a result and we'll take
a look at that code and then sort of
once you've understood the global
consistency and the way that we've
implemented the transaction then you'll
probably have some security questions
because if you're dealing with real
money there's going to be people who are
motivated to make your application do
things other than what you hoped it
would so I'll talk about the security
model like application and object level
security model there's plenty of
concerns about encryption at rest or on
the wire maybe I can answer questions
later on but this section of the talk
will be about the security model as it's
implemented at the the database object
level so back to this picture of global
consensus if what we're trying to do is
keep these Ledger's in sync
then the architecture that I'm
suggesting is we implement each Ledger
as a fana DB cluster so this can be the
database in our in our diagram language
for today and what what this will look
like in practice is that so you've got a
a group of members of the ledger and you
know maybe this is a good time I was a
little distracted earlier what I wanted
to say is that if you don't trust the
people that you're trying to run a
distributed ledger with
don't do it this way this is for when
you know who your counterparties are so
like if you had a group of banks that
we're all working together to maintain a
transaction Clearing House or if you had
you know kind of like essentially any
group of actors where you could you know
identify them and address them via the
legal system instead of some kind of you
know a blockchain stuff so the members
of this consortium of you know members
of the market each one runs a high
availability fauna DB cluster so that
cluster can be multiple machines and it
could even be in multiple physical sites
itself but from a logical standpoint
what we're talking about is each member
of the ledger has a copy of the ledger
running in a database and they can
interact with it using database queries
now within each one of those clusters
which contains the full copy of the data
set there's probably more than one
machine so that you can have high
availability Fano DB will handle
partitioning the data across all the
available machines and adding and
removing machines replicating between
machines and keeping this whole cluster
in sync with the other clusters so if
your operations DevOps person you might
wonder like what do I have to do to in
stand one of these clusters up it's a
very simple operationally you have
database that gets delivered as a jar
and you launch it in the right packaging
for your environment whether that is
containers or Deb or rpm files so that's
kind of the physical architecture of the
cluster that will support our
distributed ledger now how do we do
consistency across that physical
architecture there's a protocol called
Calvin which came out of research at
Yale
and what it does it provides acid
transactions by creating a distributed
log so in the same way that like the
blockchain is a distributed log rather
than enforcing you know those semantics
via via that kind of technology we use
the calven protocol which uses ours
anyone familiar with raft or Paxos so
these are distributed consensus
protocols that allow a group of machines
to agree about something with the
minimum number of round trips so we use
raft to decide what the next log segment
is there's some some secret sauce about
you know making sure that the
transactions are ordered within the log
in a way that you know makes sense
according to the transactional
requirements so if two people submit
transactions to touch the same key at
the same time then the system will order
them in one way or the other but once
it's ordered then it'll be stable and
serializable this is the same sort of
thing that happens inside of your
relational databases that you're
familiar with
so this Kalvin log which has the
transactions in it is where the commit
actually occurs so just like when you
commit to Postgres it's an entry written
in the right ahead log and if there was
a server crash it could recover from the
right ahead log in the same way the
calven log you know runs ahead of the
physical storage index storage etc and
everything that happens to the database
layer is deterministic based on the
transactions that got accepted into the
log so that makes consensus relatively
cheap and focused on throughput there's
an alternate model in the marketplace
for distributed consensus if you've
heard of Google spanner they use a
different protocol which is based on
time windows and looking at the right
effects of the transaction after it
plays out and retrying things when they
conflict so
and practice what that means is that
under contention Google spanner style
system will slow down on reads whereas
for fauna DB the reads can typically be
done from snapshots in the uncoordinated
way but under contention it would slow
down under writes so it's a different
trade-off I think that the fauna DB
trade-off is better suited for
interactive applications since most
applications are mostly read so if
you're interested in learning more about
the Calvin protocol there's this blog
post on our website that compares
spanner versus Calvin and goes through a
lot of the trade-offs and you know kind
of finds there's the scenarios at the
limit where one of them would be better
than the other in a clearer way and then
how those trade-offs apply at run time
so so that's we sort of maybe understand
a little bit how we offer this global
consistency now that we understand that
you can have acid transactions at global
scale well what are we going to run in
order to get the job done so this is the
actual transaction code it's meant to
look complicated I hope your eyes glazed
over a little bit we'll go in and look
at it one line at a time where you can
actually see what the query language
looks like the story that I'm telling
here with this is just so that you
understand that the complex logic of
like an actual rich transaction can be
written as a single query and submitted
as a final cluster where it'll commit
atomically so I'll go through first of
all bold the lines that matter as far as
telling the story of what's going on and
then I'll go through and show you what
they do so this first one is just making
sure that the item is for sale we can't
try to buy something that's not on the
for sale list right here we just don't
want you to sell it to yourself instead
of selling an item to yourself
in this
we just remove it from sale so those are
just a couple of preconditions to be met
here's where we actually removed from
sale you don't need to worry too much
about this except for to see that we're
just setting an application flag here
this this last bit is the last
precondition check we're just making
sure that the buyer has enough money in
there enough credits and their account
to purchase the item if they don't then
they'll get an insufficient funds error
so the second half of the query is where
the transaction is actually written to
the objects here we're creating a
purchase record it's just essentially
you know the receipt of that particular
transaction with the buyer or the seller
the price and the item so you can look
at the history of all the purchases
through your system in that same block
then we're also updating the buyer by
subtracting the item price from their
balance and updating the seller by
adding the item price to their balance
and finally we're marking the item with
a new owner
so to summarize all that we're ensuring
that the item is for sale we're making
sure the buyer is not the seller and
we're making sure the buyer has enough
money then we're writing out a purchase
record and we're deducting from the
buyers balance adding to the seller's
balance and updating the item owner and
all that commits atomically so if if you
had a very busy buyer and they submitted
you know multiple purchase orders and
you know simultaneously some of those
would succeed but only up until the
account balance would be you know
deducted below zero by the next one so
there's never an ability to spend the
money before the system has noticed that
you've spent it it's always consistent
they're there if you go follow the link
to github you can
the rest of the application there's the
transaction or rather the query that
lists all the items that are for sale
there's the query that you know lists
for each player what items do they have
and how much money is in their balance
so it's all very standard database
interactions you query the database and
paint stuff to the UI so here it will
look at an example of how the query
language actually looks up close so
what's going on here is it's actually a
query builder this text does not ship to
the server this happens at runtime and
it creates an abstract syntax tree and
the abstract syntax tree they shipped to
the server so what that means is that in
this particular case the native language
is JavaScript but you can write the same
query in Ruby and it'll have the same
abstract syntax tree and give you the
same results so we've got clients
available in Java JavaScript Scala which
is what the database server is
implemented in Ruby c-sharp Python go
and Swift and if you need to query the
database from a language that we don't
support the wire interface is JSON and
HTTP so you should be able to submit
queries that way as well so to summarize
this section about acid transactions I
think it's important to note that I've
been talking a lot about financial
services and the reason I've been
talking about it is because that
industry was left out of the no sequel
revolution all these scalable databases
came out but they didn't have
transaction support and so financial
services was stuck you know running on
their Oracle's and their Postgres but
now that we have acid transactions at
global scale the financial services
firms that wanted to explore these new
large-scale databases but found that
they did not have the features to meet
the requirements all of a sudden have
this option
so from my perspective in the
marketplace having you know worked
through the first wave of no sequel and
then seeing what different customers and
users are doing now companies are a lot
more ready they they understand how to
evaluate database technology how to you
know try out two or three alternatives
and figure out which one is the best fit
and they're using that understanding
essentially to evaluate fana DB versus
you know there's not much else versus
Postgres or Oracle or Google spanner
which you know then you are stuck
running inside the Google cloud but so
let's set aside financial services for
now because I also find that writing
database applications using eventually
consistent databases can be a headache
you you might write something in the
database and then go back to read it and
it's not there yet and so that means in
practice all your code that ever touches
an eventually consistent database like
dynamo DB or cassandra has to be ready
for that worst case scenario and you get
a ton of code complexity and repair work
and your developers are kind of more
trying to second-guess the database than
they are actually writing the
application so if you use a consistent
database you know like a Postgres or a
font ODB those problems go away and you
don't have to guess what's in the
database you're just able to write
queries and get the expected responses
now it is you know it's just the laws of
physics that in order for us to commit a
Kalvin transaction across multiple data
centers the speed of light between those
data centers starts to matter and so
sure like it is possible to have lower
right Layton sees with an eventually
consistent database but I'm not sure
that actually makes your applications
faster because you know you're writing
but there's this cloud of uncertainty
and then you've always got to check up
that uncertainty when you're doing your
reads and so it may balance out that
that even by pay in a small round-trip
time cost on writes all the
simplification of the reads and a
simplification of developing against it
could mean you know simpler application
and potentially better user experience
so we have this idea excuse me of how to
build a distributed ledger using the
database queries and global consensus
and asset transactions but I haven't
addressed the security model at all so
this is a you know just kind of to give
the sense that there's you know the
approach to how you would avoid
privilege escalation and get some of the
semantics that people appreciate from
the blockchain without having you know
some of the downsides so you know we
like that the blockchain is immutable
except for when we don't and in the same
way you want to know what you're you
want to know that your transaction code
can only you know write new transactions
and won't be changing the history but
you might have admin code that needs to
change the history so we take a layered
approach where we essentially have you
know user code in the browser
application code running in lambda but
the application code has the minimum
privileges to talk to the database which
has its own you know user-defined
functions which have the minimum
privileges again to talk to the actual
storage parts of the database so it's
very you there's no path there for a
privilege escalation that would allow an
untrusted user to run transactions that
they're not supposed to so I'll talk
about those in turn and how you know how
the layers work together so lambda is a
function as a service provider there's
lots of them for purposes of this talk
there
interchangeable essentially it's just a
JavaScript function or in another
language that runs in response to user
events so this could be you know
authenticating users on an HTTP request
and running a function that kicks off
transaction but it's also how at least
in practice when I talk to people who do
a lot of stuff with AWS lambda they're
kind of using it for lightweight
MapReduce
so maybe processing files every time
they're uploaded s3 it kind of straddles
both those worlds in our case we're
using it for interactive code to trigger
the transactions in the database so what
we'll have is a JavaScript function that
uses the fana DB client to submit a
query it looks very simple so that
complex query that we saw it was it was
the whole thing right it was all the
actual logic that's going to happen but
we don't want our lambdas to be able to
run that logic because like what if they
only ran part of it what have you had a
bad programmer and your organization and
they wrote a function that sold items to
players without deducting from their
balance right then all of a sudden you
might have to you know pay up yourself
that money or something so it could be
very expensive mistakes but instead of
having lambda call
that complex function we saw we have a
call a predefined function so this is
you know similar to relational database
API is where you can register a query
and have it called there's essentially
query fragments that you register with
the database and other queries can call
in to them and they can have different
privileges so the function that is
called can only it does what it does in
the divide at abase administrator knows
what it does and it's the only thing
that lambda can call the function itself
it's internals would look like that
complex transaction that we saw
so it's easy to call but it doesn't give
you right you only said it some
arguments and it does all the work so
like a trigger in a relational database
and again that function doesn't have
administrator access so someone
authoring that trigger wouldn't be able
to go and zero out everyone's account
balance they would just be able to you
know interact with the classes that
they're supposed to now the last kind of
important feature for replacing the
blockchain in this application is fana
DB's built in temporal data which can be
used here to ensure that we understand
what the history of objects are which it
can also be used in applications for
auditing or for those times when you
have to change the past so what an
architecture we're talking about for a
serverless distributed ledger
application the functions that are
touching the data and the tables will
run with privileges that can only talk
about the present they can't mess with
the past and they also can't change the
schema you don't want them to be able to
change the rules so these functions with
limited privileges but in real life
sometimes things happen like a user
might hit an extra zero and transfer you
know twenty thousand dollars instead of
two thousand and rolling that back on a
blockchain based application can be very
expensive because the history is
actually immutable and you've got to
come up with a compensating transaction
that would make up for the old one and
it's probably not just those eighteen
thousand dollars it's probably the tax
implications for the you know the ten
hours before the bug got caught or
whatever so it's better to have an
administrative client with additional
privileges that can go back in the
history and say I didn't really mean
20,000 I'm in two thousand and when you
change it there then of course all the
queries that are deriving you know
things like taxes etc from that are
going to run on this revised history
instead of on the you know instead of on
the erroneous data the the temporal data
support it ought by to follow doodle
store like 30 days of history you could
turn that up or you can turn it down but
it is not only supporting these kind of
audit queries but also supporting the
ability to read from snapshots so that
you can read from a consistent version
of the database without waiting for
in-flight writes to complete so that's
the architecture of this distributed
ledger application on a distributed
database and I'm happy to take questions
now sure so the question is about the
cap theorem and how if we prioritize
consistency over availability you know
what does what does that mean when
there's an availability problem so in
practice we have you know that it's rare
because we don't need 100% availability
of all the machines in the cluster we
just need to maintain a quorum so as
long as we maintain a quorum then the
transaction log can continue to be
processed and we have uptime but if we
go below the quorum then we can't
process transactions at all question so
yeah we get the consistency that you get
you know that people use two-phase
commits for we use the raft protocol for
that which is an optimization over like
a raw two-phase commit or a paxos style
consensus algorithm and there's a great
website i think if you google learn raft
it'll it's a state machine that lets you
see like exactly how the raft protocol
is executed on a log and we essentially
use that same protocol so it's like
two-phase commit but with some
optimizations to cut down
around trips and where it fits in our
architecture is how we decide the
ordering of that log the right ahead log
for Calvin once the logs order is stable
and frozen then everything that happens
on the database nodes is deterministic
so all we need to do is agree on the log
ordering and then we get serializable
consistency from there I've got a couple
of questions from me up why should I use
phone at that way what's the use case
for finally to be specific sure well
it's the consistency for the various
reasons I outlined some applications
some use cases require consistency in
for some use cases it just helps with
productivity but I think the real reason
to use I don't know a database at least
as a developer who evaluates new
technologies on a regular basis like we
like to think that we're rational and
that we're taking a measured approach
all the time but I think that probably
what's really happening is we have like
a high-stakes game of picking what is
the low friction path and so if
something gives you friction even for an
unrelated reason like you're probably
going to throw it out and try something
else because like oh the friction there
must be an indicator there's gonna be
friction in other places so with that
philosophy in mind we've tried very hard
at Fawna to make the on-ramps easy so
you should be able to go to Fano comm
and sign up and be using the api for
free within minutes if that stays easy
then you know there will be no friction
and you won't even need good reasons to
use it one question that's a little bit
next to that how does found out compared
to Cassandra sure so fauna and Cassandra
have similar scalability characteristics
the you know kind of rough size of
clusters that we expect people to run is
about the same the read latency is
similar
and it serves like the amount of
aggregate IO that a given node can do is
similar when you start to do comparative
benchmarks they're also pretty close in
some workloads we have a throughput
advantage because we're batching the
transactions together in a way that is
easier for the i/o systems to deal with
but in other workloads you're with fana
you'll be waiting on round-trip times
and consistent commits that you wouldn't
need to wait for with Cassandra
of course then with Cassandra on the
other end you'd have to go clean that
stuff up on read and have a bunch of
extra code to deal with their cases and
so Sona found that to be as consistent
and partition and casing bit more about
how availability is affected then about
the partitioning now found at the base
consistent and partitioned so can you
say a bit more about how availability is
affected them maybe the one elaborate
type this question yeah I mean I was
talking a little bit about the
partitioning so we actually allow you to
partition the calven log into more than
one log so that you know if the
throughput on the calven log is more
than a single machine can handle then
you can spread that out across machines
but typically you're gonna get best
performance with about three Kalvin
partitions it's through an open source
version no we're not open source
we're implemented in Scala all our
drivers are open source but the delivery
is a jar file and the query builder
seems do you consider simplifying the
API with a DSL that's compiles to an ast
so the question is about the query
builder and you know whether we've
considered simpler api's so we
considered it we seriously considered
like a rest style crowd API and it's in
there but it's uh it just turns out that
the sweet spot
for a database like this is to submit a
complex query so something like load
rose from an index out of a particular
range and then loop over those rows all
inside of the transaction and load
documents based on those rows from some
of those documents have conditional
logic that maybe loads other data and
then update some of them based on all
that and have that commit atomically so
just doing that over rest doesn't make
much sense it's more like you know you
want to write some of your application
logic up into the query language and
push it to the cluster one less question
block change our public lectures meaning
everyone can join a network notes those
final debate also allowed to build such
open systems sure so the question is
about could you use this kind of system
in place of the Bitcoin blockchain and
the answer is no that's not what it's
for if you need to run those kind of
applications among untrusted parties
then you do need you know some way of
you know proof of work or otherwise
making sure that people can't can't game
the system with what we're talking about
a trusted consortium of market
participants there are you know I didn't
go into that part of the architecture
but there are places in the system where
you could put monitors on the
transaction log and make sure that no
one's you know trying to fuzz the system
or something but you know typically if
somebody was you would know who was
doing that and you could talk to them so
that that's a it's a different use case
basically okay cool
any other questions from the room yes so
the question is about the the TTL the
time to live feature which it allows we
actually have two sets of TTL so I
talked about how we keep object history
around for 30 days by default and then
clean that up but we also have the
objects themselves can auto delete after
a certain amount of time so that's
really useful for use cases like GDP are
we
you know the right to erase' land
whatever so especially intermediate
processors may want to have a lot of
their data use TTLs
so that when they're done processing it
cleans itself up it's useful you know
not just for gdpr but also for you know
caching use cases or anything where you
want the database to you know not just
grow continuously over time sure so the
customer list at most of them I can't
talk about we only launched the cloud
product earlier this year and we'll be
launching the on-premise Enterprise
version in the springtime currently
NVIDIA is running a big social network
on top of fauna DB and they've had zero
downtime so we like that also Starbucks
is talking a lot at conferences mostly
on the west coast about using us for
payment card and loyalty program stuff
so essentially you know financial points
across all of their retail locations
aside from that there's you know lots of
the innovative American banks you know
have ongoing programs to evaluate new
technologies so we're in that space for
sure thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
