enterprise and enabling a culture of
innovation this is the lean track it's a
pleasure to be honest you've got some
other my favorite people actually under
planet here we're going to be under
stream so I'm having a little bit of
imposter syndrome up here at the moment
so that's the main thing and when the
things agent asked me to talk a little
bit about we started is what is actually
lean and and this is it lean does not
exist as a word in Japan if you go in
and tell them you are lean ninja jiu
jitsu something they will go what and
when Warmack and Jones went over to
study wash was happening in Japan when
they were fundamentally having radical
improvements compared to the United
States they observed the behaviors that
the teams are actually performing and
these are the kind of statements that
they took away the guides the principles
just specifies value for a specific
product from a customer's perspective
identify value streams for each product
and you're going to hear Karen talk a
little bit of that does later on make
flow without interruptions and we're
used to these things when we build
software like flow customers pull value
from the producer pull systems you have
something that people want so they come
to you for it and constantly pursue
perfection continuous improvement the
very heart of what makes us better about
going through learning loops to make us
better so this is lean so what's
enterprise so agian told me for to be an
enterprise you first have to integrate
with ldap that's his definition of what
an enterprise's I said that's pretty
good it is our interpretation of an
enterprise a complex adaptive system
where people are aligned by a common
purpose when you think about large
organizations they are large systems of
people of moving parts all interacting
together a communication network sensing
responding to each other's movements
and how well information moves around
that is so important and what drives the
alignment is purpose so there's your
definitions let's talk business
eighty-seven percent that's the amount
of companies the divider disappeared how
to merge are being acquired in the S&amp;amp;P
500 since the 1960s the lifecycle our
time of a company at the start of 1960s
was 67 years that's how long they
existed for today it's 15 and it's
falling falling now the netflix and the
googles and sit and the apples they've
only come under that list in the last 10
years companies that have disappeared
New York Times compaq one companies
being under list the entire time who do
you think it is on shared a few out GP
GP it's not any of those wine drinks or
coca-cola manufacturers you had last
night it's GM and when they got on the
list they were electricity company today
they make most their money from
financial services they've evolved it's
stayed relevant this is what is
happening in your organization today you
are in a 21st century world were 20th
century practices and 19th century
management practices the accounting
practices we use today are the same that
we first invented when we came up with
the concept of accounting now last time
I checked the world changed a little bit
in the last 200 I've years and yet we
are still using the same practices from
two centuries ago to run our businesses
so when you think about your ability to
respond to change to be agile
how can you do it when you're
constraining yourselves with these types
of techniques and practices so you meet
the new generation these people don't
care about your business plans how your
processes internal things work why it's
hard to get work done they are seeing
technology as a chance to radically
improve the performance not only of
their internal organization but what
they can offer to their customers
they're fundamentally reshaping the
paradigm of business because they
experiment they find out what things
work and they scale at speed software is
eating the world but we're in London so
mind the gap the gap the gap between
these people the scary business and the
technology team this separation even in
your organization is siloing you could
never achieve high performance when you
have silos so one of the things we did
when we were writing the book we spent a
lot of time researching we've a lot of
seen a lot of companies seen a lot of
good stuff seen a lot of bad stuff and
and these are the sort of key principles
that we took away from companies that
were achieving high performance those
that see technology is a strategic
capability they have a willingness to
support experimentation in their
organization they use iterative adaptive
practices and processes to respond to
the learnings of those experiments and
they fundamentally reduce learning
anxiety across their organization they
remove the anxiety of people trying to
learn to experiment to try things out
and then hankin scale when they find out
what works they scale it so this is the
mantra of the Lean Enterprise think big
start now learn fast if you want to have
high performance if you want to stay
relevant these are the things that
matter so I'm going to talk a little
about how you do these things think big
the purpose of an organization is to
create an environment where people can
do extraordinary things dropper now one
of the first questions I love to ask
teams are companies when I walk into
them is what's your mission what's the
mission of the thing you're working on
one shadownet pretty awesome normally
what I hear is what do you think I hear
make money my job my mission is to make
money how exciting is that Jack Welch
shareholder value is the dumbest idea in
the world it is a result a result of
doing exceptional things when you do
exceptional things then people send you
away so I often thank you when you're
thinking about mission who's got a good
mission these people have a good mission
who doesn't want to go to Mars here oh
well I look to your room would watch see
the alcohol still wearing off that's
okay who doesn't want to work to be part
of this mission one person all right
look what he's doing it's cool it's like
remember I don't even but Iran is known
to be extremely challenging that he
pushes his team's very very hard he's
high expectations he puts a lot of
stress on the system to find the
obstacles to search the mesh to drive
forward because the one thing he's
fantastic at is removing those obstacles
for the team when they hit a blocker he
will do everything from sticker part in
his private jet and flied out to the
middle of the Pacific
but he helps to move forward that's the
role of leadership so the question is
then how do you start to get alignment
at scale how do you start to drive these
things and this is why we talk a lot
about and look at organizations people
went who's a high performance group
who's really disciplined who gets stuff
done Otzi re the army are great at that
and the army used command and control
they just tell people what to do but
that's a foul see the army abandoned
commander control sometime after the
Napoleonic war in the eighteen hundreds
so even before the management practices
that we still use today and what they
align behind is the principle of mission
and they talk about what is the key
outcome that I'm going to try and
achieve what is the objective of the
mission so when I'm in a situation and I
know the principal mission is to take
that hill when I am in a situation of
opportunity or threat I don't have time
to write a 10-page business case handed
to the lieutenant handed hitters over
hundreds of the general come back to me
it's over opportunity gun I'm trusted
based on the training the experience the
knowledge that I have as an individual
if I know the key outcome to achieve I
will respond in the appropriate manner
to that opportunity or threat so the
role of leadership is to define that
principle of vision most military people
will say their orders are incomplete
until they have that so when you think
about that what's your principal mission
to your team we talked a lot yesterday
about how you then start to drive that
culture change in the organization a
negress kind talks about two types of
things you have learning anxiety and you
have survival anxiety now survival
anxiety is this sense of urgency and I
can sit up here forever and say your
business is going to blow up your
business is dead someone else has got it
learning anxiety is actually the ability
for people to feel safe to try new
things out to feel that they will not be
persecuted if they make error
now the interesting thing is just only
one way this model works because only so
much survival anxiety will work before
people tap out the only way to drive
forward is to reduce learning anxiety
and allow people to experiment and learn
and feel safe and that's how you get to
this place intrinsic motivation of
people in your organization you're
thinking big with your purpose what is
the purpose I can pursue mastery because
there is no learning anxiety I am
encouraged to experiment and improve and
I have the autonomy to do so so what
does this look like in real life so this
is examples of what some clients I work
with the largest online gaming company
in the world showing up on their themes
creating a mission mission command what
are the things that they are working on
clarity about what is happening using
visualization so people can come and
share context meeting here executives
working with teams to understand what
they are learning executive setting
Direction teams devising solutions to
achieve that direction and sharing their
learning of their outcomes to reevaluate
the direction we need to go and move
forward adaptation learning
experimentation at scale and teams run
with this this is them after one month I
had those there last week this is one
year every single team in this
development organization they even
painted the walls which I thought was
nice every team high performance at
scale so when you're thinking about big
for your organization big is not your
mobile app your new mobile app
Zuckerberg uses p50 goals he says to the
team I want day set goals that they
think they have a fifty percent chance
of cheating stretch goals first one was
to have a billion active users on
facebook to achieve that last month
next go we're going to connect a billion
more people to the internet through
internet.org now whether you agree or
not with the principles of internet org
that is a big big thinking big so when
you go back to your team and they're
like make more money is our thinking big
but you got to start now you can't sit
around Everett Rogers competitive
advantage people might be familiar dis
when you introduce something you get a
massive leap of performance but
eventually becomes commoditized over
time Jeffrey more adoption cycles for
innovation early adopters right through
to Lagarde's this is true for instance
of new products but it's also true of
organizational change in your business
there are people who are more likely to
embrace change there are people who are
less likely the tactics that you need to
reach either those is different in each
circumstance now we're familiar with
these models because this is the way the
world we have some innovations their
introductory some work then they go
through massive growths they live for a
period of time they decline they die
that was a long time ago because today
this is where we are companies
experiment with new products new
business models new ideas and when they
find something that works its scales
radically scales this shark fin picture
is owned to become smaller and smaller
and smaller classic example so imagine
you're the CFO on let's say the chief
marketing officer of a telco in let's
say 2007 and you rock into your board
meeting and you've got your graph
starting to go up into the to the right
then you go in the next year that's like
the next year and the next year and
you're like we are printing money whew
happy days we're all over this stuff
where is my bonus 2009 a couple of
people sit in the room 2010 your
business is a dumb pipe it's a dumb pipe
that people are using to do other stuff
on this happens to all of us now this is
one of the key things about thinking
about business model strategies there
are two modes of operation exploring new
ideas and exploiting them we talked a
lot about this because fundamentally
when you're working with new areas new
product development it's highly
experimental it's very uncertain you do
not know you have no data about what
will work and what won't you have to
experiment to get that knowledge but in
more mature areas of businesses or
business models you have a lot of data
you understand how the business model
works it's an optimization process they
are different things you need different
skills structures and processes to
manage them enterprises traditionally
will be on the left yet they use all the
same techniques on the right and things
get crushed because what's your ROI and
day one of a new initiative exactly it's
not a billion dollars so this is an
exercise I do with a lot of their
executives they get them to map out
their portfolio explore exploit
sustaining business models and retiring
what do you think to sort of breakdown
on this is just percentage-wise just yes
it's all in sustained so just
anecdotally this is generally around
from 85 to 90 percent if you're looking
you've got 5% in here you can probably
see I'm running out of money I'm not
running out of ideas just money if
you're lucky people are trying to retire
things and then the question is we've no
money to do innovation well of course
you don't because you're spending it all
on keeping this lights on you need to be
making lots of small bets in explore
this is about small cross-functional
teams exploring problems faces at speed
small investments because guess what you
want to make loads of them because guess
what most your ideas suck
they're not going to work and if you
were playing bet the farm 100 million
dollar bets you have no option you're
too big to fail make lots of small bets
and figure out what works and what
doesn't because the things that do you
will want to grow you'll want to change
the way they are you'll have more data
about how they operate you'll start to
scale of different practices different
processes more data manage your collect
all turn into sustain but the problem
here is when companies get to this stage
they're like whoo we got the winning
horse let's just keep piling stuff into
it anything goes it pile it into it and
you get so big and complex that someone
says can we just move the button from
the left to the right yeah six months 25
people 100 million dollars you need to
work hard to reduce the complexity of
your systems constantly seeking to
retire things and stop putting
everything into the one hang spread your
breath break it out into new small
things and build it and test and learn
because ultimately everything is going
to be disrupted now the problem in this
world still is that we spend half of the
product development time with a group of
the highest-paid persons opinion the
hippos sitting in a room telling stories
about how great the weekend was in bone
suree or wherever the hell they were
bashing their egos at one another about
trying to get their thing funded half of
the time and you have learned nothing
New York Times one of our clients so
their company around a challenge they
didn't sit around and talk about what
they could be doing we just said let's
just get a team together let's pick some
opportunities and set them a limited
time frame a limited budget and let them
go and explore a problem space and find
out the fastest point2 feedback to find
out if an idea is a good one or not
should we do something else constrain
the system create a feedback loop make a
decision do we invest more do we stop do
we do something different and the
beautiful thing is they get a culture
change because they are acting in a new
way they are not talking about it they
are acting in a new way they are
demonstrating a new way of working for
their business culture change actually
stuff happening actually stuff
delivering the beautiful thing even is
as a result of this we help them
generate loads of innovation methods so
they compile them into a book which they
have now published back to the community
of all their innovation techniques that
they're doing you can go and download it
because you need to start thinking about
how you balance your portfolio and this
is why we talk a lot about horizon one
two and three thinking horizon one is
the stuff that makes you successful
today horizon to tomorrow and three
right out there they're after but most
organizations are so trapped in their
horizon one thinking that they are safe
and they just need to keep making that
money they're not thinking about the
long-term gains you need to be balancing
your portfolio you need to design your
organization to invest about how you
want to manage your innovation portfolio
quite simply 70 2010 Google did this for
years twenty percent time e3 em and they
thought they were building their
organization to balance their portfolio
of innovation by design not making stuff
up into it really good example of how
they do this right now so mint and
turbotax generate most of their revenue
right now that is their horizon one and
they know QuickBooks is the horizon to
the growth to next thing coming for them
they've got this other product called
snap taxes and even know what it is okay
go on to the apple store after this talk
and check out the reviews of that up
this is literally like this thing
changed my life oh my god what did I do
it out it I'm crying I'm so happy i
think i'm gonna die
when the team said how to what the idea
was people said they were crazy never
going to work that's not that's not
where we're at and Scott Cook has
designed an organization where he's like
let's just go and find out they put a
small team together of three people to
explore the problem see if they could
deliver it what does map tax deal so at
the end of the year you get your tax
form p60 here w something in the u.s.
you take it out you put it on the table
you pick up your phone you take a photo
that's where tax return them boom magic
change people's lives and this is what
I'm talking about because a year from
now you will wish you have started today
you do not have time to sit around and
talk about what we could be doing
because the next what's up is already
out there eating your lunch and they're
learning fast they are learning fast and
this is the real important part now this
is a from a hvr recently and it shows
the orders of magnitude of difference
between productivity levels of
high-performing organizations look at
services orders of magnitude of fifty
percent difference between high
performance and everybody else fifty
percent that's like me running against
Usain Bolt he has a chance that's where
and here we are in our annual fuzzy
water con scrum continuous fall bound
delivery ups talking about how good our
golf score is this week maybe I don't
know do you want the money how good's
your business case are not really sure
okay we're trying really hard we're
going really fast we're still talking
about something called velocity and
everyone understands that especially
this person and this person and then ops
are on fire because we just keep
shipping stuff under and blowing stuff
up if you want to engage business people
you have to start speaking their
language just like they need to
understand the power of technology you
need to understand their language start
talking about business and impact of the
work you're doing stop talking about
velocity it's an efficiency measure for
the team talk about your impact on the
business on achieving the mission the
goal here whenever came up with a
variation of the Deming cycle called
lean startup is not what are we going to
build how am I going to measure that
what have I learned it was to get
through these learning loops the
efficiency of getting through a learning
cycle to find out what works and what
doesn't and to do that as quickly as
possible in small batches to learn fast
2011 amazon over a thousand and 79
opportunities to learn what works what
doesn't what their customers like what
they don't what technology works what
doesn't that is how fast they are
learning four years ago four years ago
and we're getting something at once
every six months with so much stuff in
there that everybody claims to victories
and no one claims the defeats and it's
impossible
so and this is why you need to start
thinking about your products your
technology choices your process changes
about how can I reduce the uncertainty
of them how can I make it economic to
work in small batches of work so i can
run experiments and find out what works
and what doesn't by putting
cross-functional teams together to
explore a problem space with the people
that it's designed to help solve the
problem for and then make those
decisions on evidence of what works what
doesn't what should we kill
healthcare.gov who knows this a couple
of evil so this was thinking big and it
was build and big so depending on who
you talk to this initiative ranges
between 700 to 1.2 billion dollars and
that's how much they sorta spent
something like this and how did they
start off big vision think big we're
going to create health care for the u.s.
awesome great vision start now well
actually what we're going to do is
engage tons and tons of different
suppliers we're going to ask everybody
what they think we're all going to sit
around we're all going to write down our
plan everyone's going to tell me yeah I
can do that I'm your man I can do that
yeah yeah and we'll all sit around and
see what happens and write some more
documents and write more similar specs
and then someone says the date that we
were going to make and everyone's like
yeah all good all good boom everybody
gets fired hiring a team yeah now we
could do it yeah of course yeah get all
the specs Oh get it all together we can
make it work whatever you need we can do
this probably about 500 million at this
stage yeah that's the real a boom they
got themselves in a situation that it
was too big to fail they fell in the
planning fallacy they had to keep
spending money to achieve the thing that
they said they would do with no evidence
that they could do it just a whole lot
of people saying based on my experience
on my excellent opinion yes of course we
can do that but no evidence opinion gov
dot uk' people familiar with this yay
331 different departmental web sites 34
different ministerial websites all
different all hosted differently as a
customer I have no idea where I am I
thought I was trying to do a tax return
now I'm getting healthcare initiatives
totally disparity martha lane fox big
vision digital place sin simple place
for people to come and interact with the
government great vision so when I told
you what's involved in that project how
do you think you'd start that one sounds
pretty big sounds like we better go big
okay they started with 14 people 261
ground and 12 weeks to prove to test the
hypothesis that they could do this and
create a feedback loop to describe
should we do more should we stop or
should we do something else they limited
the risk they paid for the information
to find out if they could do it and made
a further decision based on evidence
welcome to the world of optionality go
down the road your friends in the
banking industry are doing this for
years they make lots of small bets they
see how the market adopts they double
down and they limit their losses this is
what software development is about its
economics people and then you start to
see across the whole piece you can go in
the government and look at all these
different things that are doing to
discovery testing things out if it works
going to alpha investing more going to
beta larger audience more robust to life
there are different break points along
the way here you are limiting your
investment the techniques that you are
using to discover are different at every
stage you can take a photo on the
website
so what can I do tomorrow because it's
really important when you walk out of
here that you make a change tomorrow a
year from today you'll wish you started
today set up a mission command at your
team the total cost of this is 24 pounds
I checked how much deposit swear in the
way up here you just meet device and
sharpies get people to a place that they
understand the mission what are we
trying to achieve bring the executive
there collaborate about what they are
trying to achieve and solutions you can
think to get them there and share what
you're learning drive alignment through
experimentation and learning together
reduce the uncertainty of what you're
doing by experimenting with real
customers at all levels from paper
prototyping right through to software
how can I involve them in the process
how can I create a cross-functional team
to do that but the trick is to define
boundaries defined boundaries around
scope investment level and risk so you
create a feedback loop by design that
you have to go and see if what you
thought was true is true when can is as
soon as time that I can find out if what
I believe is true is true or false
you've got to build that in because this
is the mantra of the Lean Enterprise you
need to start thinking big start now and
learn fast I'm going to give an example
of a client that I've just been working
with they are one of the largest airline
conglomerates on the planet now they are
trapped in a world of every idea that
they want how simple how small is a
hundred million dollars a hundred people
six months for anything
they're trapped but they have loads of
great ideas they want to think big and
they want to start now and they want to
learn fast so what do we do well we took
five of their leading executives out of
their organizations and when I mean
leading executives I'm talking head of
sales I'm commercial CTO all this level
of senior executives out of their
business for eight weeks and we've
created a program for them to
fundamentally leave the business and try
and disrupt and blow up their existing
business by creating new products and
services and business models designed to
disrupt their own business it's been a
transformational experience for them not
only have they come up with great ideas
that they've now explored and some of
them they want to move forward they've
also had a cultural impact in the
organization because the people leading
it fundamentally know what it's like to
go and talk to customers again and hear
that that great idea that they think
actually sucks they're learning fast so
the purpose remember of the Lean
Enterprise is to create that environment
where people can actually solve customer
problems and have support and doing that
so when you go back to your
organization's tomorrow do think big do
start now and learn fast don't forget to
vote thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
