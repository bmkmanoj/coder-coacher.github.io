come I know I'm standing between you and
beer so I'll try and make this go as
smoothly as possible so this talk is
really about the things we've learned at
a stop about integrating software at car
manufacturers what's ironic about this
talk is that a lot of the lean practices
in software that we've been talking
about for the last two days are really
rooted in the concepts created in the
automotive industry where lean
manufacturing came from where the Toyota
Production system came from and that's
been adopted by car manufacturers around
the world of course they haven't applied
that necessarily to their software
practices and a lot of this talk is
going to be looking at how to take some
of those concepts and apply it to to
actual software practices so again it's
the last talk of the day those of you
who have only 9 reviews this is your
time to get your last review in so take
advantage of it and I don't know hit
click the microphone on the app and make
sure you review this at the end and also
ask any questions it's the last talk of
the day ask me some hard questions that
make me sweat it'll be fun ok I dug up
this page out of a old car manual for
the 1977 GM oldsmobile toronado this was
literally the first time software made
it into a car there was an electronic
control unit and I know the writing is
small and in a weird font but what it
says is the rocket 403 v8 with
electronic spark timing for improved
performance we've come a really really
long way in 40 years cars are now
becoming computers on the meals if you
think about and that statistic is really
McKinsey &amp;amp; Company
basically stated that the number of
customers declaring that they are
willing to switch brands for better
connectivity features has almost doubled
in a year from twenty percent to
thirty-seven percent think about that
for a second people are switching the
car they're driving because a
connectivity not because it rides better
not because it's more comfortable but
because of connectivity we have come a
very very long way in four years this is
Elon Musk the CEO of Tesla and about 18
months ago we dug up this quote where he
said we really designed the Model S to
be a very sophisticated computer on
wheels Tesla is a software company as
much as it's a hardware company a huge
part of what Tesla is is a Silicon
Valley software company
so Tesla has kind of led a massive
amount of disruption uber has obviously
had a tremendous amount of success and
all the other car sharing programs why
is the car industry so attractive for
disruption right now if I remember
correctly I think Tesla was one of the
first new US car manufacturers in about
45 years so what happened that suddenly
has created all of this and again this
is another study from McKinsey where yes
the car industry is growing which makes
it attractive but what's really
interesting it is about forty percent of
that growth is coming from things
outside of cars it's from new services
it's from data connectivity it's from
all of this stuff that we're building
the folks like you are building every
single day and what's also happening
here that's also creating this
disruption is the car manufacturers
aren't very good at software yet it's
not their core competence their core
competence has been elsewhere and
they're trying to figure out how to
become better at building software so
probably one of my favorite authors who
who talks about disruption is Geoffrey
Moore and he has a bunch of new ideas
that he's put out in a book called zone
to win that we can apply to what's
happening in the car industry so in zone
2 win he has four different types of
disruption in the car industry we
believe that three of them are hitting
the car industry I'm in the middle of
the book I haven't read it all but it
seems like a pretty good book especially
if you're a big company trying to deal
with disruption so the first type of
disruption it's the infrastructure model
disruption it's probably the easiest one
to understand the car itself is changing
it's turning into a connected car it's a
different thing than it was before a lot
of the other stuff is kind of stayed the
same traditional car sales you still go
to a lot you still buy a car you still
finance it the way you used to that
hasn't changed very much and again back
to the McKinsey survey people aren't
buying cars if they're not connected
they're willing to switch cars if
they're connected so obviously the item
has to
is pretty dramatically another
interesting quote from elon musk was
most cars don't improve over time but he
was talking about his own cars but Model
S's get faster and better as time passes
again a pretty novel idea that the car
is fundamentally changing and software
is one of the keys you can upload
software over the wire and next thing
you know it could be a better car it
could run faster the drivetrain could
perform better there's also operating
model disruption that we're seeing um
you know if you think again taking
advantage of Tesla but if you think
about Tesla buying a Tesla is not like
any other experience you have you don't
really drive the car necessarily you
don't get the car that you're going to
eventually buy you're ordering a car car
to go drive now meo and I think in
Denmark there's go more and let's go are
a couple of the Danish car sharing
options it's a really interesting thing
Lenny and not of Millennials Millennials
aren't buying cars anymore but rather
they're using cars as a service in the
cities they live in they're only paying
for the car while you use it and then
they're taking advantage of the fact
that ninety-seven percent of the time on
average that person owns a car it's not
used and then finally the biggest
disruption business model disruption and
this is where uber who's here obviously
today lift and others are coming in and
changing the way you think about what a
car means to you autonomous driving is
further going to create large large
amounts of disruption some examples here
are in Toronto which is considered to be
the second worst traffic in North
America Toronto Canada I'm still not
buying that statistic because I think
Mexico has worse travel but let's just
go with it la is the the worst the City
of Toronto is actually accounting for
autonomous driving and saying that it's
going to be safer and they're adjusting
how many hospital beds and that they
need in the city and they when they're
thinking about their long-term plans
another great example is uber and
apartment complex owners in San
Francisco have gone to the city of San
Francisco to argue that they need less
than the regulated amount of parking
spaces in the apartment complex and less
parking spaces mean another apartment
which means more money for the apartment
owner it's a pretty amazing kind of
disruption that's taking place and if
you think about all of these disruptions
what's at the heart of it and it's
software it's what's driving it it's
what's changing everything but it's
software at the heart of it so there's a
really cool organization called CB
insights that basically looks at
startups all the time and they put these
diagrams together about various
industries and these are all the
startups that are attacking the car
industry in different ways but it's not
just about startups all of the car
manufacturers are trying to avoid having
a Kodak moment Toyota had actually is
planning to build research institutes in
Silicon Valley bmw's doing the same
Honda Nissan others are building things
around MIT but what you're seeing is and
probably the most interesting one is
Volkswagen Volkswagen is actually hiring
engineers from Electronic Arts and from
Pixar to start thinking about how
they're going to be creating a better
experience in a connected car and
everyone's talking about it infosys
McKinsey IBM these were just a few of
the ones I found but there's hundreds of
these white papers about the coming
disruption in the automotive industry
and the driver really is coming from
software so if you take a look at this
illustration car components they're not
growing there's not a bunch more new car
components coming in electronic parts
there aren't a bunch of new clec tronic
part it's the number of lines of
software think back to nineteen
seventy-seven your first line of
software appeared in a car to today
where there's a hundred million lines of
software in
in a car and based on what we're hearing
it's going to be 300 to 400 million by
the end of the decade and this software
complexity is really real the cost of
software today in a car is more
expensive than any single component part
in the car the drivetrain the body the
engine it doesn't matter software now
costs more than any particular component
in the car think about that for a second
I just said that's something that has
zero physical cost is the most expensive
part of a car there's one estimate out
there that says the software in a
mercedes-benz s550 was basically
approximated to twenty three thousand
dollars is the cost of the software in
that car so this this information came
from the srr warranty and recall report
and all of this data is based on
software related recalls and in 2006
there were probably six or seven
different parts of a car that had
software related recalls if I remember
correctly the vehicle speed control was
actually the Prius from 2006 2005 time
frame where they had a software problem
that caused the speed control to to
accidentally not stay on now if you look
at the list on the right every single
part of a car how software in it and is
is and at least in this particular place
has been recalled automotive has always
been known for having supply chains huge
big supply chains lots and lots of parts
what's really interesting is the
automotive industry today has massive
software supply chains one of our
customers in Germany literally has 70
suppliers that's providing software that
goes into the car so think about
integrating all of that and trying to
make this into a single
Arians for the customer they've been
really really good at it with hardware
it's just a different game now that made
software so the good news for y'all is
everything I've said means you guys have
job security BMW at their hundredth
anniversary which was last year
announced the CEO got up and announced
and said they will have more software
engineers in their company than anybody
else more than fifty percent of their
company will be software engineers he
didn't give a time frame though so I
don't know the answer to that um but
despite that job security something's
not working this is not a future problem
this is reality if you look at that the
number of software related recalls and
again this is from that same SR
automotive warranty and recall report
from just this year is accelerating 2014
2015 there's massive problems here and
this isn't even at the point where we're
having basically the security hacks are
just starting we're starting to see them
in cars we're starting to see even
bigger integration problems and I
couldn't help but grab this one since it
was just about six days ago BMW confirms
that they can't get the iphone 7 which
you would think you would have tested
Bluetooth connectivity to work it's a
really interesting problem but that's
how complex the software ecosystem has
it has become so why is this happening
everyone's trying to move faster the
competition spit up time to market is
become tantamount and then again just
the sheer quantity of lines of code is
create driving complexity so we think
it's time we borrowed a lot of the lean
concepts from manufacturing and brought
into software and we think it's now time
to take these lean concepts and take
them back to manufacturing and have them
learn from us I love this picture
because this is the old
go to production system and how they
build cars back in the 50s and 60s so
let's take a look at where software is
not working at scale because there's
also some lessons we can learn from
other industries not this particular
plane but this plane I actually flew on
to get over here from from the US it's
the Dreamliner 787 and this story cracks
me up but as you know the Dreamliner had
numerous delays they were all six-month
delays but there was like 12 of them I
felt like one of the delays was related
to the brakes in on the plane it wasn't
that the brakes didn't work the brakes
worked perfectly the software on the
brakes actually worked perfectly what
the problem was that because of the
outsourcing nature of the relationship
Boeing had outsourced the brakes to
vendor the vendor it outsourced the
software development to another vendor
there was no requirements traceability
from the software code to the brakes and
when you have a physical device that
needs to be around for 35 years and then
another thirty five more years in
maintenance mode that can't happen so
Boeing decided rather than to retrofit
traceability into the existing software
they decided that it was better to take
another six month delay and rebuild the
software with traceability baked into it
from the beginning and if you think
about it um this is almost the truism
that exists in almost every software
project manual processes that you put in
place work fine in the small but as soon
as you hit scale things start to fall
apart so the new reality is we are
seeing this kind of across the board and
we've seen how some software startups
are doing it better but basically you
know if you think about it time to
resolution if you think back to Dan Dan
North's talk up yesterday morning time
to resolution is
way more important than catching every
single defect now in a car in a plane
you want to try to catch as many defects
as you can prior to release so you have
to balance this between thinking about
what domain you're in with how it works
but the reality is software now is
creating problems that are resulting in
more faults more problems more recalls
which is cost and time to market delays
and there's new threats coming in
obviously hacking has always been one
but if you start to think about the
private date the location of the car the
activities the person is doing in the
car who should you be allowed to share
that information with it started
starting to create some pretty
interesting software specific problems
coming we've seen a lot of this before
though back in manufacturing the word
kaisan and continuous improvement of
quality obviously came from that world
there's a lot we can do to steal from
this world to in turn lean manufacturing
into lean software manufacturing so what
was it that allowed us to get our heads
around the complexity of software let's
say for financial applications and other
applications when they became problems
well programming languages helped us
deal with some of that complexity and
then frameworks came and that helped us
deal with some of that complexity but I
would argue that it really was the
design patterns that solidify this layer
of abstraction that allowed us to manage
complex software projects at scale in a
lot of spaces so if you think back
things like Model View controller from
one of my old company spring source and
the spring framework and other design
patterns made it possible for different
types of developers and different types
of tools to coexist we got us thinking
about a better world of modularity Erich
gamma who i think has spoken that a
number of these in the past is really
the guy behind the design patterns but
where he was inspired by was christopher
alexander who had basically done the
exact same thing dealing with the
complexities of buildings and social
spaces and
cities so we know these pattern
languages work and they can allow us to
handle complexity and we're going to
take advantage of that here so if you
think back to the car problem how do we
fix it well you can throw more people at
it BMW's definitely going to do that
right they're hiring a bunch of software
developers we can throw a process at it
we have lots of cool processes these
days scaled agile DevOps being lots of
things out there that we can throw at it
to build cars better and we can throw
tools every company there's so many vc's
investing in software development
companies there's lots of tools we can
throw at it but none of these are going
to solve their problems on their own at
the core what we believe in what we've
seen is that you have to have a software
lifecycle integration patterns and
really what we're really talking about
again stealing from manufacturing is Val
used that was what lean manufacturing
was about they created a connected value
stream and look and then once you have
that value stream and I'll go into that
in a little bit then you look at the
people and the processes and the tools
and you decide what you're going to
implement so to do that let's kind of
start with integration and we'll work
our way to a value stream so well
integration is easy we've got lots of
solutions to that right now es bees have
come along and they've been doing great
and integration we have rust api's that
should be able to solve the problem
you're just moving data from point A to
B and then linking things between each
other this should be easy except those
who have tried it at this scale and this
complexity haven't had a lot of success
there's ridiculously rich in and if you
think about jira think about how much
you can customize JIRA think about how
much you customize HP quality center in
the testing land there's ridiculous
amounts of customization and not one
single company that we've seen and we do
an equation for a business has the exact
same situation nobody uses vanilla
Jarrett nobody uses vanilla any of these
tools so this hasn't worked the way we
think about integration
is really in layers and again we've
borrowed a lot of this stuff from other
worlds and other parts but you have to
break it down into layers the bottom
layer is integration operations these
are simple things like one-way sync a
two-way saying fire-and-forget tracking
linkages time tracking interestingly in
our world is a completely different
thing and has to be managed differently
building on top of the integration
operations you've got integration
patterns and I'm going to go into a
little more depth on that later but on
top of that you got process frameworks
and these are things like agile and
DevOps and i tol and then above that
you've got lifecycle architecture and
this is really the big picture if you
want to go back to think back to your
school days this is the v-model but
connected to continuous delivery this is
things like scaled agile connected to
ITIL it's it's you're starting to put
multiple of these process frameworks
together to start to see which is
eventually your value stream and at the
simplest level all the value stream is
is getting from a business initiative to
code going out the door that's it but
there's a lot of stuff between the top
to the bottom we have a ton of
technology out there and most of you all
probably already know how to connect
tools you've heard about data
interchange formats and interoperability
formats if you were here i think it was
four years ago i think this one was in
Aarhus though you would have heard the
IBM CI CI Oct Oh Martin alley talking
about an inch change format called OSLC
and I don't think you can get away from
the API economy just just look at your
visit a website and there's somebody
advertising some sort of API tool if you
if you allow advertisements to show up
on your on your browser so essentially
what this diagram is is you've got a
bunch of repositories to define your
value stream in a car the repositories
are places where you you put hoods
cars and keep nuts and bolts and screws
but in the world of software the
repositories are where you hold projects
and teams and requirements and issues
and tickets and defend defects and
builds and all of that stuff we have all
these protocols we have middleware to
help connect those worlds up and to make
things talk to each other but what's
been missing is this middle integration
layer so without the integration Illaria
you end up with organizations that have
a bunch of manual steps a bunch of
manual handoffs and as soon as you try
to move fast those manual handles and
manual steps cause havoc I know this is
an eye chart I apologize for that but
that's part of the point here this chart
is a fortune 100 fortune 50
manufacturing company and I'll leave it
at that knock are actually and those red
dots which look like dots aren't dots
they're the letter M's and they
represent the manual steps or the manual
processes that they have is they've
described their entire workflow between
how software's delivered this is a very
very real problem so how do you address
this problem and these are the
integration patterns I'm going to focus
on one here I'll show you the list of
another 20 or so on the next slide but
just as an example um defect unification
you need a single view of all your
defects across all your repositories
which means now think about the
automotive world where you live in a
land of software ecosystems it's not
just the defects in your repositories
that you have to worry about it's the
defects in your software supply chain
and if you don't know the single you
don't have the single view of defects
you can kind of see how you know maybe
BMW wouldn't have known that there was a
Bluetooth component in one of their
pieces one of their their supply chain
that didn't work with the iphone setting
even though the supplier may have known
about it I'm not saying that's the case
I'm just kind of postulating what the
world might have been you can very much
see that
you don't have that signal via defects
so there's a boatload more of
integration patterns we are actually
writing a book to kind of get this out
there into the public domain because
we've learned about this over ten years
and we think it's important to kind of
as others have done before us Eric amma
and others it has to get out there and
so that any one of you can solve these
problems but to give you a practical
example layering on the scale agile
framework and how this all looks like a
bunch of at least in our world looks
like a bunch of integration patterns so
let's pretend for safe you're trying to
you implement safe we actually view safe
as just something that can be
implemented and represented by a bunch
of integration patterns so you want to
connect the portfolio and a portfolio
layer that's the place where money comes
from right that that's the business side
and the investment stuff to the release
train and you want to know what a
release costs you what different
different activities cost you you want
to make sure that they know that because
they're the ones who are going to put
set the investment criteria for future
opportunities well to do that you've got
to have connectivity between
requirements and test you have to
connectivity with all the defects that
are out there you have that connectivity
again in the automotive world across the
supply chain so to actually connect up
those two worlds really at least in our
view is a bunch of integration patterns
and what this starts to look like is
something like this basically you've got
to identify all of your repositories to
produce this connected value stream
you're going to take all those tools and
get them together and then you have to
decide what artifacts flow for tuning
those tools so a helpdesk ticket for
example that comes in then needs a
software development of things has got a
flow to a developer and a tester to be
developed and tested against projects
and requirements have to survive all the
way through to deployment and then the
great thing about DevOps is and
continuous inning
Shin is the value string just layers on
top of that so I'm going to give you
another slightly more real example which
is the old V diagram again from from
what we learned in school but this time
overlaid with some value stream
management and DevOps automation so in
order to go from what we learned in dev
ops the fully automated portion right of
the life cycle that we're all trying to
get to but now to a continuous
engineering Louth when you think about
more of them auto manufacturing you've
got to start thinking about the
requirement let's say our new
requirement comes in that we need to
make the inverter on the i3 better and
most likely BMWs telling Bosch to do
that you've got continuous integration
you've got continuous change and then
you've got hardware-in-the-loop testing
and simulation and of course then you've
got the whole DevOps automation that
then applies across the bottom to kind
of keep this cycle continuing so this
takes this concept of the reality of the
value stream integration technology to a
little more real world and this is what
it looks like so on the left you've got
an auto manufacturer and then you've got
a set of suppliers as well as some of
their offshore developers and
essentially in this world we've
connected up the value stream of this
particular auto manufacturer to 40
different suppliers and that number is
growing to 70 so that they have one view
of a defect one view of a requirement
across all of their only amps so they
can layer on a continuous engineering
loop on top of that what's interesting
is the car manufacturer or the suppliers
the one building the software they get
it over to the car manufacturer who test
the software they may run it in a
simulation they may run it on a test
track there's a problem something fails
that defect has to then get back to the
right supplier so if it's the brakes
it's got to get to the brake supplier
who may have outsourced the software to
a third party who may have out sourced
another portion of it to a different
third party that's the complexity of
what's going on in automotive
so real quick what is value stream
mapping and and why are we bringing this
to software um how many of you all are
familiar with value stream mapping and
have seen it before use them before all
right good this line won't be useless
night um it's basically the way
manufacturing is managed and essentially
to simplify it it you look at your
suppliers you look at your lead times
and you look at the wait times and
that's essentially your Valley Stream
you can kind of see that with the little
kind of 2nd the bottom thing there um
this doesn't look that different in
software if you've read the Phoenix
project there's a whole lot of talk
about this there um but what's key here
is the connectivity and automation
between those handoffs for example you
could track cycle time to the value
stream so there's so much talk about in
software what is cycle time is it from
when a developer gets the gets the the
ticket to work on to when he solves it
or she or is it when the help desk
person or when a customer reports a
problem through the help desk it gets
assigned to a developer it gets signed
to a tester to test the fix the
developer claims she fixes it the tester
says no you didn't there's all these
other issues goes back to the developer
in a new jira ticket has to fix it and
then eventually after a couple more
iterations makes it back to the custom
it gets built and makes back to a
customer as a fix I would argue the
cycle time is that entire time for the
customer to see value um how do you do
that though in in a world where all of
the tools don't talk to each other and
that's that's kind of the world that
exists so this is where value stream
mapping where you can show what these
workflows look like what the lead times
are what the problems are basically is a
very very good conduit for what's
happening in complex software so we took
one example which is automotive spice
it's a compliance it's like an iso I
think the ISO course
why so thing is I so 2 6-2 6-2 and in
car manufacturing to kind of the v-model
and automotive spice and put this
together and all of these concepts of
system engineering tools software
engineering tools testing tools the
DevOps tools the hardware relating to
the software is represented something
like that in here and yes much to Dan
North chagrin there is a change control
board represented here because that's
the reality of this industry this is the
big challenge that I think awaits us
this is why there's going to be more
software developers this is what we have
to be able to nail to get right we're
not even close right now but if we do
get it right this is what the world is
going to look like we've seen this in
the small we haven't quite seen this yet
in the big but it's a world where all
the artifacts are flowing in near real
time so you have the right information
to make the right choices at the right
time and it's the right person doing so
you've got different engineering
disciplines that can communicate and
collaborate as though they're in JIRA as
though they have that social
collaboration fabric even though they're
working in special-purpose tools across
the world reporting which is probably
one of the most important things to get
ties on right but having this visibility
across the tool chain and knowing when
there's things that you can fix knowing
when there's things that can go wrong
and continuously improving you've got to
have the metrics to be able to say have
we actually improved and are things
getting better and then finally
traceability traceability we need that
just so we can reduce the recall rates
but traceability also because you're
maintaining something in the automotive
industry that's safety critical it's you
know people die if you mess up and
that's absolutely important so this is
what the world we think could look like
and everyone in this room every software
developer has an opportunity to kind of
get us from where we are today we're
yeah we're do
a lot of really great stuff with DevOps
but we're kind of doing it in the in the
small and I think there's a huge
opportunity so real quick takeaways very
simply put to build large l software
we're arguing that you need to have a
connected value stream out there to get
the value stream out into the world
automation is the way to go in agile and
DevOps as good as they've gotten and as
much as they're they're reaching for
scale is one part of it but it's not
enough and then every single step from
idea to actually running software and
that cycle has to continue and again we
believe the integration patterns are one
of the ways to do it consistently so
with that I'm gonna oppo I'm going to
open it up for questions here's my
contact information feel free to contact
me in any which way there is a linkedin
group around this topic about software
lifecycle integration and again i'm
supposed to remind you to rate the
session
that was really awesome thank you very
no it's I think it's one of the fun
things about go tues making all these
connections between things like software
dev ops right which most of us know
about and then manufacturing and I was
like hey makes a lot of sense like
Nealon said if you want to ask some
questions please just type them in the
app let me refresh who do you see
driving this process and connecting
things is it the larger players is it
smaller players integration yeah so this
is actually a pretty interesting
question um there was a slide actually
removed out of this deck which was an
integration maturity model and it you
can't go to Nirvana in in one second
what's interesting though is you know
when you think about small companies
they can yell over the cubicle they can
talk to someone and the communication
isn't as big a deal where we see
integration being more needed is where
there's at least 100 software
professionals where there's at least a
floor that kind of divides them and
that's where we've seen more the problem
gets much much more acute the bigger you
get the more geographic disparity you
have but that's really kind of where we
see integration but what's really
interesting is integration starts
usually with one solving one some point
problem I get again my testers and
developers talking or oh my gosh I got
to get story points converted to ours
back in to see it clarity so we can
understand how many dollars so my
manager stops yelling at me that's
almost where it always starts and then
once it has this weird viral aspect to
it that once it starts working they want
to do more and more and more with it
because that automation one of the most
interesting things in our deployments is
will deploy integration
and people will want all the information
to flow both sides because they don't
trust the other side and once the
information is flowing and that's just
in a point-to-point integration once the
interpret information is flowing about
through months later they're like wait a
min we don't want all that information
flowing we don't really need that and
then once they get to that world they
suddenly realize oh my god our business
processes were all around information
not flowing let's fix our business
processes and we see the cycle happen
every three four or five months and
that's why integration can be such a
powerful vehicle for for change and for
automation so thanks again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
