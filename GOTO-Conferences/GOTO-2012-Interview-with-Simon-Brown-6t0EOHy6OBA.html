chair of the go to conference in Kony
2012 but also for go to over 2012 with
me today is the self-clean architect
saddle brown would you like to do juice
yourself the self lame darkest so i'm a
software developer and i also understand
the importance of architectural projects
currently doing some freelance work and
training consulting and things like that
ultimately my role is to lead software
projects and be the architectural okay
thank you so my first question for you
this are you as a project open code or
you developer who is good at
architecture so when I when I suffer my
career I started off Cody you know
taking an instruction from people on the
team and gradually evolved into doing
high level designer and eventually its
architecture so and when architects who
does coding or might develop he went to
the doctor for me they kind of both
really the same thing and it just
depends on your perspective of the world
ideally we'd have a bunch of people at
EMU yes to both that's how we get to our
so Warren itt technical to you do you
think it's possible to get that bunch of
people who can do both it's possible for
some developers in the talk I gave
there's a really good question saying
some people do more and be more
interesting what they do for others yeah
I don't see why not I don't see why we
can't educate software developers to
become more itit rework this is they're
looking at you know cross-cutting
concerns performance guarantee
availability 2.1 trip all those sorts of
aspects yes because that was actually my
next question can you can you teach
people to become so probably take sports
of learning takes so the first thing to
get people to do is to step back and see
the big picture so most of the time as
developers we locked into our ideas for
looking at lines of code and refactoring
and design patterns and unit testing and
all are all suffering as developers
that's exactly where focus needs to
needs to be in order
to software the architectural is about
stepping back from the idea and really
looking at the bigger picture the bigger
picture is you know if you start from
out that kind of clean sheets of paper
it's what I've constraints of the
environment and we have is what we built
fit into the environment it's about a
non-functional the cross-cutting
concerns it's all of that stuff so kind
of lesson number one is step back into
the big picture and some people can do
that and some people can't and that's
really the kind of make-or-break time
for me mm-hmm and the people who can't
do that you can't teach them to do that
in the same sense as people have seen
the brought pizza can't be taught to be
one doesn't need to present programs
because they can't be very efficient in
the detail yes just a question of how
your hardware right so some people like
the detail and then get stuck in the
detail and that's why we need people and
galatea and other people you know can
only see the high life and picture
currently both no idea if we're looking
for a single individual on a team yeah
so you're under save the architects are
all the temple to lead role but they
need to go to to both yeah often at the
same time ideal which is hard yes of
course so a personal question why are
you interested in software architecture
not say developing programming languages
so there are a lot of smart people out
there so yeah we saw the keynotes
wanting rich Hickey closure you know all
of those cool languages I'm not that
sort of person I like using this was
languages but I'm not a language
designer I do have an interest in
programming languages and an orgy some
frameworks and that's why my kind of
background so I've written books in the
past on Java Enterprise Edition and jsps
and servants and things like that my
reason for being interesting
architecture is that you know currently
we're seeing lots of teams adopting
agile and agile spider-man lots of great
things and we're seeing the
craftsmanship movement which is a hype
in tacoma professionalism and so on and
so forth the projects are so failing
yeah through you know performing too
slowly not be scared of available so so
there's a relation some elements
so there's a need for somebody to take
that stuff and has it become worse with
the agile and remember that when XP
entered the stage we said well we don't
need any software architecture anymore
we don't need any big blueprint plants
and then it's losing it over so maybe
you need a message for something think
of it as a ship or building or something
correct yeah now we have the agile witch
is they are sort of coming towards or
maybe appreciating architecture but not
really so what do you think is the ideal
thing we know snow funds it's it's not
really if it's definitely taking focus
away from what teams would have done in
the past so if you look back 10 years we
have rushing for a process you know big
heavy precious framework but it gave you
a substantial go through it gave you a
vision a shared mission right in off of
the process you know look 10 years prior
to that SS ADM add another structure
method or get here now that job because
we're tweaking and defining and changing
the process mm-hmm you know we are
thinking a lot of that process and not
about one rap sheet building so I think
there's been a tendency for people to
kind of forget yeah all the stuff that
they should be doing have been doing
historically yeah which is why we kind
of had to sing it now and there's a
sweet spot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
