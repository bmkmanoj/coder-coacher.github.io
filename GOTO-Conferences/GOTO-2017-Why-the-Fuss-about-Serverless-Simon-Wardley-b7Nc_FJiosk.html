so why the fuss about serving us before
I start a couple of words of warning I'm
a scientist by training so I also used
kitten pictures this is my kitten
scientist because I'm a scientist I like
data and I like graphs so I've done a
quick graph this is the level of
audience pain that's you against the
number of slides given in a 50-minute
presentation I reckon there's a safe
limit of about 60 seeing I like to
experiment I'll be using no less than
232 the second warning I want to give
you is I'm gonna start by talking about
the concept of strategy and situational
awareness and then I'm gonna get onto
this whole issue of serverless and
they're the semi-religious Wars which
are starting to appear so I'm going to
talk about strategy to begin with and
I'm going to do it in a personal sense
when I used to be the CEO of a company
called for tango just here it was an
online photo service relatively small
this is 2004 16 different lines of
business several million users that sort
of thing and we were very profitable
lots of revenue doing very very well
except that there was one problem with
this company and that problem was me I
was the CEO and I didn't have a clue
what I was doing so rather than being
sort of like a chess-playing sort of
master I had things like vision
statements how our strategy is customer
focus we will lead an innovative effort
of the market through our use of agile
techniques and open source all this sort
of exciting stuff but this was basically
nicked from other people other CEOs of
other software companies this was 2003
my problem was rather than being over
here I was over here I was the alchemist
CEO I was just sort of making up as I
went along
I was very worried that people would
start to discover that I i was the fake
CEO i was suffering from that whole
impostor syndrome so i used to go around
recording other CEOs talking about
strategy and i came up with i do this
every couple of years i used to record
the small word's they would say when i
call business level abstractions of a
healthy strategy or blas for short and
these are the sort of common blahs
when I did this in 2014 that people talk
about things like digital business
disruptive innovative collaborative
competitive advantage ecosystem open
source etc and then I would combine all
these people's strache documents
together and generate a sort of blah
template out Raschi is blah we will lead
a bla effort at the market through our
use of blah blah to build a bla bla bla
bla and then I would combine the two
together the blouse and the bla
templates and also generate a bunch of
different sort of random strategies so
gibberish but I thought I'd go through
them so number one is our strategies
customer focus we will lead a disruptive
effort of the market through our use of
innovative social media and
collaborative and big data to build a
collaborative cloud-based ecosystem
again it's all random gibberish and
number two that came up was our
strategies innovative digital business
we will lead a growth effort of the
market through our use of customer focus
competitive advantage and disruptive I
can barely say the words it's set what
form but I would send them around to
people and I got about 400 responses are
three basic types this is the exact
wording from our business plan and the
second one was I've seen two of these
used already and my third and favorite
one is are you for hire sir so a friend
of Mines put this all online this is
strategy as a service by the way and the
URL is just at the bottom this is one
you just go to the site it automatically
generates you one and it's all random
gibberish but it seems to fit what goes
on in the markets
back in 2004 2005 being this fake CEO of
this very successful little company I
started to suspect that other people
didn't understand the environment other
people were being fake CEOs I wasn't the
only one so I went all the way back to
first principles Sun Tzu anybody know
what Sun Tzu wrote fabulous
so some sue talked about five factors
that mattered in in competition I first
understand your purpose your scope your
moral imperative why you are your
mission why you're trying to do
something the second thing understand
your landscape the environment that you
exist within and the third understand
climactic patterns so those things that
impact the environment then you re in
teach yourself around it and then you
get into - well you orientate me doctor
and then you get into leadership which
is context specific game play I thought
wow that's that sort of makes sense and
then I came across a John Boyd anybody
know what John Boyd did know who de
loops US Air Force pilots so John Boyd
talked about the game so that's your
purpose then the importance of observing
the environment so that's the landscape
and the climactic patterns that impact
it and then you get into you know
orientating with doctrine and lastly you
get into decision and acting and I was
quite excited by this because it started
to sort of make sense since I would go
and tell this to other people and they
would say wow you know really stratch is
all about the importance of why I
thought well that's interesting but
there's two why's there's the YF purpose
as in I want to be the best online photo
service whatever it happens to be and
then there's the wife movement why why
am I making this choice over that choice
and they're very very different things
so if you think about a game of chair
your wife purpose is to win the game and
your wife movement is why make this move
over that move and it's through acting
and through movement that we actually
learn so I went back to my little online
photo business there we were 2005 at the
beginning of and I thought well we sort
of have a purpose well we've got 16
different lines of business we're being
successful we're making lots of money
how did I understand the landscape and
this got me into a subject called
situational awareness and to explain it
I'm going to use three stories the
Vikings chess and for mr. Cleese so
Vikings very frightening the way Vikings
used to navigate is through the use of
stories epic stories so from Herman head
to us-ward half and you will have sailed
north of hat land and so that you will
just glimpse it in clear weather etc
you'd spend 10 15 years learning these
stories before you were put in charge of
a boat now that is simply that that's
what that means it's much easier with a
mat and we know this ourselves because
when people ask us directions if they've
got GPS you know and we pointed out if
they get on that we point out where to
go and if they don't we give them a
story up the road turn left turn right
and they disappear off and we're left
with that moment you know did I send
them in the right direction so quick
question what would you use to navigate
would you use a map visual map or a
verbal story what would you do good what
are we using business stories excellent
right so they the second example is
chess world I want you to imagine you
live in a world where everybody plays
chess and how well you play the game
determines your success in this world
but no one's ever seen a chessboard all
you've ever seen are these characters on
the screen and you play the game very
simply you press a button porn your
opponent sees what you've pressed
ah you counter they counter you counter
and the game goes on for ages until it's
a drawer or somebody wins now what will
happen is we will take these sequences
of games many thousands of them feed
them into our big data systems and come
up with secrets of success so if you
press Queen I should respond with Knight
and rook and we do this in business all
the time you look in the copies of most
of the business management magazines
things like HBR how earlobes can signify
leadership potential its phrenology of
management then one day you're going to
play a game of chess against somebody
you will see something truly remarkable
what they're going to see is the board
and you're gonna move and they're going
to counter and you're gonna move and
they're going to counter and you're
gonna lose and you'll be sitting there
going what the fiddlesticks happen there
how did I lose that game so quickly I've
been doing this for 15 20 years I've got
all my big data systems they've only
been playing for two weeks the first
thing you're going to do is copy that
sequence down has some sort of magic
secret of success you're still going to
lose then you're going to say is it the
speed at which they press the button
you're still going to lose you'll start
saying is it cultural is are they a
happy sort of person you're still going
to lose you're going to lose because you
exist in what's known as a low level
compared to a high level situational
awareness environment so what would you
use to learn secrets of success or
context-specific play what do you think
one take specific playing good what are
we using business secrets of success so
the last one the mystical is ancient
politician Greek general had a problem
Persians were invading what he decides
to do was to block off the streets of
Artemis ium force the Persians along the
coastal road into a narrow pass known as
Thermopylae where a small number of
troops could defend against the large
force
there are about 170 thousand Persians
about four thousand Greeks including 300
excellent you know the story right I
want you to imagine you're a member of
the Athenian army so you're part of the
Greek States hi I'm Thomas Turk listen
I'm giving you purpose and moral
imperative we're going to defend against
the invading horde of the Persians but
then I say to you I do not understand
the landscape I do not understand the
environment I have no man but have no
fear for I have created a SWAT diagram
strengths a well-trained Spartan army a
high level of motivation not to become a
Persian slave the weaknesses the ephors
might stop the Spartans turning up a
truckload of Persians are turning up
opportunities get rid of the Persians
get rid of the Spartans were athenian
and we actually hate the spartans and
threats the persians get rid of us and
the oracle says a really dodgy film
might be produced in a few thousand
years so what would you use communicate
determined strategy in battle position
and movement described by a map or a
magic framework like a SWAT sorry okay
what are we using business magic
framework so I'm going to go back to the
chess player versus the alchemy if I
look at navigation learning and strategy
then chess is visual it's context
specific it's all about position and
movement it's what we call a high-level
situational awareness environment it's a
bit like the military if you ask a
general why did they bombard a hill they
won't say because 67% of other generals
are bombing Hills therefore that's what
I did or that I read an article in
general weekly that bombing Hills was
the new thing all the bombing Hills
would make a good story or because
that's what uber would do it's all about
position and movement now alchemy is all
about story telling secrets of success
magic frameworks it's all low-level
situational awareness environment it's a
non learning environment
and that's where I was as this fake CEO
as being successful against other
companies making lots of money but if
you have a clue and I wasn't learning
how many of your companies do you think
are more in the alchemy more in the who
say he thinks their border chess playing
masters not us one one who thinks it's
more in the alchemy okay
so the difference between these
environments is the existence of the
non-existence of a map but maps have
very specific characteristics so what
makes a map is its visual its context
specific it's the battle at hand you've
got the position of pieces relative to
some form of anger in their geographical
map the anchor is the compass so this is
north south east or west of this you
have consistency of movement how to get
from Thebes to Thermopylae and you have
components they're very good for
collaboration communication and learning
turns out a chessboard is also a map
it's visual its context specific its
position it's got a anchor the board
itself so the position is like b1 or b2
and you've got consistency of movement
turns out a Tube map is actually a map
the anchor is the tube network and
you've got the position of state
stations relative to that network and
you've got consistency of movement and
its context specific so this is a map of
London Underground and if I go from
Westminster to South Kensington I'll go
through set number of stations I won't
take the journey one day and suddenly
discovered a new station has appeared
and then disappears the following day so
there I was in 2005 thinking okay that's
I can see that but we have maps we have
lots of maps in business I have things
like system maps anyone seen one of
these before
you've never seen a system map okay
buncha box of dying box and wire diagram
connecting different pieces the problem
is if I take a piece and I move it does
it change the meaning of this map and
the answer is no if you do that with a
geographical map of course if you shift
France and put it next to Australia it's
changed the meaning but not with the
system map that's because it's not a map
I also have business process maps
anybody seen one of these yes they're
brilliant except for they're not Maps
either they don't have position they
don't have consistency of movement I
also had digital roadmaps anyone seen
one of these recently they're great
because they're not Maps either I had
things like mind maps ever heard of a
mind map guess what there's not a map
either as inconceivable as it seems to
be we keep on using that word but I do
not think it means what we think it
means and without a map you can't learn
about an environment a changing
environment so how do you create a map
so this was my problem in 2005 when I
sat down when I first of all had a cup
of tea and it's why I was having a cup
of tea I realized that a cup of tea has
needs
well I first of all have needed a cup of
tea but it needs tea and hot water and
hot water needs a kettle and it needs
cold water and a kettle needs power so
if I focus on the user at the top as my
anchor I can create a chain of needs and
that gives me position so that's the
first thing I did I took one of my
systems maps or network topologies I
focused on the anchor what is the
customer and their needs created a chain
of needs of those components and hence a
value chain so customer required online
photo storage website required a
platform platform compute compute data
center power
unfortunately that turns out to be still
fairly useless because it doesn't have
the concept of movement or
so if you look at somebody like Nokia it
was a paper mill became a plastics
manufacturer became a telecommunications
company is becoming something different
today so I need to understand movement
so I took one point power went back in
history you got the Parthian battery
first ever battery all the way to Tesla
and Westinghouse utility provision of
electricity 1886 started to examine how
things evolved and the reason for that
is evolution Inc was changing it was
movement and it turns out there's a
common path by which things evolve not
only just for activities but practices
and data and even knowledge itself so
it's all driven by demand and supply
competition you start off with the
genesis of something it's rare poorly
understood on a scale of ubiquity
uncertainty then you get custom-built
examples products rental services
commodity and utility services so I was
able to take my value chain flatten that
evolution curve at the bottom
Genesis custom-built product commodity
put things into position and the low and
behold I have a map that was in 2005
which the question is so what why does
that matter
well if I understand the landscape or at
least can observe it now I can observe
common climatic patterns or the economic
patterns that hit us and there's about
27 of these and they're the rules that
influence the game so the first one you
learn is everything's evolving your map
if it there is supply and demand
competition is constantly driving from
left to right the second thing you learn
is characteristics change everything
starts off in this uncharted space where
it's chaotic uncertain unpredictable and
then through supply and demand
competition it becomes industrialized
ordered standard doesn't matter whether
it's computing money or penicillin the
next thing you learn is there's no such
thing as one-size-fits-all methodology
so we've gone all and
about 2001 2002 and had learnt it didn't
work everywhere by about 2004 turns out
agile in-house is very good at focus on
reducing the cost of change so XP but
very lightweight but it's weak in
comparison to something like Six Sigma
in the industrialized space because what
it's good at is focusing on reducing
deviation polar opposites and of course
in the middle you need something which
is all about learning and producing
waste so we were trying to use wrap
Eileen's start opening is much better so
we learnt that one size doesn't fit all
then we learnt that we had an OSHA to
change because of past success it's a
blockbuster Netflix it was first with
the website first with a website la
Buster right he was first with video
ordering online bla Buster yes who was
first with experimenting with video
streaming online bla Buster yes he went
bankrupt first Buster yes so everybody
said so what you don't want to be an
innovative what do you mean they out
innovated everyone the problem is their
pre-existing business model created
inertia to the change do you know what
it was about their business model that
got them late fees if you remember the
video cassettes some of you may not the
video cassettes we used to take back
they used to make money if we kept in my
home you don't get that with the video
streaming so anyway you start to learn
these 27 common economic patterns and
what you discover is you can now start
to anticipate obvious and predictable
change so there I was in 2005 without
Matt we knew that compute was going to
go to a utility I thought it was going
to be Google turned out it was Amazon
the next year we knew platform would go
to a utility we knew we'd have inertia
there's about 16 different forms of that
and we knew it would enable higher order
systems to appear
that's great from the point of view of
investment so did I want to invest here
or here or here
or maybe just try and differentiate with
one of my online photo services of
course when I said this to everybody
they would go our cloud is for startups
when it finally appeared and you know
you'd say we're all dominate the market
in 10 to 15 years it's a common economic
pattern and of course they all respond
you know burning heretic it's not going
to be the case so once you start to
understand your landscape and climactic
patterns and you can anticipate then you
move on to doctrine which is how you
organize yourself these are the
universally applicable principles
regardless of context and they're very
simple things so it's like flanking and
firing so if you're on the military I
mean flanking is a context specific move
so you do that when an opponent is in a
particular position whereas firing is
universally useful so you don't want to
be in the middle of a battle and say oh
we're gonna need suppressive fire and
have to send your soldiers off to learn
how to shoot a gun you want to have done
that stuff beforehand so that's the
difference between universal and context
specific so universal things are things
like focus on user needs
turns out surprise that's a good idea
the second thing is removed bias and
duplication so one of the things about
Maps if you have several like we have
borders and police and immigration and
you share the maps you start to discover
we're rebuilding the same thing now I
always thought government was the center
of waste and bias and in in IT
organizations I can happily say the
worst example of duplication I found in
government is a hundred and eighteen
teams building exactly the same thing
however that's nothing compared to the
private sector so in the private sector
I have my IT weapons of mass deportation
I had a global farmer 300
team's building enterprise content
management systems and five global
efforts to build the global enterprise
content management system
none of which knew the others existed I
spectacular I've got a bank they've got
a thousand risk management systems they
sit there saying they can't innovate
they are brilliant at innovation they
just keep on rebuilding the wheel in a
slightly different shade of blue okay so
you have a map you start to remove bias
and duplication and then you start to
apply methods what you discover is the
stuff on the right you outsource the
stuff in the middle off-the-shelf
product stuff on the left you use agile
in-house techniques so hs2 high-speed
rail big heavy engineering project
trying to organize it like this turn
into a map apply multiple methods that's
2011/2012 simple stuff do you know what
our world perception server is it's part
of a self-driving car I'm going to
pretend you're all part of Finance so I
T is elvish to you and what I'm doing
gonna do is take a box some wire diagram
for a self-driving car and I've turned
it all into elvish now I'm going to ask
you a question should we outsource or
build our own should we outsource or
build our own what do you think
any ideas that's the sort of question we
have all the time I'm going to turn it
into a map I'm gonna ask you the same
thing should we outsource or build our
own right should we outsource or build
our own right suddenly you've got
contacts turn it back into English
GPS world perception server pretty basic
stuff so back in patan go then we are we
have our map started using appropriate
methods thinking small breaking things
down constrain it into small contracts
that comes from fist fast and expensive
simple and tidy US Air Force so the US
Air Force and Special Operations Command
realized there was better ways of
building things you break it down into
small components they used it for the
harvest talk which was a Marine combat
aircraft
that went from paper to combat
operations in 18 months firing its first
shot in 19 months for military hardware
that's fast so you then you start using
small team cell based structures then
you start realizing but in these small
teams engineering over here is not the
same as engineering over here you not
only require an aptitude for engineering
or finance or marketing you require an
attitude these people are very good
exploring the count in the uncertain
world but half of what they produce it
barely works
these people are brilliant at making
success happen these people are
brilliant to building the empires of
scale and industrializing components so
you end up having multiple cultures in a
single organization and designing a
system which copes with constant
evolution and uses concept known as
theft now this is actually old stuff
comes from 1993 Robert cringes book
accidental empires GCHQ our intelligence
service is very kindly open source
boiling frogs which is a document which
tells you about how to organize in such
a manner so there you are you you now
understand your landscape you're
learning climatic pans you're starting
to anticipate you're starting to
orientate yourself around with doctrine
there's about 40 different forms then
you start to get into finally leadership
and context specific gameplay so these
are US context specific forms of game
play so these are the flanking versus
firing bits so I had my map 2005 we know
it's all going to a utility we know
where we could invest the question now
becomes can we manipulate the map to our
favor it turns out there's all sorts of
ways of manipulation about 70 you can
use open source to drive things to a
more industrialized form if fear
uncertainty and doubt - except to
basically play on other people's inertia
to change there's the use of constraints
all sorts of one
or techniques and so you apply that and
you build what's known as a context
specific form of gameplay so there we
were online photo service using the map
and we realized that the best thing for
us to do was to build the world's first
ever platform as-a-service now that was
a true platform as-a-service code
execution environment javascript front
and back-end it's with functional
billing you had no concept of the
underlying infrastructure or anything
along those lines we anticipated
somebody would make a utility play I
thought it was going to be Google turned
out was Amazon and some brilliant that's
fantastic and there's a whole ecosystem
model known as ILC which is a way of
exploiting other people building on top
so very simple the next thing you do is
act and that's what we did we launched
the world's first platform as-a-service
what you would now call service
environment it was great
grew like hotcakes like yay Amazon
launches yeah unfortunately the parent
company had some consultancy and they
said the three things that we were doing
3d printing the use of mobile phones as
cameras and this cloud stuff was not the
future the future was instead 3d
television so we shut it all down and
built spent large amounts of money on 3d
TV anybody own a 3d TV anybody use one
okay so I went to a company called
canonical ever heard of a bunting who's
heard of a bunting yeah
so we mapped it all out 2008 use that to
attack the market that's where we were
against right out windows we was 70% of
cloud by 2010 really simple then I went
to government started working all sorts
of government departments and staff for
government rate the better for Less
paper these days I do lots of
nation-state competition stuff so China
impact on USA now most the time people
say gosh this all incredibly complex
actually it is it what it is is
unfamiliar
we like magic frameworks because they're
familiar to us they're easy we have to
apply a lot more thought when it comes
to a man same with stories
Vikings weren't stupid to use epic
stories they were just unfamiliar with
the concept of a map so serverless
what does this all mean for service well
let's go through what's been happening
compute it was a product when it was a
product we used to build applications
with emerging architectural practices
because not only activities evolved but
also practices and these were based upon
the characteristics of a product it's a
high MTTR high mean time to recovery so
when you server went bang it would take
you weeks to get a new one so we had
practices like scale-up bigger machines
and plus one disaster recovery test
you'll remember those and they evolved
and became best practice for that world
and then what happened is compute
evolved and became more of a utility I
have a different set of characteristics
and of course everybody wanted to take
advantage of the efficiency they wanted
to go and say you know make my legacy
cloudy and people would start sticking
their stuff on Amazon Amazon would have
an outage and they're all run around
saying the end of cloud is nigh to which
we go but shouldn't our architecture
evolve as well to which they would go
burn in heretic but the thing is our
architecture did evolve to take
advantage of those characteristics low
MTTR so we've built distributed systems
not scale up a scale out design for
failure chaos engines all that sort of
stuff
and they evolved and that standard
coevolution we now give it a name
DevOps when was that that was about
2008-2009 this sort of practice started
emerge before that but we gave it a name
and it was great and a new tribe was
formed of course there was resistance
from the past because of their past
practice that always creates inertia and
the new tribe was formed and we talked
about how it's all marvelous it's all
about
user needs measurement iterative cycles
automation collaboration all that good
stuff
and of course people go but so was ITIL
and we'd go burn em heretic that sort of
thing it's fairly standard well anyway
the same is going on with platform now
so platform is very much in the product
space it was all about product stacks
lamp stack netstat whatever it happens
to be it's now shifting to a much more
utility environment so what we would
call code execution environmental
service and so we're getting in a new
emerging architectural practice built on
top of that and that's just standard
coevolution it's happened in
manufacturing happen in finance it's
happened to all sorts of industries and
it recently happened to us with DevOps
so that's what you should be investing
focus on utility platform environments
like service and and focus on the novel
emerging practices which were not quite
a hundred percent sure what they will be
but can we take a guess and what these
new emerging practices will be well I
can because though it's an unexplored
area I happen to have built zim key and
so we went through this so I can tell
you what happened and most of this the
change of characteristic was related to
the obscurity of cost so to explain I
had a project called large format
printer a particular client they wanted
to sell large numbers of these machines
they cost about two thousand euros a pop
problem is it's the usual sort of thing
we're sitting down they want to write a
contract specification I know what's
gonna happen we're Agrius specification
we're going build something and then
we'll end up fighting and arguing over
the specification rather than focusing
on what we should be doing which is
selling large format printers so what I
did was introduced a system of Worth
based development so the client what
they really wanted was need their leads
lots of them so what did the customer
need they wanted to test a printer so we
needed a testing at
ocation they need to find out about the
printers so we need a microsite we
needed a platform to build this all on
and we needed some sort of distribution
mechanism so when they test out the
printer they would get a print and it
would tell them all the wonderful
benefits of spending several thousand
euros and buying one that was great
distribution mechanism as well we had
flows in this very simple there's
financial flows other forms of capital
from one node to another which means we
can add metrics conversion rates
indirect cost per distributed print the
sword 2005-2006 but there was a problem
and the problem was the platform was the
stepwise non variable component what
does I mean by that I mean that we had
to spend a bunch of money building this
environment so I had to invest a chunk
and of course if it became popular we
might need a different architecture so
there was gonna be a stepwise jump so
you have to do lots of scenario planning
and there's lots of risk-taking involved
well one of the beauties about it
becoming a platform is it all becomes
functional as a utility platform it's
all functional costs so it smooths out
your investment so what you start to
discover is that by shifting to service
environment in not only enables things
like Worth based development which is an
entire different way of doing business
which is fantastic it also suddenly
creates financial value for refactoring
because what we discovered back then was
that we'd have these big code bases and
it was two or three functions within the
code base which was consuming most of
our resource and cost we'd never been
able to see that granularity of
information before so rather than
investing saying marketing it turned out
more financially viable often to invest
in refactoring so it changed that whole
approach to how we actually did
development and then we started
monitoring different by flow of
financial value within the system and of
course
having a platform a utility platform
accelerated the speed at which we
developed code reuse I mean the past we
always have the promise of code reuse
but not really much of the reality this
change that and so that's what's going
on with this whole space at the moment
and you will expect to see the sort of
billion dollar company built which all
it does is provide one function to other
people anyway so we're starting to see
already a new tribe form combining sort
of financial skills and engineering
skills in that space it's very early
stages doesn't even have its own meme
yet I mean people talk about things like
no ops and all the rest of it they're
the wrong memes we have we haven't got a
title for it yet they'll eventually
figure out and of course we're gonna
have a notion to this change caused by
you know the legacy architectural
practices they all have inertia in terms
of infrastructure architectural
practices in terms of coding they're
gonna have inertia to this change even
DevOps itself because it's less visible
it's lower behind the line people have
made success in this space they're gonna
have a notion of course they're gonna
try know in that space say oh we're
going to evolve but the new generation
the new tribe oh it's like a child isn't
it the new child appear it says to the
parents I'm nothing like you I'm
different even though I have inherited
genes from you I didn't really inherit
genes from you I'm totally different we
did it with ITIL because if you say
DevOps is a future legacy the normal
response is burning heretic tribes got a
tribe so quick summary and strategy is
an iterative cycle it's not a nice
linear path it's a constant process of
acting through acting you actually learn
about an environment movement is an
essential part for learning but it's
also important to understand the
landscape as you go along don't shower
ping described it as crossing the river
by feeling the stones have a purpose and
direction you take small step
you understand more about the
environment than you take more steps by
doing that you start to discover common
economic patterns in common forms of
doctrine and common forms of game play
those game plays a context-specific
they're doctoring a universal the
economic patterns occur from one
landscape to another apply those
patterns to something like what's going
on with compute yes we had coevolution
of practice with the activity and DevOps
we're now going to see the same thing
occur within the platform space and of
course we're gonna have inertia and
that's perfectly normal
that's just how things develop learning
more about maps by the way all of this
stuff is Creative Commons
how many Creative Commons 12 years ago I
assumed everybody else in the world was
mapping I subsequently discovered it
took me about five to six years to
discover that people actually didn't
understand their landscape which was
quite shocking we're starting to mat
camps well I say we're starting to do
Matt camps I tweeted I was going to be
in London anybody want to know learn how
to map and within a couple of hours a
hundred volunteers create an entire
conference which was really nice of them
our wonderful community effort
fortunately sold out and we also the
company I work for provides some online
training our video courses it's like
seventy-five dollars or something as the
discount code takes about two weeks for
you to learn the basics of mapping so
that's me thank you
