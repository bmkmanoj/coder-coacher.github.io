leadership matters and I guess for other
interests I'd be interested to see who
we have in the room so I'd like to get
you to put your hand up if you consider
yourself an engineer or a developer okay
if you're maybe a tech lead or an
engineering manager some sort some sort
of architect maybe some higher-level
management like a CTO or something like
that okay cool so what I hope to do
today is really talk about why some of
these roles are really important if
you're an engineer I guess maybe one of
the questions that you'll be asking
yourself is why would I want to move
away from being a developer an engineer
and what is this a result of that if
you're an existing sate lead or
engineering manager or higher up I guess
the question is well why does it matter
so much and how more importantly can a
very effective as a technical lead or
leader in my organization just as a
reminder there's an app so it'd be great
if you could rate this presentation at
the end or if you have questions
there'll be some time at the end to be
able to ask a couple of those questions
so I work for thought works some of you
may know us we publish a radar which is
kind of a trend of what we see
throughout the industry through our
clients it's kind of a pinion rated view
of what trends we're seeing throughout
the world and we kind of I guess known
for publishing things around continuous
delivery in the lean enterprise and some
of our luminaries like Martin Fowler and
Jim Highsmith as employee of thought
works I work as a sort of architect or a
tech lead and one of my passions is
really around building out the next
generation of technical leaders so this
is actually a topic that's really close
to my heart as a background I'm sort of
java.net and ruby developer done some
sort of JavaScript stuff and I still
dabble in writing code and I guess this
is one of my kind of interesting points
of being both of these sort of positions
of both being an influencer and building
out leaders but also still being in
developers from some level and I guess
the first question is well what is it
that happens if we don't actually have
technical leadership
so maybe you can think about some of
maybe the teams or environments that
you've worked in and think about an
instance where perhaps there was a lack
of technical leadership I guess one of
the benefits of consulting is that we
see lots of different organizations
clients and I've definitely worked with
lots of teams some may be very
functional
so maybe less this funk more
dysfunctional and some of the classic
sort of symptoms I see about a lack of
technical leadership perhaps things when
you get five persistence frameworks from
the same application perhaps things like
three different types of automated tests
from test frameworks maybe five parallel
branches or even worse even more one per
developer and maybe even a hand-rolled
source control system who's seen some of
these things on their sort of projects
or applications okay so the question is
well what was missing in that sort of
environment and actually this sort of
situation all happened on the same sort
of project so kind of scary if you're
actually working on that and some of the
hands in this kind of room have maybe
indicated it's not really the only time
that this sort of thing this sort of
lack of leadership actually happens and
a tweet that I sort of captured a while
ago that captures this is really from an
ex colleague of mine called Julian boot
and he talks about I had 10 guys in my
last project all of them had opinions
and all of them were expressed in the
code base so maybe you can think about
all the arguments amongst the developers
that you've worked with that tabs were
spaces curly braces on the same line or
not small stylistic things and then
amplifying that to the way that people
actually solve problems as well the
tools that they use we're very
passionate about tools we're a bit sort
of fashioned frenzied about what what
the latest tool is and if we're actually
using that and a lot of that contributes
to this sort of conflict that we have on
the teams and this is where we need
actually strong technical leadership
around guiding teams to be heading in
the same direction so the analogy that I
tend to use is that when we work on
building software we're building
software for a purpose so there's a
reason for that software and as much as
we try to get people to understand what
that goal is so whether or not it's an
internal application
it's a API or some sort of platform
service that our internal developers are
using or an external product there's
some business reason why that software
exists and in today's sort of ecosystem
it's very hard to actually be a solo
developer even though it's the smallest
startups you'll end up with at least a
team of five people very rapidly
there's too many sort of technology
technologies and surface areas that we
need to take care of if we think about
mobile offline if we're talking out so
the physical clients or Hardware server
side that we can't actually do all of
this ourselves and so we kind of
necessitate having to work with our
people because we need to have a whole
bunch of skills and when we sort of talk
about what we're actually trying to
deliver what often happens in sort of my
experience is that people start moving
in two different directions so maybe you
can think about some of the teams where
you saw some the dysfunction and you
might have a developer who's excited
about using the latest and greatest tool
or library or framework you know I hear
Facebook just published a news for the
MPM sort of package manager you'll have
some developer who wants to use that
other people might treat the project as
it's a time for me to actually you know
use an interesting algorithm to solve
this challenging problem other people
will be about you know maybe spiking out
and exploring new technologies and
you'll have other developers who are
really focused on delivering what you're
trying to do and so the biggest
influence that we can have when we're
thinking about technical leadership is
thinking about how divergent are we in
sort of development teams about moving
towards in the same direction and so
maybe the color area is when we're
actually thinking about this team of
people that we have we want to be
thinking about what are the actions that
we have that are sort of slowly guiding
people towards the same way there's no
single way that you can actually talk to
people about here's what the goal is
there is no single chance that you can
sort of say I've emailed the goal of
this project out now you should all
understand it
people are very complicated and when you
step into leadership positions you'll
appreciate that people have different
styles of communication other people
will prefer to have maybe one-to-one
conversations and you'll need to read
that message several times other people
will sort of prefer having sort of
written communications rather than
talking about things all the time some
people don't even deal with words they
prefer visuals and so when we're
actually thinking about hurting sort of
the team towards this goal we need to be
thinking about not just a single way of
making sure that happens but actually
thinking about how we're sort of
encouraging people multiple times over
time towards the same different goal I
think a key part as well is that
software systems evolve according to the
sort of environment in which were
working as well and you know the goal of
a system say the very beginning of a
system will actually change over time as
well a really good example is when you
sort of follow sort of startups where
you know the goal is probably trying to
find the right market fit trying to
attract the right sort of customers
where at some certain point you're going
to have to think about scaling
performance and then actually making
their actually work at an infrastructure
level as well and so what you start off
with as an initial goal for software
will actually change over time you know
as more people use your system security
will become an even more important
aspect and Owen gave a really great talk
about you know building security and
from the start earlier in this track and
you know more of that will actually be
more important as your sort of customer
base queries and this is where as sort
of technical areas we need to be
thinking about not just that sort of end
state as a single starting point but
actually how evolves over time as well
and what we're doing to sort of slowly
nudge people towards the current set of
goals so my hypothesis is around
thinking about technical leadership
matters we've kind of explored what
happens if we have a missing amount of
technical leadership we end up with too
much complexity and that really just
gets in the way and the way that I often
explain this to people particularly
developers thinking about moving into
leadership roles it's thinking about
perhaps the difference of what you
actually control in your day-to-day work
so as a developer and I know this you
know you will go to your sort of
computer you might even get to pair
program with somebody so you might check
out some code you'll you know probably
have some sort of feature or some sort
of bug to sort of work on
and then you will be sort of writing
code and maybe tests and trying to sort
of get that sort of functionality
working so you're sort of sphere of
control is kind of the code that you
actually write from you're sort of
computer and you know there's a lot of
things that I hear about developers when
you work with teams and one of the
biggest things is this thing about oh
there's things in our environment that
just get in the way you know are there's
people that are constantly interrupting
me to ask me about this sort of
information there's maybe challenges
about disagreements from other
developers about how you might approach
this problem and there are things that
as a developer you feel are outside of
your control but you get to control the
code that you write and this is about
thinking about how much impact you have
and maybe trading off how much influence
you have as well so as a developer the
impact that you have is in terms of the
business functionality or the impact
that your code has but maybe your
influence is a lot less limited because
you can only really talk to the team
that you have or maybe the other people
that you have social connections within
your organization when you think in
terms of being a leader a tech leader of
some sort your perspective actually
changes quite a lot so you know probably
one of the biggest jokes I guess in our
industry is that when people sort of
move into leadership positions as this
whole thing about being post technical
and that's because there's a whole bunch
of other things that get in the way and
if you're a sort of tech leader of some
sort you won't be able to write as much
code as part of your day-to-day work you
might be able to do that for some time
but it won't be a sustainable amount of
time and one of the reasons for this is
that suddenly you're thinking about more
than just the code you're thinking about
the team and the environment in which
that sort of code is working and so
you're sort of deliverable about what
you're actually trying to work on isn't
necessarily about the code that you
write but it's actually thinking about
the collective code that the team that
you're working with is actually
responsible for and so one of the really
great analogies is thinking about you're
not really coding about you know the
code that you write isn't really so
important as the code that your team
writes and you get to sort of program
through say your team rather than you
individually writing every single line
of code and the biggest shift here is
that sort of mental shift from the doing
to the enabling and this is where the
biggest thing is thinking about how you
amplify your impact as a tech lead so
what are the things that you can do that
help your developers get more effective
sometimes this is about navigating
conflict within your team sometimes this
is about exploring perhaps several ideas
that your team has about solving the
right problem sometimes it's about
creating enough space for your to the
engineering team to bow to explore and
learn new technologies so they become
more effective and an individual
developer might complain about lack of
that sort of maybe time to explore new
technologies but as a tech leader you're
really trying to think about how you
sort of carve out some of this time and
what you do to actually enable your
developers should be more effective so
we can do things around the alignment to
make sure that everyone's heading the
same direction but we can also do things
to sort of help amplify the
effectiveness of our developers and this
is the bigger shift is that you have
less individual impact on the codebase
but you have broader influence and this
is what we're kind of trading off as we
move into more technical leadership
roles there is something about this
though that we need to be thinking about
that we have a responsibility when we
have more influence and this is a little
bit of a warning because I have seen
many situations where technical
leadership is like the analogy of water
where water is this sort of sustaining
kind of liquid that we kind of need in
order to survive but in the wrong sort
of situation the wrong quantities you
know it can be dangerous as well so we
can maybe drown in water or maybe we
have too much salt water and not enough
and I want to sort of share an
experience that I saw at a client of
mine I was working on a team quite
separate to them but near enough to hear
what was actually going on and for me it
was a really sort of good example about
what not to do in a technical leadership
role so once upon a time there was a
team and there was a team with a lead
architect who was sort of the tech lead
for this tee
and this tech lead wanted to introduce a
really exciting new technology which at
that time was sort of key-value store
databases so the application or platform
that they had had a huge scaling problem
and you know instead of using the
relational database which is theorized
as the the bottleneck for the
performance problem they said you know
what we need to do is we need to
redevelop the entire application using a
key value store because we'll be a lot
faster there will scale a lot faster and
you know this is the thing that we need
to actually invest in the sort of
architect was able to convince the
business to invest in this sort of
proposition and ended up sort of carving
out a small team of two developers who
would sort of maintain the old system on
the relational database where he would
sort of gather the team around him and
lead them to building this new key value
store now in an ideal world this sounds
like a really fantastic proposition
right so performance problem there's a
real business benefit as a team we can
understand the purpose of that and if
you've read any of dan dan Pink's Drive
book you know master autonomy in purpose
are things that people want to have in
order to be happy at work and so having
a really strong purpose around having a
business benefit doing something really
exciting when you in technology is
really appealing thing for us to do as
developers what was interesting was I
guess some of the timelines are honest
so eight months later this team was
still redeveloping this relational
database into this sort of key value
store you know they obviously had sort
of production problems with the existing
sort of system and new features would be
added all the time so they would have to
also think about how they migrated those
existing sort of new features to the new
platform and unfortunately at some point
you know they ended up doing some more
performance testing and actually worked
out this new platform they developed
wasn't any more performant than the
existing system so they hadn't actually
worked out what the bottleneck was and
the organization ended up canceling the
project now if you're as a developer
thinking about the impact of your
individual work you've just spent eight
months of your time
writing some software that just got
thrown away and this is a big lesson for
us to have as tech leads is that when we
have this influence and impact on the
team we need to also be careful about
what we do with this sort of authority
and influence that we have and this is
where the biggest thing is thinking
about how your technical vision matters
so when you're thinking about what that
goal is you're thinking about is it
actually useful goal and what can I do
to actually test to make sure it's
actually working the other thing is as a
tech lead you need to be careful about
not wanting to implement your technical
vision yourself so a lot of your sort of
role is away from doing and enabling I
worked with another tech lead very
earlier in my career and I should say it
was quite a scarring experience in sort
of my life and it's something that I
really hold in my regard about what not
to do is a sort of tech lead so we had a
team of really bright developers really
excited building a new sort of sort of
client application process that would
take in sort of complex forms and then
they would be able to post that process
the applications to understand whether
or not their clients would actually fit
the sort of registration process and
they totally did have this wonderful
idea about introducing really rigorous
functional programming and objects in
such a way that you know it was quite
different from maybe your typical say
MVC style that was very popular with say
Spring Framework at a time but what was
interesting is that you know we'd work
on stories we get to build features and
then we would go home and the next day
we would come in and kind of recognize
something about the codebase that it'd
be completely refactored overnight how
would you feel as a developer if you
sort of had this sort of feedback not
direct but indirect through the codebase
that the code that you'd written wasn't
good enough and it was going to be
rewritten in a style that was completely
abstract you and this is where you know
your technical vision isn't really about
you implementing this it's really about
you helping your team understand and
giving your team the skills such that
they can help implement that vision and
you can imagine what the effect was with
the rest of the developers as we started
to write more code is
we knew in the evening the Tet lead
would end up rewriting all of this code
so do you think we sub take care about
code quality we still did we still
wanted to write tests but you know we
understood what would actually happen
and so this is a warning for us as Tet
leads not to fall into that trap of
wanting to do everything for ourselves
so what makes a good tech lead and I
guess this is you know a good question
to ask how would you boil it down into a
single question for me one of mine is
really thinking about does the codebase
look like it was written by a single
person
so it'll never ever happen I know this
from a fact but if you can imagine
squinting a little bit where the code
gets a little bit fuzzy and maybe you
can start to see the shape of that code
what you're really looking for is is
there similarities across the codebase
even the code that we write ourselves
over maybe a three year period we will
learn things as we go and we'll
hopefully improve the way that we write
code but the most important thing is
thinking about as your team is writing
how consistent are they as a whole unit
around working out code that kind of
looks very similar now I've done a lot
of sort of training around sort of tech
leadership internally to our company we
run a yearly program around building
skills for new tech leaders and one of
the biggest questions that we often have
with developers looking at more senior
roles is is the architect or a tech lead
the only role that you can have in order
to stay technical so you'll have you
know the post technical track which
engineers maybe don't want to have and
then the question is well what other
opportunities are there for people if
they want to stay at angle and this is
where you know we want to really talk
about leadership not just leaders so not
just the people but what are the roles
and what impact are people having what's
the influencer and individual engineers
actually have how having so a quick test
for people and hopefully we can get some
good answers here who's this person here
okay Martin Fowler very good and
Martin's probably well known for
probably writing books on refactoring
writing articles about what's going on
in industry this person here Kathy
Sierra right
she just published a book called badass
making users awesome and also was
probably most famous for also starting
off the headfirst catalog of book around
sort of headfirst design patterns this
person here shouldn't be of any surprise
to people here hopefully Rebecca yeah
Wirth Brooks who's responsible or known
for responsibility driven design any
ideas here any closure people around so
Stuart Holloway who's probably most
known for talking about functional
programming but also one of the core
people about leading closure and I think
one of the interesting things about
industry is that technically leadership
doesn't necessarily need to be your
leading a development team and what's
interesting about people like the people
that I've sort of picked up on this sort
of slide is thinking about what impact
that they're having and influence that
they're having about encouraging people
to adopt really good practices so in a
lot of the organizations that we work in
one of the more popular sort of
practices that we see organizationally
is this idea around sort of a software
craftsmanship guild so bringing people
together in the organization around you
know being passionate about software as
a craft and a formal technical
leadership that people can have is by
simply creating that community in that
guild and getting people together at a
regular part those people aren't
necessarily the sort of architect or
tech leads of the teams that these
software engineers are in but what
they're doing is actually bringing
together a collective set of people to
learn from each other and to encourage
people to learn things you have
luminaries as well that are sort of
writing and publishing and getting
people to adopt you know new knowledge
there's one thing about our industry
that never changes and it's the fact
that there's always new tools and
technologies out there so there are
always new things for us to learn the
surface area of all those so different
plat
there's just too much for us to have and
so we need people that are also there
leading the way and encouraging people
to sort of learn about new things and
this is where I often say to people
everyone can be a leader regardless of
what role or title that you have so in a
lot of organizations the role of that
person bringing together that sort of
software guild isn't a person who is
maybe paid or given that extra title but
they do it because they're passionate
about it and this is where it's the big
difference between leadership and
leaders is that people who are
demonstrating leadership are doing it
and they're creating sort of a following
they want people to learn something
about you know some something that
they're passionate about and getting
people to to grow and learn they're not
given a title and although as a leader
when you're given a title you're
expected to demonstrate leadership I've
also seen a lot of people who take on a
title and they don't demonstrate
leadership but the key point here is
that everyone can be a leader regardless
of what title that you've actually been
given so if you are in engineering your
organization right now think about how
you can be an advocate show your passion
about things and gather like-minded
people and lead the way that makes a lot
easier for people one of the I guess
interesting ways of looking at the sort
of technical leadership role it's
thinking about maybe three different
elements to it so one of them is
thinking about the developer so as a
developer you know I would hope that
you'd be able to write clean code you'd
have good skills at being I'll try
automated tests but one of the things
that you want to have is thinking about
also your architecture so when you think
about architecture and not having the
architect role but you're thinking about
systems longer-term decisions not just
about the code structure that you're
writing but also maybe about the
environment in which that sort of system
is going to be sort of deployed and
operated and thinking about sort of
longer-term decisions about reducing the
overall cost of change or the overall
operating cost but a good balance of a
tech leader is thinking about three
elements and the final one is thinking
about the leader you're thinking about
maybe how you're communicating
things you're thinking about how you
gather other people around you to follow
a sort of topic that you're really
passionate about and if you're actually
leading development teams this is where
I'd be thinking about how much diversity
you have in teams there's been a lot of
studies recently that have sort of
talked about what makes a really great
team and one of the probably most
difficult things that we have in our
industry is the hiring process where
when we sort of talk about we want to
have people who are culturally fit we
also need to be careful that that
looking for cultural fit doesn't remove
a certain type of diversity that you
want one of my most favorite books
around exploring different types of
diversity is this book called strengths
finder how many people have actually
done this book okay it's quite a few if
you haven't I recommend doing it I love
all sort of personality self-assessment
type models they're all broken but
really interesting the StrengthsFinder
book was written by some people from the
Gallup Organization and the Gallup
Organization does say huge amounts of
surveys across large organizations over
a long period of time so they have a lot
of data and one of the interesting
things that they sort of picked up was
sort of traits that made people
successful at the roles they do and they
kind of came up with about 34 different
signature strengths and what was really
interesting about it is that the people
who are more successful tend to focus a
lot more in their strengths rather than
focusing on weaknesses so you know when
you're thinking about personal
development when you're thinking about
growth you might be thinking about what
are the areas that I'm actually not so
good at and so I want to get better at
that and if there's still some worth in
looking at those areas where you know if
you're really not good at it and it's
damaging maybe you're working in
environment your relationships with
other people at work or your code you
want to address that but a lot of your
time will often be spent much better
thinking about where you can apply your
strengths so as an example I've picked
up some sort of strengths here and it's
quite interesting to have a look at them
so the first one here is woo it stands
for winning others over apparently it's
a very small percentage of the
population only 2% of people have it but
you might know people that are like this
so a really good example about people
with woo is that so to take them into a
group of people that they have never
really
Matt and probably after five minutes
they vanish convince everyone to do
something that they wanted to have or to
convince somebody that this thing is a
really great idea this is a strength of
Lou you might know other people who have
the strength of analytical where they're
really thinking about all the
possibilities of things that might go
wrong you might explain a problem to
somebody and they can think about ten
different ways immediately about how you
might solve that problem because they're
really thinking about all the different
possibilities you might know people who
are activators and activators are people
that can sort of excite tell the people
that get started I see a lot of those
people in sort of startups or new
initiatives and sometimes they're not
necessarily people that complete things
which is why you might need an achiever
which is a person that's really focused
on sort of getting a sense of progress
about getting things done you might have
people who are have that strength or
intellection where they really want to
think deeply and philosophically about
is this thing the right thing to solve
and then you also have people who are
maybe got the strategic strength which
was thinking about long-term advantages
so not what we're going to be doing this
week or tomorrow but really thinking
about what's the possibility of a year
or two years I have a sense I don't
really know this but I would say that
ela must probably has a very strategic
kind of viewpoint when it's thinking
about putting you know people on Mars
and then you have people who might have
that strength the input which is about
collecting information from lots of
different sources in order to validate
stuff
and as a tech lead one of the
interesting things that you might learn
about understanding people's strengths
is that everyone's really different as a
result it can be both a source of
conflict but it can also be a really
great way of actually building a really
strong team you know as an individual
you will not have all of these strengths
I do not have all of these strings I
mean you'll have them in certain degrees
but you will not be strong at all of
these different elements and when you do
this book there's like a survey where
you'll get those sort of top five
signature strengths and your best bet is
actually thinking about who are the
other people that you can work with who
have very different strengths from you
right so if you don't have this winning
others over type strengths
you will probably want to have somebody
on your team that has that real sort of
salesman ability that can convince
people that this thing is the right
thing to do if you have a whole team of
people who are intellection only your
team will probably never deliver
anything useful so you need some people
who have you know that sense of
achievement and needing to get some
progress and as a tech lead what you're
really trying to do is try to get a
overlap of different people across your
team to make sure that you have
different strengths in your team because
you'll need different things at
different times you know you don't also
want a whole team of achievers if what
they're doing is sort of cutting corners
in order to get things done you
sometimes need intellection people or
analytical people if say you're dealing
with really highly secured sort of
application where you really need to be
rigorous around the types of risks that
you take and so there are different
circumstances that we need to deal with
which is why we really want to lean on
diversity and this isn't just a
theoretical sort of thought of mine
there's been a lot of studies around the
results of diversity this one was a
little bit older which was in sort of
2012 was talking about company
performance and the decision-making
ability of the board and what was sort
of made up and what that what they were
talking about is that if there was at
least some female representation on the
board they would outperform so an
all-male board would sort of return
approximately 12% on equity but with a
single sort of female representation you
get four percent extra so it's 16
percent return on equity and this
applies to all forms of diversity if you
want to learn more about this a really
highly recommended book is called the
difference it's written by a professor
at the University of Michigan called
Scott page and he talks about what makes
diversity work and why why is it that we
actually care about it when we were
talking about the strengths finder book
I talked before about diversity can be a
source of conflict and you know if we
think back to the ten different opinions
and ten or all ten were expressing the
codebase that's also a way that we can
actually create a lot of conflict and so
when we're actually thinking about what
makes it effective
it's got page
with the formula it's about the
performance of the team or the
collective accuracy of the group kind of
relates to the average accuracy of the
group and diversity so what that means
is you know we don't really want to have
a whole round a bunch of people on on
those sort of streets suddenly writing
software we kind of need to have a basis
of people who know how to write software
to begin but you know what we don't want
to have is all software people who are
maybe very traditional Java you know
Enterprise Edition and just have that
maybe we want to have some people who
have a functional background people who
have maybe done some JavaScript or Ruby
people who've had so maybe experiences
with event sourcing and as a result you
increase the diversity of the group but
what you need to have is some ability to
sort of integrate these ideas so as a
tech lead you know you can't just
unleash a whole bunch of random people
and expect amazing results what you
really want to do is you want to have
people feel safe and vulnerable to talk
about their ideas and approaches and to
be able to understand which may be
combination of those approaches actually
make the best sentence so if 100 you
know really bad ideas and some of them
are good we might be able to pick out
the top five of those ideas put them
together and actually end up where
they're even stronger problem solving
approach and this is kind of the formula
that Scott kind of talks about it's not
enough just to have lots of diversity
but we need some way of actually
bringing them together and out a
solution so one of my most favorite
techniques as a sort of tech lead is
running sort of set design so if you're
familiar with lean set design is kind of
talking about thinking how you approach
a problem from multiple angles so you
might allocate say an afternoon to solve
a particular problem you give maybe a
few people an opportunity to come up
with a way to solve that problem either
through a whiteboard or some sort of
creating exercise and then you get
people to demonstrate the result often
each one of those solutions will have
problems of their own but as a
collective you might have some
interesting ways of solving that problem
that individually people didn't think of
but then you can sort of collectively
merge together to solve whatever
technical problem that you actually
have so we're kind of starting to tap
into the diversity of the
problem-solving but we're working out
ways of then integrating that into our
final approach and this is what as a
tech lead you're really thinking about a
lot just thinking about the team culture
that you're trying to encourage and the
sort of togetherness of the group that
you have when I'm thinking about from a
technical perspective about team culture
I'd be looking for things like how long
does my build stay broken so you know if
nobody cares about that build and they
just keep checking code into sort of
source control how long will it take for
you to actually fix and find that
problem that you that's causing that so
I want to be thinking about my team and
how responsive they are actually solving
broken builds I want to be thinking
about how often people avoid conflict so
I've worked on one sort of dysfunctional
team where you would have one developer
who would check out code run auto format
and check code back in and you would
have another developer doing exactly the
same thing but with a completely
different style and checking that back
in so you're kind of looking for team
smells around what's happening in your
codebase that sort of help you
understand people aren't comfortable
talking about this and this is where
your influence can actually have a
positive effect about saying hey I
noticed that we have two different
styles we seem to be having a lot of
noise in our kit logs and maybe we need
to talk about this and agree as a group
how we move forward I want people to
offer new ideas and you know if people
aren't passionate about learning about
their own sort of sort of tools
technologies then bring that into the
work environment that tells me something
about the team culture that I have that
it's not open to new ideas that perhaps
that every time that somebody has
offered what about this maybe they're
being shot down by somebody else and say
oh that's a really stupid idea I really
want to be careful about what that
environment is and I'd be looking to see
how often people are actually offering
these new ideas I want people to flag do
they need help and if you're working and
say sort of agile teams where stand-ups
are very big norm one of the big
telltale signs that I have is that you
know when you have some people come to
stand up and say I've been working on
this task I'm almost done and then it's
the next day and they talk about that so
tasks I'm almost done and they go on for
another maybe two more days when you
think about almost done taking more than
four days so it's probably a symptom
that they're probably saying actually I
probably need some help but I haven't
felt comfortable asking for that and
that tell you something about the team
that you've sort of created or you're
encouraging finally I'd be thinking
about do people feel safe to admit when
they're wrong now the most powerful
thing that you can do as Italy it is
actually admitting when you made a
mistake because it creates a sense of
vulnerability that it's okay to make
mistakes
you'd rather that people tell the whole
team that something went wrong earlier
so that you can actually fix it
rather than sort of hiding it and trying
to fix those problems on the fly as you
go so my theory is that everyone can be
a leader and if you're playing this role
of being a tech lead the question is how
do you enable it such that everyone can
be a leader one of my most favorite
methods is thinking about what I call
The Forgotten agile methodology of
feature driven development so it's maybe
one of the lesser sort of spoken-- one
of the ideas in feature driven
development is this idea of feature
teams it's something that I guess you're
seeing a little bit more today around
say capabilities around microservices
where that micro service and the team
will be focused around say a feature or
capability as such similar sort of idea
and what you're really thinking about is
when you're sort of leading this team is
you really want to be thinking about how
do you encourage other people to sort of
take on leading maybe the design and all
the quality attributes associated with
that sort of feature area and sort of
architecture style and how do you sort
of distribute that to different people
so how do you encourage people to do
that and this is where I often create
the role of a kind of a feature lead so
we still a sort of a team of some sort
but as an architect you don't really
have to think about all the
possibilities all the time you want
everyone else thinking about all the
other possibilities and all the quality
attributes you need to take care of and
so I would often encourage people to
sign up for sort of features to lead the
design and responsibility of it and then
as a sort of overall sort of tech lead
I'm trying to provide them the right
level of support such that they can
actually achieve that successfully so
for some new people to the industry they
may not be able to actually you know
understand performance security
scalability requirements very early on
so you might need to work more closely
with those people but other times you'll
have really senior engineers who
understand and can play that where you
can be a lot more hands-off and so this
is where you want to think about you
know how much can you actually tell
people what to do or not and sometimes
you can but there's a bit of a
disclaimer on that this is where I kind
of talked about the situational
leadership model so it's an old model
that talks about how you engage with
people depending on the task and the
skill at hand right so we kind of start
off with this idea about directing
behavior and supporting behavior and a
really good example is that when you
have people fresh out of university
they're really excited to maybe write
new software they really want to do
something but they don't have that
experience so they don't have that
know-how how to achieve stuff and this
is where you might be able to break
things down into smaller steps and
you're sort of telling them here is how
you might go about solving that problem
over time you sort of want to help
people you know they might develop some
skill and then you're trying to help
them understand why that problems an
important one to solve and ideally and
this is the kind of weird inverse
relationship of that arrow is that you
want to get to a point where you are
simply delegating things where you know
that they had that skill well you have
that confidence and they're motivated to
do things as well so this model kind of
talks about which mode that you'd
actually operate with sorry so for
instance if somebody has a lot of skill
but they don't know how to approach a
problem you might actually want to
interact with them as well so you might
need to sit down with them pair design
on some sort of attribute and then sort
of help them understand what needs to be
done and then you can maybe move away
and this is one of I guess the keys of
how you scale yourself as a technical
leader so you're thinking about how you
improve your sort of influence and less
of that actually doing things yourself
so in terms of thinking about concluding
thoughts once again one of the biggest
reasons why you want to think about
having technical leadership
as you're sort of having this idea of
trade-off between impact and influence
is that as I developer you'll only have
a certain level of impact through the
code that you write still really
exciting I still love doing it myself
you get to solve problems but at the
same time when you take on technical
leadership roles you're sort of having
more influence about broader things
about enabling the code that your whole
team can write or even more the
organization that you're sort of working
for can write one of the biggest things
is thinking about being this sort of
bridge between impact and influence and
you know this role of a tech leaders
thinking about enabling all the
developers that you have and acting as a
bridge to helping them become more
effective technical leaders so my key
message for you is really thinking about
technical leadership is an important
thing we really need to be thinking
about what we do with the sort of
responsibility and we can do it for good
or we can do it for bad so think about
what impact that you have and spend time
explicitly doing this if you're a
developer moving into this role think
about maybe there's more influence that
you can have and the greater impact that
the software system that you write will
have rather than the future that you
actually have where acting is a sort of
bridge between sort of the binary world
and the sort of technical world and it's
a really hard skill for us actually
development to find that right level of
balance the good thing is you probably
have a whole bunch of people here that
are really interested in it so you can
probably talk to other people about how
they approach it and the biggest
takeaway is technical leadership does
matter thank you
