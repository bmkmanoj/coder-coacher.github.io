trying to get a V to work is the non
simple part I guess well thanks very
much appreciate being invited to kick
off this new conference and thanks
everybody for coming a little bit more
about about sort of me I got a look you
know the headline which was that you
know a few years ago I helped Netflix do
cloud native architecture in particular
than the theme of this conference I've
done many talks while I was at Netflix
on cloud native architecture and on
micro services and on the migrations and
things like that for the last two almost
two and a half years I've been working
at a venture capital firm Battery
Ventures and in that role I'm looking
for interesting new companies and also
interesting new end users the big
companies that are trying to learn these
new architectures and learning how to
scale and learning how to build out new
style systems and figuring out what does
their technology stack look like and how
can we engage with them so if you're a
developer if you're working at a
start-up I'm interested to hear about
that and what you're working on if you
need money if we were VC firm we invest
in people but also if you're a large
end-user and you've got some interesting
problems and you're evaluating lots of
different products you know open-source
projects or project products from
companies very interested to know what
those are so I'll be around probably all
the rest of today and most of tomorrow
and just happy to to engage I also spent
a lot of time giving talks internal
talks at companies so you know if I'm
around wherever you're based I can I can
drop in but also I can do video
conferences and things like that so if
you're internally you're trying to
convince your management or your
architecture team okay this is what a
cloud native microservices architecture
should look like I'm happy to spend an
arrow to chatting to you about that
later on okay so
this talks called it's simple and so
let's start with an interesting question
here all right this is a fairly
complicated question right so what's the
answer well it's got a very simple
answer so now if you just say the word
42 near people they know that that's the
answer to this incredibly complicated
questions it's become a a little
reference point it's a shorthand for
this big long complicated question so
that's interesting so I'm talking a
little bit about things that we see as
complicated and things that we are see
as simple and how what is the real
difference in that because life is
obviously very complicated but we reduce
it to simple things and simple
abstractions to deal with it so the so
the real what this talk is really about
is figuring out what are the
abstractions that make your life simple
and how do you find those abstractions
what do they look like and what are some
of the things that we already do which
are actually insanely complicated but we
do without even thinking about it and so
when somebody says it's too complicated
what do they really mean this is kind of
what I think it means there's too many
moving parts and I can't tell what it's
going to do next right that's like
that's what you really are thinking when
you're thinking it's it's too
complicated all right if you if you
spend enough time with something then
you understand the moving parts and you
start to get intuition on how it's going
to behave and things start to look
simple so let's just ask a question
what's the most complicated thing that
you can deal with without even thinking
about it driving yeah so think about
that just about everybody in society you
expect them to be able to drive a car
cars are incredibly complicated driving
across the city is incredibly
complicated there's all the other
drivers if you sort of drop an alien or
somebody from a culture that doesn't
have cars and you sit them in a car and
say okay just drive across Stockholm
it's insanely complicated and you can do
it well you know listening to a podcast
you know eating something drinking your
coffee barely thinking and you just end
up where you at at work or wherever
right so how did how did that happen and
what where how do we get that level of
complexity under control so that we get
it so just be totally baked into society
if you go back a hundred years cars were
complicated no one knew how to deal with
them you have to have somebody walking
in front with a red flag in case it
fronted frightened the horses all of
those kinds of stories of course some of
us do actually have complicated cars I
have an old car that I take two car
shows and I won a contest I won this
category the needlessly complicated
Italian category in a comp in a contest
called the concours the lemons which is
held in California every summer that's
my wife and that's my car
the cars are Citroen SM which isn't
actually even an Italian car turns out
none of the Italian cars made it to the
conference to the show they all died or
didn't turn up or went somewhere else
and this was the nearest thing they
could find was an it was a French car
with an Italian engine in it and it is
actually needlessly complicated car has
hydraulic everything and it's amazingly
complicated so we have a lot of fun with
this thing trying to keep this car
running and taking it to car shows it's
a 1973 car and last time I went to take
it for somewhere actually it's break
stopped working so I had to turn around
and go back and get a different car so
you know we do sometimes have things
which aren't sort of you have to think
about them they're a little bit more
complicated but the more modern things
people have been working on the
interfaces to make it easier and easier
and more reliable and more dependable
and more predictable so what's another
thing you can think of that's incredibly
complicated that you just deal with
something you can give to your kids what
your kids spend all their time doing
their days yeah playing
I bet it was a situation I just after
the iPhone came out we had this amazing
new phone and and I was standing around
with a group of friends and I saw a
barbecue some dinner you know standing
around somebody's yard with with
drinking whatever and somebody was
holding his two-year-old daughter and
she mumbled something that didn't even
make sense to us and he got out the
phone gave it to her and she starts
searching YouTube for spongebob videos
and the rest of us like jaw drop this is
in 2008 right yeah the club had only
been out for a few months as like how
could you even do that how does she know
how to do that right
so if you just if you have any idea how
an iPhone actually works it's insanely
complicated right analog or iPhone
Android phone but modern smartphones
there's an incredible amount of
technology in the phone and in the
networks that support it and in the
applications that are on it and in the
backend services that support that and
then you can give it those pre verbal
children and they just reach into it and
do things it's incredible
alright so there's an abstraction there
that works how do you find those
abstractions of course if you take
somebody's eye somebody's phone and you
say let's say you pick up somebody
else's phone and it's unusable because
they've done this like this is my phone
I have all my icons on one page in
groups and you can't find anything
because everyone has customized their
phone with hundreds of applications in
hierarchies and whatever and so you take
something that was simple and now you've
turned it back to be complicated again
because you've customized it I know
where everything is but you know I pick
up my wife's phone and she has I have to
hunt around but just to find where's the
Google Maps gone or whatever then
there's this really interesting book
that came out last summer from Randall
Munroe who at xkcd thing it's planar he
uses only 1,000 words in the English
language the 1,000 most popular words in
the language to explain how things work
and if you look at this there's all
kinds of little boxes in here like a
thinking box is the CPU or something
like that right so he goes through and
he explains what is inside a phone in
in simple words you can actually see
some of that complexity so that's that's
just in our daily life right
we've got incredibly complicated things
that we've figured out how to use and
they've become baked into society as
simple things and some of them have a
bit more friction like learning to drive
is a complicated thing right you have to
pass the tests and then you get to the
iPhone where you just you give it to
somebody that has you can't even explain
what this thing is to them and they
intuitively figure out how to use it so
that's a whole nother level of intuition
that makes it easy to deal with
so that's attend our own lives so let's
think about work how do we simplify our
work where we you know the jobs we do
and obviously at Netflix we're well
known for this culture and there's a
book that a presentation that was put
out in 2009 which now has millions there
are tens of millions of views on on
SlideShare a freedom a responsibility
culture and you know as comment from
from Sheryl Sandberg one of the most
important documents ever came out of the
valley it's been hugely influential on
company cultures around the world and if
you're trying to start a company the one
of the real lessons here is you can only
really set a company culture when you're
small once you get big you can destroy
culture but it's very hard to create
culture turner's things like trust it's
very asymmetric if you're starting small
be very intentional about your class
your culture don't wait until the
company gets to a few hundred people
before you start being start thinking
about the culture you want be very
intentional very early and that sets up
sets you up for a successful way of
thinking so why is this related to
simplicity well here's here's one one
slide from this deck if you want to
build a ship don't drum up people to
gather wood divide the work and give
orders instead teach them to yearn for
the vast and endless sea right so you're
setting a goal right
we want this thing don't let everyone
figure out the details themselves of how
they get there right as long as everyone
is yearning for the vast and endless sea
you will end up with a boat you know if
they tell them to build a boat a boat
will magically appear out of the
collective behavior of the people who
have the goal you know Netflix is
basically its goal is to be the sort of
the future event of a video
entertainment right and all the things
needed to get there on a global basis
are just details we don't need to be
planned in fine-grain and imposed from
above there you know everyone
understands what the goal of Netflix is
and they can go figure out how to do it
one interesting thing the little prince
this is a French book by I can't even
pronounce his name Antoine de
saint-exupery I don't know I should
probably practice that Netflix just
licensed a video of that book to be on
Netflix sometime so you'll be able to
watch exactly it's al all sort of
science fiction a story but this is one
of the elements of it so if you're
building out a company and you're trying
to create these really Purpose Driven
companies then you know why doesn't
everyone do that well the problem is
what we have in in the world is a lot of
big companies big enterprises whereas
you get large groups of people you
basically there's at some point your
ability to trust everybody starts to go
down because you're organizing very
large groups of people and you have to
set up rules and processes that are
basically for running low trust
organizations you can see organizations
like Netflix as high trust organizations
across the whole organization just now a
few thousand people it's one of the
largest collectively high trust
organizations out there and one of the
reasons they're able to do that is
they're all in one location pretty much
that's our engineering is in one
location and they have a lot of internal
sharing of information and then they
have only one product they're trying to
build
so there's very little internal conflict
they're just you know they're not trying
to do you know thousands of other
different types of things a lot of
companies keep adding product lines
Netflix has a single service it's trying
to produce there's like complexity
behind that but that is deliberate it's
so that everyone's going for the same
goal right so once you have that
simplifying things you can
actually scale the company to be fairly
large but in most of the time you end up
with small groups of trusted people who
have low internal complexity they know
how everything works it's keep it simple
and then you have interfaces between
them but the problem with this is that
as soon as you put process as long as
you write down how you want to do
something it starts to drive away talent
because you're now saying okay we're
going to not trust anybody we're going
to assume you're stupid and we're going
to just say everyone has to do it this
way you all have to use this tool you'll
have to use this language you all have
to follow this release process because
we don't trust you to know a better way
of doing it and you start going to the
lowest common denominator and what
happens then is some of your best people
will just leave and go somewhere else
where they can do whatever they want to
do but probably try to find a new better
way of doing things and somebody once
asked me well you know I was talking
about they all overall are architecture
and say well we can't do that because we
don't have the talent that Netflix has
and I said well we hired them from you
that says what we got that we didn't
sort of make we don't have all of vats
where we breathe you know manufacture
Netflix Engineers they were all very
senior people who'd worked everywhere in
the industry and the reason they tended
up as Netflix as we got out of their way
we let them you build a system that
evolves and the the thing is here we're
not just building the best practice
system we're not saying I'm a I see this
mistake sometimes you're saying well
what how did Netflix do it okay let's
copy that like it's copied the tools
let's copy that process that's obviously
the best practice let's write that down
and make that our standard right that
you're actually missing the point you're
seeing a process is an artifact
over live system that's evolving Netflix
is evolving continuously and what
they've done is they built a systems
designed to evolve and at any point in
time it has a bunch of things that look
like processes but they're really just
artifacts of of the way you're looking
at it right and that there's an
underlying simplicity in the system's
thinking approach that they use and then
what looks like a complicated massive of
ad hoc processes on top are actually
being driven by this system
so there's I've talked a bit about
systems thinking there's a there's a
really good book on this by Jamshed
garage a day I'm having to practice his
name because I'm going to meet him this
summer and I got invited to a conference
he's running purposeful systems
representing the systems for your
developments have you talking about
purposeful systems like having a clear
purpose for your team right assumes pull
out pure reality in all three dimensions
so that means that you're assuming that
there isn't one way of doing things
things are allowed to evolve we're
trying to build companies and products
that are designed to evolve rather than
designed to be best in class or whatever
they're designed to be continuously
evolving which means that once you get
the system thinking right it's very hard
to tie it down if as soon as it's a
assuming plurality means that you're
allowing things to have multiple
functions you're allowing things to have
multiple processes as soon as you tie
something down to a single process or a
single function or a single structure
you're actually freezing it and you're
preventing it from evolving right so
this this is why it's uncomfortable to a
lot of people to go to a systems
thinking because they used to okay what
do I do next I don't have the rules to
follow you have to step back and put
yourself into the mindset of the system
and figure out what the next step is so
this is a different way of working when
it comes down to is these systems are
simple and flexible and very adaptive
and they evolve and when you write down
everything in rules it gets increasingly
complicated as you
to specify everything and it gets
increasingly rigid okay so most how many
people have an HR manual like a company
manual in a binder or on their cube like
a big fat ring binder and every now and
again you have to go on training on how
to you know do expenses right or
something like that that's pretty common
large company stuff Netflix doesn't have
that manual they have one phrase act in
Netflix best interest if you can
remember that phrase you are then
completely up to speed with all HR
training that's it
that's the expense policy that's the
policy for everything and if you don't
have a good enough judgement to
interpret that phrase to your current
situation then we don't when you're
working here it's so what you end up
with is a high trust organization we're
anis Everett you assume that everyone
has good judgment and can show you that
judgment and means you know everyone is
holding themselves to a very high
standard because they know that they are
being trusted and they are being that
they're being held to this this high
standard of judgment so it's a bit like
being on a sports team you know where
everyone the team has a piece to play
and somebody you know passes the ball to
you and you have to be in the right
place to catch it and you know you know
they're trusting that if they pass the
ball to you you're gonna be do the best
you can with that and not just be kind
of you know run around get it get it
screw it up and go in the wrong
direction or whatever right so the the
key thing here is that it's much it's
not a family or kapha culture it's more
like a sports team and you look at the
players in your team you say okay here's
here's some weak spots here's some
people we need to bring in and we always
want to steal the best people from the
other sports teams who are play you're
playing against right so that's that's
the mentality for this culture now that
culture works for companies like Netflix
who are fairly small and a sitting in
the middle of the Bay Area and their
talent pool there where they can and
they pay very well and they try to find
the best people it doesn't work so well
if you're say running large government
department where you can
lay people off because government
departments don't do that and you have
just the talent you've got so what I'm
seeing there is actually some
interesting amid that these
organizations also want to move faster
and they want to build in this kind of
new ideas so what we're seeing is the
formation of small cells of people like
a small group of people who internally
have high trust and know what they're
doing and own something and then have a
pis between those teams so let's talk
about the things we built and I'm just
gonna go straight to Conway's law
because what I just described is a small
cellular organization where a group of
people with high trust build a thing and
then there are many of these groups and
they connect to each other over api's or
interfaces or agreements which are
relative to the bount the boundary of
trust like I commit to you that I will
take you know 10,000 requests a second
against this API and it will return in
half a second and and I will be up so
much of the time right that is a trust
level an explicit trust commitment I
said you know and your API will evolve
with some discussion over some time and
you will be compatible for some period
of time those kinds of discussions don't
tell you anything about the internal the
internals of how that thing is built so
internally you can then iterate really
quickly so it turns out that Netflix was
already organized in these small cells
because that was the way we found was
the best way to organize and when you
build software in small cells you end up
building services and those services
talk to each other and it turns out this
is called micro services now but at the
time it was just the way we it made
sense to us to build this architecture
and so that's well one of the problems I
see with large enterprises is that they
try to get into this architecture
without forming these small cells so you
sometimes see people that will form a
devil if we have to see separate siloed
team
we hear we have to add this admin team
the developer team in the UX team and
the product team and they're all in
different buildings and scattered around
the world we need to go to DevOps work
write a DevOps team and we'll put them
here and this is not solving the problem
you're just creating yet another step
the right way to do this is to combine
people from all of the organization's
into one team that owns everything and
can deliver that thing and owns the
evolution of that thing and we were
going off this phrase from 2006 from
Werner Vogel's who built it you run it
because if you're changing something
really fast like 10 times a day a
hundred times a day you have time to
have meetings with operations about how
to run it you can't do that ten times a
day right that works if you're releasing
every few weeks or every few months but
if you're really if you're changing
something really quickly the person who
should be on call for it is the last
person that changed it typically right
you might want to occasionally I go on
vacation or something or or have so at
least somebody else that knows about it
but then this is now getting into
systems thinking right if you make
people responsible for their code and on
call for it that feedback loop is a
system it's systemic feedback loop that
makes people write really reliable code
and they don't change stuff on Fridays
and they don't check code in at 4:00
p.m. right because they're going to be
on call for it and if it breaks that
night right so you typically make
changes in the morning spend the
afternoon debugging it if you need it
you get to sleep at night things work
fine and it's a systemic feedback that
causes people to have the right
behaviors so that's that's an
interesting way of looking at it so if
we're building these applications and we
figured out how to organize ourselves in
these small groups and we figured out
how to break our application up into
pieces then quite often we're trying to
make my migrations from the old way we
did things where you had a monolithic
application because and the reason we
had a monolith as we started with
something small which is it's worth
having you know if you want to build
something really quickly and there's
only two or three of you to build it you
should start with
thing like Ruby on Rails with lots of
scaffolding well that everything is
defaulted you just go and you start
building it you know that afternoon
you'll have a working website that's
that's what Ruby on Rails or things like
that doing but it's a monolithic site
it's a it's a web front-end and a
database and they're very intimately
tied together so once you've got that
environment then you want to grow a bit
and then eventually you no longer fit in
a room and but the system gets bigger
and bigger and slower and slower and
harder and harder to modify and that's
the path a lot of people have been on
over the last ten years or so the reason
one of the reasons for this is that it's
used to be hard to deploy things like go
back ten years you need a database how
hard was it to get a database off go
talk to a company I just thought I be a
more HP or son or somebody we need a
database we talked to EMC about some
disks right so if you know six months
later you finally decided how to spend
your million dollars or whatever it was
on a big pile of disks and a big machine
and an Oracle license right and there's
a painful process so once you've got a
database every time you need to store
put data somewhere you put data in that
database so you end up with a schema
database schema that looks like a
kitchen sink it's just got piles of
stuff in it because you only have one
kitchen sink so all the dirty stuff
washing goes in it or like all right the
situation now is you can create a
database in a second less than a second
you know you just open a new domain and
on dynamodb or you say please provision
me an RDS instance on AWS or or any of
the public clouds or you have tooling on
OpenStack that will just start up
another my sequel for you so it's
trivial to start a new database and one
of the most important architectural
things you'll do you should do is make
it easy to do that and make it easy for
developers to do that themselves
self-service then they won't create a
kitchen sink because they can put
everything that should be together
together and they can put things that
don't belong together
in separate places so when we did this
transition that Netflix we went from one
big Oracle
back and off like 2 or 3 heavily linked
back ends to eventually over a hundred
different Cassandra clusters every
cluster doing one thing with an API in
front of it and everything basically
running off of that so how do you get
between these two and you've got this
big monolithic thing and how do you deal
with that and the other problem people
go as well the monolithic app this micro
services thing looks much more
complicated but when you look inside a
monolithic app it's horribly complicated
because it's talking to this the schema
that's a kitchen sink I into got a
monolithic database that's a big mess
you've got your code in front of it
that's a big mess but when you're
drawing architecture it's just one box
so it looks simple right and it's got
lots of api's into it once you try and
break that apart into micro services you
actually that if that's hard then you
know that the system was overly tied
together but once you get to micro
services the micro services themselves
enforce a separation and it looks more
complicated on the diagram but it's
actually simpler because you've got
clean boundaries and you'd have things
aren't reaching around those boundaries
you can see them reaching around because
I have a diagram this is from a
simulator that I built to some
microservices architecture for doing
Internet of Things that I did this for a
react conference but basically it's got
you know three different endpoints it's
got a multi region cluster for doing
time series analytics and it's got a
couple of small clusters and it's a
multi region system this would be
running on you know Europe in the US or
something like that so you could put
this up on a public cloud you could
start this up in a few minutes you could
scale it you could just increase the
number of machines in it to be as big as
it needs to be and if you look at a lot
of Internet of Things backends they look
something like this right there's a an
end point where your thermostat is
saying this is the current temperature
and there's a stream endpoint where your
phone is telling you what the current
temperature is and there's an analytics
endpoint that once a month on sewer
mail saying there's how much money
energy you saved this month that kind of
thing was very generic this is if you
want to sort of follow the it will talk
about this program it's a simulator for
building micro-services architectures
where every micro service is simulated
by a go routine in memory every
connection between a micro service is
done using a go channel just just in
memory and I can run maybe a hundred
thousand micro services on my laptop at
about a thousand times faster than in
real world
alright so the good thing about
simulators Tech they they don't simulate
everything in the real world they
simulate interesting things about the
real world so if you want to sort of lay
out what your architecture looks like
and play around with new architectures
and see if your tooling can visualize
them that's kind of what this is aimed
at if you just follow simian vision
Twitter if you want to get updates on it
as changes happen so what I've been
talking about so far is taking things
that are complicated and making them
simple organizing your work so that it
stays simple or wait ways that you can
organize yourself that avoid some of the
complexity but also but really about
building organizations that know how to
evolve and products that know how to
evolve because that's how you stay
competitive nowadays you need to be able
to go fast in your competition and if
you think about this from a architecture
point of view like the microservices
architecture what we're really looking
for is symmetry that previous diagram is
extremely symmetric it's exactly the
same in every zone and in every region
and then every every service is the same
as every other service so if I want to
go to one of my node services it's the
same as the other node services so I can
just failover to it so that makes it
simple if I'm dealing with part of the
system I know the other parts of the
system are exact copies they're built
off the same image the same container or
the same ami so they're all these
invariants I can apply that's how you
get simplicity into your arc
texture as soon as somebody says hey if
we do this special case thing it'll be a
little bit more efficient but it'll be
different to everyone else to go well
but the your externalizing the cost of
being different for a little bit of
efficiency you're creating a lot of
complexity which will end up costing you
something so you want to be able to make
strong assertions across your system
with the assertion so these are all the
same I can switch all my traffic from
one region to another and just keep
running that's the way Netflix runs
today they can sniff at them once a
month they take all their traffic from
Europe and they switch it from Dublin to
Virginia just to make sure that they can
and they switch all the traffic for
Virginia to Europe or to O to Oregon
they're running in three regions and any
customer can be served from any region
at any time and you think well that's a
little inefficient why is all my
everything I watch in Sweden being
stored in Oregon right well it's just
its simplicity it lets them do it and
this systems thinking approach so this
is a mic so final quote there's another
quote from Jamshed and the
systems-thinking book we see the world
as increasingly more complex and chaotic
because we are using inadequate concepts
to explain it when you understand
something you no longer see it as
chaotic or complex that's right so
hopefully that helps you think about the
systems you're building and figure out
ways to make them more simple so that's
it from me I'm just about out of time
we've got reminders to engage and win
prizes and use the app and I'll take a
few questions
so we have two questions the first one
is what do you do if you're stuck in a
medium-sized company with poor culture
that is centered around managerial
control the quit there's a cut there's a
cup well no you well before you quit and
form your own company there's there's a
couple of books which are really useful
but for this one is called the Phoenix
project by Jean Kim and it's a novel
about a company that's a medium-sized
company that can't figure out how to do
software and it's about to go out of
business and have its entire IT
department outsourced and it's based on
a book called the goal for about thirty
years ago which some if you ever did an
MBA or you know there was one of those
business books so it's a similar kind of
book it talks about it drops the the
book opens with a guy driving to work he
gets a call his the CIO and the VP of
Operations are both quit he's now the
sin and he should go visit the CEO when
he gets to work and he's just like a
manager or director or in operations and
he doesn't want the job and he doesn't
want to have to fix it but he gets
dropped into fixing this problem and it
brings in a bunch of the principles that
DevOps of you know of Kanban boards and
cars and all that kind of stuff so the
little Japanese phrases start popping up
but the story is about how they solved
the real problem at Target the the big
retailer in the US the one of the
operations guys bought 20 copies of this
book gave it to all his managers gave to
all its reports and so play acted scenes
from it to get people to really
understand it so that's that's one way
you can perhaps influence there's
another book if if you're trying to
understand its book of the art of
business value that's by Mark Schwartz
and mark Schwartz is CIO of the partner
Homeland Security Immigration Service so
when you ever need to get a green card
or a visa to go to America it's the
group that does that in all the
immigration work
and it is running inside didn't he
provide the world's biggest bureaucracy
and he's only saying where is the
business value in a bureaucracy and it's
an extremely light-hearted easy read
book which goes through like well the
agile agile were optimizing for business
value right well what is the business
value no one really defined it properly
so he's trying to figure out this sort
of an exploration away you find the
business value and if somewhere along
the way he finds the business value in
the bureaucracy what is this really
about
so those couple of books if those don't
work you know go start a company good we
have one more we have one more minute
for last question what recommendations
would you make for companies who need to
modernize and break apart their
monoliths but simply are not allowed or
able to use the public cloud
infrastructure so public cloud just
saves you a bunch of time and effort for
having to run things yourself but what
really matters about cloud is that it
should be self-service all right an API
driven and then you get the automation
then you get the developer driven
infrastructure and you can do that with
on-premise cloud you can do it with
OpenStack or missus or whatever right
there are products from lots of
companies that will automate your data
center into a system that becomes
self-service and API driven the
difference with public cloud versus
private cloud is when you stop using it
you stop paying for it so it's much more
about the economic incentive to build
systems that Auto scale and are really
cloud native is different like in your
pub in your private cloud you don't get
money back when you I mean unless you do
internal billing I guess but the company
doesn't pay less if you have idle
machines right you still have the
machines on the public cloud there's a
strong incentive to build highly Auto
scaled systems that shut stuff down when
they're not being used and you can get
an enormous amount of efficiency out of
that so like the we're about to hear
about AWS lambda what is the average
utilization of a machine they'll with
lambda an app built with Lander it's a
hundred percent it's or it's not running
it's not there or it's hundred percent
busy
what's the uptime well most the time
it's not there or it's there right so it
sort of 100% utilization 100% uptime
you're not running a machine and I think
the service architectures are really one
of the most interesting new things and
because it's coming up there I agree
yeah so thank you Adrian</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
