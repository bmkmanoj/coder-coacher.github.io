cats in my slides is because you end the
session and you're just like man I
really I just feel good
I'm here's my caps this is pistachio she
clearly does not believe anything I'm
going to say and then the other one is
named squeeks because she squeaks she
actually makes a noise like her name
which is convenient okay so today I'm
gonna talk about agile yeah no actually
not that you just have to put that in
all talks that are about teamwork
what I do kind of want to talk about
though is this concept of a sort of
agility and what agility is all about
agility is really that process of being
able to rapidly change being able to
adjust as you're going forward this is
that core of a lot of the agile methods
and it's all based on this idea feedback
and the feedback is such a vague sense
in a vague word and a vague sort of idea
I like to think of it in more of the
terms of a specific thing and that
specific thing is that all of my process
all of the things that I try to get my
team to do or that I try to do is I try
to minimize the time between doing
something and figuring out if it was the
right thing to do all the way at like
the coding level where you might be
writing your tests first all the way up
to your process level your team process
level doing retrospectives figuring out
we wanted to do something we tried a new
technique let's figure out if that was
the right thing to do and if it wasn't
the thing to do let's adjust it and this
this is brings to sort of one of the
reason I'm doing this talk is that
there's this difference between sort of
the methodologies the sort of agile
methodologies versus this just pure idea
of agility Dave Thomas the pragmatic
programmers talks about this agility and
there's a lot of talks where he goes
into really dissecting agile in there
and in all of the methodologies there's
this key phrase there's this key thing
it lays out you know XP lays out
test-driven development and continuous
integration and scrum has stand-ups
and they lay out this way of doing your
process here's how you develop software
here's how your team should work and
then at the end they talk they say oh
and you should periodically inspect an
adapt you should periodically stop look
at your process and figure out what's
working or what's not working what I
find both in my past and in the current
is that this is often left off if you
were here for Linda's talk she's sort of
pushing the other way is you should be
doing this all the time but often what
happens is you get into a team they say
we do daily stand-ups we do all the
scrum stuff and you just keep doing it
and then then people start complaining
that the stand-ups are too long the
stand-ups are 20 minutes there are 30
minutes they've turned into status
meetings but nobody is actually saying
let's stop inspect and adapt so this is
really the core of having a fixed
methodology versus the context specific
practices where you start with scrum you
start with XP that's your fixed set of
practices your fixed methodology and
that's great you should start with
something but then you always want to
look at what your context is and you
want to stop inspect and adapt your
context
so in this talk I've you know in the
past I've given talks about like very
high-level let's hear some ideas and
things like that but I want to really
talk about examples I'm gonna talk about
a couple examples from the last two
companies I've been working at as to
where we kind of started with something
found our context didn't work for it and
then we changed we did something
different something that wasn't what was
prescribed or something that didn't even
work might not have worked at other
places and so we stopped and we said we
can use different techniques because our
context is different we have a different
context and it all came about because
periodically we said this isn't working
so this talk is very much examples
there's this is probably the last of the
sort of philosophical aspects of it or
the vague aspects of it I'm a little bit
about me that's not me that squeaks she
sleeps with me every night it's
wonderful so I'm a software developer I
got introduced to extreme programming in
2004 currently the CTO of a company
called harken we have a very small team
there's three developers there's nine
people in the company we build software
and best practices for newsrooms
to engage with their audience is a
really interesting interesting business
model I always like to put my humble
slide here of like I don't have all the
answers only experiences I actually do
have all the answers so if you have any
questions at the end I can I will give
you an answer absolutely I have an
answer for every question um and if you
have if you didn't know if you didn't
follow me on Twitter or anything like
that
I do love cats speaking of which there
they are look at him
I bought this red chair it's a very
leather recliner
super fancy and now it has holes little
tiny holes I don't know where they're
coming from but little tiny holes in
them all over the place but I haven't
actually sat in it in a long time
because as you can see somebody else
sits in it so examples these are the
examples the first example I want to
talk about is around planning and I'm
kind of this is sort of the sort of
umbrella of the examples is really about
planning not about necessarily the the
concrete techniques we use for
developing software on the day to day
sort of minute-by-minute basis but this
is one of the things that I've noticed
for myself I've gotten a lot more value
out of when Dury for the planning
meetings I really sort of look at the
techniques were using and figure out
what we can do to do different there's
two companies one is called power
reviews one is called Haugen I'll give
you a little sense of them power reviews
which was the company I worked at
previously small we had twenty people we
had the interesting thing about this
company is that it was very small but we
have five different sort of stakeholders
all asking the dev team to work on this
platform there's a single platform we
had three developers five stakeholders
all different so we had you know who did
we have we had sales we had content we
had marketing we had whatever it was
interesting so power reviews at the time
if what it was was a company that did
online ratings and reviews for products
and so people would come to the website
and they would leave a rating or a
review for a product and so all of these
stakeholders would come and ask us for
things and one of the first things when
I joined there was that I was often we
would be getting asked like how long is
this gonna take
I need this to get done how long is this
gonna take us and so we had a problem
we had three developers we had only one
who knew the codebase we were lucky
because the one developer who knew the
codebase had bit he actually did the
very first commit on the codebase five
years earlier but the rest of us had no
didn't have any familiarity with it and
one of our developers is very much a
junior and so this brings up that
question of how do you estimate when you
have this context and I'm not gonna get
into the whole like no estimates kind of
argument or or discussion around it it's
really when you are in a context there's
often times people are asking you that
question and so they ask you how do you
estimate but what I will say is that in
our context I sat down with all of the
stakeholders and I told them this is the
wrong question it's not that estimation
is the wrong thing to do but how are we
gonna estimate is the wrong question
the right question is why would we
estimate estimate why would we give you
estimates what value are you actually
going to be looking for what value do
you get out of this and of course we
have the standard answers of I want to
know when it's gonna be done I'm sales
person I want to know can I get this in
time I promise this to the people that
I've sold stuff to so we looked at it
and we started talking about what are
the values and can we provide that in a
different way and so we sat and we
talked we sat down and we talked about
this idea of deadlines versus scope we
said you have a deadline of when you
want this done we are three developers
we can't promise you that we can get
everything done in that time frame so
you've got this choice you can either
have a deadline or you can have the
scope this is sort of part of that you
I'm sure you've all seen that graph or
the triangle of what is a quality scope
and time
pick two I think I think they do it and
so we've all probably seen it cuz we
watch these talks and it's a common one
I was gonna put the agile manifesto in
here but then I figured you've probably
seen that a few times this talk or this
conference but we've all seen that
pyramid so what we did was instead we
talked about this idea of taking the
feature that they want and we split it
into a bunch of small tasks bunch of
small features we don't talk about how
long it's going to take we just talk
about the key pieces that are in there
and at that point we can focus instead
on the scope and we can tell them you
can have your deadline now let's talk
about which of these things we have to
get done by then which of these things
should we do first because you're not
going to get all of them and just
flat-out be able to say here's the ten
things that you want you don't get all
of them which are the ones that you want
and which are the ones that you would
like us to do first and this is really
about sequencing and it hasn't we end up
not having to do estimation we just have
to be able to do them in order and the
beauty of this that really comes in as
sort of the value that the team gets out
of it is that oftentimes you don't it
you don't end up doing everything you
just do what you can and as the deadline
approaches they the stakeholders the
people who are asking you they're the
ones who get to make the decision
they're the ones who get to say my
deadlines coming up there's enough done
like I'm willing to say this is okay I
can take this and then you can take
those other things and push them on to
the backlog this is a example of one of
my usual principles is that when I find
a problem with my process when I find
something that I'm struggling
within the process my default answer is
to remove something from my process so
we were having problems with estimation
so what we did was we just said let's
remove that specific thing from our
process and replace it with something
else that we're already doing which was
we were working on cards so can we get
the same value by adjusting something
that we already are doing probably
shouldn't put a picture of my cat next
to the thing that says prefer removing
something but I guess she kind of has
that good look of like really so anyways
number two this is a slightly larger one
and this is more interesting we'll go
over both kind of both companies is how
many of you do like a two week have a
two week planning meeting or how many
you do like one week planning meeting
how many people have moved all the way
to just like continuous planning and you
do like Kanban boards and whips things
like that do they still say whips I was
like that of like having a having a
limit based on a whip okay so this was
the problem we faced this was the core
problem that we faced was that we had
five stakeholders we technically had a
single platform but we kind of had three
products we had a Content blog we had a
a moderation tool because in at this
company and in general if you go on to
sites that do ratings and reviews all of
the reviews have been seen by a human
all the reviews most all the reviews
that you read online have been read and
moderated by a human and that's a lot
that's an expensive process too because
you have people who are sitting there
looking through your cyst or looking
through and reading every single review
that somebody writes and being able to
say spam or not spam or something like
that so we have five stakeholders we
have three
products everybody we would have our
two-week meeting everyone would bring
their cards these are the things that we
want and everyone would vote on them and
generally the loudest person gets their
cards prioritized because they're the
ones who are talking and they overdo it
and in general that's sales and it's not
just because I'm not saying sales people
are loud but they're able to like when
we're sales
we're the ones who bring money in we're
the ones that like so we have this idea
we want to do this because we think that
it's going to make us a lot of money and
that's not a bad thing but they tend to
be the loud ones and they're the ones
who tend to get their stuff prioritized
so I made a little animation of it just
because I can do animations in keynote
so we had all of these people and our
fundamental problem was that sales and
content and moderation and technology
and data all these people were putting
things into this prioritization queue
and our goal was to get the cards in
order so that we could this small team
to seniors and a junior could just pick
off the top and start working on it so
in our meetings we started realizing
that this is a problem this whole idea
of prioritization of our cards was a
problem because when you talk about
prioritization you talk about what's
most important and generally what's most
important is the thing that the person
who's the loudest says is the most
important or the person who's most
highly paid so we questioned this
fundamental idea of what priority means
and got and time and brought the
stakeholders in the room and said why do
we need to prioritize these things and
inevitably what they end up saying is
that we want to work on the most
valuable things first the things that
are valuable for the company so as a
team we looked at this I
this is the I don't know I'm sure
there's a fancy term for it but it is
the sort of value time quadrant thing
how many people seen this sort of chart
before okay so you want to get so you
have sort of how long it's gonna take
and then you have value on this side and
you want to get short things that can be
done shortly that are high value of
course the problem is is that you know
gauging value in gauging time and all of
that we'd already given up estimation a
little so we're having trouble with time
but there's this there's guy named Arlo
belshi who if you haven't seen anything
he's done or if you haven't seen
everything he's done then you should and
if you're watching this is a recording
you can stop go watch everything Arlo's
done and come back because I'm I'm back
think welcome back wonderful every time
I watch him talk like my the way I
develop software fundamentally changes
so absolutely so one of the things that
he talked about that I brought in was
this idea that value of something if you
look at this Square and you look and you
talk about how much it's how able it is
to the company and then you look at this
one or even this one value tends to
increase at a much more rapid pace than
time so it usually oftentimes will go
like this will be worth you know ten
thousand dollars to the company this one
will be worth a thousand dollars to the
company you tend not to have ten
thousand dollars and nine thousand you
tend to have large gaps between them in
fact they tend to be you know more sort
of exponential kind of growth in the
value of your a period of features
whereas time time is almost always
linear time is almost always this is
going to take one week versus three
weeks and so you have the value of
feature
growing this is maybe ten or a hundred
times more valuable than another feature
where as the time tends to be that it's
going to take you another you know an
extra two weeks to do it and whenever
you have sort of graphs of something
that is rapidly growing or exponential
even and something that is linear you
can always get rid of the linear part of
it and just talk about value and just
think in terms of what is the value of
this feature to the card and so if you
think about it this way you can simply
bring everything in put the value on the
card and just order them that way
and forget totally how long things are
going to take and of course you split
them up into the small pieces so that
when you get that value you don't have
to do the rest and this is something we
did now that brings up another challenge
which is how do you do value based free
sequencing what is a value so what we
did was we actually were in a situation
where we said in order to bring a card
in you have to have a dollar value on it
a monetary financial value either earned
saved and here's an example of one that
wasn't gonna get sequenced moderators
are moderators the ones who look at the
reviews and say whether or not it's good
we had a problem in that one of the
things they look for were fraudulent
reviews reviewers who would write ten
good reviews for something and would
make money in order to find out if it
was fraudulent they took four steps they
would have to click the name in the tool
to get the IP address navigate to the
search page put in the IP address and
then they would look to see how many
reviews they had not a huge thing but
they they you know lose a pane and so
they would bring this card the
moderation team brought this card all
the time and it never got sequence it
would
not get sequins because sales would come
in and they'd be like we have this big
thing that we're working on this big
project that we're working on so I sat
down with them and we said let's look at
this let's look at every review it takes
20 seconds to do this per review if we
do about 200 reviews per day for a
reviewer add it up to about an hour a
day we we have 75 reviewers it's $1,500
a day that we could immediately begin
getting and saving if we had a small
change that took this 20 second process
down to like a second or if we added I
we ended up adding a little flag a
little red flag on the thing if it had
more than one review for that IP address
and so by bringing in money this got
sequence because everybody voted for it
like it was sitting there and it was
like we're gonna immediately the day we
roll this out we start saving $1,500 a
day and oddly enough we did when we got
it so this is a example of something you
can do and it got sequenced and it broke
this sort of loudness problem of
prioritization and of course we hear
there's there's pushback against this
sort of thing of like you can't this
couldn't work in my place we can't do
financial stuff and I always tell people
it might not in fact it probably won't
work in your place but you won't know
until you try it and this is how we try
every experiment at our place is we say
we this may not work but it we're gonna
try it and we always put that time frame
let's try it for two months and key the
thing I've found that is so important is
to actually put the meeting on the
calendar for when you're gonna decide if
you keep doing it so it's not just let's
try it for two months and then we'll see
it's we have a meeting because if
somebody comes and complains about it
not working or they don't like it you
can say you know two weeks we're going
to have a meeting we have the meeting
there
and people generally are like well okay
I can do it for two more weeks we'll see
and then you have the mean you make the
decision it's a big technique that
somewhere along the line it's a simple
thing to pick up the other thing that I
wanted to give an example of is the same
sort of idea of planning for my current
company Harkin we're tiny we've only
been around for about a year and a half
we have nine people we started there
were three of us at the beginning to
developers and our CEO now we're at nine
it's we're growing it's great we're
gonna be profitable next year huzzah
no wait it's being recorded I bet it
nada people are gonna come back and
catch me on that'll be the part of this
talk people catch me on so the thing the
different context we have here is that
we have only one stakeholder for a
single product we pretty much have a
product that we're putting out and our
CEO is the main sort of thought leader
around it so they're bringing in this we
do have customers who are feeding us
back but the all of it funnels in
through sort of the same place and we
again have three developers except in
this situation we have two developers
who have been developing software for
more than 20 years we have another one
who's around seven or eight years like
we have a much better team I've also
probably had my hand in almost every
line of the codebase same with the other
senior developer so we have this
amazingly different context and so when
we started doing the planning we started
with no estimation because now there
wasn't really a sense of of what why do
we actually need to have estimates we
started with a weekly planning meeting
because we were moving very quickly and
we had this start stakeholder sequence
the tasks so we would use Trello we'd
come into our weekly meeting and the we
would ask the stakeholders like is this
the next one you want us to do is this a
higher priority and we always I have
this whole like grand wonderful way of
doing it
I would take the card and I would be
like is it more important than this
other one is it less important than this
other one it would go through this big
long process and we would get it sort of
prioritized but we ran into a bunch of
problems like we can't talk about the
value because it's money like weird
we're a small small company we're just
starting this product we don't actually
at the time we didn't have a lot of
customers we still don't have a lot of
customers so we can't really talk about
money and so and sequencing when you
when you're at a early stage Stephen
seemed like I would say like is this
more important and people would be like
yeah sure
like we have to get all of it done it
doesn't like we have to get it all done
why are we doing this and I it would
rarely change like we would just it just
became this hour-long or half an hour
long depending on how many cards just
waste of a week or a waste of a time
because we'd come in there and go
through this rigorous planning process
and nobody cared about the priority
people cared whether the stuff was
getting like is it gonna get done or not
and it'd be like well yeah everything's
gonna get done eventually and that was
good enough so we ended up just throwing
that away and replacing the weekly
planning meeting with communication we
all were together we were on slack all
the time talking and all that and so
what we found was that the weekly the
sort of weekly prioritization meeting
you know we had small team so we talked
to each other all the time so we kind of
had a sense of what was really important
and we went back to this idea this core
thing that has stuck with me since I got
sort of introduced or inducted into the
religion of agile or XP is that this
idea that story cards are a placeholder
for communication I've been at places
where we this
story needed to have acceptance criteria
and the story had to have all of this
stuff around it because there was not
good communication well our team had the
context where we were talking all the
time and so we ended up making it where
a story card specifically had just a
title there was very little if any
detail in it if there was a bug there
might be like a screen shot but what
would happen is that developers when
they drew a card the expectation was
that they would go talk to the person
who had put the card in and figure out
what all the details were and one of the
things that came out of it is that we
ended up having this expectation that
when you took a card that card became
more than one like as you found more
information about what the feature was
or what the request was you would take
cards and shed them off into the backlog
and so you would do this idea of taking
something that you don't know anything
about and break it up into all of the
small pieces and so you'd sort of fill
up the backlog with the details and it
ended up it fit along with some other
things we did like we would we started
doing what we called short-lived code
branches so in get in our source
repository branches got deleted after a
day if they weren't merged in a master
and so every branch had one day and if
you didn't then we just cleaned it up
deleted it and you had to start over and
now we're at surprisingly we did that
that was another time box thing we did
and we said let's try it for a month at
the end of the month we sat down the
three developers and we were like what
do you think and I was just like works
great it's fun and we would end up
splitting cards up quite a bit so what
are what our weekly planning ended up is
that the developers would come and we
would present the sequence we talked to
everybody through the week we know what
we're doing this
kind of what we're gonna do this week
anyone have objections and rarely
sometimes if there was something we
didn't know about a really a big bug or
something someone would say yeah I have
an objection I need this done right away
and at that point we could sort of
interrupt and put that in there and then
we'd be done and so the sort of weekly
planning became more of a weekly report
like weekly sharing meeting and it took
like I don't know five minutes part of
another meeting it became part of
another team meeting where we said this
is what we think gonna do this week and
everyone was just like okay because we
sat down and looked at what we were
doing and found the things that none of
us liked and just got rid of them so we
then got to what we were building what
we're doing now which is we're actually
building a new product and we started
continuing to do this we split it up we
had lots of features to build sequencing
was difficult even for developers
because there was no context it was just
features of a new product um what we did
start doing was having a Friday showcase
of demoing the product like where is it
app so far like what can it do look you
can subscribe to the notebook now and
look look you can upload a photo or you
can crop a photo we can't upload it yet
can't save it but you can crop it so we
would have these like showcases every
week of it plus we were using a new
language and a new framework elm how
many people have heard of Elm how many
people have done Elm awesome right yeah
amazing if you haven't done it yet do it
Elm is great I always say its Haskell
without the academia which is super nice
and nobody ever mentions monads another
wonderful thing okay so let's not talk
about Elm so we switch to an idea of
script based planning
Davis was actually our front-end
developer our designers idea said since
we are doing a weekly showcase why don't
we simply write a script for that every
week what is it what's the script look
like that we're gonna walk through for
Friday let's go through the script and
see what the system does do already and
what it doesn't do already and then the
whole point of the week is to work on
the product until it does what it
doesn't do
and so Friday we can show the script and
we just walk through the script so we
completely threw away the whole like
sequencing and all of that of cards we
still move cards along for our own
edification but all of the planning is
about what are we going to showcase
because we're under development we're
hoping to get it done soon
the other benefit of this with a new
product is that the stakeholders at a
point they're gonna be able to use it
they're gonna be seeing it in action not
just what got done they're actually
going to see a script run-through of
what you can do with the product and at
that point they may say I could use it
now regardless of what your original
plan was it's like hey it's got
everything people can subscribe I can
upload pictures everything's happy and
so this became our like this is the
process we use now as we're building
this we're probably going to be building
this through the end of the year and so
our goal is to have it into general
release by the end of the year so we're
gonna do this script based thing now
after we have that out that's no longer
the right thing so we go back to sort of
the story based and the feature based
thing after you release the product
because you always want to stop and
adjust to the part that works so
this is kind of the whole summary and
the whole point of all of this is that
you are special even though people will
tell you you're not a special snowflake
I'll tell you that too but you are
special your team special your context
is special if you do these time based
experiments based on your context always
go back and very frequently stop and say
what are the things that I don't like
about this and rather than saying I
don't like like it ask your team what
happens if we just don't do it like we
took our stand-ups and we moved our
stand-ups our stand-ups started standing
up then we were in slack and we were
answering those damn three questions of
what you yesterday what are you gonna do
today
what's what's in your way how many
people ask that question that your
standup oh not very many how many people
do stand-ups every day oh great so we
started doing that we started doing that
in slack and we realized that like well
you know we read them but we have we
talk all the time in slack all the time
like I'm typing in slack feels like all
the time and so having that morning like
what's the goal of that morning those
three questions so what we've switched
to is we switch to one question which is
what are you doing today and why because
any blocker you're having you've already
talked to the people the only the most
important thing is understanding why
you're doing what you think you're gonna
do today both for an internal process
and an external to everybody else
because then people can come in and say
hey I think that might not be the most
important thing and everybody knows what
you did yesterday because we're talking
all the time and so we've done that
we've switched to we actually in the dev
team we've moved back into having a
little video call every day because the
two developers are
where the three of us are remote so we
have a little video call we moved out of
the slack stand up and into a video call
that's like two or three minutes long
because we're remote and we never get to
see each other and we thought wow I
haven't seen heard this person's voice
in a little while so why don't we make
it so that we see each other's face
every day
because we we pair a couple times a week
but it still feels distance when you're
remote so context matters and the
context your context changes over time
so I'm one thing that I'm not really
well lots of things one thing I'm not
really great at is sort of ending so
that's the end remember to rate the
session when you are rating the session
think of my cat's squeaks in pistachio
um I also wrote a book and I saw
somebody else put it up there I was like
I should put a put a picture of my book
up there it's a programming book about
the four rules of simple design great
book take pictures of it oh great book
so you can buy yeah thank you enjoy
I think there's time for questions I
purposefully left 10 minutes for
questions
indeed Thank You Cory we've got time for
questions anyone awesome okay
hi thank you for talk I'm interested
about the time-boxed experiment how
defined is it in the beginning and do
you allow for the experiment to evolve
during the time box period it's a good
question so the question is when you are
doing a time box experiment how defined
is the experiment at the beginning and
over the course of the time box do you
allow for it to evolve and change um it
depends no it does depend on if it is
like so when we tried to do short-lived
branches we said we're gonna delete our
branches every day you have one day to
get this task done and if you don't get
it done you have to start over we didn't
allow for change to that because it was
the more defined you can make it then
the less change there needs to be
because you want to you want to see does
this hypothesis hold true the key is
figuring out what an appropriate time is
more than can we change it because if
you're saying like we're gonna change
our two-week planning meeting you don't
want your time box to be two weeks needs
to be six weeks two months that's
something like that and the times when
it's for me the times when it's allowed
to like make some improvements on it are
when you try it and it's awful like it's
really bad
then don't stick with it I mean if it's
horrible but if it's just like oh this
is uncomfortable but I'm not very like
you have to stick with it this is
science
there's something I mean if it's if you
have ideas for making it better the
whole goal is to end the
time box with a learning and if you end
the time box having changed the the
experiment to the point where it's great
then success but the one thing to watch
out for is before you have a time to
experience it like if you're doing
something that you're going to get a
feel for on a day like you're doing
something that daily like we're gonna
change our stand up and after a day
somebody's like this sucks
like hold hold for a couple weeks the
the big key is is that time like set a
meeting on your calendar as soon as you
start the experiment so that everybody
knows when it is that you're gonna make
the decision and if you do in general
people are pretty laid-back any other
questions
everybody wants to run outside it's
sunny out there okay hey I was wondering
about the demo the Friday demo
mm-hmm and then you talked about the
scripts I was wondering what what form
does scripts ache is it just a list over
everything you want the system to have
and then you sort of fill it out or let
me show you yeah there's this wonderful
chrome plug-in called this is it this
wonderful chrome plug-in that serves up
a picture from the met the Metropolitan
Museum that has a cat so it just knows
all the pictures that have cats in them
and then whenever you start a new tab it
um here it is iron it'll show you a new
picture of the catalyst so basically it
looks like this it's like add items to
dispatch and so it starts with like hey
Ellen's gonna log in she's gonna go to
the workspace and then like this is the
thing we're hoping to be
do is create items and then we just do
this so it's it's very ad hoc we'll have
a list of like what are the goals what's
missing what are stretch goals for it
don't I look classy things like that
yeah look see it's another here's
another cat picture it's a really great
plugin um that answer your question okay
any other questions awesome all right
enjoy the rest of the day please
remember to rate to speaker thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
