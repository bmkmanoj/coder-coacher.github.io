are the cognitive abilities of human
beings and why some things are just so
darn hard for human beings often we talk
about that you should follow guidelines
and that it should have good usability
and all these UX has caught on uux is
the buzzword U is UX is the bus theme
these days but what we usually don't get
around to talking about is why is it
that hard why are some things just
hard-coded into the human brain and why
can we not work around that and that's
some of the things I'm going to talk to
you about today because if you know why
then you also know how to work around
and in your software and not make the
user work harder a little bit by me I am
a software engineer
I graduated from Albert University in
2003 and after that I went on to become
a researcher there that went quite well
meaning that about a year later I was
offered a scholarship for a PhD which I
finished in 2009 went on to become a
researcher again and then at some point
three years ago nearly I got to try fork
that meant I actually got to try out
some of all that heavy theoretical stuff
I'd been doing a new medicine at
University to see if it actually worked
in the real world and I'm pleased to say
it actually does so that's great today's
topics we're gonna talk about a guy
named Miller we're also gonna talk about
how and it becomes a panda and we're
gonna talk a bit about screwdrivers that
might make some more sense later on but
those are just some other things we'd be
talking about today I bet all of you
have tried at some point that you get a
message on your answering machine you
call it up and somebody has left a
number on there that you should call
back to and you start memorizing it 98
5732 2898 57 30 28 and then you pass a
window with donuts I couldn't they got
for an offer I'm gonna get some of those
on my way back from work what was that
number again and it's gone it's just
gone and there's no way you can recall
it so you got a call up to your
answering machine again hear the message
again to get the number and then maybe
you get it right if you can remember it
from the time you hang up on your
answering machine to actually punch it
into your keyboard
that's how bad human cognitive abilities
are and memory
that brings me to Millers law that was
the guide Miller I was going to talk
about 7 + -2 means the amount of items a
human being is able to hold in the
short-term memory some are able to hold
5 Sam I able to hold 9 thus the 7 plus
-2 if you want to be able to target all
of your users go for 5
don't go for nine and what is a
meaningful item well a meaningful item
could be just one single digit it could
be a word
it could be a three-digit number it
depends if you have a telephone number
in Denmark that's usually made out of
for meaningful items so two numbers two
numbers two numbers and two numbers
they've actually reduced that to three
in some cases especially with with easy
to remember business numbers where they
have two digits three digits three
digits then you down to three items so
it basically means what you remember as
in a single item rather than several
items your short-term memory how long is
it any guesses short-term memory is only
a few seconds long that usually
surprises people people think it's like
30 seconds maybe a minute it's a few
seconds long and that's if you don't get
interrupted that's if you actually are
concentrated about what you're supposed
to remember if you get interrupted is
even worse hence the donut story so
short-term memory is very very precious
to us and should not be overloaded
because if we did people won't be able
to cope with it seven plus minus two
comes from the psychology world and it
has been misused in the UX field for
many very weird rules such as the number
of menu points you should have a menu
why does that make sense to have seven
plus minus two menu points why would you
have to hold a full menu in your
short-term memory you don't it's right
in front of you you can just read it why
is my why is it not completely off
though
because when you have a menu fold it out
and you're supposed to make a choice in
that menu about what point to take you
have to be able to remember the others
to actually know which one is the
closest to what you're looking for so if
you have let's just go overboard and say
a menu of 30 points how do you get an
overview of that you don't so it's not
supposed to be used for something like
that it is at most a rule of thumb but
it's a good thing to remember that
short-term memory is a precious and very
limited resource so treat it as such
what do you see here are they order in
some way grouped how two to two and one
yeah now what do you see
code yeah that's what I expected from
this room what do you see
a syntax error yeah some people see
square parenthesis and now what's weird
compared to before is that here the
signal was on the right
here the single is on the left why is
that why does that happen what's going
on up here we're looking for connections
yeah what we're looking into here and is
the effect of something called Gestalt
frits principles
anyone heard of them quite a few there's
quite a few of them I think nine or
something like that I'm only going to go
through the most common four and the
first one is proximity proximity say is
that things that are close together we
expect to belong together in some way
things that are far apart we expect to
have nothing to do with each other this
means that in this case we have a group
up here of 12 dots then we have a group
here of another 12 dots or we might
actually have three groups of four dots
they are slightly closer together than
these so they might have more to do with
each other than those and up here we
have two groups of six or a group of
twelve compared to these two
I don't think there's anyone in this
room who saw this and thought there's
$36 there
I'm all right yeah we group things we
don't think about it but we group things
the second one similarity if things look
the same we expect them to be the same
if things look differently we expect
them to be different
that means if up here you've got some
dots that are differently colored you
expect those dots to stand now and they
do here is not the color it's the shape
instead but they stand out so something
stands out in a crowd we expect it to be
different in some way
continuity this is also just a bunch of
dots and yet again it's not because I
think everybody in this room sees this
that's continuity we tend to draw a line
where there is none if we can
and we're not conscious of this but we
do this all the time I'm gonna get back
to some examples on all of this and the
last one of the four is called closure
this is actually just a bed line but
most will see it as a circle because
they will automatically close the gap at
the top and make a circle
this is something we do we complete
things that are incomplete and we do
this subconsciously all right these are
the four main principles I'm gonna run
through a few examples this is a French
website I've chosen a French one because
then you won't get caught up in reading
most of you because there won't be that
many French people it's from an inch car
insurance company what is the first
thought when you see this website ms
chaos yeah agreed but why is that why is
it a mess I mean this got nice squared
feels here nice square feels it why is
it messy it's difficult to group because
if you start grouping these then you get
groups like this basically all of the
entire website is one group because
there's nothing separating any of it
from each other
and then you end up seeing it as one
group and it gets to be such a large
group that you can't overview it and
then you get back to the seven plus
minus two
you don't have to keep this in
short-term memory but because there are
so many things grouped together all in
one group you can't get an overview and
that's why you consider it messy
this is another example of groups that
gone wrong because here we have a label
and you have a text field and then you
have a call the text description yeah
you have a description underneath and
that's fine and then when you move down
you have another label another text
field another description another label
so on so forth but if you jump straight
into the middle what belongs together
here this one this one this one or this
one this one this one or why is that
it's not grouped just comes all with the
same diff or the same white space in
between all of them
it's not grouped because they actually
they should be grouped in threes but
they're not and because they aren't you
don't actually follow what groups there
the two ways of grouping this is from
uske banks our iPad app one way is
through boxes or lines this is probably
from a graphical design point of view
the old-fashioned way of doing it the
other way of doing it is through
whitespace no lines on that one but
nobody in here has any doubt that this
area all belongs together this belongs
together this belongs together
whitespace is overrated and I very often
see it I'm looking at you developers I
very often see it when you guys are
coding that oh but there's room over
here so I'll just fit it in here and
that's how an interface get crammed and
that's why whitespace is a lot more
important than you think it is it's a
way of grouping things it's a way of
creating order in chaos so use it wisely
and don't just think that oh I'll just
is this - pixel further up and 2 pixels
further up and then I could just fit
this in at the bottom because at some
point you get to the point where the
pixels in between are so few that they
don't work as grouping anymore
alright similarity this is from a
website where they had they did a
usability test and they found out that
people couldn't find their in from their
account information the reason for this
they found out was that these here have
got nothing to do with account
information this one does they thought
all of these five belong together why is
that
same color exactly that means that you
can have a usability problem in a
website and an easy fix just like this
as soon as they did this people had no
problem finding the information anymore
because they started looking out here
because they realized it's not part of
what is in the middle doesn't belong
with them has a different color
that's all it took to solve a problem
like that
similarity it's also what makes us able
to scan through a page like this and
find out what has gone into my account
what has gone out of my account this
case a lot has gone out of my account
and but you would have green numbers
same here when you add when you're
looking at an overview of a stocks you
can easily see which indexes are passing
which indexes are in - right now
why would I not just remove the plus and
minus then if I've got really red
colorblindness okay I'm glad that more
and more answer that when I ask because
it's actually quite a lot that a
colorblind and you cannot you can never
have only one way of distinguishing you
can never only use color as the way of
distinguishing items that otherwise look
alike because some people won't be able
to so always have two ways of
distinguishing things but this is very
easily scannable when you have a
difference like that
because they stand out continuity this
website is not something I would
recommend otherwise but it was just a
very good example of continuity it's
kinda where very weird build but that's
how it is I don't know why they have
this banner across the website but they
do and it just goes to illustrate kind
of continuity very very well because you
have this blue menu or whatever it is
over here and because it's got the same
width as down here the same colors down
here the same font the same font size
everything about these two parts of the
website are alike because of this you
automatically think okay it's the same
menu it's just this one on top
there's nothing on top it's pixels but
why do we think it's on top because
that's what it looks like in the real
world whenever we look at our desk and
we've got piles of paper whenever a
corner sticking out
we know fully well that's not the whole
paper sticking out there we know there's
more underneath it's just hidden because
things are 3d
things aren't 3d on a website but we can
fool people and use 3d as a a way of
making things belong together cuz that
blue thing that doesn't run behind this
ribbon there's nothing behind this
ribbon it's pixels but before course we
can make the link to the real world and
the 3d and the way of seeing things in
the real world we can make people see
that these two belong together because
people make the continuity of that as
also why we recognize this as five rings
it's not really but we make the
continuity and say okay the red ring is
above the green ring here and then it
goes below the green ring here no it
doesn't it's pixels but it would if it
was five physical rings that were tied
together like this and that way we use
what people already know and have known
for eternity and use it online same with
iPads we have all of these pop-up boxes
on there and by simple use of shadow and
the fact that you can actually see
the screen behind it around it you know
that this is just something that's on
top it's really not but it looks like
it's on top that means you can take it
away again and be back where you were
what do you see triangles how many -
what else three circles yeah that's the
thing you don't see two triangles in
three circles you see three crocodile
thingies and three pac-man because
that's what there really is but
everybody in here see - - trying out
some three circles because we make
closure we very quickly see that this is
on a straight line so we make that
straight line mentally
and because there's a straight line
there that means that that white
triangle is lying on top of another
triangle it's really not because again
it's just pickles but that's what we see
same with this one it looks like crudely
made pie charts but everybody sees the
3d square in there
again because we're making closure we
make the lines that aren't there
and this can actually be used
you
these all use closure every single one
of them this would just be a bunch of
white lines otherwise
this one would never be a peacock if we
weren't able to do closure around the
actual head and neck of the peacock
HP's logo with just before straight
lines we use it everywhere and we don't
think about it
I think is actually harder for us
mentally to not close these lines lunch
actually do it
all right back to where a pen that
becomes a panda why is this not a panda
it is pixels but there's nothing behind
it or above it so that's not why this
time it's not a panda because if it was
it would be
a gap here but you didn't think of that
gap because you did this
and that that's why it becomes not only
a lot of black blotches but an actual
panda
this is a funny little thing because
there are some things that we are taught
through life that then that then
overrules
some of these things such as reading
everybody in here can read because of
that they see this and say oh it says
FedEx if you ask children who can't yet
read what they see
they see this arrow
that's because they are doing closure
saying okay this is actually the only
thing that makes sense to them the rest
is just lines all right how is this
useful fine if we're making logos but
not everybody is making logos in fact
most of us are probably not
well it's useful because
we can use the fact that something is
incomplete
to our advantage how do we know that
this is a folded newspaper yeah there's
a shadow that's true but the fact that
the text is cut off you can see the top
of a lot of letters in the line here
this picture does not also not make
sense as a as a full picture it's an
incomplete picture same here you can see
the trial for some letters there that's
how we know that this is a folded
newspaper we would know in other ways as
well in the physical world because it
would be thicker cast shadow and so on
and so forth but if we transfer this to
online then we don't have all of the
physical abilities from the physical
newspaper but we still have what we had
with the folding here you're fully aware
now that there must be more further down
there must be a scroll bar somewhere
otherwise this will not be complete this
picture wouldn't make sense otherwise
and the thing about it is that
if you are making a website and you have
more than just what will fit on the
first page and you have to have a
scrollbar I've seen some very
unfortunate cases where you could draw a
straight line somewhere and in the wrong
resolution of a screen that would just
fit and people would never realize that
there was more further down and the
problem with that is we can never really
predict people's resolution on their
screen because there's so many different
screen resolutions so the way to do it
is make sure that nowhere on your site
do you have a line that goes all the way
through
if you don't have that then always
something will be cut off being
incomplete making people look for
closure realizing that there's scroll on
your site
so having something incomplete requiring
closure is a way of making users aware
that there's more
and we do it quite a lot this is from
the Windows Phone 7 and they use it
quite frequently or quite they use it as
a regular thing on the phone because on
iPhone if you have swiped somewhere the
archetypical way of illustrating that is
through the small dots at the bottom but
those are often in the way and there
might be other and more subtle ways of
showing it this could be one because
everybody will see this and say wait a
minute that's not full words that's not
even full letters there must be more
because like maybe somebody is not good
at coding but they can't be that bad
that requires people to start doing this
because they want to see what is missing
here and they want to see if they can
pull that in and there you go that's
swipe for you this is also from uske
bank's iPad app and they I actually also
made use of it because they have this
whole coffee shop branding thing going
where they have this bookshelf with all
sorts of stuff on it and then they have
things over here that you're able to
customize yourself and again they could
just have made the bookshelf go to here
but because it stops here and you can
see this a little something here I'm not
quite sure what it is that will require
people to start seeing if they can move
the bookcase and then revealing that
there's actually more behind there
because they realize okay this tiny s
here is probably not all this supposed
to be and they look for closure all
right that was crystal principles the
four most important ones their number
ought to be looked at but those are the
four most important ones there's also a
principle called affordance affordance
the different the definition of
affordance is visual a sense assessment
of intended use meaning then you're able
to look at something and immediately
realize how it's supposed to be used
just by looking at it how many of you
can hand on heart say that that's how it
is with your software how's this
supposed to be used and if we put
historical things aside and what you've
learned through your childhood you never
encountered a football before
what would make you realize how this is
used
shape you can roll its round what about
the size what does that say it's too big
for a hand unless you've got really big
hands it's perfect for your feet because
your feet are less accurate and the
material and the texture the way it can
actually be compressed makes it perfect
for kicking because it can go really far
and it doesn't hurt your foot
I could put a rock on that picture and
you probably wouldn't start kicking it
why because you know it would hurt you
know it would be heavy that's the things
you can see from immediately looking at
things
this one why is that not the same it's
too small and you have to be a really
good football player to actually be able
to dribble and score without one so
that's perfect for what instead it fits
straight in your palm it's got the
perfect size for that scissors even
without having used one of these it's
quite easy to see how that fits with
your hand and how you can go like this
and that's also very obvious when you
give that to a left-handed person
because that makes it very difficult
and that's where affordance goes wrong
this one you can't do anything else but
press it it won't do anything else
whatsoever except being pressed on
alright that was fairly obvious these
are everyday things you've all
encountered them why is that so
difficult why is the fort in such a big
deal I'll show you why it's a big deal
because when it's missing that's when we
start faltering this is it obviously
chair what is characteristic of a chair
you can rest your back it's stable it's
got a seat and even more so the height
of the chair usually fits from your knee
down to heel the seat of the chair
usually fit from your knee to your back
and the back fits with the back of the
chair it fits perfectly with your body
size is made for sitting and is easily
recognizable as something to sit on
is this a chair probably but people are
saying probably a lot round here why is
that why are we not certain this is the
chair or not a chair
yeah exactly
there's certain things about it that
looks like a chair it has somewhat of a
seat it has legs but we're not entirely
sure if it's stable I'm not sure at all
actually and it does have a back but
it's very inconvenient from a head so if
you see this in a museum
I would not be sure if I could sit on it
or if I would get chased out for messing
with a precious artifact of some sort
that's what happens when affordance is
missing we can't immediately tell from
looking at it what it's for
this one also fairly obvious it's got
two knobs you can turn them water comes
out yay
clean hands this one how do I turn that
on kick it shout at it yeah that's
usually what people resort to maybe that
could turn I don't know
but even if that can turn and I get
water how do I get hot water and how do
I get cold water
I'm not sure I bet everyone in this room
at some point has stand stood around
looking like a fool in front of a tap
they couldn't operate is that Alright
that's what happens when affordance is
missing you can't tell how to use it
this a pepper mill house whole
thing.this I thought it was a decoration
on the restaurant table I was sitting at
and I asked the waiter for a pepper add
salt to say this right there oh because
it doesn't look like it and even if I
had realized it was a pepper and salt
man trying twisting those with greasy
hands in your kitchen that won't happen
all right that's affordance that's when
you can see what it's for we're looking
at it perceive the force affordance is
visual assessment of possible use that
means you can actually use a lot of
things for what is not intended for
other possible uses a hammer used for
hitting nails if we have a hammer we
need hitting and we don't have a hammer
if we have a nail that needs hitting and
we don't have a hammer what do we look
for
so yeah similar what is similar still
iPad you will never borrow my iPad what
do we look for what is a good
replacement item and why something heavy
and hard
long maybe what could be a stone so it
doesn't necessarily have to be long that
means you won't get very many credit
points from your mother-in-law when you
use somes but they will do how many
times have we stood around and had a
screw come undone somewhere and not had
a screwdriver and what do we look for
a nice yes he I don't have but I'm
looking at the girls in the room what do
we look for yep but it's classical why
because it has all of the same
characteristics as what we would
essentially use if we had it it has a
same sharp edge that's hard enough to
get a grip
and that's basically it these aren't
nearly as good this is the preferred
tool if we have it but it'll do in a
Jess
when you have a hammer then what
everything looks like a nail
yeah when you have a bottle and you
don't have a bottle opener then that or
that or that and if you're really good
you start looking at a loaf of bread or
newspaper but then you're good and why
do we not usually go for those first
because the loaf of bread and a bottle
open does not have very many common
characteristics if it has you left your
bread out too late too long
all right so adapted use we have things
that are meant to be used in a certain
way and over time we adapt the usage of
them to more to our liking a book is
primarily for reading but we use it for
shelter if we don't have anything else
we use it to stabilize a table we use it
to sit on or stand on if we can't reach
these are adapted users and they're
perfectly fine because it's perceived
affordance it's something that's
possible it's not intended for that but
it's possible and as long as we don't
break it we are usually more than happy
to use it this way sometimes perceived
affordance becomes affordance the actual
affordance everybody in this room has
got tons of these around the office but
recent years because we sit down as much
as we do which we shouldn't write I know
we see more and more of these around the
office they look weird in the office
where they supposed to go they're
supposed to be in the gym what they
doing in the office
and then somebody came up with this that
completely defeats the purpose of it not
being good at sitting on and the reason
they've come up with this is because
somebody complained at some point that a
ball like that whenever people go to
lunch if you're in a crooked building
all the balls are at the end of the
hallway when you come back from lunch
because they won't stand still wherever
they are so let's put some wheels let's
put a ring around it so it doesn't roll
but if it doesn't roll then that becomes
impractical so let's put wheels on it
and then yeah I would really like to
lean back a bit because it's really hard
on my back to sit on the ball like that
and then you put a backrest on it
completely defeating the purpose then
you might as well go back to your normal
office chair but hey that's humans for
you how many can say they haven't been
there everybody has done this why is
that
why is that the reason it normally
happens is because some brilliant
designer some time in time came up with
the idea that symmetry is a good thing
meaning a door should look the exact
same way on both sides leaving us no
clue whether it opens inwards or
outwards
hence this
then somebody came up with the idea we
put labels on it that solves it then
solve it bonad why not why does that
usually not solve it exactly we don't
read that and if we do we read it too
late and our hand has already pushed up
hold
alright then watch this then what's the
solution think on ebooks
yeah because labels work the first time
right
no not bigger labels this would do it
there's no way you can pull that door
and there's no way you can push that
door or that handle at least why don't
we do that then symmetry yeah and
aesthetics I'm sure some designer will
tell you that doesn't look good I tend
to agree but it would solve the problem
alright but how is this relevant in
software well we have a lot of these
around or software buttons
this is a regular button this is a
pre-chosen button meaning if you press
return then it activates this is the
button that's pressed in this is an
inactive button we may run across those
all the time and if they done right they
work as intended
what if they all look like that
you can't even tell that that's a button
it might as well be a textfield
that means in software you can look at
stuff and actually tell how it's
supposed to be used is it clickable can
you interact with it or is it just text
that helps us clues like that helps us
in software as well if we can look at it
and tell how it's supposed to be used
that's why we draw from the real world
and start using 3d effects of all sorts
is to actually give clues as to how it's
supposed to be used
this is taken from Penske bunks iPad app
and use go back to iPad app and it's
just to illustrate it doesn't have to be
exactly like the physical world I mean
this is felt sewn onto paper and I mean
it doesn't get much more real-world ish
than that but it might also just be
something like this this has got enough
of the characteristic ax it doesn't have
the actual materials of the real world
but it has the characteristic it looks
like something you can pull on
same here this has got wood on there and
taped up pieces of paper and and it
looks like there's a pocket there where
they would actually fit inside so that's
very very much real-world but again
here's the effect up does the trick
the shadow that makes it looks like it
comes from underneath and there's more
to be pulled from there doesn't actually
look like the real world doesn't look
like paper it doesn't look like salt it
doesn't look like all that but it does
have the effect that gives us a hint
that there's more there
and also this one I'm quite sure if you
take the shelves off this bookshelf
these won't fall down they wouldn't the
real world hence the need for shelves
but they won't on an iPad meaning you
might as well have them floating
that was what I have for you guys
because if you go into colorblindness
it's quite complex because there is
three the most common one is green red
colorblind but you can be blue red and
green blue as well and there is a very
very very rare one called black and
white colorblind and if you want to be
absolutely sure with your palate that
you don't run into trouble make sure you
always have some other way of hinting
something other than just color just
like I saw you I showed you with the
index where you have a plus and minus in
front no matter what colors you choose
that won't be a problem because the
whoever is colorblind can just refer to
the plus or minus instead so make sure
that you always hint stuff with others
than just colors if you really want to
look into colorblindness look it up
there are simulators on the internet
that will show you how different colors
are shown for various types of
colorblindness so there's a lot to be
done in that way
UX is quite a big field as the reason
I've been speaking here a ton of times
by now and do courses and stuff and and
usually the books that say they have all
of it they only scratch the surface in
all of it
so it basically depends on what you need
are you looking for interaction design
then I would go for Jenny praises
interaction design book if you're
looking for usability tests then I would
go for Jeffrey Reubens usable handbook
on usability tests if you are looking
into doing web forms I would look at
look for brush skis web form book and so
on so forth their books on eye tracking
this books on virtually any of the
topics I've covered here and in all my
other talks so it depends on what you
are in specific need of I would rather
get a specialized book than a
generalized book regarding buttons no
longer looking like buttons and I was
talking about with you sky bank and the
felt of paper and all that all of this
where it looks like the real world very
much like chrome and wood and that sort
of thing is called skeuomorphism
skeuomorphism was important in the
beginning of the digital ages because
people had to relate it to something
they knew because they weren't very
familiar with computers and all all
things digital but by now the digital
age has gone so far that many of us have
grown up with digital items and you
don't necessarily anymore need the link
to the real world to know how it works
because you've been around since it's
been around since you were young
and that's why Microsoft when they
launched the new design principles for
wp7
they had one principle that said
authentically digital
and that meant that you had to be
authentic to the digital world rather
than the physical world because the
digital world is now mature enough to
stand on his own two feet rather than
always being related to the 3d physical
world so that's why and I think it
actually can work to not have the direct
link to the real world should still be
able to see what you can interact with
but it doesn't necessarily have to look
like a radio button on a radio from 1950</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
