data track by talking about data without
actually showing you any data so that's
gonna be fun
um this talk is not necessarily about
the history of data science but it does
have some connections with the history
of science and I think that can be
relevant for for data science also the
title of the countess was presentation
has changed quite a bit
so apologies if it's not exactly what
you expected based on the description
but let's say let's get started
um my name is Lucas ramier I'm a product
owner at booking.com booking.com is the
world's largest accommodations provider
um and so one of the best-kept secrets
of Amsterdam I guess sort of the
elephant in the ecommerce room no one
seems to understand exactly how big big
is we're one of Google's biggest
customers in fact um when I asked Google
if we were still their biggest customer
they said aha yeah and so so we're
pretty big um I am responsible for
experimentation at Boca comm so so when
we make changes to our website we want
to know if people actually like it of
course we do a usability studies we do
lab studies we ask people if they like
it but there's no alternative really for
just trying it out in in the real world
and seeing where their people respond to
your change so we run web scale
experiments where we make changes to our
website and see how people respond and
we have infrastructure in place to do
this and that's where where I come in
so it's partially tooling partially
training a lot of speaking a lot of
telling stories statistics is a
sometimes a difficult subject for people
to grasp but I find that if you tell
stories it's much easier to understand
um this talk is not necessarily about
sauerkraut's but
there will be sauerkraut um let me start
by saying we started this story by
telling you about this ship the HMS
endeavour sailed out of Plymouth on the
6th of August in 1768 and this ship had
two missions one was public and for the
good of science and one was a very very
secret and in fact it was so secret that
the the captain of the ship didn't know
what the mission was he was given an
envelope and told that once he had
completed his first mission he would be
allowed to open up the envelope and read
his instructions and now if you try to
be a data scientist about this and said
well let's just look at the data and see
whether we can figure out what these
guys are gonna do and you you dig up the
ship manifest and the ship manifest
tells you exactly what is onboard this
ship and you look at the manifest and
one thing really sticks out is that
along with all the other things that
would they would usually take in a voice
like this this ship is also carrying
three tons of sauerkraut now I don't
know about you guys I like my fermented
cabbage every once in a while but three
tons of sauerkraut is a lot of
sauerkraut so in this talk I want to
challenge the idea that this was
actually helpful but having all the data
is useful I want to challenge the idea
that in big data all you need is a lot
of data and a smart data scientist and
you can figure everything out and in
this in a sense data or big data it's a
little bit like sauerkraut you can have
a lot of it if you don't know what to do
with it
okay so maybe that analogy doesn't quite
work but um we'll see where we get and
this talk is divided into three chapters
and chapter one is on revolutions maybe
not the kind you were thinking so Thomas
Kuhn wrote an interesting book and he's
under the progress or the scientific
revolutions and he says a very
interesting thing is this progress in
science is not a simple line leading to
the
I say this to people and they say yeah
yeah I know that it's more like a
meandering River that flows towards the
truth they said no no it's not it's not
like that at all
science makes regressions all the time
it's not the exception it's the rule it
steps forward does one step back two
steps forward one step back science is
not a simple progression or a simple
line leading to the truth it's it's with
jumps and starts and movements back and
forth I think a very interesting example
of this if my clicker actually works is
see this clicker it's huge
it's the biggest clicker I've ever seen
it's awesome it's like ancient
technology and so RS Arkansas famous was
a it was a Greek philosopher who lived
three three centuries before Christ and
he had this interesting idea he said if
you're going to build a temple and and
the solar system is the biggest temple I
can think of
then what any God would do is put the
light at the center of the temple so it
illuminates all things now for a Greek
philosopher is a pretty good argument
these days we would hardly accept that
as evidence and but he hypothesized for
the first time that the the stars were
fixed and far away that the earth was
revolving around the Sun rather than the
other way around and this was was widely
accepted in this time on people around
and thought those was a fair point you
know if I build the temple like that I
would put the Sun in the center and and
so this was accepted theory at that time
now um it's very very weak evidence
right there's no there's no data here he
has a model he has reason for believing
that the model is correct but he has no
data to back it up and so along comes
this guy 200 years already 400 years
later clearly spalling told me he tried
to sort of summarize and the ideas of
the ancients he tried to summarize the
all the theories that the Greeks had and
I mean when he came to reason about the
solar system and and what exactly lies
at the center there are really two
competing ideas at the time
the Sun is at the center of the thing
and everything revolves around the Sun
so that's a heliocentric model he do
being the Sun and but there was also the
geocentric model which is the earth is
fixed in at the center of things and
everything revolves Mundi earth and now
these can't be true at the same time so
it only has a problem he has to figure
out which one is true wants to summarize
things and and he says you know this
notion that the that the Earth revolves
or understand is altogether absurd it's
crazy because if if the earth were in
fact revolving around the Sun for us to
have day and night the earth would also
have to spin at the velocity of run one
revolution per day now one revolution
per day they had a pretty good estimate
of the size of the earth at the time so
they calculated how fast the earth must
be moving and he said if the earth is
indeed spinning this fast then any time
I throw something up in the air the
earth will outstrip it and so as you'd
fall to the west this is brewing and
thinking right there so I mean if you
throw it up the earth will spin
underneath it and then stuff falls the
West's right you can run an experiment
try that out
um and so why do you said was I don't
observe this westward motion I don't see
this it's not happening um also if the
earth was actually moving these stars
should be moving relative to each other
because because the movement just like
you're in a car and you see a tree in
the house they move relative to each
other it's called parallax motion and
this was also not seeing the stars are
fixed and and this is a third key point
they had mathematical models juice based
on the idea of geo centricity that
allowed them very accurately to predict
where the planets that they could
observe we're going to be the next day
so they would say I know where Mars is
going to rise I know where a Venus is
going to rise and I'm using this math
that is based on this idea that the
earth isn't the center of things and so
I have no evidence that the other thing
is true in fact I have I have two things
that I should have observed and but I
have math that
or supports the other thing QED quod
erat demonstrandum
therefore it is proven but what actually
he means and this is the key thing here
is that both of these first two points
are an argument from absence of evidence
right
what he is saying is um I have no
observed westward motion no observed
stellar palate parallax and I have
geocentric math that works to explain
what I have actually seen and these
things are key because this westward
motion does actually exist it's called
the Coriolis effect and that took the
about two thousand years before they
actually got to observe it when it
started shooting cannonballs these ken
balls fly so far that you have to start
to correct for this effect and so so
this effect that he's talking about that
he's using his evidence here does
actually exist but he couldn't observe
it because the effect is too small and
the same goes for stellar parallax so
stellar pirate parallax is real it does
exist what you mean this is very good
equipment to be able to observe it but
but it does happen and so basically it's
not QED GED good enough dude right with
with what do I have observed now this
works and so along comes this guy about
a thousand or fifteen hundred years
later and he says hey guys I read this
awesome book by this great guy called
our circus and he has this great idea
that in fact it's everything revolves
around the Sun instead of everything
revolving around the earth now finally
when he prints his famous work on on
these this thing but is his revolutions
Omnibus and he conveniently leaves out
the fact that he got this idea from some
ancient Greek I mean maybe there weren't
enough pages or something but but when
he published it that that little detail
got lost a.m. and one of the interesting
objections to this model at the time was
that this model although we now think
this is simpler because it doesn't
require all the counter revolutions that
were needed in the in the geocentric
model and one of the objectives was that
why is the earth the only one that has a
everything revolves around the Sun
except for the moon this model was not
simpler is more complicated alright and
so interesting thing in the forward that
was written by so this was published on
the year of his death right there was
Copernicus was quite fearful and that it
would be misconstrued as something
against the church so so that the person
who wrote the foreword to his to his
book and said these hypothesis need not
be true nor even probable on the country
every day provide calculus consistent
with the observations that alone is
enough now this is an interesting way to
think about scientific models they don't
have to be true as long as they help you
predict what's what's happening in the
real world I'm not sure I agree with
that point of view but it's interesting
that then that soon they wrote this
under absurd in him actually he didn't
even want to he didn't even want it to
be known that he was the guy who wrote
the foreword for the book so that's how
crazy they were at the time I'm still
there's very little evidence actual
evidence that this is the right model
and this was not accepted when
Copernicus wrote it down people said no
no we have we have the geocentric math
it works fine and until this guy comes
along and this guy is not in in in any
sense of the word a philosopher right
and he the the real breakthrough that
led to the acceptance of the
heliocentric model was not a philosopher
or a theoretical breakthrough it was a
technical logical breakthrough and this
guy built telescopes that's what led to
the acceptance of the heliocentric model
because he built the telescopes that
were better than anyone else had ever
constructed and this allowed him to
observe for the very first time moons
around Jupiter and this is when people
started saying wait a minute if this
place if this other planet also has
moons then then our geocentric model of
math suddenly becomes a lot more
complicated because now we have to
correct not just for this backward
motion we seem to be observing on the
planet itself but also the moons around
it seems to be you know
with it so we need a more complicated
model to make that work and this is what
finally led to the acceptance of the
heliocentric model because that actually
makes this a lot a lot easier to accept
but it's this observation made possible
through better telescopes that finally
led to the acceptance of the
heliocentric model almost 2,000 years
after some guy said you know if you have
a light put it at the center and the key
thing here is that there's there's
always multiple models that can excite
explain the data that you already have
so you have a bunch of data you look at
it you go oh here's a way I could
explain this data and but if you have
multiple models and the way to find out
which model is correct it's usually not
found in the data you have because
that's the data you use to come up with
models in the first place and so it
requires a concerted effort to actually
collect new data usually to the contrary
of one of these of these models to prove
that one or the other is correct so this
brings this notion of having two types
of data there's the data you have you
probably have lots of it and that's okay
you can have lots of it and there's data
you need and they don't necessarily
completely overlap in fact very often
they only overlap but very little and in
cases in cases wasn't abundantly clear
that's the sauerkraut and that's the
science right this is the stuff you have
that you really don't have a need for
and then there's a lot of data that you
actually need that you don't really have
and thinking about this is what the
scientific method is all about that to
me is what data science is all about
chapter 2 transit we talked about
revolutions let's talk about transit and
our Sarkis wrote lots of things and most
of it was lost but the only thing that
was really preserved was on the sizes
and distances where he tries to estimate
the size and distances between the
heavenly bodies that he could observe so
he tried to find how far away is the Sun
from the earth how many earths could you
fit between here and the Sun now he's
doing this using very simple geometry is
actually quite nice if you if you
finished high school basically you can
do this so you don't need any
degree it's super fun if you're bored um
and so what he's using is things like
the solar and the lunar eclipse to try
to estimate in a geometric model the
distances between the between the
planets mm and he comes to this number
and so this is a somewhere between 318
1520 and this this uncertainty isn't his
he wrote down a very definite number but
the unit of measurement he used was a
stat I and the challenge with this is
that depending on inflection this can
mean very different distances and the
the work was transcribed several times
and so we don't know which one he meant
it's like the as if the word meter could
actually describe a meter and a
kilometer and depending on what is a
meter or meter and so this wasn't
preserved and so we don't know if he
actually meant 380 or 15 and 20 so so
it's somewhere in that range um if he
meant 15 20 he's off by one order of
magnitude approximately so it's not so
bad for you know a Greek philosopher
three hundred years before Christ mm and
so and about 2,000 years later along
comes mr. Haly yes from the comet
Halley's Comet and he wrote an
interesting dissertation he said if we
were to observe how Venus moves across
the Sun we can use very similar
geometric math to calculate more
accurately the distance between the
earth and the Sun and the way this works
is you try to observe from different
places on the planet when Venus which is
a tiny speck compared to the Sun when
Venus starts translating the Sun and
when it ends and when you have these
different observations from different
parts of the planet then you can
estimate the parallax so you can
estimate the how the the triangles
between the Sun the earth and and Venus
two of them and this allows you to then
estimate distance and now what you would
need for this is is observations of
Venus crossing the Sun
luckily and this had happened about six
years before the HMS the endeavor left
left
Plumas and that wasn't accidental this
ship was actually going to Tahiti
because they figured if we could make
this observation from England let's go
find some other place on the other side
of the world so we can make the same
observation we also see the transit of
Venus so James crook who's a captain of
the ship sails from Plymouth all the way
around South America to Tahiti and back
the other way for two times times so
forget big data for a moment this is big
like he's actually sailing around the
world for two time stamps but they're
very important time stamps because these
two time stamps should allow us to
calculate how big the solar system is
now James Cook gets the Tahiti on time
which is good because otherwise they'd
have to wait in under two hundred years
so so you get there and the weather is
good it's awesome no clouds and so they
could actually see Venus move across
across the Sun so great right and but
there's a problem
they had three people on Tahiti making
the same observation and they got two
very different numbers and the reason
was that the once Venus starts crossing
the Sun there is a an effect called the
black drop effect where the the
backlighting of the Sun causes it to
appear as if Venus is merging with the
edge of the Sun and this makes it very
difficult to say when does the crossing
actually start and so the three people
making observations in in Tahiti
disagreed more than they would have
liked the margin of error was a lot a
lot bigger and so they were at a right
time right place right idea just an
insufficiently accurate telescope bummer
luckily a jérôme Lalande a few years
later could still use this data to
estimate the distance between the the
earth and the Sun and then he came to
about 24,000 or a3i which is as about 2%
off so I mean the real number is like
23,000
four hundred and something so it's not
too bad it's actually pretty good
considering they thought the mission was
a failure
um so the key here is that science is
limited by the data we can collect and
that data is actually limited by
engineering more than you think and so
if you think about doing good science
it's not just not just about having the
right idea I mean our stock has had the
right idea about the heliocentric model
but it took two thousand years for them
to actually be able to collect the data
that they could use to prove that this
model was correct and here what happened
to James Cook is that they actually had
this the right Mothe or the right place
the right time but then they didn't have
an telescope that was accurate enough to
make the actual measurements so you're
still limited by engineering
I think Elon Musk put it very well in an
interview he said in the absence of
engineering you do not have to date that
you that hitted limit it can be real
smart within the context of the limit of
the data you have but unless you have a
way to make more data you can't make
progress and this is key if you work
only with the data you have you're never
going to make progress you have to think
about the data you need to create in
order to progress so this brings us back
to this model whether it's data you have
and data you need and I think what's
often overlooked is that both of these
are dwarfed by the data you could create
if you think you have a lot of data now
just think of all the data you could
create now I'm not suggesting you should
because storing all of that is going to
be a nightmare and most of it is going
to be useless but it is useful to think
about the data you could create as
opposed to the data you have and if they
say you need we'll come back to that
later
first Chapter three transmutation this
brings us to alchemy so this really irks
me this rattles my nerves when people
write stuff like this when people talk
about data science often they're using
analogies that are worse than using
sauerkraut they talk about data as the
new oil the new crude the gold to be
found the nuggets to be dug up by some
day and some mythical data scientist is
going to find it for you um and this to
me is not science this is this is
alchemy
and just before the the Scientific
Revolution many of the people who were
also chemists were also alchemists and
one of the things they tried to achieve
was this this Philosopher's Stone this
legend there is a substance that would
allow you to turn lead into gold or
crude into oil if you will and and I
think a lot of the rhetoric around data
science is very similar in in in this
sense that it doesn't matter what kind
of data you have just bring a data
scientist on board and they can turn it
into something really valuable and to me
them this is the data science versus
data alchemy yeah economy and a good
example of this is Kegel your home for
data science and so that the cattle is a
website where companies can put data
sets and questions and data scientists
or machine learners will come and try to
solve them um but the way this works is
that as a company you have already
defined exactly what the problem was
like you have already defined exactly
what the data looks like you've already
defined how the data is collected how
it's stored how its encoded and you also
decide what the outputs going to be all
that's left to do is transfer the
translation from one to the other from
the input data to the output data M so
this leads to a very peculiar kind of
thinking where if you give people
channels like this so people who are
used to the kaggle way of thinking if
you give them a challenge to say well we
have a bunch of hotel reviews on this
website booking a conference and we want
to show something good something bad we
want to show what's good about this
hotel and what's not good about this
hotel now if you ask someone who's
accustomed to the idea of receiving data
as is and then thinking about ways to
turn it into gold then there will come
up with something like this sentiment
analysis formulas try to find out
whether you can find the words that are
key that tell you what the sentiment of
the sentence is this is very hard
because humans use irony and sarcasm and
humor and those things don't translate
very well into into computer speak and
we
so SoCal go to me is like like cackle to
me real machine learning is like chess
is the war right it it's it's an
interesting mental exercise it's
probably part of the entire entire thing
but it just isn't everything the large
part of the struggle is actually
figuring out what data you need to
collect how to collect it how to encode
it and what the outputs going to be so
if you give a challenge like this to
what I would call a data scientist they
would come up with something like this
you give people two boxes and one box
you put a smiley face on it and you say
what did you like and the other box you
put a frowny face on you say what did
you not like accuracy 99.9 percent this
is better than any algorithm can ever
give you because we get all the positive
sentiment in one box and all the
negative sentiment and the other box
it's almost perfect we solve the problem
at data collection stage and now I hear
you thinking this is too easy
yes it's too easy is that a problem
so thinking about the data you create or
you could create is actually useful
because it makes many problems a lot
easier well I want to walk through a few
of these to give you an idea of how this
model could be used so if you have data
that you have but you don't need at the
moment but you could also never recreate
it do you delete it or do you archive it
so that's a tough decision because if
you delete it you can never get back
this the same is not true for the data
you have you don't need but you could
recreate right so I have some data if I
really needed it in the future I could
recreate it so then can I delete it well
what's the what's the cost of recreating
this data that's a versus what is the
cost of storing it so now it's obvious
that these two types of data are very
different in the sense that that I have
to think about how I would use them on
the other side of the spectrum and this
happens a lot in in my world and
experimentation is there's data I need
but I don't have and I cannot create I
would really like to know when we run
experiments on on booking.com I would
really like to know
whether people love it sadly I I can't
put probes in people's brains and you
know figure out what they love it but
because you know I'll be better not nice
um and so we have to find proxies for
the thing I actually want to know but
it's good that I know that what I need I
cannot get because then I know why I'm
looking for proxies and I realize that
the things I'm using are actually
proxies for the thing I can't get so
here's a here's an example of some of
this stuff being applied at booking.com
we wrote a paper for 4k DD 10 asses and
Matz did I wasn't involved in myself I
only reviewed it um but I think it's an
interesting application of data science
so we wanted to send out an email that
says does this sound like you our team
of travel scientists have thought long
and hard about your next holiday and
based on your past adventures they think
you have a passion for and then we'd
come up with reasons that you go on
different trips now to do this you need
some past places people have gone to but
you also need to know why they went
there and so one way one way to figure
out why people go to a particular place
is to skip to that is to scrape
Wikipedia but you girls just ask them so
we asked them why why did you go to
willing and I didn't click any of the
boxes because none of the reasons were
actually in willing and but um so so we
sent out this email that that suggests
these things are relevant for you and so
some people loved it and some people
really hated it like you should probably
fire your team of travel scientists hard
to be more wrong and so the cool thing
here is that we look at this and we go
well that's that's qualitative data
right it's not quantitative I mean the
the uplift is there this totally worked
so the first email campaign is sending
out this thing all the numbers like in
science if something is significant you
make it bold so all the numbers in our
paper are bold because sample size mm
and so so it was a really very very
successful email campaign and then this
feedback comes in where people say well
yeah it's hard to be more wrong you
should probably fire travel scientists
and some people even thought it was
creepy and so because I thought a human
was looking at there
because it says travel scientists
rainless people so we sent out the
second email campaign this almost
doubled the impact of the entire thing
and I do this presentation at
conferences for machine learning and
people asked what parameters did you
tune did you change the model is there a
new data feature that you fed into the
thing have you have you figured out a
smarter way to no no we took out two
words travel scientists people thought
it was creepy so we replaced it by
something that didn't suggest a human
had looked at their bookings and we
doubled the impact right so this data is
very valuable because it tells you
something about what users perceive when
they get this thing and if you have a
data scientist that only thinks within
the context of the data that they have
to build the model
they're never gonna figure this one out
and so double the impact remove two
words so deciding what data to collect
and how is a fundamental step in the
scientific method and it's limited both
by theory and by engineering and by
humans you have to have the right people
to think about these things
um I think then there's one slide to
remember is it is this one so some of us
are a philosopher some of us come up
with a theory like our Sarkis and it
doesn't even have to be well founded by
data theory as long as it's a somehow
disprovable that's good enough um and
some of us will build telescopes and I
think at a conference like this you're
more likely to be telescope builders and
philosophers and but do not
underestimate the importance of your
role if you say well I just do data
collection right that's the easy part
no it's not that's the hard part at
scale that's difficult counting is hard
rounding errors are problematic floating
point is tricky right good data
collection is really really difficult
and so don't underestimate the
importance of that and with in relation
to today's scientific method so when I
do interviews I live and die by this I
judge a man by his question rather than
his answers I give a data scientist the
problem if they solve it that's nice if
they ask questions that make me think
a good one that's one I want so with
that questions do you have to pass my
car into someone that's question yes I
got one other question and yep and it's
sending out recommendation Seymour not
very critical to be actually correct
do you use data signs for actually
critical decisions where you can't
afford being wrong so an example of
where you can't afford to be wrong
financial transactions I wouldn't use
this and I wouldn't use an experiment
there but we we use experiments for
pretty much everything
and so even infrastructure changes are
run as controlled experiments and I
think can you so so one thing is you can
you afford to be wrong and the other is
can you afford not to know so if you
make a change and you say well I'm going
to make this change but I'm not going to
run an experiment on it I'm not going to
validate that this is the right thing by
having a good control then you're
essentially saying I don't care if I'm
incorrect about this thing and that it
doesn't improve the metric in the way I
thought it was going to and that's okay
I mean if if you think the risk is
greater how much do we have time or yeah
we've comp of minutes left so if there
are other questions as well so let me so
much so my job is looking is tell
stories right then they called a
statistical story so I have one that
fits here
so the two statisticians are hiking in
the woods
it's always about size efficiency
stories and and you can imagine the
types right they've got big wellies
hands up to here big glasses bit nerdy
and so they're hiking because that's
what they want to do in their spare time
and it starts to rain and they don't
like rain so they start to look for
shelter and in the distance they see a
cave and so they run up to the cave and
the first statistician says I'm going to
go inside to check if it's safe okay
second guy stays outside
first guy goes in rounds a corner and
about five seconds after he rounds the
corner the second guy standing outside
hears a loud roar
and something that sounds like ruffling
of a big hairy beast and then then
silence
now the second guy standing outside is a
statistician so he says look that was
not a representative sample of
statisticians it also wasn't a very
large sample size I didn't have a
control there might be lots of
confounders going on but I'm not going
inside because if there is a bear in
there I don't want to know
and so when you ask like do you have
decisions that are too risky oh yeah yes
but then you decide between knowing and
risk and you say this risk is so great
that I don't want to know I don't care
I'll stand outside I'll be wet that's ok
as long as you know that's what you did
yeah good point
ok what time for one question left so if
it's one I said thank you
no one asked about sauerkraut I have all
these slides a direct questions what is
sauerkraut but I think okay what is that
guy's so sauerkraut is fermented cabbage
so it's a German dish I have five
minutes awesome I can do my slides and
so man one minute left I'm really
disappointed in you guys like I put this
teaser in two of them actually and no
one asks cuz I have another one
um so M cook brought sauerkraut because
scurvy was a disease that was plaguing
the ships where your teeth thought your
fault out fall out and you die it's not
it's not great and they had some idea
that it might be caused by lack of fresh
fruit and vegetables actually one of the
first experiments ever lint and he gave
a few sailors a fresh fruit and it
totally worked too bad they ran out of
fresh fruit real quick it's hard to
bring fresh fruit on the boat and so
they thought maybe if we bring
sauerkraut that'll work and so they
brought three tons of sauerkraut to feed
it to the sailors to see if that would
cure scurvy and turns out they cook
didn't have a lot of scurvy on the ships
but it wasn't because of the sauerkraut
was for other reasons so again difficult
to make a make a good reading and scurvy
is a good example of science making
making these regressions again so as I
was researching this every time I look
scientific progress I find these
regressions in the case of scurvy the
the English Navy figured out that you
had to eat limes sour fruit - and you
wouldn't get scurvy so awesome then in
the 18th century ships got faster and
they went to India and they found that
the Indian limes were actually cheaper
than the Mediterranean ones so they ran
an experiment swapping them and they
found no difference so they said well
let's use those the reason they found no
difference because by then the ships
were so fast that no one actually got in
his curvey anyway there were eating
limes for nothing and by the 19th
century someone wanted to go to the
North Pole and and figured out that they
were gonna get scurvy along the way this
problem dad so we should do what the
Navy does and they brought lime juice
and it didn't work and they all got
scurvy because you know there's not
enough vitamin C in the in the Indian
limes and they hadn't figured out that
it was vitamin C yet because you need a
very very very good reading it's a very
small molecule and and so they rejected
the idea that it was these limes that
helped fight scurvy so they had the
right model they actually had a solution
then they tried it out if I go wait this
doesn't work they rejected the entire
thing and they went to a model where
they said scurvy is caused by a disease
in meat that's not fresh which is
entirely wrong but that's the model they
adopted and then in the 1950s that's
when they finally were able to detect
vitamin C and said wait a minute
actually it's a deficiency illness it's
caused by lack of vitamin C and that's
when they when they rediscovered the
fact that these fresh fruits to help
against scurvy so it's another example
of science going yeah yeah I gotta go oh
nope and again and this happens all the
time so it's very you and thank you
Lucas good
