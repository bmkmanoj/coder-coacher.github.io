me or my cousin so I used to speak a lot
because they used to be in a start-up
and when you're gonna start up you
actually want people to know what you're
doing and then I went to this company I
can't remember the name of it because oh
I know I saw it in the airport this
morning Oracle and when you're a big
company you don't want people to know
what you're doing because that would
that would only confuse them and you
don't want to confuse the by you want to
make things simple right so you tell
them things like oh we're the top 10 in
top 10 signs or the nothing we're the
top 10 in number one an airport
advertising a little better all right so
it's it's no kidding it's been three
years since I spoke at a non Oracle
event which is you know that's it's like
long enough for for for Java died like
12 times you know like Swift is gonna
kill it no pythons gonna kill it again
let's see I used to do a lot of speaking
and so I'd you know the easiest way to
come up with something was you know that
to write down everything you know but
the problem is if I told you what I knew
like you'd ignore it and that's that's
the problem when you give a presentation
you got to kind of sneak the message in
right because if you come out and you
say it like this is my message I want
you to learn something people like you
know like nobody wants to listen to a
message because you guys know everything
right anybody here not know everything
one two okay wrong industry like if you
don't feel like you know everything you
shouldn't be working with computers and
you know like my kids know everything
you know it's like I turned on the can
doing it wrong so I used to make these
top-ten lists and I used to kind of
invert them and be like the top 10 ways
to really screw up your application and
the funny thing is is people would
actually learn from that I'm gonna
invert it today back to normal just cuz
I'm lazy but you know I used to make fun
of things like C++ anyone here ever use
C++ man I'm sorry me too
I still use it some but supposedly it's
getting better
and I used to have hair you know I'm
doing the rod Johnson and it wasn't all
going gray and yeah I'm coming to be sad
old man and that's all I got
all right so you know I have to
apologize I got to start by apologizing
because a couple months ago or years I'm
not sure when like Gaeta calls me up and
she's like I want you to come and speak
it go to Chicago to be great and I'm
like hey I haven't spoken in public in
awhile and I don't I don't have any
presentations yeah no problem I'll just
make up a title and put it in the all
right our case should be fine you know
we always enjoy a good time and so she
put the future of Java so guess who in
this room is not responsible for the
future Java but is on stage okay any
anybody all right so so I started you
know coming up with some like
alternative presentations I was gonna do
so instead of it you know the problem
the futures job is like I really did
that presentation back in 2011 right at
the Java language summit so if you want
to see me talk about the future of Java
which you know you still haven't
finished yet you know I this is I put
the list together of what we needed in
Java it's all there you can write down
the URL the problem is if I talk about
the future I got to put a legal
disclaimer on my slides and it sucks it
like ruins the whole deck all right and
I thought George was actually gonna be
speaking at the conference and talking
about the future Java but I did see it
Atilla here and others I'm sure you're
gonna get lots actually I'll mention a
little bit on what I think about the
future Java later on in the presentation
so you know I was like thinking ok you
know what would I present on so it's
like last night and I'm sitting there
you know thinking okay I've got a couple
hours before I fly out I've got to you
know put together a presentation what am
i what am I gonna talk about and so you
know I started working on titles so my
first one was the top 10 top 10
presentations I ever did present I
didn't go over so well how about the
anyway let's get that let's see this one
should speak for itself as you can tell
I don't do as much programming anymore
because I'm now pointy-haired boss you
know so I mostly do golfing what else do
I do
sailing golfing schmoozing mostly
schmoozing and in PowerPoint in Excel
I'm really good at Excel so if you ever
need help with Excel like I can show you
how to sort a column or sum it up oh and
I settled on this the top ten stories
from my elicited are you watching it's
like PowerPoint magic check this out
watch look at that and I swear to God I
figured out how to do all this last
night wait because anyone here ever like
build and deliver a presentation come on
let's see some hands right isn't amazing
like you spend like four minutes like
putting the content together in like six
hours like one pixel over yeah so I'm
gonna start with number 10 and I've told
this story a few times but you know I
bought this book years ago and it was
called the seven Habits of Highly
Effective People I think because I
wanted to be one of them and so I opened
the book and the first chapter is called
begin with the end in mind I was like oh
that's a great idea like think about
where you're going begin with the end in
mind and then I started reading as I can
this book sucks and it just I never
finished chapter one but I it did remind
me of this story of a father and his son
the young son I don't know maybe five
years old and they're outside on a snowy
day and they're standing there in the
yard and you know the son is like trying
to beat his father at one competition or
another and he says to his dad you know
I bet I could walk in a straighter line
than you and the dad says ok see that
tree over there go go walk to that tree
and let's see who can walk in a
straighter line and the little boy he
starts walking and he starts you knees
very carefully balancing he's putting
one foot in front of the other and he
turns around his dad's like still
standing there and you
okay finally gets over to that tree and
he turns around he looks back and like
his his path is all like like s's right
because he's been watching his feet and
trying to make every step perfect and
that instead of thinking where he's
going and the dad you know just walks
over I'm taking you know looking at the
tree and taking the longest steps he can
and you know and of course not every
step was perfect but the line itself was
was close to perfect and it's yeah it's
one of those you know heart-rending
stories but the concept is actually
really good it's like sometimes we get
so stuck in the details
you know we forget about you like that
number 10 begin with the end in mind
that was number 10 that's the first one
begin okay tough crowd so you know
they're a couple difference obviously
you can apply this to technical things
you know if you're looking for example
at some of the work going on in in Java
9 you know a lot of the a lot of the
writing that goes into the the concepts
of what's coming it's it's it's
arguments about and I don't mean
arguments in the you know he said she
said or I'm right you're wrong not that
kind of argument more like a legal
argument like a weighty thought about
how how can we make decisions that we
won't look back on and and feel we're
like the wrong decisions like Jack's
second
like how can we how can we make
decisions that are good but you know I
think as well you know I unfortunately
I've got into management so I don't get
to make technical decisions anymore but
you know I see the same thing you know
in terms of managing whether it's
managing technical people or others you
know having having a concept of where
you're trying to end up whether it's a
technical goal or whether it's you know
whether it's a moral goal in a sense
right so what are the things that you're
trying to accomplish think about you
know make your decisions based on that I
wanted to give an example of this and
from from my own personal history so in
2006 we had a company approached us we
were still in a start-up and this
company approached us you know offering
offering to buy the company our our
startup and you know it was we've gotten
lots of offers over the years but this
was the first time we got an offer that
was actually big enough that we didn't
laugh at it no it wasn't the right
number but the problem is when you have
shareholders you have to represent the
interests of shareholders it's what you
call a fiduciary responsibility in fact
I've been using the word fiduciary a lot
lately sorry inside joke about the back
Jack
so the when you have a fiduciary
responsibility you have to take into
account the decisions that others would
make if they had access to that same
information because you're responsible
for making decisions potentially on
their behalf and so we sat down as a
board and we walked through it very
carefully you said okay let's forget
this particular offer let's forget all
those things let's start by asking the
question you know what is it we would
want to accomplish in an acquisition
what would the goals be what are the
things that you know and we laid them
out and we prioritize them item by item
and you have to understand I'm the
world's least organized person if you
couldn't tell by the fact that I was
writing a presentation at midnight last
night so to take that time to do it
the the gift it gave back was really
simple as we went through the process of
the acquisition every time we had to
make a decision we just looked at the
list I mean the list we didn't have to
look at a whiteboard or something I mean
it was in the head right but we'd say
okay does it meet or defeat this goal
does it meet and we just went through it
and basically every decision ended up
pretty much making itself through the
process you know one of the interesting
one of the interesting things out of it
was that in the end you know we chose a
company out of the number of companies
that were bidding on our startup we
chose a company that was far from the
highest bidder
in in that process because we had made
the decisions not based on you know just
random like what's the amount of money
or whatever we had we had made those
decisions based on those priorities and
it made it very easy not just to make
the decisions but then to look back and
explain why we've made them number nine
managed to your pain has anyone ever
heard anything like this managed to your
pain this is this is probably the only
brilliant management thing I ever came
up with so when we were a start-up you
know a compare and contrast being a
small start-up and being a large
bureaucratic organization we had a
support system right so if someone
bought our software they could call up
for support makes sense right we had a
fully automated system so they'd call up
you know press one if you don't want to
speak to a human press two if you'd like
to hear this menu again press 3 if you
want to hear something other no I'm
kidding we had a really had a nice so
basically they'd call up they'd leave a
number and they would get a call back
within 30 minutes that was that was our
support policy there get a call back
from someone who was an engineer not
from someone who was not an engineer but
our support policy was really simple
we'd give a customer a piece of paper
and it said ok these are the three
numbers one is the toll-free number that
gets you know that you leave your
message on
the second number on the list was the
cellphone of the CEO of the company so
if you didn't get a call back in 30
minutes
the next person you were calling maybe
waking up out of bed was the guy in
charge of the entire support process
personnel etc and the third number is
the number that's in the phone I put in
my bag that was my cell phone number so
why would you do that and the answer is
you want to manage to your pain right
you want to say if something goes wrong
it needs to hurt who does it need dirt
right in a big company who does it need
to hurt and a big company you want to
hurt the person you pay the least okay
you want to pick someone half a world
away am i touching some sore spots think
about it though like compare the DMV you
know with a neighborhood cafe or
something you know where the owner is
they're serving you and in trying to win
your business right think about the
faceless bureaucracy versus that that
personal level of service managed to
your pain says if something goes wrong
make it hurt and make it hurt the person
who can fix it so in eight years of
business I got zero calls we had lots of
support calls by the way not because
there is anything wrong with our
software it was perfect I'm sure but
because we managed to the pain if
something went wrong it was caught by
someone who could fix it I'm ray finally
get to talk about something technical
random is awesome or stochastic is
fantastic that's pretty good right go
you like that so what do I mean by this
Gil you probably know where I'm headed
this is one of the things I
I wish I could like turn this into a a
project so if there's anyone out there
that thinks how this is a cool idea like
stick this in j-unit please so it turns
out that testing is very difficult right
you've seen the unit tests right you
write them as like new class well that
worked next unit test new class dot add
X right and so on and it's like you have
you know fifty three unit tests they all
test like one little thing and you're
done then you ship it and it breaks cuz
it didn't work if you're listening to
Martin this morning you heard about all
the concurrent stuff for example things
like that so you know as I was trying to
figure out how could we solve how can we
solve certain classes of problems that
we were seeing in terms of data
structures and things like that came up
with this idea not that its original I
mean there's fuzzing and things like
that but what we did is we've created
dsls for specific things that we were
testing and when I say DSL what is DSL
mean it means I made up some strings and
each one of them had a meaning that's
all a DSL is its it sells books but it's
a lot simpler so basically if you think
of this user pointer hand planner yeah
so this thing on the left so basically
for every function that we wanted to
test yeah sure we had some static unit
tests for it but we'd create an operator
or a verb in the DSL for that operation
for that function point or sometimes
it's a you know more complex set of set
of function points that get that go
together and then we would randomize
creation of a test and the way the test
would get created is we create a control
case so for every data structure we're
testing we'd either reuse something that
was existing but you know safe
or we'd create a control case that was
allowed to be simple but inefficient and
then as we created the test we would
actually apply each random operation
against the control case
so that we had a state an expected state
for every step of the opera for every
step of the test and so that the
operations themselves are not truly
random they would either be purposely
correct operations to test some
operation that should succeed or
purposely incorrect operations to test
something that should fail and so it
would create if you will a list of
operations and this is a ran fully
randomized test and then we would run
the test and when we ran the test we'd
create a new controls data structure
we'd create that subject of the test
itself
we'd execute the step list of steps in
the test and any time after each step by
the way it would do a comparison both of
the result so it would compare the you
know return codes for example route it
compare exceptions if if any it would
compare what else well yeah the state of
the object itself right so basically
each one of these operations was being
compared between a controlled case and
the data structure being tested and then
when it found the failure it would
actually go through and act asked each
one of the verbs to print themselves out
and it would here let me actually show
you although I don't know where they
found these EGA projectors so if this
doesn't work don't be surprised let's
see
does anyone know what EGA is or am I
just really that freaking old CGA no yes
so here we go so so this was an example
of one of the tests I rode and you can
see you know it's chugging along it's an
assertion error something didn't match
right so it prints out the one versus
the other and then it shows me the test
code to represent its new data structure
not this one a different I had a
Christmas break so that's the only time
I get to code is when I'm on vacation
and I you know I I wrote you know
there's typical 53 unit tests for it and
then with this approach I proceeded to
write another 15 billion tests but only
kept the ones that failed because each
one of them became a regression test so
like if for example come on Mouse I know
how to use a computer don't worry but if
I don't I'm sure if someone can help me
here
how do you do that is there such a thing
you just messin with me
view where is that I think your
presentation would do that so cool I'm
in the wrong one
mm-hmm hang on wrong tab do I know what
I'm doing
no not that one
all right let's go back out of this so I
can get to the right tab thank you
that's perfect let's see no not that one
what happened to my other tabs yeah this
crap all right now I'm looking stupid
all right let's try this again
where'd you go idea was not meant for
this by the way cuz it's no longer your
appearing on my screen okay code
examples are gonna be a slightly
difficult and not this one hmmm how do
you exit the full screen
all right somebody told me the keystroke
on Mac for getting out of the fullscreen
thing control/command f thank you some
reason that seems to have closed all my
tabs
okay look at this one
so where was i before I was so
embarrassed
was talking test this wasn't oh yes so
these are examples of some of those
those tests I was describing so
basically every time it would hit an
assertion a failure or something
something went wrong in the test prints
out the source code you take the source
code you slap it into your your test you
have a new unit test use that as a
regression test so now you can now you
can debug it so apparently I had 42 bugs
that I found using this there's a good
number right it's like you know one zero
one zero one no cut them anyway close
all right let's go back to the
presentation obviously I'm more
comfortable in PowerPoint I can change
my mind about having that recording
posted to me so let's go forward so
randomized test certainly one of my
favorite the things of late never give
in so this there's a common
misconception that Churchill gave the
speech called never give up but it turns
out it's never give in it's interesting
has anyone actually read that speech
anybody just a couple little hands
nobody like stood up and said yeah so
it's a long speech but I'm gonna read
the whole thing just kidding
now actually the the beautiful thing
about the speech and I'd encourage you
to read it by the way you know search
for never given Churchill there's a
beautiful part of it that that you know
the first 50 times I read it I never
noticed but if going back it it strikes
me you know Churchill his entire life
a failure except for one little short
period of time called world war 2
basically everything he did before World
War 2 was a complete and utter failure
in fact the worst battle the worst
losses for the English in World War one
was Churchill making some you know gut
decision to attack an impossible
position to attack and so on some cliffs
on somewhere in the Mediterranean or
something he was just a completely
horrible like tactician strategist or
whatever strategy
but in World War two he somehow like
found that that vein if you will and and
what I loved about the speech this was a
speech he gave at the school he went to
as a child and he went to visit them and
they had rewritten they had added a
verse to the school song in honor of
Churchill but what I what I thought was
amazing is this this actually happened
during the war you know when things
looked pretty bleak and the amazing
thing that he did in this speech is as
follows but I just want to read one
paragraph the ten months that have
passed have seen very little terrible
I've seen very terrible catastrophic
events in the world ups and downs
misfortunes by misfortune see means the
Battle of Britain you know London
basically being raised by bombs dropping
on it he says but can anyone sitting
here this afternoon
this October afternoon and feel deeply
and not feel deeply thankful for what
has happened in the time that has passed
and for the very great improvement in
the position of our country in our home
so he took what for most people would
have been like the depths of despair and
he turned to dry he said don't you see
those things that we have to be thankful
for and he said one of the best lines
that's up on the screen he said we only
have we have only to persevere to
conquer in other words here was someone
who saw beyond kind of
current situation the current despair
the current you know the current
travesty he saw over that hill you know
to something beyond and he said all we
have to do is keep going and we'll get
there like I can see the light at the
end of the tunnel and I love when I when
I build a presentation and I usually
take much more time it usually takes me
over an hour a slide which is why these
are so crappy apologize for the quality
of the text but I could only draw so
many pixels and normally I like to put
pictures on and stuff like that but the
the story I wanted to tell and when I
build a presentation it's all about a
story the slides are just there to kind
of give you something to look at while I
well they talk but I have this this
beautiful story when I first was at
Oracle you know we were this tiny little
company coming into this giant behemoth
and I remember you know we wanted to get
Oracle consulting to work with us right
now you would think being at Oracle
having been purchased by Oracle that you
know they'd send someone from consulting
to talk to us and be like yeah we want
to be able to do consulting on your
software right right yeah nobody's
nodding except nodding off okay so
nobody came to us right so we had to
like go search them out obviously they
weren't managing to their pain right so
we had to go search them out and like
beg them to do this and like okay fine
we've got one guy who nobody wants to
hire you can you can talk to him right
here's a consultant talk to him like
well okay it's better than nothing
you know one is better than nothing so
this guy was a fairly junior consultant
you know we could tell you had a lot of
passion a lot of eagerness to learn
we're like yeah we can work with this
and he started learning and he's like oh
this is fun he started learning and
learning and then we get an email saying
yeah you know I really love this product
I love working on it so I've written
some code for you guys that I want you
to
the product George is smiling because
George is thinking oh this sounds so
familiar
managing Java and so we're like oh
that's great you know and we go and we
look at the code and we're like oh
that's not so great
okay we're gonna draw straws to pick
who's gonna go tell this guy that you
know thanks but you know maybe maybe
McDonald's is hi you know this is yeah
so um I'm exaggerating a little bit in
terms of we didn't say McDonald so we're
talking Dunkin Donuts but we're in
Boston come on
Boston so one of our architects went and
talked to him said look really
appreciate what you doing but your code
does not meet our standard and I'm not
talking coding standard I'm talking
about you know the borrower it doesn't
meet it you know from a design point of
view it doesn't mean it from a quality
point of view it's not coming in and you
know that's a pretty hurtful thing to
tell someone right because everyone
thinks their codes better than everyone
else's right so finding out that it's
not as pretty crushing for a programmer
anyway didn't hear from him I think he
went off who knows what happened to him
and then we got an email said I get it
now I get what you were trying to say
and it hurt but I'm gonna show you that
I can learn and get up to that level and
didn't hear anything for a while we knew
that he was working on various projects
with customers and stuff and actually
they were being successful and happy
customers and then we heard he had you
know taking a different job insider work
only like oh well lost all that
investment you know we taught this guy
how to use our software I taught him how
to build things and so on
you know trained someone else you know
whatever well it turns out he didn't
just leave he went and built architected
Oracle's elastic charging engine
and I just I stole this from a coherence
marketing deck so grains of salt and
everything else just assume it's all
exaggerated and marketing lies and
nonsense but still even if you like
water it down it's like holy cow three
billion SMS events processed per hour on
sixteen CPUs that's more than the entire
world's SMS traffic well back a year ago
or two when the slide was made I'm sure
it's more now so here's a guy who's like
you know I got two choices hey I could
give up or I could take it as a
challenge
and I this is I think you know just
watching a challenge like that sink in
and settle into someone and watching
watching them bloom it's just it's a
wonderful thing so on that topic Oh
how much time do I have what am I
supposed to finish I thought this was
two hours okay I got to move quicker
then bag burn it you told me two hours
so on that topic you always want to
embrace criticism like if there's one
thing you want to get good at cuz it's
the hardest thing to get good at is be
open to criticism because nobody likes
to be criticized anybody here love to be
criticized
one couple sick people I have but you
know it is hard it is really hard to
take criticism but always require a
better option this is one of the rules
we always had in development like you
can criticize anything as so we had a
guy from the Ukraine so you know kind of
Russians like Ukraine speaking and of
course he used to obliterate the English
language so one of the sayings in
English is there's no sacred cows
so his was there's no sacred cows so we
had no sacred gas house our motto but
basically what it meant is it doesn't
matter whose idea it is it's open for
criticism just be willing if you're
gonna come and criticize you have to
have a better plan and it's a great
great rule of thumb because it forces
people to do the homework not just of
sitting back and poking fun at something
but actually doing the work to come up
with something better I love this I've
been working on trying to figure out how
to make this a rule but does it support
recursion George you're laughing did I
talk to you about this one I'm thinking
of this is the new litmus test in fact
think about it like this anyone know why
a for paper is special without looking
at the screen it recursive cuz a4 paper
is actually half the size of a 3 and a 3
is half the size anyone know what the
number 1618 is 1.618 golden ratio yeah
this guy's good you should be speaking
what this means what's the thing about
it technically for a second everyone
wants to write Maine do you know what I
mean like everyone wants to be the one
who writes the method main right I would
say there should never ever be a Maine
longer than one line of code because I'm
on stage and I get to make audacious
claims that have no basis in fact but
what I mean by that is everything you
write in terms of software think of it
in a conceptual manner everything should
both be a container and a contain e in
other words you should both be composing
and be composable so when you think
about good software that you've worked
with things that you like using and
reusing it's composable
in nature to leave what do you think
does this ring a bell
like you want to be able to compose
things out if you want to be able to
reuse it without rewriting it usually
when we say we use we mean
you want to be able to reuse it you want
to be able to embed it in something else
and then if you do it well your
maintenance up being one line of code
this doesn't just apply to software this
also applies to organizations
organizations should be composable
decision-making should be composable in
other words if you are a manager and
you're telling someone who works for you
to do something that you would not
tolerate being told it sounds like the
golden rule so I wonder where the golden
ratio came into this if you think about
it all the golden rule is is recursion
simple recursion like would you can you
describe yeah I'm not mathematical so
I'll go into the next point I love this
one in elegant designs are almost always
wrong I put almost because I was afraid
that someone could prove that there was
some an elegant design sometime in the
history of software that was actually
right but here's the thing complexity is
the enemy
our entire industry really has one
purpose which we fail horribly at which
is to manage complexity okay think about
the things you use online why you like
them one one reason you like them is
because they actually let you get
something done without having to like
remember 53 passwords and etc etc like
very simple so in software anytime you
encounter a design that's not simple
it's almost always wrong what I was
gonna say about this I was gonna go into
a big example with state machines and
stuff but I'll tell you a quick example
because it's it's a lot easier and I
don't have to go to the code editor
which makes me look like a moron when we
wrote coherence the first release of
coherence we didn't actually ship and
that's because we hit a bug in the
software and to fix it the source code
doubled in size the number lines med not
to point zero times but it was roughly
twice the size after we fixed the bug we
looked at it and we said you know
something's wrong if the code has to
double in size to fix that we threw it
away and we started again so coherence -
OH
we finished about to ship hit a bug
guess what happened I went to fix it
source code which was this time much
larger than the one oh of course doubled
in size by the time we fixed that bug
and the reason is because you can't code
your way out of a design flaw the only
way to make software work is to design
it to work you design the edge
conditions out on the whiteboard not in
the code people and relationships are
always a good investment and sometimes
the investment is you what do I mean by
this well I don't get the code as much
anymore and if you can't tell by now it
makes me sad he said but you know I love
coding but I will tell you the one thing
in my job that has replaced that joy
that I would get from coding is actually
when I see people in our organization
when I see them grow whether it's grow
technically whether it's grow in terms
of being a manager or you know build new
capabilities and into what they can what
they can do and I would say that you
know even though I'm very unfortunate to
have lost some really really good people
over the years I never have ever
regretted investing in them and watching
them watching them leave or or whatever
so what I would say is this like if you
ever get tired of writing software you
know the next thing you should be
architecting you know as organizations
as people you know because the rewards
there are just like that that feeling
that joy and yeah anyone read the
mythical man-month
yeah quite a few I love that book
that first chapter where he talks about
castles out of air and the joy of
creating it's that same joy you know
that you see from the growth of people
that you work with on that topic the
bark is worse than a bite and this is
this is the hardest one of the hardest
things I've ever had to learn
which is to say you see a problem you
have to deal with it and typically the
hard problems are not technical problems
anyone here think technical problems are
harder than people problems because I
find like technical problems I could
deal with them all day no problem but
people problems wear me out like like a
bad shoe so I had an employee actually a
friend personal friend of mine from from
back in my school days back in nineteen
not 12 anyway great great friend great
guy a brilliant guy and but the problem
was it just wasn't working and we tried
X we tried why we tried Z and like
nothing that we tried would work we put
him on one project with him there was
conflict only couldn't feel like and I'd
worked with this guy before and he was
brilliant like he and I had built some
really cool stuff at a previous company
we had worked at and it's like it's like
I know he's brilliant I know this should
be what you know is so frustrating not
being able to find some combination that
was gonna work and we knew like we knew
where this train was heading right like
there's the cliff we're heading toward
it like no no maybe we can defer the
inevitable right but just it's called
inevitable for a reason right it's
because it's in evitable like it's going
to happen and finally I had a
conversation with I said look this just
in it tore me up I didn't sleep for like
a week before this I you know I was sick
I couldn't eat and had to call it I said
look you know it's just it's not working
he said you know I know it's not working
I've got to do something else you know
I'm thinking and like I just realized in
that instant like he and I have both
been struggling with the same thing we
were both scared of this imagination
that didn't exist like the bark was
worse than the bite
imagination was way worse than reality
which I think it brings me to our last
one before he jumped into my overtime
always do what you know to be right and
this goes back to the recursive thing
right good information helps make good
decisions whether it's technical
information whether it's organizational
information right honesty in a work
environment is an absolutely critical
part of you know making something work
so Gil you built like chips before right
and they had half adders and adders and
crap like that I'm gonna pretend I know
something about Electrical Engineering
like what if you put two and two and it
came back as five what would you do like
how would how would the chip in it it
just couldn't work right you need the
basic functionality of an organization
to be you know honest and
straightforward and transparent even
when it hurts so I wanted to give a
brief example I was interviewing a guy
years ago and he was really good because
I was interviewing him for marketing so
he's like really slick you know like I
couldn't quite get through the veneer
it's finally I said what would you like
your kids to think about what you do for
a living
about your job and you really put them
off balance because you know forced him
to kind of dereference that pointer one
more time right and look at it from a
different angle and then coincidentally
a year or two after that I was at work
and some of my employees were getting
kicked out of their offices and being
forced to go into cubes and you know I
had warned the bureaucracy that this was
gonna happen and it would be bad and I'd
lose these employees and I said you know
you can't let this happen and so on and
so forth and what do you know it
happened and I sent I wrote an email I
sent down I wrote his email to some big
important person and I said look
I told you not to let this happen if I
asked you for something
there's a legitimate business reason for
it and don't make me ask twice
now I looked at my screen and I thought
yeah if I send this email I'm gonna get
fired
shouldn't I
I mean I was being in an ass which is my
title but then I asked myself going back
to the interview I said if I don't what
would I tell my kids I do for a living
well I fight for people's offices and I
lose and I give up okay so long story
short didn't lose the offices I made a
few enemies but never regretted it you
know it's it hurts I give you a story
they've had a good ending I've had a few
that are bad usually my fault
but no matter what yeah so now there's a
safe harbor statement so look I've only
got 62 more slides so if you can just
read so my favorite parts coming from
Java anyone pay attention what's coming
in Java
there's modularity coming have you heard
of that
so modularity is basically a way to
break all your applications by making
sure that anything you use it was in the
son package is now illegal like misc
unsafe and all that some value types are
working around a evil design flaw in
Java which is basically this concept of
identity every object has an identity
and the way that they do it is they
trade off the concept of immutability in
the concept of identity and and in
exchange they basically allow the
equivalent of an object an immutable
object to be completely in light how am
i doing on time five oh so okay
I'll give you the the tag line on this
codes like a class but it works like an
INT so if you've used other
languages you've probably run into
tuples as a great example one of my
favorite examples is I think we'll be
able to implement I Triple E 754 decimal
with value types i've actually
implemented it on top of java long but
needless to say there's no language
support for that I just do the encoding
and decoding let's see why why are value
types important
well they eliminate D RAF's which is
important on micro benchmarks smaller
footprint that's important big thing
though is they can dramatically reduce
the number of objects and GC tends to be
Gil's gonna argue with me because he
always does on this point but GC tends
to be a function of the number of
objects if you if you don't know Gil
writes the the VM the azul vm technology
which supposedly never pauses so there's
your pitch so this is the example by the
way oh did you see the link i actually
put a link so you can look for value
types on OpenJDK this is an example from
john john rose showing how point could
be implemented it looks pretty much like
a java class not the I made a bold near
the by value that's kind of the only
difference really and the fact that the
compiler would know that it's immutable
so I'll give an example with some some
work that we were doing in a similar
vein we did the same thing with say long
values which is a pretty obvious easy
one and you can see 600 Meg's of RAM
down to 40 megabytes seven seconds ton
to two and a half so some pretty
dramatic optimizations are possible and
this is all done in pure Java so we
weren't doing any unsafe or anything
like that just some some some specific
data structures so this this is a type
of thing I would expect to see in Java
10 now there are strings a great example
of another thing you can do with value
type so small string for example could
be done entirely in line so no separate
char array for example they're still
figuring out the details of how they
could do this but check this out single
location so that drops the number of
objects in half for Strings single cache
line because it's all you know the
string and its contents are all in one
one cache line if it's small enough and
we'll talk about arrays to out a minute
but here's an example that we did with
strings it wasn't as good because it was
actually slower because of the boxing
and unboxing if you will but it was
definitely smaller 85% less memory and
when Java does it in Java it should be
much faster actually right George
guaranteed arrays - oh this is one of my
favorite things I've been begging for
this for years
so you see the previous presentation I
linked to so 64 bit array indexes is
anyone really pissed off that they're
limited to two billion items in an array
like you know you have an array of phone
numbers okay basically what it does is
it introduces a concept almost like an
interface it says this is what an array
is you know getting set and then some
optional extensions there - things for
like split and all those not fork/join
but what am I thinking of help me out
here Map Reduce type things yes there
you go
then there's a atomic under that camera
in the name of let's see
multi-dimensional arrays so finally you
can replace your old Fortran code with
Java that would be pretty cool
GC specialization this is one that I
haven't quite gotten the the JVM team to
commit on yet so by the way all these
things are obviously uncommitted thanks
to a legal thing I put up but if you
think about it Java GC is optimized for
many small objects so when I say small
like what's the biggest object you've
ever had that's not an array you know
100 fields that's less than half a K
right but if you have gigabytes of
arrays they're sitting in the same
managed data structure gigabytes in
bytes hey do you notice something here
there's like bytes and gigabytes and
they're all kind of mixed in the same
place so this this arrays - oh stuff can
actually specialize the GC I'm almost on
I swear
let's see and why is this so important
well all of our investment in GC at
Oracle is going into g1 which is a
compaction based GC algorithm and what
it means is that if we have to copy
those giant arrays because all g1 does
is copy it it's a compaction based on
copying if I understand correctly so by
having a by having this specialization
we can basically just leave the arrays
in place and then do the compaction on
just those small objects so dramatic
dramatic optimizations is there at least
someone in this room Talib who would be
interested in this oh yeah not only that
a lot of the unsafe stuff goes away in
Java 9 so we could sure use stuff like
this right George alright and with that
I have come to the end of my
