this was the core agile values as
feedback is important so please use your
app and rate the session oh just yo I
think it's already been announced that
one of the things in the top corner says
I'm really old that part's true I was
going to conference a few weeks ago with
Ron Jeffries and Ron Jeffries it's
actually been programming longer than I
have Mikey we started writing code
before Martin followers born so talk
about really old code kind of the
interesting thing is actually in the
bottom of bottom right where it talks
about technologies I tend to be one of
the early adopters of new technology I
don't come up with this stuff but when
something new comes along it's hard for
me to resist kind of playing with it and
so I've kind of done that for my entire
career but a sign of fact that means
some of the things I'm talking about
today may not be appropriate for you
today but chances are with the next five
years this is something you'll see it
quite a bit up so it doesn't feel like
quite right for you still take some
notes because this may become
interesting later on so why do you want
to do manage those processes so let's
sort of start with why you'd ever want
to go to this way especially you have to
be a manager right now I think for the
developers in the audience week we could
go there immediately part of things is
it is you had certainty associated with
requirements what it drives a little bit
this so going back to the early days of
agile when I was still playing with the
early days of agile I kind of had this
model in my head and I talked about this
my clients is this kind of certainty
around requirements and there's
uncertainty around requirements and it's
kind of a broad rate you're somewhere in
the middle there most cases and it turns
out and you know my feel about agile was
you know what if all frankly worked I
mean I built a lot of systems using
waterfall processes we deliver on time
but generally he had a certainty of
requirement you knew what you're trying
to build and therefore you could put a
plan together and make it execute that
when it became a little lesser and when
you're sore a little a little less
concerned about what's going on not
quite sure what's happening
you maybe change your mind a little bit
that's where agile really became a sweet
spot and and for a lot of my clients
back then you know you're they're kind
of in that not quite sure what I want to
build a stage they may say they knew
they did but you can look at them and
say you really not quite sure but there
was this whole thing it says if you
don't know what you want to build I'm
sorry
agile doesn't work waffle nothing works
you're kind of in that sort of the
graveyard a project so you try to this
project not knowing what you want you
just basically spending money for no
benefit so again this is my model about
the you know y2k timeframe well you know
more recently you know been playing in
this sort of the graveyard and building
applications as graveyards though and it
sort of comes from this recognition this
concept of there's a set of what I call
fuzzy problems a lot of this comes from
the a wonderful model from Dave Snowden
the noise with the pronunciation good
eben model this is a Welsh word and one
of the good day snow today was the
classify problems based upon sort of
their key traits and Holly can it behave
in simple problems where the
cause-effect relationship is very
straightforward so this is pretty easy
to wrestle with these sort of problems
because it's very straightforward the
concept of best practice exists in this
zone and then it defeats complicated
problems where the cause of Vic
relationship is is more convoluted which
sort of says yeah there's a cosmic
relationship but it's kind of only if
humans really understand what it is sort
of the domain experts so to speak oh but
it does exist but then he doesn't stop
there dave says there's also these other
problems that he calls complex and
chaotic now complex problems where the
cause of rec relationship does not exist
it turns out yes if this happens you can
probably figure out why this particular
event happened by chasing back see the
causal effects but it doesn't predict
the future and there's a whole
interesting set of policies what I call
fuzzy this is like shuttle owned you
money I don't know the absolutely answer
to that question I don't know if you're
going to pay it back it's a fuzzy
question Google AdWords all the
marketplace store stuff is is sort of
fuzzy I've certainly all the financial
models the market and market the markets
like that are completely fuzzy you don't
know this is going to happen and where
you have best pockets down and simple
and you sort of have good
practices are complicated because there
is more than one way to skin the cat in
conflict is there's no good answer in
fact an answer that works today and
tomorrow fails the third day you sort
have to walk away from it and that's a
very strange sort of phenomenon the
other thing Dave Turner will tell us is
that most the time you're in a state of
disorder which means you're not really
sure where your problem fits this is the
thing that he does know it's exalted is
help understand that but he says about
85% of problems he runs across from
disorder the company doesn't really know
where it fits and you have to sort of
watch it see how it behaves tale hood
acts that sort of figure out what sort
of segments it lies in and he also says
is the morning here as individuals we
tend to have prejudices so far we want
things to be sometimes you know it's
your want to be complicated cuz I'm an
expert and I get paid really well to be
an expert so it is about what problem it
is I'm an expert even though it may be a
complex problem which expertise doesn't
exist yet you claim you're an expert and
so you sort of drag it over there
certainly if you're a politician your
since thinking there's two everyone is
kind of simple all I have to do is go to
a wall all right do something else and
all of a sudden although all the complex
problems fall away of course you know a
simple solution like that doesn't really
solve complex problem now it turns out
also that you tend to organize yourself
differently a Frisian one of these
problems like that so this is sort of
the key therefore a simple problem it
turns out there are best practices and
so you can hire a bunch of people and
the job of the manager is very clear
teach them how to do it well teach if I
do it faster and faster because there is
a best practice when you get into the
complicated world you have these experts
they know how to do it both your experts
they're very expensive and sort of
properly leverage them we want to make
sure to put a team in place to do what
they tell us is it and so you put a
manager in place and employees to do
this work and you carve yourself up into
stories you bit crave backlog so you do
all the all the right things to sort of
drive this engine and get it to work
very effectively when we move over to
the complex segment where there is no
cause-effect relationship there really
are no experts
and so's without a rule for the expert
in this space the fact we try to use
that sort of complicated structure here
this structure and solving a complex
problem the first thing you're going to
do is figure out your experts not an
expert your reaction is going to be your
firing you are another expert of course
these equally ignorant so it turns out
because we have a full story like to
tell about these experts to say what's
the dirt or these experts and used-car
salesmen and the answer is used-car
salesmen know they're lying so
eventually you get tired of firing the
experts you fire the manager and hire
another one because clearly he can't get
the work done and of course you're fated
to fail and it's sort of structure
solving a complex problem so instead
when you organize the complex probably
organize yourself along people that are
going to try things out knowing that
things will fail and they'll try
something else now words they almost
have no memory of this
they're almost like you know baseball
players going up to the plate knowing
that 70% of the time they are going to
fail and they can succeed thirds of the
time they're worth 20 million dollars a
year for having just such low success
rate and so you have to have people have
no memory because fundamentally is no
room for an expert there's no role for
the manager what's the manager going to
tell you to do
there's no backlog associated with this
so you want to organize yourself
differently for this it's a it's a
perilous process because the problem
doesn't really allow that complicated
structure to work well that's what
motivate so so now my model sort of says
instead of having a graveyard here this
is kind of the maintenance of fuzzy
problems but it turns out they're viable
problems these are problems we're
starting to solve
unfortunately I've been at a chance to
my last decade of my career to go play
with almost exclusively fuzzy problems
and that allows me use for new
technologies new languages new processes
and I want to share some of those
processes with you now the key thing one
of the key things that's driving this
they should see a lot of visibility
around is we're moving to what I call
the age of agents there's all about
things you know programs running on your
behalf out there sort of making you
helping sort of collect information and
making suggestions to you they don't
really know that you should get up right
now and go draw the card as location
they don't really know that you don't
really know what you're
mule should be but they have some ideas
about that it's a fuzzy problem you're
seeing that you know you know here this
wholeheartedly there's just a lot of
assistive technologies out there or how
to do things better you're seeing all
these clever front ends that are voiced
driven it turns out the voice driven
parts not the interesting part of the
problem I was fortunate to here's a guy
that found it Siri before Apple bought
them talked about this whole process
they said the innovation he had was
getting these various services he's back
in services to interact with each other
figure out how do we think things to
interact the voice front-end which is
kind of icing on the cake but that's the
real innovation occurring this and of
course this is all fuzzy you know we're
making suggestions too
this is the world of where we're going
and this is where the real money is
being made is solving these fuzzy
problems and again organizing yourself
as a complicated doesn't get that
accomplished I do go to all conferences
you listen to all the hot topics out
there there's lots of Technology stuff
out there I talked about micro services
of course the container world is going
crazy have their own conferences it does
a lot of this stuff but it's not just
technology out there there's a lot of
process stuff obviously agile finished
use now for almost 15 20 years you know
Noah Eric Mars talking about one hacker
way other sort of very advanced
processes to allow you to to work
differently there's all these sort of
the business guys getting into it as
well they have lean startups and MEP s
we have these new sort of focused titles
you know full stack developer become
something more in vogue the DevOps
community have it own conferences and
it's an underlying theme to all this it
says we're trying to solve fuzzy
problems and competitive advantage of
fuzzy problems comes when I can go fast
I can try an idea out aggressively
that's why it's important to depth
DevOps I got to deploy this code quickly
I can't sort of stack up ideas for three
months and ship it I will get killed by
the guy who's shipping it every day and
so you move it to this mode so it's
about going faster so if you look at
sort of the XP values you know whether
you're working in fuzzy or agile
processes you know I kind of believe it
all of these these are sort of the
cornerstones of building successful
teams and morale associate with that and
I kind of agree with like ten
said many years ago you get these things
right and it's fun it's fun to come to
work and that's the reason that I think
he pushed really hard for this is create
this fun environment so we greet all
those things so you look at sort of you
know solving the agile stuff and we came
up with a whole set of practices
associated with that came up a whole set
of roles associated with trying to focus
on that but when you get the fuzzy
problem all of a sudden and you want you
work you wanna work differently than
this and so we start getting too fuzzy
all of a sudden these are not best
practices these are things you tend to
get rid of and as well as that you start
killing the roles off and you get down
to something that's almost very
simplistic but it's designed to go
really fast
so looking at a couple of case studies
where I actually done this this is
actually from 2006 this is you know it
you know 1112 years old at this point a
work I did in London when I was working
for Thal works and this is sort of the
you know we had a team you know down the
side you see the names of the team that
was our customer and these were the
various participants I am NOT Fred and
George there's a different George not me
twice and I've sorted the duration of
titles and for the client we gave
ourselves titles because that's what
he's looking for in fact we were even
thoug word to sign this lease title day
was the officially the project manager
George was the guy who had great ruby
knowledge because there's a ruby project
and I incident Ruby before so he was
kind of tech lead and he brought into a
person of course George's go write code
as well because George likes writing
code those were kind of our official
roles and we had a business analyst so
again very traditional agile sort of
structure but how do we actually work
because it turns out we're working in a
fuzzy problem so it turns out you know
David the manager official manager he
also were XF assessed for us
he understood the big system and he said
I can I can do this for us in fact he
actually ran the build process as well
of course Matt the customer says well I
can look at the code and make decisions
as well on the fly if you guys are
continually developing this stuff so we
picked up that role it turns out of
course the main project I'm working on
I'm going to be the manager anyway and
the client sort of treated me that way
so you're sort of assuming those sorts
of roles
a lot of architectural experience even
compared to George so I almost you know
once again playing a tech lead role
about overall architecture goals
Paul was actually a brilliant guy in
terms of bringing new technology and
make a good use of it and so you know
week three kind of played tech lead
roles and sort of traditional techniques
thing I actually have a UI design
background as well so I did that along
with the customer we did we design all
the screens it turns out we also turn
out ourselves we were doing the analysis
once we understood our problem we're
trying to solve we were becoming great
analysts and so we sat there and did
that and of course the customer caught
on to how to write stories very quickly
himself and so realizing that and we
realized that elements the first week
you know Jeremy rolls himself off the
project we don't need him so you look at
how we're actually acting and it's like
they're almost you know bunch of
full-stack developers undifferentiated
roles we do what we needed to to get the
job done and this again is you know a
dozen years old now the other things we
did is sort of again to complement the
fuzzy process is basically we're a
fixed-price project I have the love
fixed-price projects because in a
fixed-price project I get controlled
process I get controlled resource I'm
going to sort of justify myself to a
client who has no knowledge of how agile
actually works so I like that idea but
we also collect a the team we all set
around the same table you know including
Matt the customer iteration length was
usually daily because we're again having
a stand up that talked about what we
need to work on today because things are
coming out really fast we're now talking
about one week two weeks sort of stuff
we're talking about where do you get
done yesterday what can we do today some
of the same focus that that Dan North
talked about this morning very
eloquently and basically we took the
original backlog they had and they had a
backlog we threw it away like what do we
need to worry about today and it turns
out Matt for changing his mind as he saw
the quality evolved and so that back
foot you know these kind of stories we
had written up on cards we kind of wade
through all this way and the final thing
is we wind up over delivering we deliver
twenty percent more than the client
expected on time just by turning us
loose and just solve the problem so this
is again in an environment where we're
basically in a manner Julis environment
we're kind of working to solve the
problem
now one of the inhibitors to getting to
am Angela process because probably
you're sitting in a complicated
organization one that has a specialist
one that has a manager one that has the
employees and so what do you have to do
to fix this and I've had some occasions
Tatchell Russell that's myself the first
thing I have to realize is we're over
specialized to some degree having the
concept of your job is to be a front-end
programmer you're as a back-end you're
the database person and thou shalt not
cross these boundaries now without lots
of paper and a lot of processes not
without meetings this incredibly slows
you down and speed is what you want for
fuzzy problems the theory of course
these specials are more productive so
let's make sure they're productive and
again I'd like to Dan North's definition
productive this morning it means
generating a lot of stuff not
necessarily being effective of course in
practice the overhead of communication
is completely underestimated I mean the
steps will take taegons to step to the
next process and how much paper it takes
in meetings and of course you create
these imbalances well I've got enough
iOS programmers who has too many iowa's
programmers I never met that team but
you always creat these imbalances
because of these specializations and of
course if you're a specialist and you're
not busy right now you kind of got to
look busy
and so you sort of create you know
arbitrarily useless sort of work like
backlogs so what are the exact roles
happens these agile roles tend to
evaporate when you start to solve these
problems this way now and frankly been
you know pushing away these Admirals for
almost over a decade now so I like this
pyramid because it talks about this kind
of three types of roles overall and I
sort of put the titles with initiatives
roles so management is like project
managers and iteration managers business
guys I put the customer ba and QA here
QA because QA is always testing at the
business level you're doing acceptance
testing unit testing that's part of
development and there's lots of titles
for developers they're architects
there's you know front-end back in all
these other things
DBAs I kind of loop all those in
developer because we got we've got kind
of homogeneous and that pretty quickly
all right so let's talk about the face
of these roles that you sort of get into
these fuzzy problems well first of all
you sort of look at QA and
thinking about QAS it's kind of
interesting because QA when I started
writing for go was the guys you couldn't
teach the right code so the guys can't
write code so you make them QA and sit
there and they try things on the machine
or punch cards back in the day but now
of course all the QA tools are
programming tools you got selenium you
got cucumbers you get other tools
they're all very much programming tools
interesting yes be a programmer actually
be of it without wake you're right
really bad selenium code you write good
selenium code I much rather have good
selenium code and of course these
architectures of the systems were
building a really complex to be right
except to test against these you really
understand the architecture this is
nothing QA skill of yesteryear this is
different so let's say you have to write
code and you have to understand
architecture gee it sounds like a
programmer and of course now we're
moving is the idea we don't run except
this test anymore we actually want our
systems to have active monitoring in it
the same sort of thing thought process
but I my systems are active now they're
they're running all the time they talk
to the external services it was easily
need to do is pull these external
services and see what the result is but
but if external service goes down and
you haven't got active monitoring you
don't know about this until somebody
calls you up so by the way I can't login
anymore you've got to instrument your
system so it finds that problem quicker
so if you got an instrumented system use
that instead of acceptance testing
deploy to the live environment again
time to market all right so that QA goes
away based on that all right close to
the next one business analyst
here's your business analyst his job is
to tell the programmers what to do
because we're stupid and when we ask you
a question you'll answer it for us of
course what's really going on is of
course he don't really know either until
the app talks to the customer when I ask
him a question he goes around to ask
customer tells to the answer
so I'm saying okay why you saying Miller
dude what is your role here you're not
the domain expert you're just kind of
little mouthpiece
Way says you know well is this what is
too complicated for you to understand
you're just a programmer I'm like do you
want fracture
really you think your world's more
complicated in my world there are only a
few domains where that's actually true
by the way one of his like particle
physics you know it's string theory all
that stuff we can't get our heads around
that because only those weird physicists
can do that so we're we doing that case
we teach them write code I feel a way to
solve the problem so it's not too
complicated for us trust us we can
understand your problem to me well we
can't talk yeah well some that's true
but we can sort of get over that I mean
frankly things like you know the Big
Bang Theory have convinced the world
that yet we are human beings at some
level and we can be communicated with at
some level we just they understand it's
different for the language we like
social skills be out so we dress funny
fine but it really is the end of the day
I don't really need this guy I really
want to talk to customer directly
printing for the fuzzy problems because
one things about a fuzzy problem is Irie
didn't understand the problem in order
to try solutions out again we can't have
a backlog can't have stories because we
don't know what the answer is so he's
gone all right so we're down we're doing
nicely here iteration manager the
history of iteration manager is a
made-up title that frankly thought works
made up and back in the day it one of
the very very early agile projects
dollars came in and said we need a
project manager on the team as part of
our people and the company said I don't
want to pay for a project manager I got
my own we use my project manager always
said he's not really a project manager
he's an iteration manager he's really
gonna do is manage the iterations which
you don't understand okay that's fine
because it's a lie
usually and there's nothing in you know
Kent Banks original book talking about I
need a project manager you can cause
them a clerk that's a better title so we
get rid of that guy because we not
necessary all right so we're down to
project managers what are their role in
this world well if you sort of look at
the individual roles of what they trying
to do they do a lot of things and in
fact you're expected to do a lots of
things that they do their job well first
of all they are the clerk and I thank
God we have somebody to do that for us
because we don't want keep
tract about ourselves it's not a lot of
burden associated with tracking a story
I'm sorry it's not a lot to that leaders
it's very important to have leaders in
organizations but sort of anointing
somebody to be the leader is not a
formula for success it says he may not
be the person is respected he may think
he needs to make decisions that he's not
qualified to make so teams are much
better off by choosing your own leaders
we'll get more into that he is the guy
to talk to the outside world so he kind
of is an ambassador of that level he's
talking to the outside world
coordinating schedules of teams you know
dependencies all these sorts of things
he plays that role
he's also suppose to be the coach and
mentor for the team he's supposed to
sorta give you career advice of course
he became a manager so the type of
advice he tends to give you is you need
to become a manager at some point to be
brilliant like me not so your best
coaching mentor it's actually dr.
inclinations it's also the concierge
she's the guy that's supposed to be
working for the team doing things the
team needs to have done the things that
you know otherwise don't get happen and
occasionally it turns into some
power-hungry boss who says I I am I am
the God here I can get tell you what to
do and some guys get off on that not the
good one that's why it's in red or
someone get off on that now going out
and trying to find the best person for
an organization has all these traits is
doomed to failure and so reckon you want
to recognize these are not necessarily
the things managers are supposed to do
but these are basically roles and
they're also necessary you'll
necessarily have to have the manager do
or have a manager begin place to handle
so you want to sort of begin to weigh of
these things get rid of those things
that sort of disperse these roles into
the rest of the team and let's kind of
move it how she did move to this so
basically after this then you're left
with basically the two roles I talked
about ya customers you got developers in
relationship is customer tell me about
your domain T for your domain and then
hey it's a it's about ideas
I do algorithms that's why I'm a
programmer I have ideas I'm going to try
all sorts of amazing things when I've
done this in practice and I've done this
again for the last 10 years of various
organization it turns out you know the
customer coming one day says why we make
some more money yesterday what do you
guys do a week
we tried this and it worked how did you
think of that - we're just we're just
programmers we try things very powerful
so that's kind of how you get rid of
those roles as sort of doing that so you
already moved at creating the manageress
process the first thing you need to do
is begin to trust the organization you
have to trust which means basically push
stuff out there on a limb trust that
it's going to happen first thing you
want to trust that the programmers care
one of the things that says my
programmers don't care about stuff they
just come in to collect a check probably
if you create one of these unfunny
environments that's exactly what they're
doing you want to make it fun trust that
they will care treat them that way trust
that leaders will emerge I believe it's
situational leadership I believe that
these things will happen as social
beings we tend to want to have leaders
and because we want to have leaders we
will tend to anoint our leaders as
necessary and in fact if we can't figure
out how to anoint we will sort of act
very dysfunctional in that way it would
be very obvious that's happening but you
want these leaders to emerge so trust it
will happen short of being a sociopath
we like doing this problems will arise
and will get solved you don't need to be
jumping in there saying oh my god we may
have a problem and oh my god we may
never solve it trust that they will be
solved these are bright people they're
motivated a care they have leaders they
will solve these problems trust it will
happen and finally you should believe
that he will be constantly changing a
structure and you want to not only
probably support that you want to even
encourage it because you are fighting
move towards various phases the needs
for that project are going to change and
one of the side effects that means is
you have the wrong people in the room I
don't need that database wizard anymore
we got that we don't only the architect
we're way into the process the
architecture has been well established
the roles look really good everything is
working really fine I don't need an
architect anymore in fact he doesn't
really that right that good of code you
know he's an architect
so you know don't need them anymore
but seems to be constantly morphing when
a various first always project going
about 2004 I had a team it was given to
me I thought works I made 10 staff
changes the first six weeks of that
project including kinking client
programmers out of the room I was
Tooting the teams the teams I need it to
get the job done it's a constant thing
it's one of things we used to focus on
iteration every iteration you know yes
having to stand up it so we all had the
retrospective it's very good talk about
the process changes talk about how much
you got done in the showcase and
evaluates the team and see if I have the
right people in the room and more fit so
trust you want to have a delivery focus
you want to make sure is whole
organization surround delivering the
software so you want to think of
everybody the room everybody in the
organization is supporting delivery I
had the opportunity to visit but the
McLaren racing team center outside side
of London when I lived there one things
that was very obvious in that entire
organization they talked about it
everybody from you know the executives
all the way through the secretary knew
exactly what the timings were last
Formula One race and everybody organized
a she focus on how do I get that time
down it was a universal focus we worked
at IBM and I worked at IBM my first 17
years and I went through four one is
that for early downside and one of the
themes behind the early downsizing says
you they're building product you're
selling product or you're supporting
product if you're not doing one of those
three things you don't have a job
anymore you want that your organization
have that same philosophy user writing
code your figure out what the code needs
to be you're servicing that code you
deploying that code whatever it is it's
all about the code so how are you making
delivery go faster
how are you making a delivery go faster
so all the rules got to support that
focus on the cycle time how long did it
take to get there how many offer you're
doing built how often can you get doing
built ski-doo wheels faster when I
worked in the in London to get a
different company we got our point two
week push new code of production every
three and a half minutes
we didn't start there we were pushing
twice a day and it was like we do twice
they can do three times a day right sure
we tweak this we can do faster we kept
going faster and faster and faster it
was very much that four in one focus
again and it focuses on doing the right
thing by the way we had 50 employees
that year we made fifty million pounds
by going faster this is the way to do it
and you got to have the guys on the top
who believe this is the way to run that
it is all about the organ it's all about
getting the code out the door and the
even as the top executives got to
understand that because once they change
their mind about that oh we can't make a
mistake
almost all the waterfall processors will
creep back in because that's what it's
designed to do make sure I can't make a
mistake you want to go faster you gotta
have that different focus I will say
that that's one of the nice things about
some of the organizations I worked in
they understood going faster was eek
with the key thing we would make
mistakes in these companies I remember
quite a few mistakes we made and the
customer come to us and say you guys
made a mistake we say yes we tried it we
try something didn't work and we've
wasted 300 ollars of your money Wow
you know can't wait sharing dollars we
have some more meetings about that my
job was a tell him to shut up and I
would tell him that if you didn't like
my answer if we could see the managing
director he would tell them to shut up
we're not going to slow down because of
a mistake instead we will go faster we
do believe in the feedback so we got to
force at the top from a management
perspective we're trying to advantage
for the inversion the management
inversion is kind of the ideas that the
manager works for the team again the
power-hungry guy never really gets this
but the really good managers the good
managers you've had your careers I'm
sure really thousands they work for the
team and they would do whatever that's
there for the team if you want to kind
of enforce that make sure that the role
doesn't exist otherwise so wiping out
the title of manager replacing with some
of these other titles becomes a key part
of that so my favorite term for this is
sort of a concierge it's kind of like an
ombudsman it's kind of a rule you put in
place and say well here's the guy that
the team has a problem here's a guy can
always go to and make it his problem it
doesn't matter where you know you need
you'll and adapter fine go to the
concierge to go downstairs so the
nearest hardware store pick if Atlanta
adapter bring it back to you when baby
dude a database expert you'll go get
that guy for you it's very important
that this concierge reacts to the team's
of these regardless how quickly they are
it's his problem he's a concierge again
management inversion focused on he needs
to respect the team's decisions the team
may say well here's my leader you're
looking at your concierge saying well
that's a stupid choice you can't really
say that you gotta say yes that's fine
you gotta live with that trust of the
team we'll do it right ambassador who's
the guys to represent the team the
outside world again they'll make choices
about who that is they may rotate it
around fine except their choice and most
important to membership one of those
damaging things you could do to a team
it's when the team is dissatisfied with
one of its members you come from the
concierge and says oh by the way this
guy doesn't fit and he keeps fighting us
on this he won't check in his stuff he
doesn't want to work fast he won't say
soon he's just driving his nuts we want
to get rid of it fine he's off the team
there was no other answer that thing is
a he's off the team
now becomes the concierge problem the
concierge can decide was a personality
conflict skills mismatch where I just
need to fire the guy but it's not the
team's problem anymore
same way I can't force a member in to
the team I remember sitting in London
where I was playing the concierge role
and you know so you know third party
doesn't know the executive walks in says
I had this guy like came to work we're
going your team's with you I said fine
we can bring the guy came in and asked
them to say what they think but need him
to be on that team said yeah give me ask
these guys well who's will make decision
they are no no I need the decision
they're going to make the decision I am
NOT making that decision you can ask me
to thank as much you want to I'm just
the concierge turns out is one actually
one of the tricks we learned in the
management school turns out it was
called power in negotiation
turns out one of the really powerful
roles when powered ago she ation
techniques is I'm not allowed to agree
with you
I'm walking to the negotiation and I
can't say yet I saw something very
powerful
so membership very important it let them
control the membership now if you play
the concierge role there on earth
secrets what's going on that team Dan
North talked about the the team and that
wasn't that was a gun boy boy Dino what
was it man T it was t boy the eyesore
goes around gives or et everyday to sort
of see what's going on fundamentally
concierge has the same ability to see
what's going on teams just by Washington
interaction being around it to be asking
silly questions or go give me a LAN
adapter the Morales team is there so you
want somebody's kind of watching what's
going on knowing that it may need a
leader the ambassador was struggling and
made some coaching about that that
concierge is seeing that and again he
can react in sort of that coaching sort
of role alright so actually put this in
action and is is more of a case study of
how we did this because the
specializations were institutionalized
with titles that's kind of the most you
know damaging thing I see you in
organizations people carry around cards
and titles and of course in Europe you
have contracts that say this is my job
there's a contract laying out what my
title is very very constraining when you
want to try these exchanges and I run
across that when I was working in the
Daily Mail in London sort of the case
study from The Daily Mail so what does
the organization's or fifty programmers
or fifteen big IT guys or Ops guys some
QA guys some design people I found
twenty five-plus titles not that unusual
and I spend by experience either and I
found fewer people understand the
project was zero the poor scrum master
was paying the white board every day
trying to you know get the report funds
back in the front end the design team to
see him we had made project any progress
on this project and she couldn't she
couldn't figure that out so what are we
doing that case how's my time
17:04 good shape so so I create new
titles and where I got around the
contract was I said you don't have to
take these new titles let you work on
the new project your project has the new
titles I got
tons of legacy codes can be there for
decades you would keep your old title
here's your legacy code have at it
your choice by the way I will I will
offer retraining we had almost hundred
percent participation retraining every
role into programming because I do value
a QA guy who thinks about a system and
how it might fail I value him
let's turn me into a programmer I love
architects because architects have
conceptual skills it would be architects
otherwise trained the right code again
they are beasts and managers managers
are natural leaders they say you know
human thing is going on he's a right
coach so when these human things happen
and build a team they know how to defuse
a situation because they have experience
in that so I love these experiences of
other roles you know going back into
programming so we talked we gave
everybody a chance to go through
basically a 40-hour intensive
programming course so we're back in
describe how we're going to do the title
so basically we divide ourselves into
you know various roles or
responsibilities we said you know we use
a three-tier pyramid not the five levels
that Dan North talking about and we
decided your title is going to be if
you're what you're competent one of our
technologies we're going to call you a
developer that's the title nothing more
fancy no adjectives no license needed
just to developer you are not confident
what are our key technologies you're
called a graduate developer because we
like to hire graduates and of course why
would I hire anybody can't do JavaScript
or can't do Java I'm not sure why it
hires in the first place but it's nice
place for this chart senior developers
that kind of an expert the guy who's
really good as it's tough magical and
how he can work again very traditional
sort of titles that you see it always
higher key this is where he did
something different we said what we
really want to do is we want to create
these system developers these are guys
who are competent non-experts competent
in five to seven our key technology
databases languages iOS Android
platforms
etc and we will pay you the same we pay
these experts because it turns out these
these full site developers these system
developers these are the guys that give
a problem
Fuzzy's problem and say attack it and
they can sort a little bit architecture
they do a little bit going to break it
up this is it looks like a database
problem this looks like a front-end back
in responsibility if they need help they
go get the expert through much like
Daniel's described these experts are
floating resources they go to where the
worst problems are they're not permanent
team members it's unnecessary and we
create one more Tyler called master
developer and we told everybody you get
to choose you get to choose which way
you want to go in this view model
working these view projects now this is
the Daily Mail Daily Mail is 125 years
old literally an 1890s or buying tabloid
news the same way to do it today 1890
we're still doing that
it's run by Lord Rothermere the fourth
law cross the rivers title we're talking
about staid old English organizations so
I walk into human resources show this
new chart what do you get reaction I get
from human resources from 125 year old
English company well I was expecting a
holy war instead they loved it they have
been in so many tangles with programmers
saying oh yeah look at this job
description I meet every one of these
things I should be promoted and they
have to go back to the developers and
management they're arguably endless
arguments they never never finished
these arguments this allows them to get
out of the game who's judging whether
you're competent the Masters those
experts we're doing ourselves Solon's
house it's just a matter of counting
after that so they loved it so we fixed
the title and all of a sudden a lot of
our problems went away
we had fun we'd hired and fired two CEOs
trying to rewrite a system this team got
together and finished it early
what else do we do well one of the
things was they were sitting in their
cubes and of course that discourages
communications encourages emails
documents all sorts of other nonsense
so you know take a again a hint out of
kid pecks
first XP book where he says first thing
you do on the first day of our project
is you fix the furniture there's only a
picture of what I did this and when I
was working in India we built around
now we actually buy them but you know we
built their own tables because it turns
out sitting around the table as close as
possible is very powerful so it turns
does a three reason people talk to each
other first reason is we have the same
hobby frankly is a company we cannot
control that it means you know your kids
go to the same daycare you support the
same football team you know again not
much control over that second reason
people talk to each other they have the
same manager that kind of fix that
problem but and there they have the same
manager they'll talk to each other
because they work for the same manager
there's affinity there third reason this
guy got tenure at MIT for this the
chance me i you and i communicating
varies inversely with the square
distances between our chairs he was a
former aerospace engineer so he's kind
of that nature to it so basically
instead of sitting the whole QA team
together over here and sitting the whole
development team over here
you're wasting two chips because they
work for the same manager and they're
sitting close to each other and they
point fingers at each other so instead
put them around as tight as possible to
minimize the square of distance it put a
round table every one of different roles
around the same table so you fix the
furniture which also means you move the
people to that so we ripped out in daily
mail we ripped out all the cubes put in
liberty putting in tables gave them
place cubicles to put their stuff into
the wall knows it non-dedicated
leadership kind of touched on this
already but basically if you look in the
you know books like this which is you
know it is sort of pop popping
anthropology book but you look at what
point is a village need a dedicate 100%
time leader not so it gets over 100
people yet here's oh here's the team we
got eight people gotta have a manager
there eight people
oh my god you can't possibly handle
eight people all by himself well these
guys in primitive societies take most of
the time yes you're a village village
elder the other person is going to make
these decisions when necessary otherwise
you're going to fuel with everybody else
so go back to that 2006 example yeah we
were all writing code even though we're
playing management roles we're still
writing code we're doing other things
with our time we got time to spare so
the ambassador role I want to call out
that bit more of
very very important role because I don't
want to have a guy who feels like he's
obliged to go into negotiation with
ability and make a decision on behalf of
the team he's an ambassador ambassador
represents your interest to the outside
group he's a member of team you can
rotate around all you want to that's
fine
in fact it's a good idea to sort of
rotate around as everybody sort of see
what the outside world looks like see if
they're inclined to do that regularly or
not but you're not empowered to commit
again that very powerful negotiation
technique you cannot commit on behalf of
the team let's the team says you can so
bring back the opinions of the team or
make a decision as a team we'll decide
whether we do this this way or not or
maybe have some better ideas send you
back but bring back the ideas from that
but you're just the ambassador you can't
make the decision so no longer to have
that managers out there trying to make
the decision if he's forced to make that
decision because like Oh guys I really
tried hiring or behalf but I had to say
yes we're going to deliver this in two
months instead of six months we just
have to do that team morale just goes to
hell
they're not motivated you don't want to
buy it you don't want anybody empowered
to make that mistake he's an ambassador
and you know biggy skills are valuable
that's kind of valuable we can get over
that but EQ your emotional quotient sort
of understand relating to other people
very very powerful here so if you have
those EQ skills well the other thing we
get you're careful of is you want to
bring work to the team once the team
figures how I work well with each other
they've made some decisions in my years
of a consulting experience and working
with teams and writing code myself I get
a new team together very bright guy it
would say you know it takes anywhere
from three to seven weeks before we
start producing stuff and all of a
sudden you are our velocity is enormous
it's we got great velocity but that
magic point where we actually start
producing three to seven weeks out
because we would sit down we'd sell it
to we like best or what's our philosophy
architectural and we get together we
have to hammer the stuff out again and
then once we establish these sort of
ground rules with each other we're very
productive and then what happens is we
get split up and put new teams we do it
again then you go in short cycle times
you can't do this anymore the projects
are no longer six month long projects
for it longer you
can't afford to pay that penalty for
that so you keep the team together and
bring the work to the team so a team is
sitting here where you've already
hammered other stuff out come to kundrus
as an expert teachers your domain bring
some money with you so we can spend it
and we'll try to make things happen and
we run out of money we're running out of
ideas go away we'll bring you another
guy teach us how to do that so don't
create this sort of musical chairs that
every time I do this I bring my
spreadsheet out oh I need one Senior
Program one architect two key ways
everybody's equal we put them together
the work no they don't they don't work
for the next three to seven weeks
don't break the team up keep them
together they already know how to work
together so we started doing that as
well we brought to work to the teams all
right I get these questions often so we
wrap up with talking about appraisal and
coaching first of all these are
conflicting ideas understand appraisals
and coaching or conflicting ideas and
the idea that management could do these
both with the same team is very very
difficult and IBM I had training and how
to do this as a manager weeks of
training associated Hydra this regular
training as well as coaching but how to
do this job because this is normally the
conflict so the appraisal is about
measuring your contribution however
that's measured V be very specific about
what that contribution is but you want
to measure that contribution it does
affect promotions that's why people
argue about it it may affect your salary
and there's going to be a perception of
what the employee thinks he did versus
what actually the data says the content
was accomplished coaching is about being
honest and giving feedback about what's
wrong so naturally a conflict with that
so how do appraisals on am Angeles
process fortunately guided upon what you
count
what are you counseling that says we've
been successful again productivity is
Dan Norville talking about not to a good
thing effectiveness is how you're going
to measure that you should raise your
very precisely but you can't break it up
by individual not when the team's really
working together you can't say this guy
did this Mike this guy does so much you
can't stand from the outside to make
those judgments where you can sort of
ask the team to allocate it what do you
was who was a major contribution to the
success
so yet the team knows that knows what it
is they can adjudicate that they come
back and say everybody is equal I
perfectly have to accept that answer
trust the team you will have variations
from team to team do not try to fight
that let each team make the decision of
how to do that and certainly encourage
experiment I have one team that said we
could do a group of pretzel
we're going to round the room and
everybody sort of you know we're going
to point to somebody and say okay tell
me something that's tell me about this
person's contribution to this project
everyone has to say something one way
the other got to say something there's
no passing the next person who goes
through that the team had enough trust
with each other that they can have those
Frank dialogues now we didn't like any
manager into that room because we wanted
to have a frank discussion but they came
back to have good answers let them
experiment coaching though Adam Angeles
team is radically different you
basically want to make sure first of all
you separate the timing you don't want
this to be coincident the same appraisal
timing you want to make sure in the
minds of everybody there it's two
separate processes the extent possible
you want to allow again the variations
of how to do this and one things I like
it's a mentor model it says you know
mutually select your mentor it's going
to have your coaching relationship it's
got to be mutual you know we I got to
want to coach you you got to want to be
coached by me and we can't change our
mind we got to make sure we're someone
we don't cap its own own everybody tries
to go to the same person can basically
turn them into the manager so we need a
cap is necessary I actually prefer
outside mentors got mentors who are
outside the team because they don't have
a vested interest in that they don't get
it confused with the contribution stuff
and you really want to have that sort of
firewall that says you're not allowed is
a is a mentor to tell the appraiser
anything it's a private conversation
trees like a doctor privilege sort of
conversation do not break that firewall
things that you can do to break that
very easily status reports well you got
to be very aware of things people who
come to ask you questions as engineers
as engineers we want to answer because
we're engineers you got to fight that
instinct what you really want to do is
you want to ask them that question
hiatuses information
Emira one of my early thought waste
projects it was a fixed-price project so
where we got to cover it no matter how
much effort is the cable one guy came
and said you know you tell me who's
working in India I said are you using
this information I said you did so don't
know fine we figured that I'll come back
and see me
his major comes and sees me let you know
who's working in India I say how are
uses information no ma'am yeah me Anna
well good we fear that he'll come back
and talk to me never saw anybody else
now if I'd answer that question they
would trot it back into my rates and I
have another question why your rate so
high why are we too low why can't we do
with something else another set of
endless questions stop the train here so
it's only comes Nancy from information
like status reports asking what they can
do with it
where's this go who's gonna be reading
this see what they say sign off evil and
so somebody has permission to say you
can do something or not do something in
fuzzy problems that doesn't work those
things I said what I joined the Daily
Mail was sloppy favorite flower across
the CTOs desk was a sign-off sheet they
said the next time I see one of those
slide across my desk I'm going to the
shredder I never saw what just try to
work with John again so he comes and
says we can't work with Johnny he's just
impossible to work with oh no keep
trying I'm sure you can work it out with
him more how it just goes to hell
there was a Harvard Business Review
years ago Harvey visitors review talked
about it what's the damage of one apple
of the bunch
one bad apple a bunch how much does it
spoil a study actually measure it takes
down 10 to 12 other people with him so
John is causing trouble he's taking 10
to 12 all the guys with him get him off
the team then fix the problem and
finally do not overreact to this you
know this could be just has more
planning meetings or a better plan we
wouldn't have this issue we're going to
go faster not slower so you get all the
stuff right you wind up having a new a
new way to attack these fuzzy problems
instead of sort of using stacks stories
and specialists and all the TVD
processes and except this test and
migration scripts and all the stuff to
build
model is which are appropriate for
solving complicated problems instead
when you're solving fuzzy problems
complex problems you want to look at
idea focus features you want to be
talking about full site developers who
can think about the problem and how to
solve it overall you want to build
systems that have fast very built into
so you can try something out
aggressively and forward we went from
notebooks to production there were those
staging no testing no integration
servers bill book to production for two
million pounds 50 employees it was a
good answer micro services as part of
this very small piece of the work you
can change it very aggressively if it's
based architectures under every
definition of that barn gave it this
morning in continuous deployment not
continuous integration continuous
deployment so that sort of wraps of the
story of how you basically want to do am
Angelus process and why it makes sense
for certain class of problems but also
how you attack the problem may be and
how you're more if your organization to
attack it so hoping you got something
out that I'll be around the rest of the
conference so you know please let me
know thank you
