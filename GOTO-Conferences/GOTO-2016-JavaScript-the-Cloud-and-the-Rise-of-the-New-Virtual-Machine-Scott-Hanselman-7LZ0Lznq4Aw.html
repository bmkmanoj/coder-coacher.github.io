needed that energy from that one person
back there who care no it's too late I
don't want your pity
I appreciate you though thank you it's
so nice when lots of people come to a
great conference and can we just give a
big hand for the organizers of go-to for
putting on such a beautiful beautiful
conference absolutely one of the top
conferences not just in Europe but but
worldwide much better than the last
conference that I was at it was me and
that one guy had a good time but it was
good so my name is Scott Hanselman you
might know me from my podcast if you
don't you should check it out it's a
really it's a great show I've done over
500 episodes now so that's ten years of
podcasting it's not Microsoft specific
it's it's a non-denominational podcast
I've got another one that I do with Rob
Connery called this developers life that
people are always asking about we are
working on another episode so you can
check that out and I've also got a
website called March is for makers that
I do every March with my friend Sauron
from code newbies and we talk about IOT
and stuff like that so if you're
interested in IOT check out march is for
makers calm super fun lots of great
stuff now as said before I do work for
Microsoft
but I work remotely so I'm on the forest
moon of Endor safely outside the the
tractor beam and I work an open-source
right which is which is great now when I
went to work at Microsoft I came from
open-source right my work on open source
net and I work on the cloud people
called me a sellout they said you just
selling out to the big corporate machine
and it really hurt my feelings it made
me really sad and I didn't know how that
I was going to be able to to deal with
that and get through that situation but
somehow I found the internal strength
the impersonal integrity because there
was a time before Microsoft when you
know things were kind of rough for me
that's me on the left there but after
Microsoft things worked out pretty great
you know and and working at Microsoft is
a little bit rough because we have a
pretty complicated org chart at the
Microsoft it's funny cuz it's true but
what I want to talk to you here is not
about Microsoft but rather about the
cloud and the browser I was at Intel
recently and I was talking to a person
there who is very very old and I mean
like a hundred and twenty hundred and
twenty-five talking about super old this
was like employee number twelve and this
was a person who had seen my talk on web
programming and asked me how they could
become a web developer and I thought
that was really awkward because this is
someone who has forgotten more about
software than I'll ever know and they
they're asking me how they can learn
about the web and then I realized that
here's a computer science person a
low-level microcode assembly language
person who's been in the industry for 50
60 years but they missed out on the web
stuff all the the nested tables and the
1 pixel
gifts right you know all the crappy
parts of the internet just to give you a
sense of how old this person was this is
a picture of them taking a selfie this
is this very very old person this is a
kind of person who can like look at some
Lisp and be like oh you missed us
you missed a parenthesis right there and
then they would like put the parentheses
back you know just the right number of
parentheses right this was a person that
was so old and I was like what were you
doing when you were not on the internet
and they were like oh I'm sorry I missed
that I was too busy inventing the
compiler if that's the level that we're
talking about here okay now so I thought
to myself what an opportunity here to
teach someone who is a computer person
today is Internet and skip all the yucky
stuff right well I said okay let's look
at it in two ways there's the cloud and
then there's the browser we'll start
with the cloud now there was a time when
this Thomas J Watson who I guess was the
head of IBM or something said that they
thought that there was a world market
for maybe five computers they would
figure they'd be like one per continent
you know and I guess maybe England
probably would want their own so they
would have their own but there was
basically a refrigerator sized computer
one per continent once you sold all five
computers that would be the end of it
now I don't know if this is a real
person I don't know if this is a real
quote but I do have this really old book
so we'll just make that the guy
because you know Abraham Lincoln said
that you can't trust quotes on the
internet so if I'm gonna be making up
all the quotes in this talk we're just
gonna start with this this random guy
all right so it turns out that this is
actually true there is in fact five
computers right there's like the Google
computer and then the azure computer and
then there's like the book store
computer I like I like to imagine the
Microsoft executives like how are we
losing to a bookstore and they like slam
their hands to the ground but that's
just how I imagined it in my mind this
is a picture of the azure cloud we are
we're upgrading right you know we've got
color which is cool we're constantly
adding new fresh computers to the Azure
cloud so don't you know don't count us
out yet we're he's pretty happy with
that section there we go he's pretty
happy about the the Azure cloud but I
said to the person in Intel I said all
right well there's this thing called the
cloud and the person had Intel said well
is that what hipsters call hosting I was
like well yeah but no you know it's more
than just hey there's a computer that I
can't see anymore that's what they
thought the cloud was right before you
have a host and it's like you know it's
that one right that's it's that Linux
computer and then the cloud is when you
just take it away and then you say it's
it's in the other room somewhere we
don't know where that is right that's
what the cloud is but the cloud is more
than that what I said was the
fundamental idea was when we started to
have virtualization now this is a
diagram here that you see in school when
you take your computer science courses
and it's the characteristics of an
operating system right here's the stuff
that makes up an operating system you
have to have security you have to have
memory management you have to have
networking if you have all that stuff
you have an operating system and I said
this to the person in Intel and they
said yes I know I invented all of that
and that was super awkward but but I was
moving through that that's what happens
when you talk to 120 year old computer
people well I said the power isn't the
operating system in the hardware it's
the lie it's the idea that I can lie to
that machine and make it virtual that I
can carry it in a USB key in my pocket
and the computer doesn't know it's being
lied to
it doesn't know it lives in the matrix
right it lives in a virtual machine and
it can be then moved from the cloud to
my data center to other locations that's
what the power of virtualization is and
in fact if you think about
virtualization if you've all seen the
movie Inception right that's a movie
about when you run a virtual machine
inside another virtual machine time
slows down right that's the message that
D'Onofrio was trying to get to us now
you can do anything in a virtual machine
and when you put it in the cloud it's
even more amazing you can do things like
run Linux in Azure in Azure actually 30%
of Azure is Linux people don't realize
that and they say how would they allow
that why would that how is that okay why
would they allow well what do you think
it's running on trying on Windows we you
know we're gonna make you use Windows no
matter what so you know and you can go
up to somewhere like vm depot which is
this cool website with all these
open-source virtual machines and you can
say hey i want you know this Jenkins
virtual machine that runs on Ubuntu and
I can go and grab that little bit of
information and say as your VM create
and I can programmatically talk to that
virtual machine the programmatic
programmatic ability that a word
programmatic M&amp;amp;S being able to
programmatically create a virtual
machine is the power so I asked the
person and Intel how do you make a
virtual machine today and they said well
you fill out a form and you fax it to
your manager and a couple of weeks later
a virtual machine gets provisioned for
you that's horrible like you you need to
be able to go like that and say create a
virtual machine and you get some ASCII
art which is awesome because you know
that's how Microsoft tells you that
we're not evil anymore
just lots of ASCII art and stuff but
virtual machines are kind of kind of
complicated I don't really like virtual
machines I'm not a huge fan of virtual
machines virtual machines are free like
a puppy I was like hey free puppy great
cool now you have to run apt-get update
on the puppy and apt-get upgrade and no
one wants to have to do that to a puppy
it's no fun when you when you get a
virtual machine you're now responsible
for that thing right you have to manage
the lifecycle of that virtual machine
from that moment on what you manage the
operating system you manage the apps so
well the person in Intel was thinking oh
I can just make virtual machines in the
cloud that's cool I said well if you
want to put like an expense reporting
application in the cloud you don't want
you'd want to think about the virtual
machine like if there is a heartbleed or
another one of those cool named bugs
that comes out for Linux they always
have the best names and then you have to
go and shush into a machine
y'all shush into your machines I'm
trying to make this turn into a thing I
want I want that to be a thing we don't
SSH into machines we shushing to them
and you have to do the little thing when
you do that now for your co-workers that
didn't come to go to I want you to just
spend a couple of days just casually
just fitting that into conversation I
don't know how it works in Danis but you
just shush in and then get it so they
think that that's a thing now and then
they start saying that then you switch
back like nothing ever happened and then
see if we can turn that into a thing
that people say okay so you know you
have to go in shush into the machine and
then update it and stuff like that and
you can do anything with a virtual
machine it's great but is that the layer
of abstraction that you want to be it's
kind of like you know your first car
where you have to learn how to drive
stick shift right you have to learn how
to drive manual I know that in America
most people don't know how to do that
not only do most Americans not have a
passport but most Americans can't drive
a manual stick car is this a manual
stick country or automatic manual good
because in America if you break your leg
and then they need to drive you to the
hospital
you have to find someone who can drive
manual or you're gonna lose the leg
that's like a real problem in America
this is why we teach people assembly
language first you make you make them
suffer you make them hurt you today's
hey you want to learn computers kid move
ax commas are it's gonna be great and
then then you then after you're done and
they've suffered enough you say no see
see see is so much better than what why
did you make don't worry about assembly
we're gonna learn see now and then you
and then you make them suffer and see
and you malloc and you're free and
you're mal like a couple more times and
you don't you don't free and then and
then you can you know no C++ it's like
plus plus better than C it's over here
come on
it's great right and then you teach them
Java and c-sharp and garbage collection
and all that kind of stuff and then you
make him wonder why did you make him
suffer because you've got to suffer
first
because if computers were easy than
anybody would do it and we can't have
that so virtual machines are like your
first car you can't you can't go and get
a rental car until you've learned how to
manage your own car and
platform-as-a-service which are web
applications which is what the person at
Intel wanted to do those are like the
the uber or a limousine where you don't
even have to change the oil you want the
cloud to manage the operating system
updates for you you don't want to shush
into that machine or run Windows Update
right
Windows Update sucks having to remote
into a machine to run Windows Update is
really no fun have you ever had that
experience when you're typing on your
Windows machine everything's cool and
then time slows down and gravity starts
to grab your hand which was about to
press Enter
but as that's happening the windows
update restart dialog is coming up and
and you don't know how to stop it and
the restart Now button is the default
button and you're like
but your hand is already being drugged
down depressed thing and then Windows is
like we're restarting and there's only
one way to stop a Windows machine that
has had that happen right and it's a
dirty notepad and then Windows and then
Windows the power of Windows and the
Intel Pentium processor like not
responding I can't reboot because
notepad is dirty there's nothing we have
to save this text file or we are never
going to be able to reboot the server I
haven't no there's no other scenario
it's extremely painful I don't want that
experience it's just it's not ok so you
want to think about things at a higher
level the cloud isn't just unlimited
virtual machines the cloud is best
practices and the cloud is web
applications if I want that expense
reporting app I want to put it in the
cloud and this is where as an old person
it becomes very painful for me because
in the 90s the late 90s I spent about 10
years learning how to make what is
called a web farm yeah yeah it's pretty
amazing he understands that there was
actually an entire page of my CV
dedicated to scaling web farms I I'm one
of the people who has a multi-page CV
because I'm fancy and page 2 was a
decade of learning how to scale websites
and it is now a slider bar
and now I have the joy of going to work
with young people who are like oh this
website is taking like a minute to scale
that's my impression of a young person
I'm sorry I don't know how to do that
but you have to understand what it feels
like when someone goes to the
command-line and they say site scale and
that line right there updating a server
farm the 90s were wasted like you lost a
decade of your life but remember we're
trying to teach this to the Intel person
who skipped out on that stuff so we're
not worried about my personal pain and
the Lost Decade
scaling server farms what we're
interested in is the fact that that
slider bar is the true encapsulation of
a best practice your insurance company
your healthcare company or your whatever
magical startup you work for whatever
unique snowflake that your company is
that has text boxes over data with a new
JavaScript way of doing it the root
issue here is that scaling a web system
is pretty much understood so clot the
cloud has gone in and encapsulated those
best practices for you know geographic
load balancing and things like that and
it's all just done for you so I can go
in there and scale and people are like
what just happened so I told the
gentleman from Intel like you don't have
to worry about that anymore it's
understood the the best practices of my
decade have now been encapsulated into a
check box and it's okay so then they say
then he says well what language should I
use you don't have to use C sharp
directive Java what do I do said well a
good cloud doesn't care about language
choice pick whatever language makes you
happy that's totally cool and he
couldn't believe that and he became a
little bit lightheaded
he can run dotnet or node or PHP or not
PHP or Python you know or just whatever
makes him happy it's all open source and
it's great it all lives up in the cloud
now this is at such a high level a high
level of abstraction that sometimes can
be difficult to get one's brain around
and the best story that I have about
this is actually a go to conference
story I was at go to and we were getting
to see Adrian Cockcroft who was at the
time the chief architect of Netflix okay
he looked like this guy and you know
he's English which means he gets +2
charisma just immediately upon arriving
right you know and he's the chief
architect of Netflix which is like
amazing right so then he shows up and
he's explaining how Netflix made some
really interesting architectural
decisions in the cloud high-level
decisions above virtual machines above
Web Apps the decision was whether they
should go from spinning rust hard drives
hard drives you can hear right you know
if you can hear your hard drive you're
probably a bad person and you should get
an SSD get by an SSD if you can hear
your neighbors hard drive don't ever
trust them hard drives are meant to be
silent or do they how do they transfer
those from spinning rust over to SSDs so
they were looking at what's called AI
ops right the cloud has this notion of
in point operations per second it's some
number that the cloud uses to indicate
throughput from an i/o perspective and
it was something like you know Amazon
was gonna charge them a buck for 300 I
ops or three bucks for 6000 it was like
20 times the perf for three times the
money and he was explaining this at a
high level and then they just had to
like push a button and it would work and
it was amazing and he talked about the
whole architecture and how it was great
but the simple decision of X times more
money for 20x times more parfum SSDs are
great at the end they did the QA and
this young Danish individual came up I
don't know how to do a Danish accent but
I can do nerd and and they were like
well you know actually sir you know SSDs
are extremely unreliable and they will
probably fail either answer
basically telling the chief architect
British guy plus two charisma of Netflix
PhD in unsolvable numbers who knows
telling him you're an idiot SSDs are
gonna fail and you've got your company
on them and how do you justify that it
was unbelievable
and he just stood there and just took it
unbelievable and he thought about it for
a second and he said that's not my
problem I'm renting them we were like we
didn't know what to do I wanted to just
slap somebody I didn't know I just felt
something this this kid didn't even know
he'd been cut your you know you know in
the ninja movies when that when the and
then the head has been cut like this and
then the top part of the skull and the
brain just falls down and the brain is
like right there and the person's like
you know do I push him over is he gonna
fall on his own we didn't know he didn't
know he was dead that's not my problem
I'm renting them whose problem is it an
Amazon's problem what if they all fail
still not my problem right they have an
architecture that they can deal with
those kind of things but ultimately if
you rent the car the car doesn't run
what do you want to do you want to have
another car drive up alongside you and
then you jump into that car and then
this one bursts into flames and goes off
the side of the road and you just keep
taking off right because that's how
rental cars work right that's how it's
supposed to be done now I don't have an
animated gif of a ninja cutting
someone's head it off like that and I
apologize that I don't have that gift
but I do have this gift that happened at
go to
like that's the kind of quality
technical discourse that you only get at
the go-to branded conference that's the
high level that that they're talking
about when you're running something like
a Netflix or a large company like that
near the chief cloud architect of
something like that you're looking at
things at a much higher level dashboard
do you really want to be shushing into
machines in order to see what's going on
no you want to see a map of the earth
you know I mean if you're a global
startup like I am with offices all over
the world in every Starbucks your your
company's dashboard has to include a map
of the earth with random dots pushed
pushed on it right and you want a
dashboard that's gonna show you dollars
and charts and graphs and all that kind
of crap you know I mean if you're really
into dashboards that's cool too you know
but you can't fool yourself into
thinking that that's a dashboard and and
people still argue that that's a
dashboard hey man I got a dashboard I
got a cloud I got a cloud right there I
got top all right fine I'll upgrade each
top it's got color you can't argue that
that's a cloud level dashboard right
those are the kinds of arguments that
people can make but they're always going
to be wrong you can't tell me that Mario
is the superior Mario brother it's
always been Luigi you can say Mario all
you want but I'm still not gonna listen
to you because no Luigi just want to
make sure you're paying attention when
you're thinking about things at a higher
level you also want to try to solve
problems at a higher level so that
things don't become a lot of what are
called yak shaving you guys know what
yak shaving is we'll talk about yak
shaving in just a second there was an
interesting problem that the New York
Times had where they had terabytes and
terabytes of TIFF files that were scans
high-res scans of all the different
issues of the paper and they gave them
to some interns and they said would you
OCR these and put them into PDFs and
have the embedded text so we can search
them cool no problem
totally awesome into
any thing to do right for each paper in
papers right no problem for loop got
that computer science for loop well it
turns out that if you take you know 150
terabytes of something and you for loop
over it you know it'll take a little
while so then suddenly this becomes an
interesting computer science problem
when your boss is thinking hey for loop
no problem
maybe your weekend and but you're
thinking well me I could do multiple
processors multiple disks I could shard
the disks
I could have multi-threaded within the
multiple processors how many machines do
I have suddenly this is a really
complicated thing and your boss says is
that done yet and you say hang on I'm
trying to shave this yak and when I'm
done shaving the yak then I will talk to
you about the business problem yak
shaving you know yak is right it's a big
hairy animal right yak shaving is all of
the stuff you have to do to get ready to
do the stuff that you want to do right
hey I can put in a node app in the cloud
well gonna get up your github and you
get your CI and your test containers and
got to shave this yak let me show you a
good example of yak shaving now be
careful if you go out there and you
decide to Google with Bing for yak
shaving you can find some pretty bad
stuff so you're gonna want to search for
very specific gif here this is an
animated gif showing yak shaving to this
guy Bryan Cranston comes home and he
says hey how's it going I'm a light on
oh this light is it's broken I gotta fix
this light I'm just like it's burned out
shoot oh the thing is broken there I
want to fix that 400 the squeaky this is
kind of squeaky right here hang on I'll
get some oil for that Wow crap I'm not
of oil all right I'll go to this car and
I'll the car won't start
oh crap alright have you fixed that
light bulb yet what does it look like
I'm doing
isn't that like every continuous
integration server setup that you've
ever done it's like literally everything
that is that is how it's done lost my
spot that is tragic because there's
7,000 slides here here you think I'm
joking there's like a freakin million
slides it's okay there's only like 250
floods so it's okay we'll just look at
Mario again all right so what if you
could think about things at a higher
level and you could do naive parallelism
on something like that right you say I
want to do a for loop and you just want
to move this slider bar the computer
science problem of doing multi processor
multi node whatever type scaling has
been solved and now we're starting to
see things like Amazon lambda or Azure
functions where you can write a little
bit of code and you give them your
credit card and you just say scale until
$300 because that's how much money I
have that slider bar then gets plugged
directly into your credit card and it
will scale and the the problem is
ultimately some function called do it
that does that thing here's an example
you can imagine how to go and call a
couple of libraries and OCR some text
it's not a big deal but what if you
could go and take that do it function
and a little console app like this and
put some inputs and outputs on it such
that you have a trigger where you put a
file into a piece of storage or into a
queue and it fires off that function and
then the resulting output pops into an
output queue suddenly then all the act
shaving goes away that's the promise of
what is on top of platform-as-a-service
or you can have functions as a service
so I try to explain to the individual at
Intel that this is the kinds of layers
of abstraction that we're seeing now
with the cloud and it's so much more
than just hosting so then we got to move
to the browser talk about the backend
how do I explain the front end to this
person well remember this diagram where
we have memory management and threading
and all the different characteristics of
an operating system there was a time
when you would sit down in front of a
computer that looked like that and you
would talk to one of the five computers
in the world that look like a
refrigerator and you would go to your
page and you would go in you there we go
and you would you'd go to your page and
that that user interface was generated
though by the refrigerator
what was that computer doing it's
waiting fast-forward 40 years and I have
a quad processor 16 gigs of ram i seven
with SSD that's pretty much waiting
around for angle brackets or curly
braces pretty much all the time I have a
pocket supercomputer with a quad
processor and 3d accelerated graphics
that also waits for some refrigerator
somewhere to go and make some some text
I don't think that's what Tim
berners-lee and friends wanted when they
made the first web page by the way this
is in fact the first web page this is
like the beginning of the Internet and
it's funny that your URLs in your
website seem to change and get broken
but the the Internet's first page is
still there because cool you are eyes do
not change this page here was the
beginning of the internet and they had
anticipated it would be this big hyper
media book they weren't thinking
application platform they weren't
thinking you know this is gonna be great
and then we're gonna make an angular
JavaScript framework they just wanted to
have these infinite books right and
berners-lee is a super nice person and
extremely humble and I think that we as
developers and as web developers need to
take a moment and appreciate his job
title because he could have put the
but he showed restraint and he did not
say the which means that whatever your
job title is it's fancier than hisses so
that means that I am NOT a senior web
developer anymore I will always be
junior as long as that is his title and
and a funny story actually a very
uncomfortable thing that happened at
work I was talking to this very nice I
think it was a Danish guy very nice guy
at work and we were having an argument
about rest and HTTP and it was a
friendly argument then he left and then
my buddy says do you know who that was
nothing good ever happens out of a
sentence that starts with do you know
who that was
no tell me that was Heinrich Nielsen he
invented HTTP I was just arguing about
HTTP with the person that invented it I
then double checked trust but verify I
went and looked on the spec first named
Heinrich first Nielsen
he was Tim berners-lee's intern so now I
see him in the hallways I don't know
what to do what do you do i genuflect
doing they might go like this like you
know he made the good job on the
Internet
thanks sir they didn't understand when
they made these things how popular they
were gonna be and they didn't know that
we were going to create hacks when we
didn't get the web that we wanted we
wanted a Portable Document format HTML
wasn't the format that we wanted so they
made PDF and the people that made PDF
they didn't know that it was going to
become the fifth most popular religion
on the planet
no one no one could possibly guess that
how could that have happened
so we're surfing the web we're trying to
make it something that it's not and then
this happens how did we know when this
happened because we were surf and we
were and then Java loaded and then these
guys were like we can do it too right
and then these guys were like we've got
you to there's still a reason to live
what were we doing what were those
things three things trying to do they
were trying to do that they were trying
to bring another operating system we
wanted an application platform so we put
one in a little square in the middle of
the browser and then people would load
applications up into that thing and we
thought it was a good idea now you're
all software people so I assume when you
go to check in at the airport that you
want to see what's on the other side cuz
you're looking at their stuff you know
their and I'd like to check in right now
what kind of a system are you running
here yeah so how do I get upgraded and
then by the time you get yourself over
here you're like oh so f7 gets me to
business class ah because we just want
to know how that system works right now
I've got a Toyota Prius it's like a
hybrid because I live in Portland Oregon
and they give us those when were born
and I went to the Toyota store because I
wanted to have the oil changed in the
car and I always talked to the guy about
the system they've got like a text
terminal thing that talks to an as/400
and then one day I show up they get a
whole new system I'm like oh dude you
got to tell me about your new system
that sounds amazing and he says yeah man
it's super cool fires up Windows XP
and then he fires up firefox and then he
opens a jar file off the desktop and
Java is like are you sure you want to
run Java and and then he's like yes and
then Java is like the Internet's pretty
much decided that Java is a bad idea
please type the Internet is pretty much
to say that the job is a bad idea in
this text box to prove that you know
what you're doing and he goes and he
does that he loads the jar file and the
jar file is a terminal emulator that's
talking to the sane a s400 on the
backend and then he looks me in the face
and tells me that this is so much better
than the system before we're creating
these ridiculous systems that are these
documents with these little islands of
interactivity and little physics demos
of teapots and such and it's totally not
what the world meant and you know God
bless Java on the server side but for
applets yeah it's more like right once
debug anywhere now job is happening but
then what's happening simultaneously
this is Java people don't like that
because totally not related it's 2016
I'm still explaining to my boss that
JavaScript doesn't equal Java and I lose
him somewhere at the exclamation point
equal and he's like what is the
exclamation point like no it just means
that it's not the same thing
it's just shut up so javascript is
happening and javascript it looks like
it could be something it could be
amazing here is a flowchart of what it's
like to work in JavaScript
javascript so how did we know that
javascript was amazing it's because
people did crazy stuff with it
they built like terminal emulators in
JavaScript they built Commodore 64
complete system emulators in JavaScript
to prove that it was possible but we all
thought it was a toy right because we
would always have these conversations
with our boss about whether or not we
should use JavaScript for stuff but do
you remember that moment when you
figured out that javascript was not just
a toy because I would just go to like
fill out a form and I just put alert
poned as my first name or whatever and
I'd be like JavaScript but the moment
the moment that I knew that JavaScript
was really something special we you all
had this experience you're filling out a
form you put in your phone number and
you hit tab and the form field goes red
and you could I don't think it posted
back to the server and you fill the
format again you hit tab maybe you pull
the network cable out just to prove it
to yourself you go it validated the
entire form on the client and I grabbed
my laptop and running like this because
I'm a programmer I don't know how to run
very well and I don't care and then I
brought over and I show my boss and he's
like I still have no idea what's
happening and I thought to myself
javascript is actually a thing Java
scripts of thing that people can do
amazing stuff with so then to prove that
people could do amazing stuff I went and
found this this is a complete
implementation of Linux entirely in
JavaScript
but-but-but hang on though you should be
immediately suspicious because anytime
someone shows you something cool on the
web you have to right-click on it first
to make sure it's not flash because I
could have just said that and I would
have right-click and it'd be like about
flash and you'd be like why are you a
liar and then even though you don't see
flash you're still suspicious and then
you have to select the text you go hang
in a second and then if you're really
still not even sure if that's really a
thing or not then you need to go and run
GCC and then compile a C application so
now I'm running Windows running a
browser running a JavaScript running a
Linux emulator running GCC and compiling
a C application to say hello world
because that's awesome and I showed this
once is it gonna work
I showed this once at a conference and
they didn't they said why don't you
using GCC I I don't think my choice of C
compiler really affects you I'm running
JavaScript complete emulator so I was
trying to figure out how I could explain
to them that this was an important time
you know in our lives and that something
amazing had just happened and the best
thing I could do to prove that was to
fire up on my Windows machine an iPhone
emulator and then go to Safari and then
inside Safari fire up a Linux emulator
and then so now I'm running Windows
running iPhone running Safari running
JavaScript running Linux running a C
application and I think at that point I
am allowed to pick my own C compiler
so this is the part where I remind
everyone that you probably should stop
disabling JavaScript because it just
seems like at least in Portland when I
meet people before I've heard their name
I know that they are a vegan that you
CrossFit and they disable JavaScript in
their browser and I'm literally just
handshaking them like you know I've just
now met them I don't know your name yet
you know I'm a vegan crossfitter and I
don't browse with JavaScript enabled why
you have to have JavaScript all the good
stuff happens when you have JavaScript
enabled there's amazing games written in
JavaScript and at this point you might
be thinking this is probably where Scott
is going to show us that you can compile
C++ and run it through clang and M
scripting and turn it into azzam J s and
he's probably hopefully run quake in the
browser cuz that's the point in every
talk about JavaScript where someone has
to go and run quake in the browser no
not gonna do it
cuz it's cliche and I just like to look
at Jack Reacher being sad what I want to
do instead is I want to take the
characteristics of JavaScript and
overlay it on that one slide that talked
about the characteristics of an
operating system so JavaScript has
garbage collection it has all these
great graphics subsystems it's got
networking all this kind of stuff it has
all the characteristics that one would
need when they wanted to make something
an operating system javascript must be
an operating system and Atwoods law says
that any application that can be written
in javascript will eventually be written
in javascript then again proving that
javascript is its own operating system
now at this point I've pretty much
convinced myself of that but then I
discovered that councilman's law is that
any application that can be written in
Microsoft Excel will eventually be
written in Microsoft Excel
including a pixel-perfect compatibility
system of pac-man where each individual
CEL is a pixel this is actually so
perfect and so amazing that it can't be
stopped
ooh that's a good error I'm gonna go
ahead and say yes
I love it when Windows says not
responding new halloween is coming up if
you heard about my halloween costume i'm
gonna be going as Microsoft Outlook I'm
gonna actually I'm gonna set up this bla
like a shower curtain with kind of an
opaque shower curtain where you can kind
of see me but you can't quite see me and
it's gonna say not responding at the top
and then I'm just gonna go to parties
and then just be really antisocial and
refuse to speak to anyone that's gonna
be amazing so you've got a new operating
system on your phone that you didn't
know inside of that browser and phones
are so powerful now this is all the
stuff that I had in my pocket in 1993
that's all the stuff in my pocket today
there's been so much creativity since
the introduction of the iPhone it's very
exciting time for phone design now this
young man said that betting on html5 was
a problem it was too soon they should
have bet on native instead and he wrote
Facebook's app over again I think that
that's wrong I think html5 and the open
web gonna continue to push things
forward and it's been proven that HTML
apps can be as fast as native apps
there's a really wonderful quote from
one of our great American philosophers
that says the Avalanche has already
begun it's too late for the pebbles to
vote what a great frickin quote that's
one of those quotes you just want to put
in your mouth and chew on it
the avalanche has begun the mountain is
coming down and the pebbles are having a
meeting about the Avalanche how do we
feel about this avalanche that's your
boss wondering if html5 is ready for
primetime do you think that this is a
thing is it going to be a good idea
maybe let's wait and see who said that
which of our great philosophers said
that and passenger Kosh awesome thank
you first time that has ever happened
big hand for the young lady for pulling
it off thank you awesome
now when you say html5 you really mean
JavaScript and CSS right it's the family
of stuff and ultimately how do you tell
HTML from html5 well you try it out an
internet explorer and if it didn't work
it's probably html5 that's the general
test for html5 compatibility it's
difficult to be a web designer now there
was a time when the most advanced thing
in computer science was HTML tables
there was no more complicated thing
compiler Theory HTML tables and I could
go in off the street to anywhere and I
could get a job do you know tables yes
yes I do
boom junior engineer then later on in my
career they would say do you know
rowspan I do senior engineer VP of
engineering based entirely on HTML
tables in fact I know that on Netscape
Navigator for the maximum number of
nested tables is 32 and the only way
that you know that is when you've
written your 33rd table and you stared
Satan himself in the face and said I
don't think so sir I don't think so but
today HTML is nothing the kids don't
even appreciate the angle brackets they
just make a div I'll see the most
amazing stuff I'll see Gmail level
multi-page cool Ajax blah blah blah and
I'll go awesome view source it's one div
I have no idea how they did that but
that was amazing div they wrote that div
better than any other div HTML is just
the structure now write CSS gives you
the color and the style and CSS is so
expressive and powerful so intuitive you
immediately get know what you're gonna
get and you try to express something in
CSS completely clear and understandable
it's amazing
CSS is awesome
now I tried to fix this cup because it
bothered me and it's even worse when you
try to fix it you can't so then you use
JavaScript for everything else and
JavaScript is amazing because in Ruby is
everything is an object and closure is
everything's a list and in JavaScript
everything is a terrible terrible
mistake
here's me learning JavaScript as a young
child
and JavaScript is great because you
don't even need to learn the bad parts
you know you can think of a noun and
google it and there is a noun je s I was
like lawn chair there is lawn chair je s
it is a real thing javascript is so
intuitive powerful so fun to debug now
John Resig who wrote jQuery made this
amazing book called secrets of a
JavaScript ninja you should get this
book it's amazing but I noticed when I
bought this book that there's a samurai
on the cover
so I said John Resig why is there a
samurai on the cover of secrets of
JavaScript ninja and he says well that's
because JavaScript is loosely typed
ninja samurai duck typing I apologize
for that joke now someone else said once
that JavaScript is the assembly language
of the web who said that I did I had to
be in here somewhere I'm gonna make that
quote everyone else said that and I got
yelled at on reddit so I went to Brendan
Eich who created JavaScript and I said
what's the deal here and he that is
actually Brendan Fraser that is Brendan
Eich but you know Brendan Fraser is a
beautiful man so we'll just keep him up
there he needs to work I haven't seen
anything of his since the mummy Brendan
Brendan Eich says javascript is the x86
of the web but he said it a couple of
years ago and he can't claim its
original it's one of those things that
everyone says right but then it actually
happened like I said it it's a new
assembly language and now they're making
it they're making the web assembly it is
a joint effort and this is happening
we're gonna be able to compile C and C++
in a supported way into web assembly and
it's super powerful you can do things
now of course like CoffeeScript like you
know this is what a ruby person wishes
javascript was or you can take
typescript which is what a c-sharp
person wishes that javascript was you
can compile those things into idiomatic
JavaScript so it's a compilation target
it's a trans compilation target but
people sometimes let layers high too
much complexity and they don't really
learn JavaScript right they just learn
jQuery they forget about the underneath
bits they think that they're slick but
they're not
I'll do that one again sorry that's just
too good not to show again I'm almost
done now people say that no one writes
JavaScript anymore write they write
jQuery you can meet people and ask them
to go and do some JavaScript and they'll
immediately go and say you know open
Resig and then they'll start writing
some some selector who said this jQuery
said this jQuery if you go and look up
jQuery in the Wikipedia it says jQuery
this article is about the actor for the
JavaScript like legacy see jQuery so
jQuery actually said that no one writes
down something where a jQuery and the
great thing about knowing who jQuery is
and knowing about his IMDB page it's
amazing is that once you know jQuery
exists if you're having a conversation
at work about it like you know we should
probably use jQuery for that then you
have to say well I don't know I'll call
his agent and see if he's available
you've I've ruined jQuery for you
because jQuery because you think you're
gonna build something with jQuery and
it's gonna be amazing and then it never
turns out the way that you thought it
was going to turn out and you don't know
like whose fault it is it's extremely
stressful people need to use vanilla Jas
no your low-level stuff right vanilla
Jas is where it at that is a library
that I think we can all get behind
vanilla Jas is this fast cross-platform
framework and you can go up here and say
what you want you can say I want
animations and regular expressions in
math library and Ajax and Dom and it
will go and dynamically build the
library that you need and what's
exciting ability there is a little bit
bigger when you gzip it
yeah because it turns out that you
already have the stuff that you need
right and people will go and like
there's all these great frameworks
available but they'll go and they'll
like make their own before they go and
do their startup right people should
expect more from their web tools the web
is in a really great place right now
where stuff works well together things
are plugging in well so I explained to
the person from Intel that you have got
this amazing cloud on the server side on
the back end this in an infinite scale
and elasticity and your choice of
languages but on the client side you
have this deceptively powerful
accelerated machine you've got a virtual
machine you're not using you might say
well a thousand people have hit our
website and we only have ten machines in
the farm but are you forgetting about
the thousand quad processors that have
JavaScript and a VM on them it's amazing
how often I'll go to a page that has a
table and I'll sort by a certain column
and we all know that the intel i7
processor isn't optimized for sorting
lists of 10 or even 15 items so we'll
post those items back to the server and
let the server in the cloud the power of
the cloud sort those 10 items and then
bring them back over again I'm seeing
graphs and charts being generated as
pngs on the server side while pocket
supercomputers sit and wait so remember
that you've got this integrated virtual
machine and you can write JavaScript or
you can target it with JavaScript your
cloud doesn't need to work so hard
that's what I've got you are powerful my
friends you already know the cloud and
you can program the browser so get to
work thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
