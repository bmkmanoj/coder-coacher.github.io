mixed reality with microsoft hololens
I'll skip that slide because Lars just
told you to use the app so my name is
Philip I'm the founder and CEO of media
lesson where small consultancy based in
Germany which explains my strange accent
and my sometimes inability to speak
proper English
I'm also Microsoft regional director and
four times micros MVP which doesn't mean
I do work for Microsoft I'm a full
independent expert but obviously we do
partner a lot with Microsoft so today we
want to talk a little bit of about mixed
reality and hololens so that's our
roadmap for today I want to kick off
with just some general remarks on mixed
reality how its positioned in there in
the universe with virtual reality and
augmented reality then we'll have a
quick look at the hardware that's kind
of the centerpiece of the experience I
will try to do a live demo on stage
which is always kind of risky with this
guy with this device but we'll see how
that goes
I will show you some some real-life use
cases that are built today and then
we'll talk sometime about the developer
story that's behind hololens and all the
options that you have if you want to go
into the area of mixed reality reality
and hopefully we'll have some time left
after my talk so that some of you get
the chance to actually try it out
because it's a huge difference between
seeing videos and and images and me
talking about the experience then to
actually really wearing the headset and
and having the chance to try it out so I
have brought with me two devices and I
will also be here during the break so
hopefully a lot of you get a chance to
actually really try it out okay
let's start into mixed reality so if we
talked about the headsets like the
hololens its first of all important to
understand that it's not so much about
the technology of visualizing stuff like
how much resolution how much resolution
does display having things like that it
the the the trick really isn't in the
sensors the spatial understanding the
environmental understanding that this
device actually offers so let's sort
that out mixed reality is kind of a new
buzzword that has been promoted by
Microsoft which really means the
blending of the virtual and the real
world so let's take a little bit deeper
in that one so we have obviously the
physical reality with all our real world
app objects as we as humans sense it and
then for a lot of years already we have
the virtual reality with various devices
like the H is HTC wife they offer us a
full virtual environment virtual world
can take us anywhere we want we can have
virtual objects of any size and kind and
do whatever we like in this world so you
the idea really is to bring those things
together for a mixed experience that is
not only about blending the physical and
the virtual world but also about
understanding between the two worlds so
they really fit into each other so when
we look at the virtual reality as most
of you might have already experienced on
us on those devices out there we are
full virtual we can do whatever you like
but we cannot see the real world anymore
so each of us who is wearing a headset
like that is kind of stuck in his own
virtual world this is really nice
because it's very immersive so it's
great for gaming and entertainment it's
not so nice if we want to actually get
things done right because if we won't
work with a device we'd still need to
collaborate with other human beings most
of the time we
to be able to interact with our
customers and clients we might want to
construct something with a group of
Engineers so virtuality is not so great
at that because if I cannot see another
person it's really hard to interact with
it there's virtually no real
communication possible and then on the
other extreme if we look at automated
reality devices out there like maybe
Google glass or handheld based systems
it's really about augmenting and digital
layering into your girls it's like I
head up this play in your car or in jet
so it's giving us an extra digital
information layer but it's not truly
interacting with the environment when we
go over to the mix reality though it's
really about integrating and responding
to the real world so the device has an
understanding that there's a floor I'm
standing on and I can apply physics to
my Holograms so if I drop a ball on the
hololens it can bounce back from the
floor because the the headset actually
knows there's a floor or it knows about
furniture a chair and a table so you can
really interact and this offers some
really nice opportunities so for example
if I want to have a TV in the wall on my
wall wearing a hololens
I just pin a 2d pane onto that wall
because the hololens understands it's a
wall I can pin things against it they
stick to it today they can really lock
on the wall or I can have virtual
objects really sitting on my table not
falling down and not being like halfway
in the table but really sitting on top
of it no matter where I'm moving so what
actually is a hologram for me it all
started with Star Wars having Princess
Leia being able to communicate through a
hologram so it's basically like any
other object in my real world with only
one difference instead of being made of
physical matter a hologram is made
entirely of light obviously
so it has some some physical limitation
because it's made of a lot of light
there is no color black for example
because what light would black be so if
I'm having something black in my virtual
world wearing a hololens
it becomes completely transparent I can
see through obviously so having the
color black is really hard in a hologram
and because holographic objects are
really mimicking the real world
I can I can view it from different
angles so it's really locked in my in my
real world it's anchored so I can walk
around it like with any real object I
can view it from different sizes and
angles this is really interesting
because it gives us a different approach
different connection to two virtual
objects if you imagine you're learning a
human anatomy with a hologram it's a
huge difference if you can actually view
it from different angles just using your
own body then using a controller it
gives you a much better sense of
proportion and size and dimension and
gives you way more insight than
traditional 3d technology and well
obviously if holograms don't offer any
physical resistance so if you touch them
or push them you wouldn't have any any
feedback there are a lot of people
working on this issue with special
cloths that that offered an electronic
feedback but I think we're not quite
there yet so another view on on the
market would be dividing up the device
categories between desktop performance
mobile performance to really see where
holograms or and hololens
fits in so on the horizontal axis we
have desktop versus mobile and on the
vertical axis we have physical reality
versus virtual reality and most of the
professional-grade VR devices nowadays
would be on the lower right corner right
there attached to a real PC it has to be
a really powerful
a lot of graphics GPU power and they're
fully fully closed you don't seal the
real world and then on the other side
the LR portable we are devices on the
market in a lower left corner that would
be something like Samsung gear VR or
Google daydream and then hololens
positions itself in the top left corner
being very portable and I come to that
in a second and being really see-through
devices and this is besides the sensors
that the spatial understanding being a
portable device is a really really real
differentiator for the hololens because
it enables a lot of interesting
scenarios since it's not tethered to any
PC it's its own self-contained computer
you can really have a very robust
experience you can just carry it around
to your client go into its his empty
construction site put it on and start
planning right away you don't need to
pre scan the room you don't need extra
sensors being set up it's all built into
the headset so if we compare it to
augmented virtuality it kind of gives a
lot of the same features it allowed us
it allows us to augment the real world
with helpful information obviously we
can just have simple head up layers in
hololens as well we can blend Holograms
in your real world and then one thing
that's very little known about hololens
is it also has some sort of a VR mode so
there are certain apps like for example
hollow tour where you have so many
holograms in front of you it really
closes your field of view so you're
completely in a VR environment but
obviously it doesn't completely replace
the real world like a virtual reality
device with - so let's have a short look
at the hardware
the Hollande's itself as I said
self-contained computer which basically
means everything that it needs it's
built into the
to the headset it has a CPU a GPU it has
Ram it has a has persistent storage it's
basically a Windows 10 machine and then
it adds up with all the sensors and the
sensors are used first of all for a
spatial recognition so it's scanning the
room to make an architecture spatial map
of it it's using this using the same def
sensors that were introduced with the
Kinect camera and also has an RGB video
camera sitting in the middle of it
actually watching your hands and
allowing you to take screenshots and
videos of the field of view as you might
imagine we we need to have some sort of
a display those are the transparent
lenses they have a fairly low resolution
they're only running at 720p that's very
low if you compare it to an HTC Y for
oculus rift but if you try it out your
first time you will see the the
Holograms itself a crystal crystal sharp
it's a really nice piece of hardware and
then obviously some sort of silicon that
actually does all these complex
processing if you see how many sensors
the system has there's a lot of sensor
data that needs to be processed and
interpreted and therefore the hololens
has a firt computing unit it's called
the HPU the holographic processing unit
it's a dedicated piece of hardware that
does all the sensor calculation takes
all the raw sensor data and provides us
useful meaning out of it it also does
all the gesture recognition and and
voice recognition in the system another
very important component of the hololens
would be spatial audio if we if we look
at hololens and watch all the videos
about it on youtube we will see it's
almost all the time about the visual
experience but if you want to have a
true immersive experience
you also need audio audio helps you
actually identify the location of
objects in the room because most of the
time an object the hologram would not be
in your field of view Smita might be
behind you
left-right wherever and using special
spatial sound you can actually guide the
user towards a hologram and gain his
attention and it's done through those
two little red speakers that allow you
also to hear your your real world so you
can still interact with other humans
which again it's very important if you
want to use this device in a
professional environment and right now
it's clearly the direction where it's
positioned towards professional use
interaction also very important because
very different in hololens we have
basically free systems of interaction
using the hololens the first one would
be gaze cases just basically means where
i'm looking at and it's like if you
imagine you have a little laser pointer
that's mounted on your head says it
sends a rate and wherever it collides
with your real world or your virtual
world you will get a free D pointer at
this position so it's basically a mouse
in 3d wherever you're looking at you can
see where it collides and then interact
with the object then to do actually to
do some sort of interaction you have
gesture that are usually combined with
the gaze so you're looking at a virtual
real object and then you do a chest or
in the most common gesture in the
hololens would be the air tap which is
just your finger and doing like this
this is kind of the mouse click there
are some other Chesters like what the
bloom gesture for example to actually
spin up the the Windows Start menu but
to click really important most important
one and then the third system would be
voice commands so we have a built in
microphone array like the Kinect test so
we have very very good voice recognition
built into the device and if you design
your whole lungs application it's really
important to determine your audience and
then decide whether you go for voice or
chest or a combination of both because
there are certain situations where the
gaze gesture system will be very good
because it's precise for example in a
professional environment you have
some people that use the device on a
daily basis or on a regular basis they
used to using gaze and gesture so that's
very efficient for them but if you have
on the other sent a handle application
that's more public facing like for theme
park for a trade fair where you put on
the Holland's for people that have never
used it before they have a hard time
learning gazing gesture
it takes some minutes to adjust to it so
it might be more efficient if using
voice commands for these situations so
to give you a first overall impression
how the device fields I have one little
video that I wanted to show you to set
your own same page here
microsoft hololens brings holograms into
your real world
using transparent lenses spatial sound
and an understanding of your environment
Holograms look and sound like they're
actually part of the world around you
that is mixed reality with microsoft
hololens holograms are viewed through
the holographic frame centered in the
middle of your view this preserves your
peripheral vision so you can move freely
and connect and collaborate with people
around you holograms and mixed reality
don't block out what you can see in here
this enables you to engage with digital
content and tools alongside the objects
in your real world Holograms can be
world locked in a physical location so
you can walk around them or they can
travel with you you can even hear them
in 3d with spatial sound
microsoft hololens is the world's first
fully untethered self-contained
holographic computer with the mixed
reality experience of hololens you can
stay in the real world and interact with
real people as you simultaneously
explore 3d in 3d
okay that looks impressive looks like a
lot of post-production right so one one
new information that's that's really
important that came up in the video is
the holographic frame so in some of the
shots that were in the video you could
see that it the actual holographic
experience isn't like full screen fully
immersive all around you there's a
certain frame in which you can see
Holograms and there's a lot of space
around you in your field of view but you
don't see Holograms this is this is
because the the lenses actually have a
certain area here where the display is
sitting and that's basically like a
little display that sit in front of you
so it's not as immersive as you might
think when you were watching expression
especially the very early video stated
of the hololens so the holographic frame
is one piece that you might find
surprising when you're first wearing
wearing the hololens okay
so summing up we have a device that
supports mixed reality in virtual
reality mode it it's the core the core
feature would be spatial mapping to
actually really understand the
environment and you have seen that in
the video a little bit where it has this
this little mesh that was drawing all
around the room with the polygons you
can actually do that on the hololens if
you just click around you
we have no application open you're
wearing the hololens just click around
you can actually visualize exactly the
spatial mesh that's going on it's fully
untethered runs Windows 10 and has an
interaction model using gaze chest and
voice so now comes the fun part for you
maybe not for me to actually try to show
you live how this how this feels what
I'm running here is the hololens
companion app it's just a very simple
Venus 10 app that connects to a hololens
and let's see if that works give it a
little second
okay went online that's a good sign so
you will see it has a little bit of a
delay because I'm I'm connecting to the
Holland's through my iPhone hotspot so
it's not really a super professional
Wireless I'm using so we have a little
bit of a delay but you can see I have
the the main menu actually floating in
front of me that's kind of a the
hololens version of the Windows 10 Start
menu that I can bring up and hide using
the bloom gesture so if I do the plume
gesture it's gone if I do the bloom
gesture again your this so let's see
before the session I already pin two
apps here you can see those two windows
those represent apps that are currently
running and so if I click on one of
those guys the apps will actually load
up and here we are this is a demo
version of a app that's used for the
education of abductors and giving them
some anatomic insights so this is a
basically a hologram that's that's super
stable so if I move around very fast
it's it's rock solid doesn't move around
in space it's like a real object and one
very cool thing about Holograms is if
I'm getting very close to them and I
need to look on the screen a little bit
actually they open up at a certain
distance let's see so I can really look
inside what's going on in this in this
human body you as a developer you can
actually adjust the distance when when
holograms open up so the standard
distance would be 85 centimeters but you
can control it so this is a very basic
application that doesn't have a lot of
interaction in it but it actually gives
gives a very good idea about how
hololens feel in the real world and
although it might look very immersive on
the on the previous screen actually in
my field of view it's like it's
it's approximately this size and all
everything around doesn't have Holograms
so if I want to see something up here I
really need to move my head a lot to
actually explore the Holograms but
usually people are just very fast to
this behavior so I don't very nice thing
is the spatial mapping visualization so
if I go out of this out of this app and
then let's see when the preview picks up
to it I then click for example on the
floor you see you should see the polygon
outline so you can actually see what the
hololens is actually seeing and how it's
recognizing the room and as I move
around with my head I can really see how
it's scanning the entire room there are
certain limitations on a distance so it
doesn't scan things that are more than 6
meters away from me but in a normal
office setting I can scan the entire
room and actually it saves the room
profile so if I place Holograms in this
room and I go elsewhere and come back in
two hours
it will reload all those Holograms on
their original position that I placed
them all right let's see if I can back
to slides
oh come on
we are quick look at use cases that are
out there as you know the the hololens
is not really consumer good device right
now it's it's available as a developer
edition price around $3,000 and then
there's a commercial edition that comes
at five thousand dollars so it's use
cases are clearly aimed towards
professional use and they're actually
quite a lot of them oops
guys it's flickering did it make
something wrong oh okay hopefully okay
let's go on so if you imagine marketing
and sales you want to sell a complex
product maybe on a trade fair or in a
car saloon and you want to visualize
things that are not on the outside of a
product like for example how the engine
works how certain digital systems work
it's a really nice way to to bring those
content up and had to have some sort of
a view inside of a product obviously
product design so if you're actually
working on products before printing them
out in 3d you might want to use a
hologram to to really construct it and
then for education obviously we've seen
that with the holo Anatomy sample right
now it's a really nice way to educate
about complex complex content then
there's architecture and this is an
interesting case we we kind of prototype
that for ourselves a couple of months
ago we've been moving into a new office
space that was completely empty there
were no walls inside just a basic
building structure oh no it's gone I'm
sorry about that and we wanted to figure
out where would we put walls how would
we the room feel if we put a wall here
or there where would we need extra
windows where where won't we want to
build class and we actually constructed
a very simple app using cinema 4d 4d and
unity where we can just place walls
the empty space and you had a really
nice impression of how the room would
look like without actually constructing
it so those are scenarios that work
extremely well or another use case would
be your manufacturer of a complex
machinery that is part of a larger
production line for example and their
machines already placed on the shop
floor before or after that the machine
you're actually building and you go
there if your client all wearing
hololens this and you can actually place
the machine in in real size and see if
all the connectors fit if it works in
the right space remote servicing there
are a lot of use cases already doing
that so allowing people to help me
remotely so having engineers not going
on-site but shipping hololens is with
complex machinery there's research with
NASA going on on Mars games and
entertainment obviously McQuarrie area
and then semi virtual construction is
one of the use cases my company is
currently working the most on so you're
having a certain machinery or or cars
that are built in parts you have just a
chassis for example and you want what we
want to see there simulated real lights
or you want to simulate certain
accessories on a car that's really nice
use case using the hololens because it
can actually identify the object and
then precisely build holograms on top of
it and then there a lot more
okay I'll skip over that one so let's
see how we actually build applications
for mixed reality and right now we have
a quite a choice of options there so
four four four four four start we need
to actually choose what kind of
application we want to build for the
hololens they're basically two types in
general there's a holographic view and
there's a 2d view and we've briefly seen
this in my demo where we had where had
the two representations of the apps that
were actually running already as 2d
panes and then as soon as I clicked on
one of those app instances it got
fullscreen and offered me a holograph
expereinces and actually i can do both
and mix them with the hololens and let's
have a look at those two so if I go for
a holographic view obviously I have get
Holograms and I get a some sort of
fullscreen experience I'm the only app
running at the moment we can render
world lock Holograms we can really
anchor them and per system across
holographic sessions we can even export
those world log Holograms and copy them
to other hololens devices so we can set
a set up an application experience with
a room with one device and then spread
it out to multiple devices shell doesn't
render so the menu is not the air and
Venus running and the app is handling
all the user input and then we have the
2d view where we were rendering on a on
a 2d pane and we can roll out those
slates we can adjust them in size and
position and the cool thing about it
it's basically every uwp desktop app can
run in one of those 2d panes so they're
all there are already hundreds of
thousand apps for the hololens that can
run in 2d mode so you can now already
just download netflix from the store and
then pin it on your wall and have it
200-inch Netflix display on your pet
patio if you like or some sort of
outdoor space that works already apps
resolution stays fixed right now so it's
not you cannot have X load with like 1
million columns all around you it's
always the same app size you can just
scale it in itself so those are our
basic two options on obviously the
holographic view would be the most
interesting part so if you go down the
holographic path we have a lot of
options how to do that in respect to
technology so right now the most popular
option would be to use unity unity is a
well-known 3d game engine basically a
middleware to write cross-platform 3d
content apps and games it has probably
the best productivity
all your options you have because you
have a visual editor you can use to
offer your apps you have the the biggest
community out there most platform
support it's right now with unity 5.5
it's actually built into unity to have
hololens support and free for personal
use obviously and right now around 91%
of all apps that are out there are built
using unity so that's by far the most
popular way but there are other options
too so if you want to be a really
hardcore you can go direct 3d using C++
so you can go bare metal you can skip
the the middlewares can skip immunity
that will offer you some performance
gains but you have to take care of
everything yourself very low platform
support so you have to write a lot of
stuff yourself you can also obviously
use C sharp with a sharp digs wrapper
around it for C++
then there's Euro sharp that's a project
by exam room so that's another way of
writing apps cross-platform free apps
using c-sharp just not a middleware
option and then if you're coming from
the web stack there's actually hollow
chess
that's a JavaScript Hollande's framework
that's out on github by Microsoft that
allows you to write holographic apps
using javascript in WebGL and then
obviously you can do pure uwp using
Zemel CTR BB or C++ to write 2d view
apps so those are general all your
options options you have the tooling is
in most cases or in all cases free so
what will you will need to Visual Studio
2017 or registry 2015 update free there
they are free as a community edition you
can just go ahead and download them you
will need Visual Studio to compile uu
WPF and actually if you want to deploy
in a real device or if you want to
deploy on the hololens emulator
you'll also need Visual Studio which
brings us to the hololens emulator
that's a complete virtual machine with
Holland's running on it you can use to
actually develop holographic
applications without having the real
hardware which again it's kind of pricey
right now so hololens and later you can
start right down
then you need unity if you opt to use
this middleware all also available free
personal edition and we have the
holographic toolkit that's out on github
the holographic toolkit is actually a
collection of pre-made components that
you will typically need with you if
you're using Hollande's for example you
get components that do spatial
processing that do special audio that
handle input that recognize gestures so
that a lot of low-level stuff gets out
of your way and you can really focus on
your content so that's a really good
stop to actually check out the toolkit
before writing your own stuff and then
there's not a very interesting framework
that we've been using recently a lot
it's called euphoria you might know if
you have done already
iOS android free 3d games it's very
popular there it's basically a framework
to do marker based recognition in in
video signals so if you're looking at a
at a video feed in in real time either
for your smartphone or through the
hololens it can recognize 2d markers
like the QR code which is not super
exciting but it can also recognize 3d
objects that you can train into into a
model and then can be re record
might be wondering why you'd need that
on a Han lens because you have spatial
mapping and spatial mapping does all
your room recognition but there might be
a lot of things in your room that are
not suitable for spatial mapping for
example because they're very small or
they move around and in the room like a
car or a little piece of equipment and
you want to really precisely track that
and put holographic content on top of it
so for example again you're on a shop
floor and you're picking material out of
a box and then having to place it
somewhere specifically on a car you
might be able for you to actually have
the precision
and into moving objects to augment that
in a proper quality so that's where
before air comes in so the typical
development workflow would be you'd
actually create your scene all your
content using unity and then you would
build your project into Visual Studio
2015 where it's a uwp app and you then
compiled there and from there deployed
on either your device or on a hololens
emulator now this is a process that
takes even even if you have a real
decent machine that takes a lot of time
so doing the whole cycle here it takes
literally a couple of minutes so it's
not very efficient if you're kind of in
the beginning of your project just want
to quickly iterate so there's a new way
of doing it with unity 5.5 that's called
holographic emulation right build into
unity and this is very interesting
because you have two options here you
can either do a simulation or a remoting
simulation means you actually have
holographic features running life in
your unity editors if you hit play in
unity you have you can load a certain
room profile you have the spatial data
you can use a gamepad like an xbox
controller and simulate your your
hololens movement in your scenery and
really quickly iterate without ever
leaving unity or if you want to test out
a real device you have holographic
remoting which means you install a
little companion app from unity on your
hololens device and then deploy into
this in this companion app without going
through Visual Studio which again makes
it a lot of a lot faster also has some
limitation it kind of has has impact
obviously on performance because it's
running sort of a virtual machine and in
case you're doing a lot of low foria or
third-party stuff it might have
limitations there as well so this is a
quick sample how it looks like of doing
this simulation in in unity so you can
see the polygon area what you really
have a virtual room and you can move
around with your gamepad controller
without deploying on the real device
so as I said we've we've done a couple
of projects in the in the last month and
they're like the top ten learnings we
had from this project that if I knew in
advance would have saved me a ton of
time so I want to share those with you
first of all Holland's really is a
mobile device it's not like the HTC wife
doesn't have a super-fast computer with
a decent GPU and in behind so it's it's
more performance wise it's more like and
I have on having a tablet computer or
smartphone so this has a lot of
implications obviously you have to make
really sure that you don't drop below 60
frames per second if you drop below 60
frames per second Holograms start to
move around in the room they're not
they're becoming in stable because a
recalculation doesn't doesn't work
anymore
you really have to stick to 60 frames so
so this limitation really has impact on
how many polygons you have in your
scenery which shaders you can use how
you handle things like with forea for
example or or shadows so in our
experience if we go into models that are
way beyond 100,000 polygons it's not
going to work in the hololens and if we
talk with our clients they usually come
up with hey we have to see ad model of a
car or whatever it has four million
polygons because it's like a complete
car every screw and everything of it and
this doesn't work right away on the
hololens it doesn't work right away on
any device but especially in the
hololens we don't really have to
recreate content and this is a massive
effort and really have to take that into
consideration before you start any any
app for hololens is how you will handle
content and make sure it works nicely in
hololens and and gives you the right
performance and for example things like
before yeah they take a lot of CPU time
so if you use euphoria to track an
object we quickly turned on we you see
the marker and then turn it off right
away and then move the position that we
get from euphoria into our spatial model
and then let let the hololens hpu the
holographic process and get it render
recalculate their the position changes
number two would be don't forget to
include Holograms that sounds trivial
but actually you have to explicitly do
that so if you place something in your
world it's not automatically anchored
and if you forget your anchor you don't
immediately recognize it it still stays
kind of stable but as you as you keep
adding stuff to your project things are
getting getting in stable and start to
move around so you have to explicitly
think about how you'll enter your
Holograms and there are different
techniques you can do about that I did
provide a lot of links so you might want
to dive into that one as well use
existing tools and pattern so the
problem or the challenge with Hollande's
would be that it's a fairly new
technology there's not a lot of best
practices out there how to do
interaction how to do input but there's
some design guidance by Microsoft and
there's obviously things like the hollow
hollow tool kit that you can actually
use to not reinvent the wheel all the
time you you don't you don't have to
generate your own chester's of doing
things because people have a hard time
learning that you should stick to to the
basics at the beginning and then
leveraging spatial audio that's kind of
underestimated all the time and within
every project you really have to
convince people of doing it big but it
adds a lot to the experience so you
could have just a visual marker in your
scenery saying turn right to continue or
you could have an audio source that's
coming from your right ear that guides
you towards it which is way more natural
than having any sort of artificial
visual marker in your field of view just
the right input mode for your audience I
I did already briefly talk about that
this if you have a public-facing
application you want to really go with
voice commands versus you have a
professional application with with
frequent users you go for gaze and
gesture that's a small one but it's a
really annoying one so if you're doing
unity development you typically have
more than debug and release
configuration
Visual Studio you also have a master
configuration and if you pick debug or
release configuration it doesn't doesn't
compile in all your project dependencies
so if you hand your your app package to
a tester or to a client they won't be
able to install it right away
so make sure you pick master build
configuration to make sure all your
dependencies come with it then also
light matters in Holograms one might
think that because IC threw it into the
real world and real world has has its
own lighting I don't need my own
lighting but that's not true because the
hololens doesn't understand the real
world lights that i mean they're there
but they're not calculated into the
experience so I have to make have to
have an idea a concept of my own light
system that works with the with the
environment the users are in so that's a
big one used uwp part of your app for
data access that so if we build a
holographic application it's always a
uwp app but if you use unity on top of
it unity has its own moaner engine and
sometimes we want to do complex
operations for example data access we
want to suck it communicate
communication to have real-time
communication between a hololens
app and another controller for example
maybe we have a surface controller app
or a dial control or whatever and those
things are tend to be really hard to do
in unity and they're relatively easy to
do and UWP so our strategy here would be
to do as much as we can in UWP and then
have a communication between the the
unity part of the application and you
WPF application and not try to do
everything in unity that's a DES saved
us a lot of time in our last project
just write build time for your app so if
you if you set up an application in
unity you have two options how to output
the application you can either choose
Zemel which is kind of the UI technology
of UWP or you can go directly 4d 3d
direct3d and this has implications on
the feature set you can actually use in
your applications so if you're going for
D 3d
which is a default option you will
always have the best performance because
it leaves out a lot of the sam'l
interest URI infrastructure but you
cannot do any sort of on-screen keyboard
input you can just do that if you use
Zemel output formant so that's a there's
some some sort of decision you have to
make upfront in your project and the
last one would be the one that has the
had the biggest business impact for us
test early in your target environment so
we had an application that we developed
in our office with a 1-1 to free scale
model of an object that was part of the
experience and it worked perfectly in
our setup where in our office then we
went to the client and they had a
special studio environment with very
bright rooms very bright balls a lot of
light on them and the true scale model
with a lot of reflections and things
didn't work at all and it did cost us a
lot of time to read through that so it's
it's really valuable to to go ahead and
test as early as possible in your
real-world environment because hololens
is really reacting towards its
environment lighting does matter a lot
and things like that not a nice feature
we were just starting to explore is the
spectator view spectator spectator view
allows you to have a holographic
experience that can be seen for a
third-party perspective you might have
seen this experience if you if you have
watched some of the Microsoft keynotes
around hololens you'll also see someone
with a huge camera running around on
stage filming the scenery and then
allowing to have as a like a third-party
perspective in Hollands they open source
technology so everyone can build the
solution like that you can see our
solution we have a diesel our camera and
then on the on the flash adapter there's
tested in the hololens and then we we
can combine the the video image of the
camera with the holographic layered and
have third party perspective that haves
a lot if you want to do a video of the
experience for your customer to really
showcase it this is a little sample
video we did have an application we're
building for Steelcase
so this is the first party perspective
and you can see now this is the
spectator perspective so you can
actually really see what what the people
using Holograms can see and the other
thing that's interesting here is they're
actually two people wearing your
hololens so you can build holographic
apps that actually share their
holographic experience across multiple
headsets which again adds to the adds to
the productivity value of the device and
then beyond tolerance there's an even
bigger perspective or bigger picture
here called Windows mixed reality that's
actually the idea behind hololens is to
actually have a real platform for mixed
reality in holographics and what you can
see on this picture is on the right hand
side there's the VR view of the
holographic shell on the left hand side
there's the mix relative view that you
would have using a hololens and the the
right hand side would be enabled through
new headsets that are coming up this
year that are running on this mixed
reality platform and Venice mixed
variety is shipping today with credit
update so if you have creditors updating
slooh you also already have a mixed
relative application you have relatively
low hardware requirements it's not like
an HD wife so a lot more machines can
run it and you will have a choice of
very inexpensive immersive headsets
coming up starting with $2.99 later 2017
and obviously input would be more like
gamepad Mouse here they're they're wired
but they run the same applications than
the hololens all right I'll skip over
those doors are pure marketing slides so
where would you would you actually start
obviously grab the tools there's a
really neat online training course for
beginners called the holographic Academy
online that gives you like a brief
walkthrough for all for all the core
features like spatial mapping special
audio input gaze and everything like
that and then go from there
one github repo I really want to point
out is the galaxy Explorer that's an
application Microsoft
built that has is full fully open source
really gives some nice insights and you
can go from there so this is the very
very quick run-through of mixed reality
and hololens and with that I would like
to open up for questions and or live
demos as you like I'm here I got two
devices so don't be shy okay you have a
couple of questions so I have a couple
of questions here that came in through
the Apple just you touched on one of
them very briefly with the shared
experience that multiple people do the
same thing but this one does have a bit
of a twist like multiple people wearing
the hololens can they like interact with
the holograms all of them were said like
a master mode and then the other people
can just watch or how does that work you
can really have a collaborative
experience it really depends on how you
implement it in your own app so it's up
to the developer how he built it but
it's possible to do that all right
the other question I have is what's the
battery life like on these things okay
so on on this device it's if you go full
brightness doing a really expensive game
it's like two two and a half hours if
you go full power I think that's what we
have time for thank you very much for
Phillip thank you
