days with a disclaimer to make sure that
you understand that I might not know
what I'm talking about
and so therefore if you don't like it
and there may be some things in the talk
that you don't like you can always
comfort yourself by saying perhaps she
doesn't really understand what she's
talking about my PhD is in computer
science and what we're going to talk
about today comes from the field of
cognitive neuroscience and what we know
about that science is that they make
progress as opposed to some slower
moving Sciences like computer science
and the reason for that is very simple
in science you follow the scientific
method and the scientific method says
you have an hypothesis and then you
devise a clever experiment to test that
hypothesis and then you examine the
results do some analysis and decide
whether or not to proceed on the basis
of that earlier hypothesis or whether
you need to make some serious
adjustments those are controlled
balanced experiments so the
psychologists and the neuroscientists
are experts they do a good job of that
and so they learn if you pick up a paper
about our industry that was written
yesterday and one that was written 20
years ago the problems are still the
same we're still debating some of these
issues over and over again and of course
searching always for the latest silver
bullet and never looking for that
research those control balanced
experiments so we're not really a
science
are we so I'm going to cite a lot of
research and if you'd like to know where
I got that if you'd like to read that
paper or that book
send me some email and I'll be happy to
give you that information although this
is not an academic presentation so I'm
not going to cite everything along the
way so let's talk about mindset what the
researchers tell us is there are
basically two ways of looking at talent
or ability or intelligence how can you
read the screen the first one says that
you believe that what you have when
you're born in the way of talent or
intelligence is what you have it's fixed
and there's really not much you can do
about that you are a natural at playing
a sport or head programming or doing
whatever you do or I'm sorry you just
don't have it it's the talent myth and
many times in our organizations we spend
a lot of effort trying to identify those
people who have it believing in that
fixed mindset the alternative is yes you
are born with a set of characteristics
and abilities yes that's true but
whatever that set of characteristics or
abilities you can always improve you can
get better of course it's possible to
measure where you are now there are IQ
tests and SAT tests and other ways of
doing that
but there is no test that can say what
you will be like tomorrow or next week
or next month if you decide that you
want to be better that whatever that
talent or ability is so I call that
the agile mindset it's the belief in
growth it's the belief in learning now
I'm not going to ask you to raise your
hands I am going to ask you to think
about that
what mindset do you hold and realize we
don't have that consistent view over
everything there are some areas in our
lives where we do tend to be fixed and
others where we are more agile so most
of us don't hold one or the other all
the time but we do usually have one that
dominates we tend to lean toward the
fixed mindset or the agile mindset and
this is with respect to anything any
ability any characteristic including raw
intelligence so I gave a talk about this
at the agile conference and what I
thought was important about learning the
research behind the two mindsets and
what an enormous impact it can have on
your life and the way you work and if
you have children on the lives and the
potential of those children as well so
if you haven't seen it it is online and
the slides will be available you can go
look that up the basic research was done
by someone named Carol Dweck's she's at
Stanford University she's written an
easily accessible book if you'd like to
learn a little more this is not a long
tome and it is written for the lay
reader not the expert so it's called
simply mindset it's a good place to
begin
there are also some free online articles
the first one by Malcolm Gladwell who
examined in an article called the talent
myth the two mindsets and the research
that's been done by Carol Dweck the
second in New York magazine and lastly
Time magazine did a feature article on
Carol Dweck and the impact of her
research and then there are a couple of
links that point to more papers those
are all free they won't take a lot of
time if you'd like to read more about
these so we've got the two mindsets
that's interesting but what's really
important for us is to look at what that
mindset means about all of the other
aspects of our lives so the first thing
we got here is it determines the kinds
of goals that you seek so let's think
about that for a minute if you have a
fixed mindset that means that you
believe that what you have natural
ability or not nothing you can do about
that
and so therefore you spend a lot of time
trying to show everybody else that you
have it so your goals are all about
making your performance look good you
always want to look good because if you
don't that must indicate that you don't
have it it's a clear sign to anyone
who's watching that maybe you're not a
good programmer or a good developer or a
good manager or whatever it is that you
want to be you always want to look good
and that leads even small children to
choose goals that are easy so maybe
those of you who were at the meeting
last night the user group around women
an IT and last year I gave a talk about
that this is what happens to little
girls little girls especially bright
little girls have the most fixed mindset
on the planet and why is that well
they're told from the very beginning
that they're perfect because in the
beginning they are little girls have
good language skills good people skills
they know what their parents want they
know what their teachers want and in the
beginning in grade school they
very well they're at the top of their
class and they hear it from parents from
grandparents aunts and uncles all their
teachers say oh you're so perfect you're
so smart and they begin to believe I
have it I have it
I was born with it their mindsets are
fixed now the problem with that mindset
is that sooner or later you do run into
something where you don't do well and
that causes cognitive dissonance oh oh I
thought I had it I thought it was
talented I thought it was smart I
thought I was perfect and now I see that
I'm not able to do very well and that's
exactly what happens to bright little
girls they start running into hard stuff
as they leave grade school and they
begin to take a difficult math class or
a different science class it's a little
more challenging and oh no oh no they
don't do so well so they move away they
find other areas where they can always
look good they choose their goals so
they always look like they have it well
all the research shows that there can be
other traits that we have in addition to
these but this is the driver for these
factors for determining performance
goals and then of course reaction to
failure if someone has a fixed mindset
and things aren't going so well and they
do make mistakes or fail they're very
upset by that and in fact if we stay
with the bright little girls what many
of them begin to tell themselves as they
have failures is I must not be very good
at this
well I must not be very smart at math or
science
I'm not so good I better go over
somewhere else so that I will I will
have a chance at succeeding so those
that have the agile mindset on the other
hand know that what it's about is
getting better and when they fail and
they don't do so well it's okay I'm I
can learn
I can't improve I can I can get better
failure is not a serious problem and the
goals they choose our goals where they
can be challenged I want to have a
chance to improve I believe that I can
and then finally the belief about
whether it's a good thing to work hard
or whether it makes a difference what
kind of strategy you use that if you're
a fixed mindset person you believe that
you don't have to work hard in fact if
you have to work hard that's an
indication that you don't have it
whereas for the agile mindset that's
what you do you do have to decide to
work hard you do have to decide to pick
strategies that will work and then
finally how you feel about others and
when they do well those with the fixed
mindset regard that is competition
there's only so many pieces in the pie
so that person is doing well oh no maybe
that might mean that they're better they
have more talent than I do that
threatened by that those are the agile
mindset know that the pie is
ever-expanding it's okay I rejoice in
your success it gives me hope I could
possibly be as good as you are someday
so the mind is almost like a muscle for
those with the agile mindset they
believe the harder you work the better
you'll be and in fact the most
encouraging research about getting older
and believe me I pay attention to all of
that research the most encouraged
thing is it's okay to get old you're not
ever going to come to a point where you
say that's it
you can continue to grow you can
continue to build bone you can continue
to build muscle you can continue to
build connections between the neurons in
your brain as long as you work at it as
long as you continue to learn as long as
you continue to work those muscles and
work those bones until you die you can
continue to grow so had your mindset is
the reality the research clearly shows
that I think that's very encouraging
you're so young you're not worried about
your brain or your muscles or your bones
you should be unfortunately those with
the fixed mindset they say no no it's
not like a muscle it's like height
you're born with it or not there's
nothing you can do about it makes a big
difference in a wide spectrum of
attributes about our lives these two
mindsets so here's the talk for today
that was a little bit of an introduction
what we know about people with the fixed
mindset is they're more likely to
stereotype others they believe that what
we all have is fixed that you're born
with it or you're not and furthermore it
should be pretty easy to determine
whether you have it or not
so in stereotyping what the brain does
is make categories of people based on
obvious characteristics like race
clearly those people who are that color
are not as good as the people who are
this color and so therefore we
categorize all the people in those
various categories as being exactly
alike so we enable them all with the
same set of fixed characteristics so the
fixed mind
that not only affects how you see your
own talent and ability but how you see
the talents and abilities of others
now we're hardwired to stereotype
there's no way we can avoid it I gave a
talk about that at another agile
conference and I think that's online as
well it's called who do you trust but
what we can do is be aware that we are
doing it we can be aware that we have
that tendency and what we know is that
those who have the agile mindset yes
they do stereotype but they're a little
looser about it and they're a little
more willing to withhold judgment longer
and they're willing to learn about those
individuals before they fit in fit those
individuals into that hardwired category
so they are less likely to stereotype
all right let's all I have a silent
prayer to the computer gods and let us
hope that this video will work dear
computer guys please make it work yes
blue fairy make me real make me real
blue fairy come on you're not praying oh
yes you are sorry
can you see why I wanted to show that in
Denmark thanks to the Carlsberg folks
who said sure you can put that in your
PowerPoint presentation absolutely
so that's stereotyping those two people
came in they looked at the theater it
was full of those people and they could
see only two empty seats and most people
walked right out again
now you wouldn't do that would you if
you really wanted to see the movie you
would go right in there and what you'd
get as a result is you not only get to
see the movie but you'd have a whole
room full of new friends and some free
beer now how is that unfortunately most
of us do that all the time it keeps our
brain very busy making judgments about
other people whether they're good or bad
whether they're smart or not and we do
it on the basis of a lot of things not
necessarily whether they're covered with
tattoos but some kinds of
characteristics that we are not even
aware of how did we decide that we don't
like that person or that we do or that
we think that person is smart but not
that person or that this person is
better than that one
how did you make up your mind about that
sometimes it's not so obvious and the
disturbing thing about stereotypes is
that we believe them even if we're a
member of the stereotyped group so I'm
definitely concerned about whether women
choose to go into math or science or not
and there was a classic experiment that
was done giving women a very difficult
math test and they had two groups of
people who took the test and in one
group in the beginning of the test
there's a little bit of information the
name the grade level and a little tiny
box that said male or female and the
other version of the test was exactly
the same except no little box that was
the only difference so would you think a
little tiny box could make a big
difference in a difficult test could
that skew the test results just that
little box what do you think well I
wouldn't be talking about it if it
didn't make a big difference because it
did and what's really interesting about
that experiment is that afterwards the
women who took the exams were asked did
you notice there was a little box did
you notice that you checked male female
and these were all women in the test so
they all checked female do you remember
that and none of them even remembered
checking the box but clearly some part
of their brain was paying attention
noticing that oh oh I am female oh we
know women are not very good at math
yeah so we not only apply those
stereotypes to other people if we are a
member of a stereotype group we apply
them to ourselves no it was only way it
was only women there was a checkbox for
male but there were only women taking
the test now when the test is run with
males and the women don't have to check
the box they're just as good as the guys
so why would it make such a difference
because it was a subtle reminder even if
they weren't aware of it a subtle
reminder that you're a member of a
stereotype group that doesn't do well in
math sorry
women are really nice people aren't they
yes and we like to have them around
actually we need them we need them
otherwise we'd be in real trouble
we won't have any anymore generations
following us so yes we better keep them
around and they are useful as well they
can do a lot of things but they're just
not very good at math or science or some
of the other hard things we all know
that and clearly but research shows that
women believe that as well we are our
own worst enemies so I know you don't
have time to look up all the URLs in the
world but this one is about an
interesting experiment that was done by
a 3rd grade teacher the day after Martin
Luther King was assassinated she taught
in a small town in Iowa where
everybody's pretty much the same they're
all white they all go to the same church
their backgrounds were very similar no
black people in that town in Iowa how is
she going to explain to them what had
happened with the assassination of
Martin Luther King why did he die and
what was that cause that he was fighting
for what was that all about and how
could she make them feel it really feel
it what was going on the struggles in
the south during the civil rights
movement so she came up with a brilliant
idea when her students came in that next
day she said I want to rearrange the
seating we're going to put all the
blue-eyed children over here on this
side and the brown-eyed children well
you'll sit over here because I've just
read some interesting research and the
research tells me that the brown-eyed
children are smarter than the blue-eyed
children so I'm going to spend most of
my time
now teaching the brown-eyed children and
the blue-eyed children will will have
some coloring books some toys will keep
you busy but it's not your fault that
you're not as smart oh one other thing
just so we don't forget let's have all
the blue-eyed children wear a little
collar so when we see the collar it will
remind us yeah they're just not as smart
so years later and that's what this PBS
special is about they interviewed the
now grown-up children and when they
talked to the blue-eyed children they
all said the same thing when she put
that collar around my neck I felt stupid
she created stupidity by labeling them
and by making them wear that little
collar so the danger in stereotypes is
that we create reality we create a whole
group of people who can't contribute we
create a group of people who feel stupid
who feel that they can't contribute who
feel that they're just not quite as good
as those other people I can actually
change their performance and of course
this is especially true for managers hmm
how many managers in the room come on
come on yeah yeah I read some research
just recently it said you know when
managers bring in new people it doesn't
take long just sometimes a matter of
hours before they've already decided
who's going to work out who's going to
be a good guy and who isn't so long
before they've ever had a chance to see
real performance or evaluate it in an
objective way they've already made up
their minds not you of course with other
managers so I wondered about that and I
sat down at a table with some managers
that I knew and I said I just read this
interesting research tell me is that
true that you make up your minds pretty
quickly about whether people are going
to work out or not do you do that just
almost instantly
well they said hmm I guess we do but
we're always right
of course they are of course they are
always right why is that because if they
believe that you're a good guy and that
you've got it and that you're going to
be great that is exactly what they will
see like the brown eyed children will we
know they're smarter therefore we expect
that they will do well and that creates
a reality around that expectation
whereas if we don't think you're going
to be a good guy you're not going to
work out and that sets our expectations
at once that's what we'll see so you're
not really objective how about even
concrete data that you might pick up
whether you're measuring or whether
you're not whether you're what you see
and what you don't see and actually this
has been known for quite a while I have
this Harvard Business Review article if
you would like to read it so otherwise I
think they're going to try to charge you
money for it
just omit that's called Pygmalion and
it's simply that if managers believe
that you're going to be okay you will be
and if they believe you're not going to
be okay you won't enormous power that
not only the managers but everybody else
on the team can exert that power on
other team members can create great
contributions or not kind of scary so
that we know both of these mindsets have
to do with goals the kinds of
performance goals you set for yourself
the kinds of learning goals that you set
for yourself the fixed mindset they look
all over the place so that they can look
good so their performance makes them
appear as though they have it and what
happens to people over time is that
that's the only kind of goal they ever
have and they stop learn
and they stopped believing that mistakes
are bad mistakes must be an indication
that you don't have it
mistakes are bad effort is for dummies
so here's the good news that you can
have a mindset absolutely we've got
plenty of research that shows that is
going to be agile or it's going to be
fixed but you can change it in other
words the mindset itself is agile and
not stuck with one or the other and what
we know is that you can grow that you
can grow the agile mindset in members of
your team you can grow that mindset in
your children in your spouse in your
friends simply by the way you interact
and the kind of feedback that you give
and sometimes the research is pretty
clear
that you don't have to do giant big
things just small little simple things
can make an enormous difference in how
you change the lives of others you have
a lot of power so here are some
suggestions you can praise others for a
good job absolutely but when you do it
never if you can avoid it and this is
such a hard habit to break if you can
avoid it don't ever say you're so smart
you must be a genius
at this don't ever say you have some
level of ability some talent some level
of intelligence say instead you must
have really put in a lot of effort on
this Wow you must have tried some
unusual things praise the strategy or
process that was used ask about how they
accomplished what they did Oh tell me
about how you finally fix that
I've been working on it now for two
weeks and I wasn't able to get anywhere
can you help me learn something new
about what you did and instead of
brushing failure under the rug bring it
out celebrate it this is especially true
for your children instead of telling
them you're so perfect you're so smart
encourage them to fail it's okay
to deal with failure is the most
valuable lesson you can give your
children or each other that failure is a
good thing it's about learning when you
try when you struggle when you have
challenges you have a chance to learn
you have a chance to get better and
share your stories I failed too I have
failed many times and here's what I
learned from that it's okay to do that
and we know that many times people get
discouraged
especially women we heard these stories
last night about how they thought even
though they had struggled to get a
degree and they had struggled to get a
job and they got a job and they got in
the workplace and they instead that
little voice in their heads kept telling
them you can't do this you just don't
have it and when they had failure well
they weren't able to do so well the
little voice really cranked up the
volume and said see I told you you
better go do something else or you can
have some success don't spend your time
here this is a waste of time
so you need something for that little
voice in your head so tell others say
know the brain talent intelligence any
ability you have it's like a muscle use
it keep getting better you don't have
some fixed amount of talent
that you're doomed forever to fail no
you can learn from this and move on we
tend to get down on ourselves people we
know well our spouses our children get
down on themselves I can't do it I can't
do it dad I can't do it mom it's too
hard so you need some other words some
other ways of telling them because
normally the argument goes oh yes you
can you are smart and that is exactly
the wrong argument because you're
reinforcing the fixed mindset so don't
counter those feelings of inadequacy and
depression by saying no no you're wrong
you are smart you are talented you are
intelligent because that's exactly what
we do and that doesn't help them because
they simply say no I'm not no I'm not so
the message has to be instead failure is
okay it's about learning it's about
struggling we all have to struggle and
share your own personal stories I've
gone through that as well so I know you
can't read this and I'm going to ask
what time good okay so I'm at I'm not
going to read it the reason these things
are in here is that after I gave the
talk at the agile conference I got a ton
of email and it said I heard your talk
and that's really great but what do I
tell my kids I want to know some words
can you give me some words that I can
use can you give me some little phrases
can you give me some arguments and so I
created these very detailed slides so
that you can have them so here's what
you can tell your kids instead of you're
so smart say I'm proud that you really
worked hard on that so you can download
these slides later and take notes if you
want something to tell yourself when
you're down on yourself because if that
happens
a lot instead of having the little voice
in your head say oh I guess I'm stupid I
guess I can't do this I guess I'll never
learn maybe I'll just go home and have a
beer and forget about it
so say to yourself words of
encouragement about learning and about
taking advantage of failure so and again
you can read all of this on your own
time and for others what are some words
that you can tell the other people in
your life when they become discouraged
and when they need some way of reminding
them the power of the agile mindset so
this of course connects to agile
software because that is the message you
know we spend a lot of time arguing is
it about the backlog people are throwing
the backlog out and say well there goes
scrum
well scrum does have a backlog but scrum
and all the agile practices have I think
a common core which is simply this the
agile mindset that it is about learning
it's about trying something about having
little experiments so what I did was I
went out and I copied all of the
statements that I could see in various
web pages and blogs about agile that had
to do with failure and I found fail
early fail often fail fast learn
constantly failure is an option without
failure how can learning happen make
mistakes faster if you don't know what
menlo innovations is it is the most
agile company on the planet
go to their website Menlo innovations
comm and look at how you build a company
from the ground up in an agile way
perfect is a verb so it's really perfect
it's not about being perfect it's about
getting better those that fail fastest
grows strongest and I just finally had
to stop
as the quotes are all over the place
agile is about the agile mindset it is
about learning experimenting so agile is
agile agile development has the agile
mindset it's about believing that we're
all a work in progress and that that
fixed mindset no that has nothing to do
with the way we operate we're going to
get better over time and so are you
and someday when you're 70 maybe you'll
be up in front sharing some information
because you're still going to be
learning I just read some interesting
research about old people they did a
longitudinal experiment when over 40
years and in the balanced controlled
experiment they were comparing one thing
which is what do you think old people
are like and for the people who thought
that old people well you know they
stereotype them and believe they really
can't do too much whereas the other
group believed that no no getting older
Wow that's ok there are lots of people
who are older who are doing all kinds of
exciting things and over the course of
40 years they noticed something
interesting in the group of people that
held a negative age stereotype they
began to age sooner they began to have
high blood pressure strokes heart
problems and they died sooner so I'm
going to give you the greatest gift
possible you stereotyped old people
based on me
I am your role model I turned 70 in
March so another bit of research has to
do with 70 year olds 70 year olds now
are so much better than they were a
generation ago and in a generation hence
even better I wish I could see you at 70
because you are gonna be amazing
you already are thanks for listening
after my official timekeeper are we good
okay do it we have a time we have time
for a couple of questions any questions
yes I think it's very difficult even the
researchers themselves who know the
power of holding the agile mindset have
said I know I'm not agile all the time
and they find themselves tripping over
words because it does have to do with
the kinds of words that you use in
conversations with others and in
conversations with themselves they find
their tripping over things that are
definitely fixed so it it's something
that can change over time yes and it's
something that maybe with even within a
particular domain we kind of go back and
forth and it's like a lot of other
things that we have inherited or
hardwired that we're stuck with that and
awareness is our only defense so be
aware when you are judging others don't
be aware if you're saying oh you're so
smart because what we say when we say
somebody is so smart the implication is
well other people then must not be and
that would include sometimes me oh
you're so smart I must not be so that
kind of labeling sets up that fixed mind
stereotype yeah you're right none of us
is all of the time one or the other
yeah any other questions I just realized
I forgot to repeat the earlier question
and he's chastising me from the back so
his question has to do with gender
differences which are clearly there
isn't that a good thing
clearly gender differences different
ways of thinking where wouldn't some of
those be more applicable to certain
areas and I think they're ours
I didn't cite it here but there are so
many studies that show what you want on
your software team actually what you
want on any team is diversity and what
we tend to have because we like
people who are like us is we avoid
diversity we want to hire people who are
just like us because we believe that
we're smart and we are good at whatever
it is so we tend to look for other
people just like us and we build teams
where there is almost no diversity so
what women bring to the table is what
anyone would bring to the table who's
not exactly like us
is a different point of view and that
that's going to make some times things a
little more difficult because we're
going to have to hear those different
points of view but the end result
research shows so much better because
that same research also shows that if
the team is all women it's not very good
so we all need to be there we need to be
around the table and make our own
contributions but you're right it's
probably a different contribution but I
think it's valuable yes sir so the
question is isn't it true that learning
does slow down as you get older and have
just read some interesting research
about owls
so I owls go through an interesting
adjustment when they're born they have
to coordinate their vision with their
hearing and it takes a little bit of
time before they can do that and so what
they try to do is say well what about an
owl that's already an adult can they
make that adjustment can they learn how
to do that and the original experiment
said no they can't in fact we'd now tend
to believe that there are certain things
you can't do as you get older so that's
why I thought this research was
especially interesting and then a
brilliant person on the team who
happened to be a woman said wait a
minute let's do this experiment
differently instead of having the Owls
try to make the adjustment in one big
jump so they were asking them to adjust
they were wearing little glasses that
altered the difference between their
hearing and their vision
by a certain number of degrees let's cut
that down instead of making it 23
degrees let's make it say 5
let's make it 5 degrees and see if the
older howls can do that and sure enough
they could they could do it and then
they could do the next 5 and the next 5
and the next 5 so they could do exactly
what the younger owls could do they were
just a little slower so I think that's
you're right the research does seem to
be pretty clear we're a little slower
but we are also more of a perfectionist
so when we take those little steps we
don't move forward unless we make sure
we've got them exactly right so you have
a different learning style as you get
older you know that you can't sometimes
just jump in and fail and learn quickly
you're going to have to take your time
but you can get to the same place and
maybe along the way you've learned some
things that the others haven't other
questions
we're doing we're good thank you so much
I appreciate
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
