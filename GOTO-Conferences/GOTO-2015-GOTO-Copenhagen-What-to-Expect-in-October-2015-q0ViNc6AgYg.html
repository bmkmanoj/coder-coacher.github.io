program chair for the go to conference
Copenhagen 2015 being a program chair
means I get to work with the people who
are inviting the speakers for the
conference and I'd like to spend a few
minutes of your time to tell you about
the program for this year's conference
first the four key notes we chose to
invite this year we have Anita's in
Gupta from NASA she's going to share
with you her experiences working on the
Mars rover landing she faced real
challenges she had to think out of the
box and make some idea generation that
you could even dream about they also had
to do some really weird and spectacular
testing before they did the Mars rover
landing and yet they had to deal with a
lot of failure the things that she
learned and her experiences is something
you could actually use in UIC work even
though it's not exactly rocket science
next we have brand goods he's the
architect of the Java language so
creating a language like Java is no
small feat but keeping it up to date yet
still keeping it close to its core and
respectful to its ideals is really a
whole nother story brand Gertz is going
to tell you how difficult it is and how
they've overcome the difficulties in
keeping Java a modern language next we
have admire you might know I admire more
from functional programming but this
year is going to talk about agile
methodologies if you're using agile
methodologies and statistics say that
you are you can experience a great and
maybe well-deserved kick in the backside
from Eric Meyer when he gives you a very
inspirational and provoking talk about
agile methodologies and the hacker way
of doing things next we have yen
unionism you might not know her yet but
i think you know mobile pay she was a
usability specialist and the senior
interaction designer on mobile pair from
danske bank she will share with you her
insights in making this so user friendly
and usable actually so that now
everybody in Denmark knows what mobile
pay is and most of you are using it
when we are creating a conference like
the go to conference we look at a lot of
subjects we ask people in the field what
would you like to see we look at what
the S&amp;amp;D said the last year maybe they
wanted something more of this soulless
of this at the conference and then of
course we ask a lot of people in the
field abroad as well in other countries
to see what are the trends in San
Francisco what other trends in Australia
things like that and then we come up
with a program that we think will fit
the Danish audience but also with a bit
of future in it this year of course we
need I OS Swift and Android and a little
bit of Apple watch we've chosen to spend
a full day on the game changing
practices and methods so not just agile
and scrum but also some new kids on the
block because it's in the end it's that
it's the people working with people with
IT so it's very important that we have
these processes in hand continuous
delivery something you can't really look
away from same goes for safety security
and privacy this track will show you
everything you need about privacy as a
developer reactive architectures and
microservices is something that people
say is all wine on new bottles and it
might just be so er in a red suit but
these people the speakers in these
tracks will tell you how to make
reactive systems and micro services with
the technologies we have at hand today
how to actually build them of course
data management and data analytics is
something we need to have an testing we
still need to have something about
testing people still don't know how to
do it in the right way and people still
have some misunderstanding so that's
something that we need to have new and
cool stuff this year with chosen
robotics and drones track about
front-end development and the newest and
Microsoft technologies there are some
darlings that we needed to kill in order
to create this program for you we really
wanted a track on cool cars like the
Tesla and the Google self-driving car we
wanted something about Netflix and uber
we wanted something about programming
with children there's a lot of things we
wanted but we had to cut down on the
program to make it fit when we invite
speakers we think of three things they
need to know what they're talking about
need to be respected in their field and
they need to be good speakers in order
to neat what they to know what they talk
about well maybe they've programmed
implemented the systems that you're
using maybe they've written the book
about the processes that you're using
maybe they've got some case studies huge
experiences with working with the
specific technology that you would like
to try out when it comes to being
respected in the field some of them as
you can see already respected and well
known in the field and some of them are
quite new faces on the block but these
people we hope will be the next year's
Martin Fowler's brand goods and Eric
Myers and when it comes to being a good
speaker we always try to invite speakers
that are able to tell the audience
something to keep their attention span
large enough to actually listen to their
session so we always ask the attendees
to evaluate the speaker so that we know
what to do next year with invitations to
speakers training workshops is also
something that we spent time on the
training workshops are longer sessions
in the technical program during the
conference we just have shorter sessions
like the Fred George is talking about
micro services but here Lee's got a
whole day where you can actually get to
build some micro services together with
Fred George and you can see that the
domain of sessions spans from apache
spark to how organizations succeed with
scrum and the Toyota kata experience all
kinds of sessions longer sessions that
you can wear you can have a chance to
actually work with the things the
networking part of the go to conferences
is also very important we hear that from
the attendees after the conference it's
important for them or for you to talk to
each other to talk to the speakers to
discuss things that may not necessarily
have got anything to do with IOT lady
we're trying to facilitate it not just
with beer and breaks but also with a
Lego Mindstorms competition Monday
afternoon we also try to build the next
generation of people like you with the
go to kids event sunday before the
conference where he like me bear will
teach with parents and children about
how to teach programming to children all
in all I think it'll be a great
conference and I hope to
copenhagen in October bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
