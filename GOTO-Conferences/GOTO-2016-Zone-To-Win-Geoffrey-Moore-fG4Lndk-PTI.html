this for a while I'm probably best known
for the first book I wrote which was
called crossing the chasm and crossing
the chasm was about the challenges that
a start-up faces when they take a
disruptive technology and they seek it
to get adopted in the mainstream market
and it's a set of challenges that that
that book was written in 1990 it's still
in print it's sold over a million copies
around the world and so it's it's it's a
very good set of frameworks for dealing
with a perennial problem introducing any
disruptive technology the book I want to
talk to you about today actually covers
the same journey but it covers it from
the point of view of an established
enterprise not a start-up this is a
company now this is an institution which
has a core business that is mature that
is that it's throwing off significant
amount of returns and now this business
wants to catch the next wave but it's
the next wave not the first wave and it
turns out it's a very different problem
and so the frameworks that are good for
crossing the chasm
are they still describe the market
dynamics rather well but they don't
describe the internal dynamics and as I
was listening to mr. Russ talked about
just before the break and the kind of
corporate antibody immune stuff and
those kinds of challenges and clay
Christensen wrote a book called the
innovators dilemma moved we've talked
about this problem for a lot we haven't
done a lot to solve it so the intent of
the frameworks I want to share now is
this is how I think you ought to solve
for it that's the intent so it's about
catching the next wave what we're going
to see is it creates a resource
allocation challenge it becomes
ultimately a crisis of prioritization it
is not one that most companies face
effectively most companies fail at this
moment and it's very damaging when they
do so it's incredibly important to me
that we stop doing that the framework
that I'm going to suggest to sort this
thing out it's something called the zone
management it was developed with
salesforce.com and with Microsoft over
the last three years working with Marc
Benioff and his team at Salesforce and
Nadella and his team at Microsoft so too
high pedigree organizations I think very
good place to get started and we're
going to talk about it in a series of of
modalities which we call attacking
defending and sustaining so that's where
we're heading
maybe just to kick it off with one thing
we talked a lot about disruptive
innovation and you know I think we're
all very sense of the fact that it feels
like it's coming faster and faster and
bigger and bigger the question at some
point when you have that is so how the
hell do you know which ones to worry
about I mean you can't you can't do them
all and so where do you do how do you
decide that by the way I'm going to ask
you that question at the end of this
talk for your company so you might not
you want to pay attention just for a
moment before you get to your cell
phones so the key idea here is that with
I think the orange the orange subtitle
is the key idea a disruptive technology
becomes actionable in your segment and
in your company when it takes the
marginal cost of doing something that
for you
in your history was very expensive and
very challenging and created a barrier
to entry and drives it close to zero and
now all of a sudden it effectively it
changes the design rules for a
next-generation person coming into the
industry whether that be you or be a
disrupt or so whether you're the disrupt
tour or the disrupt tea this is what's
important so take cloud computing for
example so cloud computing has taken the
marginal cost of deploying software
globally to zero now again not for an
established enterprise the established
enterprise is still running a bunch of
on-premise stuff that's got
client-server architecture when you add
cloud computing to an established
enterprise that it's an additional set
of things and now you have a hybrid
architecture of on-prem or private cloud
versus public cloud and you have to
bridge it and it's more complicated but
if you're Aaron Levie
as a sophomore and USC you get to start
box which is now a 300 million dollar
public company in your dorm room and
deploy it globally effectively for free
so the design rule for the disruptor has
changed
how big a deal was that in your industry
it's what I want you to start thinking
about mobile does the same thing for in
connecting with people we got a billion
people now on our planet that have
smartphones go into two billion
apparently during the rest of this
decade
you can talk to two one to two billion
people on this planet for free now again
probably not in your organization
because you probably have cr
client-server CRM systems and you have
different directories and you have all
this kind of stuff that that makes it
even more complicated but if you're
Brian if you're I mean if you're Brian
Chesky at Airbnb or you're Travis
kalanick at uber that's what you just
did you just took over the world for
free Brian Brian doesn't buy any
properties and he owes no property
managers is the world's largest
hospitality organization in the world
Travis owns no cars and he employs no
drivers he's the world's largest
transportation so in these things when
the marginal cost goes to zero all hell
breaks loose okay and so it's really
really important now it doesn't it not
in every case in air in every industry
the oil and gas people have not been
frankly neither of those things have
affected the oil and gas industry for
example big data is the next one and now
they're getting less free these things
are now getting less and less free right
now but you can sort of see there
they're going to be approaching the
asymptotes called free going forward
but but big data so now all of a sudden
we would be a notion that we could
capture all of the log files from
whatever is the relevant digital traffic
to our application intent whether we're
seeking terrorist activity whether we're
trying to do social signals to do to do
promotional stuff if we're trying to
optimize ads spend with retargeting I
mean there's a bunch of places where
we're doing this and if you can analyze
the decision data relevant data at a
scale that was not possible it's it's
with elastic computing and elastic
storage it's getting as soon as you
separate compute from storage because we
spent most of our lives putting it
together
around social you know storage area
networks and network attached storage
well when you detach it completely all
of a sudden you can start participating
in this asymptotically approaching free
and you start saying you don't throw
away data in my lifetime that would've
been the dumbest thing you could have
said the whole purpose of analytics was
to throw away their data because you
couldn't afford to store it okay this is
this is a different game machine
learning still coming in and machine
learning is not free and in the u.s.
right now I have a friend who's whose
son is computer science student at
Dartmouth
he's just entering a senior year they
are now getting job offers at the
beginning of their senior year okay so
it's like and the by the way they're
comparing him the biggest job offer in
Josh's class was somebody got a hundred
and fifty thousand dollar a year salary
and a hundred thousand dollar signing
bonus as a junior okay so it's like you
want your children to marry these people
unless you okay but the point about this
machine learning what we're seeing with
machine learning is look it's not free
but once you get the algorithm up to
speed the algorithm runs for free and
and you and you start watching your
imagine with you know you're gonna take
out huge swaths of labor we had that
question just before break about the
social implications of all this digital
disruption what's going to happen to all
the lorry drivers if you have
self-driving cars or self navigating
drones or or whatever it is so what what
what machine learning does show you is
it starts up when it starts off its
dumber than dirt it's not very smart at
all but it never get it oh it never gets
more stupid it doesn't like the rest of
us who as we ate to do but but but it
gets smarter and smarter and smarter and
eventually it beats garry kasparov
and eventually it does Drive a car and
so so optimizing any digital system and
then if you have the Internet of Things
well if you put a sensor on a physical
object you just made it a digital object
so you look at this thing and you're
saying look this these are design rules
in various parts of our of our economy
are being changed by these technologies
and the question is will
we're for you for example I I had a
conversation with the chief innovation
officer at Wells Fargo Bank it's a it's
a big retail bank in the United States
here was his reaction
cloud computing meant we got a big big
big footprint we're kind of our own
cloud not not important for us
smartphones table stakes smartphones
have completely changed retail banking
Millennials think branch banks are
creepy they don't want to go inside of
them we have 3,000 of them you know so
we have to sort of change the platform
Big Data yes but not until really
machine learning machine learning is our
future because now we can do algorithmic
underwriting and use social signals from
from PayPal or from from whatever you
know a digital financial transaction
clues and we could we knew better stuff
Internet of Things not so much for us
but you see how different companies
could pick out different ones so I want
you to be thinking about which ones for
you okay whatever one you pick you say
look we're going to catch the next wave
well who better to catch the next wave
in tech companies well start reading
this list at the bottom and start
reading it upward and when you hit the
line where you don't recognize the
companies names that's when you came
into the industry now some of us in the
room might be able to go all the way to
the top I'm thinking Simon over there
might be able to go pretty far up ICL is
not on the top list but it could be okay
the point about this by the way these
were not the bad companies these
companies crushed it the first time
around that's how they got on the list I
mean they just killed it but when they
went to catch the second wave they and
they tried multiple times you cannot
imagine these companies with the amount
of working capital they had publicly
held companies very strong boards of
directors would you go to your boards of
directors a year say well we don't think
there's anything new to invest in this
year right so every one of them every
year had a strategic plan to catch the
next way whatever the hell the next way
was at that time and they didn't so it's
like
why is this so I by the way because
you'd like to think well we're smarter
than they are no you're not okay let's
just be really clear no we are not you
are not they were not stupid the problem
was they were my framing of this is they
looked at it through the wrong frame and
when you when you look at it through the
wrong frame then you
uuuuu find it very very difficult to
solve for the problem so I want to
reframe it that's what the rest of the
stuffs about so how do you sort of break
the back of this thing and I think the
guys at McKinsey gave us a really good
starting point so this is the McKinsey
models called three horizons anybody
here in this room heard of this model of
the three horizons okay it actually
comes to fruition
during the annual budgeting process and
it's designed to answer a very simple
question if I give this initiative or
this organization resources in the
annual plan when do I get paid back with
it obviously with interest and and the
McKinsey model says there are three
legitimate answers to that question
answer number one is this year answer
number two is not this year maybe next
year more likely the third year and
answer number three is with three to six
years and frankly maybe never okay I
mean you know I'm not sure so wait so
when you look at this and you look at
those those 54 companies you say well
how'd they do well when it came to
saying give me more resources this year
I'll give you more sales next year give
me more salespeople give me more
engineers you'll get more software these
people did just fine they're established
enterprises know how to manage the the
wall street next quarter next year
fiscal year that's how they got public
and stayed public right that was very
very successful the rap against them for
most of the first decade of this year
was you know what they really can't
innovate they can't do the really
exciting new stuff we need to get new
people to do that turns out that's just
 that's a technical term we use
in California those those come
every one of those companies had labs
that was doing fabulous work
really cool stuff IBM labs Nokia labs HP
look Xerox PARC Xerox PARC essentially
funded Silicon Valley for 15 years where
the R&amp;amp;D the only company they couldn't
use it was Xerox so why not why couldn't
see rocks use Xerox PARC and the answer
was because they couldn't get it through
horizon 2 so what's happening in horizon
2 so alright so if you think about it so
arise into if it's the annual budgeting
process and the rise into business
sponsor comes to the table it says you
know we're gonna take this thing to
scale it's a big big opportunity I need
a I need a big amount of cash to do this
and I'm not giving any of it back and
then next year I'm gonna need a bigger
bucket of cash I'm not giving any of
that back either okay and then maybe in
the third year we're gonna we're gonna
be seeing the great returns from this
thing
well that's that's that's where we got
stuck that that that just was too hard
for the organization to swallow that
pill and so the way in which we ended up
trying to net this out in a single
sentence the sentence will ended up
being if you're gonna catch an s-curve
meaning one of these ways you have to go
through a J curve and so we all know
what a J curve looks like now what's
interesting about J curves is from the
venture capital point of view
venture capital is set up exclusively
and explicitly and solely to prosecute
jakers the limited partners who put
funds into the gins into the venture
capital organizations who give the money
to Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins and
andreessen horowitz and more David out
all these companies they give it
explicitly to invest in jakers the
general partners then interview
entrepreneurs with business plans and
the only plans that they take seriously
have big whopping J curves in them and
then the entrepreneur if you join one of
those startups you
know your number one job is get the hell
through the red part of the J curve as
fast as you possibly can which probably
does mean working 15 hours a day six
days a week and by the way if you didn't
come in on Saturday don't bother to come
in on Sunday I mean it's just that's the
game now it's a hard game to win and a
lot of people don't win it but but
nobody is conflicted there's there's
everybody is completely aligned around
what's going on
that's the crossing the chasm game now
you want to play that in an established
enterprise that has a core business
where you're not funding it out of
venture capital you're now going to fund
this out of operating cash flows you go
to your investors you say hey we've got
this incredible opportunity what do you
think they go and no no no no no no you
went through the j-curve don't do it
again
no no earnings per share stick unit look
you got a great business here don't
screw it up you know keep keep it going
cash flow cash flow cash flow right free
cash flow FCF Rick the salespeople you
say what hey look it this is really cool
these people are gonna love it and the
salesperson says it is cool but I want
to go to club I want to go to club if
I'm gonna go to club after make quota
and there's no way I can make quota
selling the new thing because a nobody
has any budget for this thing it's so
new so I'm gonna have to actually go
create budget before I can consume
budget B to be honest the thing doesn't
actually work I mean it's a great demo
but it's getting there see none of our
partners know how to support this thing
D the only people I know in the
companies that I'm calling on are the
people that bought the last generation
stuff whose jobs would probably get
marginalized if we sold them the new
generation stuff so I'm completely out
of pocket it's like no no I don't know
no and then the sales management right
behind him--as going do you want me to
make my number I mean I mean I can give
you some resources for this but that I'm
not how am I gonna make my number you
want me to make my number yeah we want
me to make your number okay
so thank you okay and then the customers
even the customers will be doing this is
very exciting I really I'm not exactly
an early adopter myself though uh we
like to like wait and see a little bit
in the meantime could you actually
deliver on the last release that you
haven't actually delivered on yet so
they're kind of going eat and your
partner's are going hey come on guys we
have a sweet deal here don't screw it up
just just play the hand you've been
dealt it's a great hand so what happens
is your time like this the venture back
thing which is not conflicted you're
totally conflicted in this model and the
thing that becomes important is we have
to realize look this is this is the
actual actuality this is not a mistake
it's not like somebody's made them it's
not like this is a mistake nobody on
this slide has made a mistake all they
have done is said what is that's always
that's open is just data and so whereas
we were processing that data you start
thinking well what would what was the
paradigm we had that was not helping
versus the one that could help and one
of the ways to look at this is to say
look when you think about innovation
I always thought of innovation as a
father like a big cornucopia and you put
a lot of ideas in the top and you'd sort
of work them through the middle or
horizon and horizon three horizon to
horizon when it's time you know it's
time and in the good ones that come out
the bottom it turns out that model is
actually okay for sustaining innovations
for innovations that complement and
supplement your existing core business
that's exactly you can have stage gates
I know if you've ever managed innovation
through stage gates stage gates are fine
for a funnel they are death for an
hourglass because when you get to the
middle of that hourglass you can't get
through the stage gate you just stop
everything you definitely so it's like
having it's like having an embolism or
sometimes always having something bad in
your in your in your intestines so that
what what what the what the horizon
what what the disruptive innovation
model says it's interesting it says the
world obviously loves your horizon three
business
horizon-1 business interestedly they
love you horizon 3 business they think
it's cool when Watson wins jeopardy woo
woo you know or the or the goat alphago
beats the go guy cool deep blue beats
Gary Kasparov yeah yeah but now you want
to do what and now what you want to do
is take a massive amount of resource out
of your core because there's not enough
resources to go around so now you're
gonna take resources out of a proven
money maker to bet them on something
that has still in the middle of a J
curve and it's just like mmm and all of
a sudden the temperature in the room
goes down about 10 degrees and people
start looking like that so the point
about this exercise is there's a choke
point it arrives in two and
interestingly it's not an RD choke point
you don't solve this choke point by
giving the people more Rd what they need
is more go to market resources that's
the scarce resource that's the envelope
you're stretching because the same go to
market resource envelope that you want
to prosecute the core business you want
to take they take that same envelope and
now stretch it to prosecute the new
business even though you know they're
very different so what you will do by
the way is you'll actually have an
overlay sales force do the new business
because they're going to be specialist
in the new business which is fine that
actually works but it's hideously
expensive and the first year you can get
away with it and the second year is
ghastly and the third year is terminal
because it because it because assisting
scales the financial upside down gets
it's a J curve right it's a J curve is
that this and your and publicly held
companies with core businesses are not
organized to prosecute jakers
so this was the key insight bringing a
disruptive innovation to scale is not a
natural act okay it puts your whole
organization in conflict with itself
it's an autoimmune disorder right it
basically causes the organization to go
against itself so they say well okay
Jeff I'll be done can we just like start
drinking martinis now I mean you know
because what the hell one-and-done is
that the name of
life and business no I'm not going to
make that suggestion I just want to have
us own this reality because then the
question and by the way this is the
reality that Microsoft was confronting
and this is the reality that Salesforce
was confronting ok and I'm going to
submit to you that they both are
prosecuting this reality successfully so
how is that possible
sorting out the conflicts so the key
idea behind the zone model was simply to
say there are legitimate interests
inside the corporation that are in
conflict with each other and though and
the first thing to do is to sort them
out to get clarity around each of the
interests but to isolate it from the
other interests that it is in conflict
with and so this 2x2 matrix does this
rather well so you have the disruptive
stuff on the left and the sustaining
stuff on the right and everybody kind of
gets don't put the disruptors with the
sustainers I mean nobody's we figured
that out a long time ago and then the
other one is bringing home the bacon in
terms of revenue and and and and profits
versus not but being below the line so
you look at those four zones and three
of them I'm going to submit the the the
the three that are not the
transformation zone I will submit you
have in your company today but if I
walked into your company a day and I
walked onto a floor and I talked to
three people I could tell you which zone
I was in and I will submit to you that
you do not have any two zones on the
same floor because they don't like each
other but they'd stuff they don't like
each other they don't hang out with each
other so let's talk about the three
zones the four is oh so the first one
horizon one performance zone this is
where you know you you will make the
number this is it has a culture of
commitment you commit you commit to make
the court will you weakly connect you
have quarterly commits you have the
annual commit for sales quota you also
have a commit as a developer I'm going
to build this on time on spec on budget
not which to do you want right I mean
this is a commit culture this this is
where this is where you serve the world
the world experiences your company
through the performance zone that's
where you make money it's where your
invest
by the way this is known at your
investors inspect very closely through
your financial reports but it's also
where you execute your mission if you
fail on the performance zone your
feeling your mission okay so that this
is this is you this is the you that you
are sending out into the world this is
what we're here for
but an arisin one it's largely the you
that you have built up to date it is
what a lot of people call their core
business or a core business says it's
the flywheel that runs the economic
engine and and people you run it and in
a very I mean most large companies have
very clear systems for doing that going
forward they can be improved and by the
way the book talks about how to improve
systems in all four zones but for the
purposes of our talk tonight let's just
take that is okay that's our core
business we kind of we kind of know what
we're doing there the productivity zone
is all of the cost centers that fit
below the performance zone and enable it
to perform so finances in the
productivity zone HR all of IT legal
marketing customer support procurement
anything that anybody that doesn't have
a number in their comp plan so if you're
in make it or you sell it you're in the
performance zone but if you're doing
anything else you're in the productivity
zone and those two zones soak up 95 plus
percent of the total budget every year I
mean that's kind of where in fact and my
father's there my father went through 40
years of business without one disruptive
innovation touching his industry so he
spent his entire life just in those two
zones
good going going forward but many mature
industries can work that way but but for
everybody in this room I will submit you
have an incubation zone you have
someplace where you are at least testing
the waters
maybe organically maybe you have a
minority investment in a start-up you
know maybe you're doing a tuck in
technical acquisition but you're doing
something over here to test to test the
water to invent the future to get a
flavor of you know what's going on and
that culture but by the way this is a
commit
culture this is a collaboration culture
this culture is it wants to be helpful
it's continuing and its job is primarily
to help the performance zone okay
dictate to do whatever it takes behind
the scenes to make the performance zone
successful and then the incubation zone
is supposed to be completely on the
other side of the page don't do what the
people on the right hand side are doing
get ahead of get what we're sending you
out ahead of everybody go off and be be
effectively brilliant and those three
zones I submit exist in your company
today is that fair I think it's fair and
by the way each zone feels slightly
superior to the other two so if you're
people in the creativity zone they're
pretty sure they have 10 to 15 IQ points
on you pretty much to a man woman or
child yeah they're just probably 15 IQ
points smarter the people in your
performance zone will never stop
reminding you we are the people that are
paying for everything around here we're
the people that make the money for God's
sake what and the people in the
productivity zone will say are we the
only adults in the room I mean it's like
is that what's going so each zone has a
culture we've all kind of known each
it's a little bit like Thanksgiving
dinner you know you can kind of hang out
with each other but usually I meant one
day to the table there at the other
table whatever but but but it works okay
and then there's and these three zones
exist and I would submit every year they
exist that is not true of the
transformation zone if I go into your
it's company and I look high and low I
will not find the transformation zone
because it doesn't exist it is a
temporary construct that you bring into
existence for the sole purpose of going
through a j-curve of taking your company
through a j-curve and that requires a
complete change in a radical
reallocation of resources that goes
against the grain and certainly against
the inertia of every process you have
going and that requires a command
culture and it requires the CEO to step
in and say I am taking control of the
boat i delegate the ship for most of the
trash
but I just flew over from from Los
Angeles for most of that flight I am
reasonably certain that the the chief
pilot did not have his hands on the
tiller or whatever you call it on a
plane but I guarantee you when we landed
he did okay and that's kind of the game
here so so it's a but that's that's when
it comes into existence so you say okay
how do you work this system now let's go
back to our annual budgeting process and
we say okay so how does this actually
work and then we're going to look at the
transformation playbook itself well if
you're budgeting and you're not going
through a transformation if you've
decided that yeah there's very
interesting technologies around but this
this is not our year for a j-curve how
do you do the budget how do you
prioritize the zones during the
budgeting well the number one priority
is the performance zone we got it we're
going to make our number right that's
how we fulfill your mission in the world
so do we have enough sales people and
selling capacity to make our bookings
number if we don't let's add more do we
have enough delivery capacity software
engineers professional services product
whatever it is if we don't let's put the
money there that's first
now after that it's like okay now let's
look what we have a huge stack of
programs that would make us more
effective and and systems that would
make us more efficient it's an infinite
list we can't fund everything but but
let's fund as much of it as we possibly
can in support of the performance zone
doing its mission and by the way let's
put something into the incubation zone
because we don't want to get caught
completely flat-footed so and in the
good years we'll probably put a little
bit more in and in lean years maybe a
little bit less in but but that's what
we're gonna do so the envelope looks
like this there's nothing in the
transformation zone this is what we call
a good year right your investors will
like you you will get home at night you
will even occasionally go to it's one of
your children's school events I mean you
know your your spouse will not be in
negotiations with a lawyer by complete
parting ways with you because he or she
will have seen
I mean the point this is a good year and
by the way just to put this in
perspective even in tech if you
negotiated one transformation per decade
which is something that those none of
those 54 companies did one per decade I
would you would be world class
now it's Apple did three but that you
know it's like I'm sorry everybody has
somebody that blows the grade curve
right but but if you just if you do one
per decade which means and I and I think
they take about three years the J curve
the venture experience with J curve is
it's a three year it's a three year play
so that means seven out of the ten years
my wish for you is this is what you're
doing and we just keep doing and by the
way all those things we criticize the
silos and all that stuff
silos make this thing work very
efficiently they're horrible at changing
but you don't want to change this is
these are the seven years you just want
to get more mileage out of the same
opportunity so you actually do put in
place the silos that you're going to
regret for the other three years okay
but you do okay so sweet deal why would
you screw this out two reasons the first
one was the one that we worked with Marc
Benioff and his team at Salesforce on so
this is we called it zone offense
eventually because you're voluntarily
putting your company into a state of
risk why would you do that because you
believe you have something in your
incubation zone either because you
acquired it or you build it organically
or most likely a combination of both and
you want to scale it to material size I
want to get it a material size in this
model is 10% or more of total corporate
revenue total revenue for whatever
you're going to mark an envelope is
responsible for at 10% or more your
investors your partner's your customers
go WOW you're the new business it's it's
real I mean it's real I mean who knew
apples in the music business who knew
right
apples in the phone business
Amazon's in the in the cloud business
who knew but until but IBM is not yet in
the Watson business Watson is not 10% of
IBM's revenue so IBM reports out Watson
is under analytics and AI but the
ampersand is is a design you allows them
to put in a lot of core legacy business
to keep the number big enough to be
interesting right which is totally
appropriate by the way everybody knows
what they're doing but instead it's a
totally appropriate thing to do but the
point is what Ginni Rometty has got to
do at IBM right now if she's got to take
that to there so if you do that that has
to be the number one priority this is
the thing that the 54 fellows didn't do
by the number one priority that means
when the performance zone person says
well I have to make my number the answer
is why sure as hell want you to make
your number but that is not the number
one priority the number one priority is
if we go into a J curve we are coming
out with a 10% or greater business come
hell or high water that is the number
one priority there is no higher priority
nothing takes priority over that outcome
because the worst thing you can do to
your company is taken into a J curve and
not get out that's how those 54
companies by the way you can one doesn't
normally kill you if you look at those
54 companies two three four five but
every one of them's like like I just
another another self-inflicted wound of
serious serious import so that raises an
important question if you don't think
you can get into a J curve if you for
whatever reason you're uncertain then
the key responses you must not start
most companies start and say well let's
see how it's going to turn out that that
that's the death that that's that's
deadly no no yeah if we're going to do
it we're going to do it so therefore
it'd be very thoughtful and it's no
accident by the way if who's been
successful with this stuff founders yeah
Marc Benioff well yeah he owns 20
the company Jeff Bezos Bill Gates Steve
Jobs
you know Elon Musk Reed Hastings Larry
Page sure so so so so so what so one of
the things that allows founder of the
the people to do zone offense is there's
often a charismatic founder that still
has a huge stake in the thing and
basically they can kind of do a my way
or the highway sort of sort of mandate
the problem is I don't know about your
companies most of the companies I deal
with are not run by founders the CEO is
a hired employee office and in Europe
third fourth fifth sixth seventh
generation okay
not the founder so that makes it even
more challenging which means that the
and we'll talk about this in the
transformation playbook
you have to socialize this at this
intent across the entire executive team
and we have to get the entire executive
team to make that commandment because if
you don't make that commitment you're
not going to get through the jakers and
then the productivity zones here and
whatever else is in the incubation zone
not now not now not now if I'd find find
another home so here what you the key is
but because that what that number one
means and you'll see it in the
transformation playbook you have to
enlist everyone in making the big change
none of those companies did that the 54
meaning the company executives who were
in charge of the other functions and the
core businesses did not make it their
number one priority that the emerging
business get to ten percent or greater
scale what they said is I'll make my
business work and I'll use my resources
to make my business work you will not
get through the j-curve there is not
enough resources to play that game
everybody every leader of every business
and every function in the productivity
zone has to commit 100% that that is
that you get up every day every morning
and you say is there something I can do
to accelerate the growth of the of the
transformational business because every
day that it is subscale is a bad day
it's a bad day for me it's a bad day for
the entire company so we're gonna do it
so that's that's that's the game plan
okay having said that I think this is
maybe one out of five this is a big-ass
to ask somebody voluntarily to to put
particularly if you have a family
business there are aunts and uncles and
saying what are you doing you know I
remember the numbers say the master you
you think public companies are hard to
run run a family business I mean if you
think your public boards hard to deal
with
just try dealing with your blood
relatives okay so anyway so so I think
this is not common the one that's much
more common was the Microsoft example
Microsoft didn't have something in this
incubation zone that said let's take
this to scale Microsoft had three of the
very very best businesses we have ever
seen in the high-tech sector the Windows
operating system business the office
office automation business and the in
the sequel server led back office
software business and they just print
money and by the first first five years
of this this century the word financial
returns are spectacular okay what
happened was all three of them took a
direct hit to midships from the
next-generation technology torpedo
so so Windows Windows in 2001 I don't
have the actual statistics I would bet
you that 85 to 90 percent of all devices
edge devices that were sold in the 2001
to 2005 period ran windows in the second
quarter of this year 20% less than 20%
they did not get 20% share at the edge
oops right and remember every time you
buy the new windows then you want to get
the new office to put on the new windows
and and then and there so that was
number one so then the office business
is we don't by the way they didn't have
anything that ran on mobile office only
runs ran on Windows so they so that was
their problem number two and then all
that back office surface all that really
really lucrative back-office server
business cloud so Microsoft has the
phrase existential threat these
technologies have put my core businesses
under an existential threat not a tough
to compete thing existed the way coded
the way digital photography put Kodak's
film business under an existential
threat and so the insight that that and
I think Ballmer probably had this
insight but he didn't have the right
personality to take it to scale but
Satya does it said the inside is you
cannot fix a business under existential
threat if you leave it in the
performance zone meaning you cannot ask
it to both modernize itself and meet the
the revenue goals the bookings goals and
the contribution margin goals that you
have traditionally said plus an extra X
percent because we want to grow every
year
that's not you're not gonna be able to
do both those things and so so you're
going to do a J curve it's a different
kind of J curve because part of the J
now is you're taking one of your
workhorse revenue engines offline so
you're kind of you're kind of dampening
your own J so where it they started this
with it with with the back-office
software business so so basically they
said we're gonna we're going to move it
to the cloud well the cloud was a
hideous J curve now if you have to go
through a J curve it does help to have
like a hundred billion dollars somewhere
lying around I mean it's helpful but the
point is they still had to report out
these financials and they're going
through a hideous J curve and even now I
mean Asher is is is the margins on Azure
are not particularly attractive but the
growth rates and the meaning and having
this you have this cloud that has a lot
of statute with enterprise IT it's it's
it's a very powerful asset and you've
seen Microsoft stock price do very well
on the back I would say primarily of
their success with Azure and secondarily
with office so then when they had the
office issue they look the the Satya was
saying cloud first mobile first Qi Liu
takes over office he says well I have no
product that's mobile and no product
that's cloud hmm okay so so he goes to
you buys a couple of Bo
products just jam that and office365 to
spit in their cloud play and again
office 365 is I think it's it's not
maybe it's not quite yet back in the
performance zone but it's certainly
getting there most people are going at
the margin yeah we'll we'll use it but
it's still it's still it's not nowhere
near as profitable as if you bought it
under the old enterprise license
agreements and it's still threatened by
Google Apps because if Microsoft Office
is a personal productivity software
suite and the world is going to a
collaboration productivity software
suite and so you've seen them come out
with things like team it's their slack
compete they're doing all those kinds of
things but the point about it is they
relaxed the performance zone demands on
that on that thing to do that so when
you do that you make that the number one
now what you do is you go into your
incubation zone whether again through
acquisition or through organic
innovation or whatever and you find
whatever you can in that zone that can
modernize your core business to get it
back in the game you don't have to
leapfrog the disruptor you just have to
get your business close enough into the
into the same zone that people can go
well I never really wanted to switch and
if Microsoft is getting that close to
Google Apps or that close to to Amazon I
I can live with that it's not I I get
that it's not as good as but I have a
huge stake I've got so many you know
places where I'd have to change if I
switch vendors the last thing I want to
do is really do that so that's what
modernizing modernizing the business is
all about but by the way the performance
zone comes in third and undoubtedly is
going to is going to take a hit the good
god is good news but I'll call it good
news here everybody knows you're gonna
take a hit
it's obvious you're going to take a hit
and the fact that you're proactively
embracing this challenge actually
encourages investors and customers and
partners not discourages them because
they see that you're under existential
threat and they can see that if you
don't do something that this is gonna be
bad so again you enlist ever
in this case in modernizing the existing
business the current business so this is
so this so so what is the ask them so
what what what is the playbook that you
would have to say if I am going to do a
transformation what is it I really have
to sign up for because again I've said
that founders do this well well founders
have that extra gear if you're not a
founder I think you have to have a very
thoughtful discussion with yourself with
your lead directors on your board and
with your trusted advisors on your
executive team do we have the will do we
have the clout do we have the unity can
I create a Coalition of the Willing to
do this or not and if the conclusion is
you know probably not that's not a
horrible conclusion it just means no
j-curve you know if the answer is not
then we're not going to start it so
here's the playbook lay book says
transformation solve other commitments
that's the fundamental idea failure is
not an option by the way people look at
VCS they say wait why failure VCS look
like three out of four fail or two out
of three fail it's okay to fail it's
okay to fail with other people's money
it's not okay to fail with your money
the the venture model is set up on about
a three to one win ratio
it's the wage though the whole model is
set up that way you're they're not
spending operating cash flow they're
spending venture capital right it's a
totally different financial transaction
so in an in an operating cash flow
funded situation failure literally is
not an option
everyone's badge is on the table making
the hot rise in one number is important
but it's not the top priority and in
fact I gave this conversation to a
warburg pincus off side of CEOs about
three weeks ago and one guy say say yeah
Jeffrey's in I want to say this
differently its transformation there are
only two rules
the first rule transformation is the top
priority
the second rule there are no other rules
okay it's a version of saying making
making the second bullet there it's just
a really clear way I think
which means total alignment is required
this is what this is why I said you can
you create a Coalition of the Willing
because if you cannot get total
alignment you can't make this thing work
so the CEO is in command
you cannot delegate this the CEO cannot
say well I'm going to have this
executive vice president Li this charge
no because the CEO is the only person
who has the right to take resources away
from other core businesses and give it
to the fledging business I mean no it no
the executive vice president has that
kind of power it's a new narrative for
the investors the Board of Directors has
to be in full support they can't be
saying well yeah but you could still
make your number ru if that's what
they're saying to you and you're this
hired CEO you have to say no I'm not and
then have that conversation and if you
discover they say well you have to okay
then we're not we cannot prosecute a
j-curve in our company at this time and
we will not and I'll show you but I'm
going to show you what you can do if you
don't because it's not like you're
condemning yourself to death if you
don't go through a j-curve there are
legitimate alternatives the third one is
executive compensation is usually
universally tied to this one outcome you
want the entire team to reinforce this
prioritization by seeing that their
discretionary bonuses are keyed
overwhelmingly to the success of this of
this one outcome by the way stock
options are a great way to do that
because if you really a particularly for
zone o for both of them your stock price
should achieve it should increase it
dramatically in the case of zone offense
and highly appreciative zone defense and
therefore make those options very
attractive the keep the key milestones
if it's zone offense it's got to get to
ten percent or more of the total of the
total thing because until it until that
tipping point is reached everybody is
giving you the doubt of the benefit and
then after the tipping point you will
get the benefit of the doubt but G but
until you're getting the benefit of the
doubt you just you cannot take your foot
off the gas pedal and in terms of an
resuscitating an existing business you
don't have to get it to meteoric growth
you just have to get it back to
single-digit growth that is reliable
because whether it'll show
I've absorbed enough of the new
disruptive technology I've incorporated
enough of the new design rules that I
can build a profitable business on back
of my existing installed base and I can
defend it against the barbarians that's
what the world needs to see so faults
and fixes fault number one this one I
did a bunch of work with Cisco in the
first decade of the century I have a
huge respect for it for that team and
John Chambers in particular but John
would never ever ever have only one
thing one Jay he always had more than
one j-curve going at the same time he
just he just he's couldn't couldn't not
release them it turns out there is no
it's incredibly stressful to a
corporation to go through a J curve
there is no chance you could take a
public company through to J curves at
the same time there's it's just it's
crazy then why do people do it because
they have there's a cliche don't put all
your eggs in one basket right it's a
very good cliche it's a very sensible
cliche don't put all your eggs in one
basket so I have a new cliche chickens
lay eggs one at a time if a chicken
tries to lay two eggs at the same time
it's bad for the eggs and it's bad for
the chicken okay that's number one
number two withdrawing support before
the tipping points reached this happens
a lot this is the classic failure mode
you put on the overlay sales force you
do all the things you're actually
growing you're succeeding but you're
upside down financially to the point
where your CFO is apoplectic and you
have to do that and they see you we've
got to figure out some way to cut the
burn and the problem is in the middle of
a J curve if you show any sign of
flinching all those people sitting on
the outside watching are you most should
I go in or should I not go in they all
pull back and and and you can never get
momentum back so so you cannot you
cannot flinch and then the third one is
letting anybody on the team opt out of
taking account of Bill
for the transformation success no
everybody has to be on the same patient
and quite likely if you have multiple
lines of core businesses is highly
probable at least one senior executive
someone who has been an anchor tenant
for your business someone who's been a
pillar upon whom you have relied on you
will have to replace and you cannot
dilly dally with it because every day
that the person who's not committed to
the J curve is in place they're sending
a message to the entire organization it
is okay not to support the J curve and
it's not it's not it's fatal not to
support the J curve so transformations
are defining moments they simply must
succeed so given that which is a pretty
chilling recipe it raises the issue okay
Jeff you know you're saying this is some
sort of hero ball I'm pretty good but I
don't think I'm teed up to be a hero at
least not this year now what so this
framework is a way of saying look there
are at least three routes to absorbing a
disruptive innovation into your
enterprise and getting value from it the
most conservative route is to say I'm
just going to take the new technology
and I'm actually going to optimize my
existing systems without changing
anything outside of my technical
envelope so I'm gonna go to the cloud
I'm not going to build a new data center
I'm gonna I'm gonna get admin I'm gonna
outsource that thing around I'm gonna do
a BYOD bring your own device to work and
I'm gonna stop buying laptops for
everybody in the company you know or I'm
going to do some sort of mobile device
management mobile application management
kind of thing I'm gonna do a bunch I'm
gonna put Wi-Fi in all the conference
rooms I'm gonna do a bunch of stuff it's
gonna it's great it's going to make us
more productive people will be more
collaborative life will be good but I'm
not I'm not upsetting the applecart and
ideally in fact people would just
experience these things as as nice
incremental additions to life perfectly
legitimate thing to do with disruptive
technology the next one up is
no we have to be more aggressive than
that we want to change our operating
model we want we are we are a cab
company fighting against uber we need a
mobile app that lets our customers you
do self dispatch you know call cab have
watch that come to them and probably pay
for it with their mobile phone but I'm
not over I still own my own cabs it's
not a new business model same business
model but I changed my operating model I
don't have as many dispatchers you know
I have to I have to retrain all my
drivers I've got a budget I've got a
budget I've got to react whip them I
mean there's a bunch of stuff and the
key thing about changing the operating
model is the IT organization doesn't
have enough budget to do it so if you're
gonna do the orange one you have to
actually go to the performance zone to
the people that are actually you know
going to change their systems you have
to say you've done you were going to
hire ten more people you're gonna have
to take some of those headcount and you
have to give that money to the IT side
so that they can build out this mobile
system or build out this you know
digital you know baby maybe it's some
version of chatbots in our customer
hotline or or whatever the heck it is
we're modernizing our operating model
but we're still in the same business and
then the third one is no we're gonna
change our business we're gonna add a
new line of business to the game that is
the transformation zone play but but the
idea is you can play this at three
levels and it kind of it kind of is
whether ways to kind of get which level
you're playing at is how much pressure
am i putting on on my vendors if you're
just doing the infrastructure stuff
basically you're putting product
pressure just a product or as a service
offer pressure you know just give me
better stuff and I'll make my gray area
better if I'm changing the operating
model I need a bunch of solutions I need
I need to have I need a business process
reengineering I need new application
software I need I need something that's
going to work you know across the mobile
network whatever the heck it is I need
that and then if I'm doing the business
model it's it's an end-to-end project
it's it's it's open-heart surgery all
the way
so if you look at this what this says is
that there are three legitimate paths
forward with any disruptive innovation
and what I would wish for you to do is
that would wish for you to to bring your
stuff into the incubation zone now just
use your incubation zone dollars now
whatever you think is the disruptive
wave in your world get it in your
company now but bring it into an
incubation zone so to get your fingers
dirty with it get somebody you trust to
help you get your own perspective on it
because if you do decide to scale it
you're going to want to have an inside
executive helped lead the
transformational effort or or the or the
the transitions it to the other to other
zones so so do that and then make the
call you know make the call you know hey
this is one that we're just going to put
into our platform of normal IT we're
just going to be a better more efficient
company nope we are gonna change we're
not but we're could it still have the
same customers we're still giving them
the same value proposition we're just
going to do it in a much more modern way
or no you know what we've got a new
business maybe a new ecosystem we're
gonna build we're going to do that and I
would say that transformations are the
exception not the rule so my last slide
is it's just a question for you which I
would love for you to take away I'm not
sure a quick sort and how to how to
manage this but but maybe we don't do it
right now given our time but maybe if
you think oh we are we are doing it now
so okay yes okay all right okay so the
idea by this question is for your
industry and your enterprise if you had
to just pick one of those five waves to
prioritize over the other for which wave
is the most disruptive at present okay
and then the second question is if you
engaged with that wave which of these
three arrows would be the most
productive way for your company net in
2017 given the realities that you were
facing will be the most productive way
you could do
thank you Jeff so um we want to keep you
up here a little bit it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
