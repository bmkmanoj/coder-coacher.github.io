what and idiot who I and what are you
doing for today so she says my name is
adria note my official title is a chief
scientist but container solutions which
is a consultancy specialising and
everything sort of micro services and
close native yeah i'm currently working
on sort of stuff around image tune with
dr. registries and so on he was so i
wrote a book for riley called am using
docker what are the main concern around
Afghan security yeah so there's a lot of
thing made about container security and
I guess that comes idea of comparing it
to them virtual machine and security and
virtual machines so there's the argument
that the virtual machines are naturally
more secure because they have a
hypervisor later under this certain
amount of truth to that but what I would
say in most cases adhere you're going to
be using containers with virtual
machines so if you're using containers
inside virtual machines you're only
added another layer security in up
removing anything good or bad practices
for addressing it because of insecurity
and sure please biggest when I see as
people and run the application this
route and container so if you use my
base images like debian or center it'll
be set up and so that when you enter it
here the root user but even an
application site they are what you need
to do is change to a different user so
that's like i've set in a user in the
dockerfile or when you contain about
self users with mike see do or is it
tool called go see us a little bit nicer
that will change to a different user and
the reason to do that is then if for
example container break it was to occur
and somebody got out of container are
known to the host because users aren't
named page by default there would be
root on the host if they're also proven
contain and also simply if if a meta
carries roots inside a container then
there can
have more privileges than mr Talbot just
inside that container so solid like this
idea of that Lisa privilege if I was
okay from lower half instead of amenity
figure well it should be reasonably high
level security official image so the
official images the ones that invented
by dr. but they won't cover you that the
user will be normally route by default
so if it's a base image like read that
like sent off or deadly that before as
user will be a brute and he changed out
in the application the reason it's
ruthless so that you can install
software and so on so in your own image
or me to do things that need root
villages like and so on software but
once you've done that need change your
user there's also a application images
like Reddit and so on and you look at
those images they will change to an
uncle excusa so the reddit image run
just a reddit user for example and
that's actually quite a good tip for
picking up security tapes if you look at
the docker files for the way that
official images to keep it together
those fishes voyage can use it against
our very high there I don't use a shady
oh right so if you so I guess the
casinos if funding image name dr. hot
it's not an official image but you'd
like to use it the first thing I would
look at is is it an automated build and
if it's an automated build you'll be
able to go and playing the dockerfile
and the source that it was built from
and you can verify it via that so you
can look up what's actually in it you
can also go a step further you could
download that dr. Philemon source and
build it yourself and then you're
absolutely sure for tenants and as well
as automated those people can't just
push any images it like up so I would
probably stay away from those because
there could be anything at all
password ultimately generally by the
droid take my services Keysha which
container right so let's you said you
don't put in your image god I give
secret run thing and there's a few
different ways that people do it you can
use environment variables and there are
some issues with that because they're
quite visible you put them in files and
make the file but what what we're moving
to and it's perhaps not quite here yet
but we're moving to sort of secret
management with them p value story so in
docker my mantra dr. Cohen I'll inform
Lord they'll have be a secret API and
you can create secretly than that unmask
them into containers of runtime and
there's also tools like volts from asha
kore do something very similar although
you have to share the API to show how
does it happen is really interesting the
secret store works and what about
there's a light high secret right so if
you use an external key value store like
the vault it's obvious an issue where by
highly to continue I must enter key to
the vault so one way you could do this
it was having like a one-time password
or a short-lived password that you pass
into the container perhaps as
environment variable I want to use that
talking it gets access to a secret that
it wants for the rest of its life sign
with the database talking or the epi
talking and if we need to access to
vault again so it just uses a secret one
and then it's no longer good I think it
has expired or because only good for one
actress alternatively you can also use a
file system plugin so the way for
example of Secrets API and dr. swarm
over the pro network is a they will
actually places file with the secret to
you have access to in the root of the
container so it never needs to ask
because the key value store told that
she didn't excite the foil containers
down and hopefully there will be so I
believe the orange is some attempts at
volume plugin for stuff like asha
vault
refinishing okay thanks that a
