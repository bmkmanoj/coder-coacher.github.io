profession I've had a number of roles I
worked in industry for a while I was a
developer i worked in industrial
research but i also spent some time in
academia teaching budding young minds
and I always struggled with ways to make
some very difficult topics easy enough
so they could understand what I was
talking about even though they hadn't
had any real industrial experience and a
lot of things are difficult and we have
a class sometimes a whole class in
something and my main interest was in
design that's my PhD research was in
design so I wanted to spend a lot of
time in it regardless of the course so
I'm going to act out a little scenario
about a way I handled teaching a very
difficult design concept in my data
structures class this is my office and
I'm working very hard waiting because I
have an appointment with them someone in
my data structures class who's coming in
to show me something about a program
he's been working on hi professor oh hey
Chris hi here's my code I guess you
can't do I think you can't guess what
that does ah yeah you're right I don't
know what what does it do wait a minute
oh that's better okay hmm no no what
does it do it looks like you've been
working hard on this I can see that
maybe uh let's see what can I say wait I
know don't you have a younger sister
sure sure I do this stephanie see some
seats actually taking a programming
class tom she's learning how to program
too oh ok yeah I think she's in my intro
class and I wonder do you suppose
Stephanie could read this no no no this
is this is way too difficult you know I
want to kula
you know this is you wouldn't be able to
understand this you know yeah this is
hard stuff yeah yeah I was just
wondering let's let's suppose that
someday you're out in the real world and
you're riding real working code and and
stephanie has already graduated and the
company decides that they want to hire
her as well so you and Stephanie are
both working at the same company and she
is asked to maintain this code I wonder
could she do that now we know that
Stephanie is really smart right I mean I
know you're smart and this is a hard
problem but she's really smart yeah and
and I hate to say this but I'm smart too
and if I can't understand it and it's
not likely that Stephanie could
understand it what does that mean how
odd this let's think about every time
you write code to solve a problem even a
very difficult problem that you're
sending a message to all of the people
who will ever read it whether those
people are your younger sister or you
know what it might be you it might be
you in a couple of months who has to
look at the code that you've written and
and pretend for a moment that some other
smart programmer comes along and looks
at what you've written and would say wow
wow this is great I understand exactly
what's going on here I I understand this
code and not only that i'm amazed at how
elegant how beautiful this code is and
i'm going to show everybody on my team
this is such a beautiful example it's a
masterpiece
do you suppose that you could take this
wonderful solution and write it in such
a way that it will be so beautiful that
it will be just like a song it will sing
I think anyone who could come up with
this very difficult solution could also
write something beautiful hey maybe I
should start grading on beauty what do
you think okay I get your point I I
think I'll I'll go off and make the
world a better place now thank you Chris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
