Chicago and I'm the pleasure of talking
to Adrian carcroft who just gave a
fantastic keynote on what what would you
expect on basically moving to moving to
your entire world to the cloud and saas
so great to have you Adrian okay after
your talk I think one of the questions
for those involved in large our IT
organizations is what are our you know
how do we move to this this model
realistically given we have a lot of
existing infrastructure old systems and
so on you know what are the maybe the
baby steps are the first steps to do
that so the real point here is that
there's a kind of bombs race going on
right now of who can develop products
faster because if you talk to somebody
in a big company not and say would you
like your product development to be
slower than it is now they're never
going to say yes to that they want to go
faster so the question is how fast can
you go and and what would what's
happening right now is a radical speed
up in the ability to get things done
quickly and it's a combination of
several things coming together like
cloud is one speeds up one piece big
data peak and lytic speeds up another
piece DevOps speeds up the
decision-making and cultural piece so
once you've got all of those things you
can go around a loop and discover things
really quickly so that's that's the real
value that enterprises a scene and the
arms race becomes because if there's
three or four people competing in a
space or in a product space one of them
takes a year to learn something about
their customers the other one takes a
month or a few weeks then they're going
to learn much more they're going to go
faster they're going to be more
competitive so that's really what's
interesting right now and lots of people
now struggling with getting you know how
do you make that transition and part of
it is that you know South DevOps is a
reorg you can't just add it
group you have to go and figure out how
to reorganize your company and a lot of
the time what people are built is silos
of responsibility you know there's a
silo of people that look after storage
and there's people that own the database
and there's people that own the apps and
then as the product managers and they
all kind of work horizontally and
they're organized that way and then when
they go to do something they have to
communicate and hand off all the way
down the stack so the first way of doing
it is to sort of do the 90 degree turn
and what what I guess amazon called to
peets of teams that own everything so
you have a product manager you have the
developers you have all of the ability
to deploy anything you need to
production for your thing you own
everything right and with cloud in
particular you've got everything's API
driven so you're you know creating a
large-scale data store is bunch of API
calls and something like Cassandra and
you have an arbitrarily large probably
just read the data store and you didn't
need to go and talk to anyone else about
even I have to go provision sad or
something like that to do it so that's
that's an incredibly powerful model for
moving forward but you have to figure
out how to reorganize around teams where
within the team is a very high trust
environment where you can move
incredibly quickly and everything around
that is now a an API to effectively an
untrusted system where you have no
control and you get this bounded context
which means you don't have to understand
as much about the rest of the world to
make something happen quickly you know I
think a classic thing I'm sure you
mentioned in your talk is that you know
the companies are doing this google
Netflix Amazon which is an enabler for
it but uses it itself they they seem to
be delivering you know what appear to be
a small number of services right in case
of Netflix you know your videos and you
select them and then the content network
delivers them and then there's paying
for them and so on but whereas the
classic IT organization
so there is a lot more services a lot
more diversity with a lot of
interconnections between them and and
also us a deal with regulatory
environment yeah well Netflix is sort of
600 different micro services which all
have to interact and they're all
individually a are a bounded contacts or
development team builds a service which
is a piece of Netflix and with NIT a
team builds an application which is a
piece of that so I think that it isn't
that different in terms of the structure
of what you're doing or building
something which has an external
viewpoint there's a customer using it
whereas for IT you have an employee
using it typically or maybe if your
innate sometimes 80s building things for
product use for customers as well as for
internal use that the netflix model
splits it so the corporate IT is really
about employee productivity you know
it's more of the cus full of the
employee facing tools and then the
product organization owns all the
external facing stuff and most companies
those are combined in some way so you're
doing a mixture of things some customer
facing some internal and the real focus
on netflix has is the very singh it's a
single product in the market but it's
implemented as lots and lots of
individual things so in some sense it is
different but a lot of the techniques
actually map i think if you look at it
from what's really happening corporate
IT though the a lot of these internal
services are the same services over and
over again i mean everyone does payroll
and everyone is already outsourced
payroll because that's it's become
that's been a commodity service for a
very long time but a lot of things like
HR apps and sales and marketing and all
those things are becoming SAS and what
we're seeing now is the hollowing out of
IT by SAS vendors where you just go and
configure the SAS product and it does a
better job than this custom thing you
built inside the era of having fully
custom ERP is people spent a lot of
money on that there is no real
competitive differentiation and having
your ERP be slightly different too
business is not that different so you
can move to a more saps model for things
like that as well so it's size of
enterprise customers often the
motivation isn't so much to go to this
new model to offer new services although
the color there was some of that but
often it's to try and do a cost
reduction reduce platforms I take
advantage of the quad provisioning and
so on yeah yet so there's there's really
two businesses kind of fall into two
camps there's if you're a very sort of
visit some companies basically are
competing on the base of differentiated
product right so you're innovating in a
market trying to create a new market
grant disrupt things or just trying to
stay at the leading edge of something so
in that case is how fast can your
innovation out other markets are
building utilities and operating them
efficiently you know like power
companies if you look at PG&amp;amp;E or
something is the company in the
California they are being very
innovative in putting out smart meters
and building power stations in your
nuclear power stations or whatever
there's an enormous amount of innovation
going on but to most of us it's behind a
wall socket right there's you're pulling
the same power from the same wall as
just being delivered to you so they're
optimizing forecast so if you're in that
space where you're you're building a
utility commodity you're optimizing
forecast there is a lot of innovation
but you're kind of doing it behind the
API and this is this is one of the key
things is to have that API between
development and operations where
development is about the innovation of
product happens above the API and the
optimization of cost happens below the
API so from Netflix's point of view
using AWS AWS our cost optimizing behind
that API incredibly aggressively and
most IT organizations you don't want to
blend those two together you want to
build a clinic the I between them I
think that's the key part some people
suggest that these
comics of scale will basically come back
so that you know actually provisioning
on Amazon may become very expensive
compared to buys a cluster of arm cores
or something that in the futures that's
something you see is a scenario where
you basically what you pushed out to toe
sarika pushed out to amazon you'll be
pulling back into our own boxes I did
this is it it becomes so expensive or
and you know they couldn't the inner cat
cost of a loosely connected network
versus getting you know a few thousand
cores in a future generation of hardware
so what like I said before it if you're
in the innovation side of that then it
doesn't make any sense to be investing
in the low-cost infrastructure because
it's all about how fast can you develop
and you will just slow yourself down
every time you do cost optimization
you're actually slowing yourself down if
you're on the other side of it yes you
need to do a cost optimization and the
other case where you have to that move
me on public public vendors as if you
get to be too big so there's you want to
be a small fish in a big pond and I have
a slide somewhere and use it today that
basically has a shark and a paddling
pool you don't want to find a sharp if
sharks don't fit in paddling pools right
so if you end up to be too big for the
cloud then you have to do it yourself
and if you look at facebook or google
themselves or Twitter or you know the
really big vendors they are too big to
fit in public cloud and from netflix is
pointing to the netflix CDN is that case
the netflix CDN is too big to fit in a
public CDN so they run their own CDN and
if they don't have the least data center
space for it but it's the data plane
it's the you know delivers lots and lots
of bits but it's incredibly simple
there's no real business logic in there
there was a very good presentation at
the streaming media conference a few
weeks ago with a lot of detail about
this all of the intelligence that
manages that CDN runs on AWS but there
the thing that delivers many terabytes
of traffic runs outside
and you know provisioned infrastructure
that they had to build themselves thank
you very much for your time I think a
clear message to those who are sitting
back and watching and think it's only
Netflix and google that are going to
this technology I think it's a tip of
the iceberg for IG to start moving
quickly and starting to get some of the
advantages of moving at speed like I
don't matter what I've been saying
thanks very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
