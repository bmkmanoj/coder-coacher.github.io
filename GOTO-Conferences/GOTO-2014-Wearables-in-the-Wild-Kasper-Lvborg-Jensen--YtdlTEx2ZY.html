wearables and more particularly it's
going to be about wearables in the wild
so like taking wearables out where
they're supposed to be used essentially
we want to be exploring and exploiting
how we can use these to create new and
better user experiences so first of all
should we believe in the hype about
wearables is it going to revolutionize
the way that we interact with
information and services and how can we
leverage wearables to create greater use
experiences I'm going to give you a hint
it's going to be all about the context
of use so my name is Casper lobo Jensen
I'm from Denmark I'm the chief wizard
and founder at leaf Castle labs and I
did my masters in software engineering
and I did my PhD in human-computer
interaction and mobile devices
essentially using mobile sensors to
infer about the users context and use
that to create better user experiences
but I've been working in a lot of
different places and I've primarily been
a software engineer or a consultant or a
researcher or academic and more recently
an entrepreneur but in all of these
cases as i'll come back to i have always
been in some sort of way and interaction
designer and that's probably why they
put me in the ux track ah briefly about
leaf castle apps we create well changing
mobile innovations and we help others do
the same so we develop and we consult
for clients we work with partners to
create new businesses or to create new
products and we have our own products
which is the fun part when we just play
around with new technology just to learn
about them and then we go and train and
do workshops and talks like this so just
some examples what we do on the right
side this is from Namibia where it was
for a couple of years is this a
hackathon for mobile developers in the
maybe on Africa
and skelter on the left right is a new
app that I'm working with some people on
which is essentially going to
revolutionize the way that you interact
and engage with people at conferences
like this or other events and
facilitating you to hook up with the
right people and find the people that
you want to interact with in an easier
way and in my steps is another app that
comes pretty much from the kind of our
own projects the labs and it's an app
application for cancer patients and
their families to essentially try and
get them out and walk more and also to
talk to each other about their feelings
through the process of going through
this illness and in the same at the same
time raising money for cancer research
so just some examples um there's some
different perspectives on you I or UX
that I just wanted to briefly outline is
that you could say there is a business
perspective it's like what's the product
what do the users want there's a
developer perspective it's more
technical what's actually possible with
the technology as it is the interaction
designer as we learnt in the track today
it's the people the more practical like
how should this be done what kind of
flows do we need how should it look like
and then there is the more academic side
of it is like putting the theories like
the gestalt laws that we learned about
in the first talk how do we put that
into practice why do these things work
so there is an underlying body of
knowledge that we can draw upon um so
how it fits in in I started out doing my
masters and PhD and then in the mean
kind of undecided I started doing some
freelance development stuff and I
figured out i really like building
software and it actually ended up being
why i found it leave castle apps to have
a platform to build cool things that can
change the world but i also had a
parallel career so to speak in academics
i was an assistant professor at all boy
university and then i moved to namibia
for two years and I was an associate
professor at a technical university
there in Vinh took um where
also worked with mobile applications for
ya for all kinds of purposes but
essentially to build usable useful apps
in the Southern African context that
could help alleviate some of all the
problems and to develop various sectors
of the country and then recently as i
said i have i moved back to Denmark and
I went into more the startup scene
entrepreneurship because I realized that
this is actually where a lot of the most
innovative stuff happens and this is
where you really have an opportunity to
go out and build something that really
changes the way we think we do things
and as I said as an interaction designer
that's kind of been a path through it
all and I think Courtney said it really
well in the last talk I don't think we
should look at developers and designers
necessarily as separate people or
business developers for that sense I
think we all have a bit of an
interaction designer in ourselves not
trained not skilled necessarily but
don't exclude people from the process
because if you're building a product
with the team for sure you should have a
say in how to do it so who are you how
many developers designers back a few and
managers businesspeople products all
right that's a good mix so you
understand I guess what I'm talking
about um have you used any of the
fitness bands like the health tracker
stuff anybody who's used one okay what
about smartwatches not too many okay a
bit surprising at a developer conference
anybody tried out google glass or any
other smart glasses okay that's dad that
was expected so those of you who tried
it you'll know that it's quite a
different experience and I'll try to
give my own experiences from using it
later but it's really something you have
to try for yourself um so I don't know
what your expectations
our for this talk so if i don't know if
anybody wants to any particular things
that you're hoping to take away let me
ask do you expect to get the definitive
answer of how to develop and design for
wearable technology so it creates the
perfect user experience that will solve
all the world's problems okay well I'm
sorry we're not ready for that talk yet
as you will see we're actually quite
early in the in the face of wearables
but I will try and provide some
inspiration and give you some ideas and
hopefully you'll pick up some themes or
some concepts that you will have in mind
when you start when you first get into
developing or building wearable products
quick outline arm what are wearables
where do they fit in what is context we
talked about context all the time what
is it really and how can we think about
context when we talk about wearables and
even more important how can we leverage
it to create better user experiences and
I mean really using it and then I'm
going to talk a little bit about speech
because that's one of the new modalities
that is being really heavily pushed and
it's very ah particularly suited for
small wearable decisis that don't have
the same kind of interaction area for
touch interaction and hopefully I can
distill it all into some practical
take-home advice that you will remember
so if you only remember those things
that will be what you should need to
know and if you only remember one thing
it's all about context and i'll get to
that very soon so wearables um wearables
can be a lot of things and if you try
and find the definition on it online
it's actually quite hard and I think
it's if we look at this I don't know how
well it can be read and I'm not going to
go through all of this I just wanted to
show you that there is a lot of stuff
out there this is made by Beecham
research they publish this it's kind of
a map of
the application areas and what kind of
device is and what are the kind of the
main capabilities of these wearables so
you probably picked up the hype about
wearables right you think wow this is a
completely new thing this is amazing now
we finally have the technology well
wearables are not new at all I mean
Google glass technically in many ways
existed twenty years ago twenty-five
years this is from MIT I mean these are
some cool guys right this is how you
want to look when you walk around I mean
if you think Google glass look bulky or
in any ways you just got to realize how
much technologies i crammed into these
things I mean it's really impressive
engineering ah but these guys they
graduated from their PhDs they went out
to do amazing research and they actually
also ended out in the big companies
building a lot of these technologies and
that has enabled us to go from a
technology that was for really hard
court eggies to being open to everybody
who wants to use it so it's a it's an
opt-in thing nobody forces them on you
this is that Starner on the left and on
the right and he is now a professor at
Georgia Tech and he was us all to one of
the lead people on the Google glass
project so what has changed my why are
we talking about wearables now 2014
wearables why is this the big thing well
technology obviously a lot of things
that's happened hardware gets better
wireless networks get better ah mobile
software platforms are opening up for
developers really important for you guys
for us for me we get a lot of new SDKs
and then we have the cloud which we can
leverage to get a lot of how heavy-duty
processing done which we can't do on our
devices so now it's actually possible
and feasible to do a lot of these things
consumers have picked up smartphones it
come a way of life with social networks
and that has created this always on
culture where you're constantly kind of
tapping into these streams of
information and you expect
thing that you can book anything in the
world from your little device at any
given time so at any time anywhere we
expect that this can be done now and of
course the business ecosystem is there
as well so it in it makes it easy to
distribute applications and to make
money off of it so a lot of developers
now have an incentive to build cool
things for people so not to go in that
hole big chart I'm going to focus on
stuff that could be worn does the
wearable part it allows user interaction
a lot of these are more passive sensing
devices that has some sort of signal but
not what we would consider like real
user interaction and then even more
importantly it allows developers to
create and run software on them because
this is a developer conference so we
should talk about something that you can
actually go out and use in about 30
minutes after this talk so what's in the
market like this I would say is pretty
much the cream of the crop these are
like the top tier devices that are
available all the Android gears peple um
we got microsoft just released a a band
that pretty much looks like a watch and
has a lot of functionality as well we
got google glass we got recon
technologies they make some really
awesome i wear for especially for sports
and then we have the epson so these are
actually overlay glasses so their wares
Google glass is a peripheral view that
doesn't block out your vision these will
actually allow to go full-on in your
face so that's a little bit of a
difference um and of course Apple are so
they just announced Apple watch I just
want Lilly that I would like to do a
little pull this is the apple watch
edition I beautiful fashionable watch
you should never forget that wearables
will become a fashion item so I think
Apple they will probably be very
successful with this this is an 18 karat
gold watch um it has been guest we don't
know yet
how much this will cost when they
release it next year anything from
twelve hundred dollars up to about five
thousand dollars which is not that much
for a gold watch these days anyways you
can get a low-range Rolex probably in
that price range at around five thousand
but in two years this technology will
you be happy with that I mean it's
probably going to be outdated that's
what Apple does right um so that's kind
of to me that's a bit weird they will
probably sell a lot of them I don't know
is there anybody in here who's kind of
banking on getting one of these will
admit to it no okay well ah and and on
the other end of the scale this is a
small start-up in the UK called blocks
and they actually said well technology
is going to evolve so fast we let's
build a modular watch where you can
switch out the bits and pieces as you
like so if you're really into fitness
you can get really accurate fitness
tracking but if you just want whatever
else like GPS or you want some you want
a camera or you or you want a particular
screen so you can plug and play it so
that's kind of the other philosophy that
we might see in in the near future we
cannot talk about wearables without
going back and talking about the
evolution in computing especially
personal computing so if we go back in
the olden days as they would say we had
mainframes then we started getting
personal computers then came the web we
could do stuff then what's the mobile
revolution and now we're talking about
wearables but in the early 90s Mark
Weiser from Zurich spark and his team
they are working on what they called
ubiquitous computing or invisible
computing or calm computing which is the
last will it was a philosophy or is a
philosophy that has really affected the
research in mobile HCI and and within
the space a lot and the idea is that
instead of having these dedicated
devices that we go to devices will be
spread out everywhere we'll have all
kinds of interfaces and will you
seamlessly switch between them and
interact with them and they will move
into the background so you'll focus
the content and information or whatever
service you need to do but it will not
be about the device essentially you
shouldn't even be thinking about the
fact that you're doing a computing task
you should just do it and that is very
much one of the killer cases for
wearables because they that's one step
closer to that vision and we can't think
about wearables again without thing
about the ecosystem that they will be
used in because we all now will have
smart TVs we have our laptops
productivity devices they're not going
to go away I'm not going to be sitting
and doing programming on my android
watch anytime soon anyways so it will be
an interplay of all these devices so
that's something we need to keep in mind
when we think about the user experience
that will be designing for these things
another thought that you might want to
have is the intimacy of the technology
which is again reflects on this
development where we went from having
these stationary devices that we would
go to and walk away from to something
that we would carry around in our
pockets all the time to something that
we really carry on our body at all times
on our skin that we can feel and
vibrates and gives us signals to augment
abola even implantable I don't know if
anybody watches futurama there was a
pretty funny episode which was a play on
the iPhone but this was an iphone so
they actually installed the phone in the
eye and then you would have like a
projected screen that you could interact
with probably not going to happen within
the next couple of years but just
something to think about money talks
yeah should we believe in the hype about
wearables if you were to take a guess
what would you look at I think money
drives a lot of this so from a business
perspective what we see the same boom
than we've been seeing with smartphones
or maybe even see a bigger boom because
people already kind of bought into the
smartphone thing what are the key market
drivers like what are the things that
move so obviously health and fitness
tracking is a big one in the consumer
space um now you have to
think about is it worth it for our
company to get into wearables just now
like just after this top will you go
back to your company and say we should
get into wearables this is something I
would like you to think about at least
during this or after the talk because it
might be time which is what I'll be
getting at and this as a developer is it
worth it for me to sit down and learn
new api's and new ways of thinking or as
a designer to learn new interaction
paradigms is it something that's going
to upgrade my skills enough so
essentially is it time to go for
wearables if we look at this god no
report from august this year ah i don't
know if you're familiar with the hype
cycle or the hype kind of curve so as
you can see wearables is at the very
peak of what they call inflated
expectations thats hype right we believe
it can do everything solve all problems
but then we'll gradually learn that
maybe it doesn't fit in and there are
some limitations and we go through this
disillusionment and then we slowly go up
the slope of enlightenment until we
reach the plateau of productivity now
how fast this is going to go is
everybody's guess but right now the hype
is there I'm not going to go for all
these numbers essentially they believe
that there will be hundreds of millions
of wearables sold within the next couple
of years so and these are people who
make a lot of money thinking about these
things so they might be right I think so
here's a graph so you know it's true
what I'm saying it will go up more money
more value this is essentially just the
money revenue generated from selling
devices like the physical devices
there's a whole business ecosystem
around creating apps and services for it
or enriching your already existing apps
and services nine out of 10 smartphone
vendors have now entered the market of
the top lenders by 2015 they speculate
that the cost of the SmartWatch with
Android will be as low as 30 bucks
that's going to lower the bar for a lot
of the people who don't want to fork out
one hundred and fifty dollars
and lastly forty percent of consumer
wrist-worn devices in 2016 is predicted
to be smart watches this is from a
gardener recent Gardner report just
something to think about whatever you
company does of what you do military
have been using this for decades this is
not new they have heads up displays and
all kinds of wearables are a really
strong push is happening in medical and
emergency response because that's a
really busy environment where you need
real-time information in a reliable way
but still being out of your face when
you need to attend to the real world a
lot of stuff will happen in enterprise I
personally believe it's going to be a
bit opposite so a lot of tablets and
smart devices entered the enterprise
because people were using them at home
and getting used to them so it was easy
like bring your own device but this
might actually be opposite that for
instance glasses will be something that
your end enterprises will use them so
people get used to using them at work
and then they'll say hey I can see use
for this in my home life for for
instance health and fitness education
games or personal productivity which is
where our wrist-worn devices are great
your little personal assistant that just
reminds you all the time like a Google
now experience but on your wrist so you
don't even need to take your phone out
of the pocket but this will depend on
the value created can these devices
provide value they will be successful so
what are the killer apps think about it
during the talk and you'll probably know
in the end you'll know at least what are
the killer properties but the real
question is is it enough that it's just
a new device that can relay
notifications from my phone to my wrist
or to my eye but my peripheral view or
do we actually need to create some
completely new use cases that going to
be the killer thing um so I'm going to
be talking for the rest of the talk from
my own experiences from wearing Android
wear which I've been wearing since
Google i/o and from using
glass which I've been fortunate to use
on several occasions testing other
people's app I haven't actually build
any software for glass but my longest
use was four days and i really recommend
if you get your hands on them make sure
that you can borrow them for around
three days which is what it takes for
you to really get your head around what
it is so what is it like to wear like
what is it like to live life with
wearables these wearables this is taken
from glass while I'm driving so i'm
wearing two watches i mean only one of
them i'm actually using here I was just
testing navigation from the watch um my
first impression this was from glasses
people take notice because my wife and
my son everybody thinks it's interesting
so all of a sudden the world changes for
you because every normal situation
becomes something where people start to
behave awkward it's hands-free so you
start as a designer you start thinking
about Oh core developer you start
thinking about all kinds of cool things
where you could use this when you're
doing other things and maybe you just
want to look something up or you want to
ask Google something you just do it you
don't have to take out a device you just
you do it it's a very intimate and
personal this is from google glass I'm
reading I'm reading a story for my son
before bed I would never have been able
to take this picture in any way with any
of the devices that I had and it didn't
ruin the moment for me but it was like
it was just it's it's you can capture
some moments without actually snapping
out of the moment I can't explain it
that's why I say you really have to try
it for yourself and the last notice
sometimes this unison of two devices
become more than the two on their own
like and this is one of the strengths of
the Android wear platform is that a lot
of your existing apps on the phone they
will now have an extended kind of app on
the wearable so for instance in this
case if I star
the camera on my phone my watch will pop
up as a little card if I want to use a
remote trigger so I could put my phone
here and walk over there and take a
picture and then it will actually
preview on my watch how the picture
looks so if you add a dinner party for
people but you want a picture of all of
you that you can do this I know it's a
small thing it's just these are kind of
list thoughts that I had during the
using your usage but it comes at a cost
especially glass like where it's all
fine it's like wearing a watch and a lot
of people don't even notice but when
you're wearing where people look at you
weird and you probably read all the
stories but you get that kind of cyborg
look I had them on I went to a family
party birthday party and it's coming in
Denmark that you kind of walk around the
room and create everybody give them a
hug or whatever handshake how close you
are to him um and that was super awkward
for me and it really it I could really
see how far we are culturally or
socially form from from wearables or a
glass being out there in the public and
that's why it they've been banned in
several places for many places even like
public places cinemas and their
conversation starter obviously so it's a
real big question I think I didn't and
this goes back to what's the killer
application of wearables is do you want
to live in cyberspace or do you want to
live in meatspace this is the real world
this is what you dis is the human
experience this is the digital world now
I'm super addicted and I'm super super
excited about getting tech news really
fast and I want to stay updated on a lot
of things that has that's just something
I'm not ready to give up i'm not ready
to just throw away all my technology and
go out and live in the wild but I also
see how a lot of people in social
situations they end up sitting in their
devices and not engaging with the people
there I don't know if you ever tried
that at a party or something
suddenly you look around the table and
everybody's on their phone that I don't
think that happened ten years ago 15
years ago so can we go back can we get
more real life but still without
sacrificing the things that we love
about the digital world I think so this
is the new kind of mobile experiences
that I kind of want to allude to hear
these are the calm experience this is
where the technology kind of disappears
gives a better balance and let you focus
on what's immediate and need action so
essentially it's about getting in and
out of technology fast which is what
they could Google colored like micro
interactions instead of having these
long flows on your phone you just want
to go in all right I got a tweet from
Jana ok that's nice and now I'd see that
I'm done I can go on with my talk and of
course it's about combining the devices
so that you get the best experience with
whatever device makes sense for you in
that situation against situation is
context so it's all about context so
when you heard earlier if you win this
track that content is king if content is
king then context is God it is above it
is the most important thing to think
about for wearables but what is context
it's a fussy kind of thing like how do
we make it operational how can we think
about it especially as developers and
this is where it's actually quite a big
of a bit of a technological challenge to
use context but as a designer it's kind
of a simple thing to think about is like
if I know exactly what the user is doing
then show this like if the users running
show this screen if the user is not
running show this screen but how to get
to that stage so this is kind of the non
exhaustive map of context I actually
took this from my PhD thesis and I just
smack the guy in the middle because it's
all the same things still
it's about the user is he mobile what
what is he doing physically aah what
does his plans look like I can have a
look in his calendar he's supposed to be
at a meeting physiological things heart
rate respiration is he stressed or is
she nervous about the talk that she's
going to give social who's around what
kind of event is the person that
networks what kind of network is it a
good time to start streaming some video
to the phone location is one of the key
pieces of context because from that we
can infer a lot about the other things
time time of day the physical
environment what kind of lighting
settings we can adapt to that is it
evening night or during broad daylight
outside what about the device itself
like what is it doing what what is he
doing some kind of gestures
computational resources what else is
going on is this a good time to start
this heavy speech recognition algorithm
or should we just switch to a simpler
flow because we can now predict that the
time it will take to actually give an
answer is too long and it's going to
break the flow so we will will present
the best experience to the context
that's kind of what a meaning so that
when we talk about contextual or context
aware it's really about being smart
about using this information about this
fussy frame called context to create
something that makes sense to the
situation and it's a lot about being
proactive so sometimes you have to know
what the user wants to do before the
user knows herself and that is tricky
but that is powerful so you can think
about your app in terms of what's
important and relevant and and what are
there any feasible ways that you can
obtain this information in a timely and
reliable way when you're designing for
context so just a really classic example
is location so we have all heard of
location-based services
like this guy he comes to Berlin
suddenly all the trains don't run that's
kind of annoying ah so he so but maybe
the you can you can then say okay you
want to go to this restaurant but but I
can see that the trains are down so I
can read re route you to the trams of
the ubon or whatever or I can find
another restaurant for you with the same
kid seen that you were actually booked
for that is in walking distance it's
pretty far-fetched example so the role
of the phone so the phone doesn't
magically disappear and as a developer
you have to look at it as this will in
most cases for now be your main hub of
communication and contacts sensing and
processing and you will push this
information to and from the wearables
that the user is wearing so it's really
important as a developer for these
things is to think that you will also be
writing apps and services for the phone
from a UX point of view you can look at
it as either you're going to be
extending the phone experience so
actually making it smarter or more calm
or nicer for the user to do whatever he
was doing on the phone before in a new
and better way or you can do standalone
things like glass works stand alone so
you can write apps where you don't even
have to include any flows on the phone
of course there are some downsides it's
tricky it's really hard you will be
wrong like that you will assume
something about the user and it will not
be true it can be invasive people don't
like that all this information is being
sensed about them and what's it being
used for and it's sent to the cloud and
it comes back again like what's going on
and then this thing about being
proactive it's like you want to kind of
be a bit of aggressive and push things
that are useful and the user will love
you for it if you do it right but if you
have all the user too much it's going to
be a crappy experience so there's really
a trade of here and that kind of depends
on the accuracy of your of your
knowledge of the users context and then
its individual for different use cases
and different modalities and different
sources of information
and usually a specific model like speech
recognition for a medical setting will
have a different vocabulary than the
general purpose speech recognition for
searching on Google so you can make more
specific and better user experiences but
it all comes at a cost because it can be
really expensive to build these models
but good news for you because a lot of
this has been built into the new
versions of now I'm talking about the
Google platform with the new lollipop
coming out there's a lot of these things
are being made freely available to you
as a developer you can tap into this and
all the tricky parts are being handled
all the communication between the
devices the context sensing like you can
do activity sensing like if the user
starts running and you you created a
running app you can just kind of tap in
to say I want to be notified when the
user starts running and then you pop
your app or you can tap into speech and
tents so whenever the user deliberately
want to say ok Google how is my talk
doing that kind of question might
trigger an intent that you can subscribe
to and then you can launch your app on
the wearable and give the right
information briefly and then disappear
that fits the situation but it's as a
developer you get a lot of this for free
and it will be continuously evolved it's
like kind of a bit like the micro
service kind of thinking that Martin
Fowler was talking about this morning
it's these are independent modules that
you can subscribe to you don't have to
you or not they will be better and you
will get the benefit continuously and of
course cloud is going to do a lot of the
heavy heavy lifting so one of the key
things I took away from google i/o this
year was the world is the experience
again where do you want to lift or you
wanna this is kind of goes a bit into
the mindfulness kind of philosophy
that's that's been coming up in the
previous years it's like I want to live
my life I want I want to be here with
people and real things and
and persons and and enjoy nice food and
stuff I don't want to live in my device
but I still want to get my digital
information streams for instance I do
want to have those smart services that i
can use whenever i like it so this is
from the google i/o talk on wearable
design micro interactions is essentially
as you can see it's you don't have to
get out your phone get into the app read
the thing there's probably ten thousand
other things that's grabbing for you
attention and then you close it and put
it in your pocket and maybe a whole
minute past where as in I can just look
at my wrist and I can see a set of
interest maybe I act on it and I'm done
a key thing to think about as well is
less is more for wearable so it's a
different way of thinking about putting
content and information out to the users
you really don't want to overdo this
because it has to be glanceable it has
to be something that it can just be a
split second that the user interacts
with it and it he or she might not do
any more than just look at it and that
should still be enough so how does that
look for where well where the user
experience is really built on a stream
of cards that is sorted based on your
context so it pushes or serves the one
up that seems to be most relevant for
the situation so this is why you need to
be clever about the context so you can
insert your own cards when where and
when you find it fit so these cards hold
information they can trigger actions and
you can make it recognizable with their
certain design standards so you should
go to the the Android developer website
there is a really nice design guidelines
for where there's really good design
guidelines for glass as well so I'm not
going to even try to to go through all
of this i'm just gonna I'm just going to
send you there so you can check it out
on your own but there there are a few
very simple interactions that you can
base your you flow your experience
on long press short tap of course
swiping left and right up and down or
diagonal if you're so inclined and then
speech events or speech acts and then
there is a classic if you want to close
the app you just palm it you just close
it and the light sensor will block out
so it will know that you want to close
it but it's a small form factor so you
want to do big gestures you don't want
to have a lot of tiny little widgets
that you have to manipulate I mean you
have control on what you want to put
here but you have to fit it to the user
experience that fits the device so
here's just a brief example you get a
message you swipe ok I want to reply ah
then it's as you can speak so you can
say yes or no these are clues to what
the user can say in this situation or
you can tap them and then you can speech
so it actually does speech to text and
can send a reply so you can just talk to
your watch and it sends off the message
so you can this is a micro interaction
like really fast and you can be on your
way if we look at glass same concept
with the flow of cards they call it the
timeline so you have these cards that
you can see glass actually shuts off
very fast so it's not on all the time
that would drain the battery really fast
so you need to activate it if you need
it or it will kind of notify you if
there's some notification coming up so
you have several gestures you can
activate it by looking up like this you
can move your head around to scroll so
you know hands and they even have this
kind of beta feature where you can wink
to take a picture it's quite funny it
has like a training video so you have to
do it kind of slow but not too slow it's
kind of a little creepy wink like so
it's pretty obvious if somebody is
wearing glass and they're taking
pictures at you they either they're
really flirting with you or they're
definitely taking pictures so keep an
eye out for that if you're ever around
people of course voice and speech is a
really big
thing for glass as well and then there
is a touchpad here on the side so you
slide on the glasses back and forth
between the cards you can tab you can
long tap and you can close things so
it's it works really well you really
have to try it I can't if I can I can't
describe it so you can think about your
app in terms of notifications that you
pop into this stream and it will sit
there and the user can look at them and
scroll back and see what happened
earlier you can think of it as an
ongoing task like this example is a
timer you say start timer with a voice
intent or you press it in the in the
menu and then it's actually going to
stay active so you can keep track on the
time if you're cooking or whatever it's
really nice you're cooking and you can
see what if if you have dirty hands and
then they have these full-on immersions
this is like it's going to take over the
display and you can have an actual app
like a game or whatever you whatever you
feel like doing so you you got a lot of
control as a developer I'm going to talk
a bit about speech I've done some speech
work during my PhD back in the days and
I have to say it the technology even 10
years ago wasn't that impressive but it
has gone very impressive now so you
should really think about including
speech into your applications now for
mobile because I bet users will start to
expect it so you will be one of those
apps in the market that doesn't support
speech and people are going to be like
is what are these guys they don't know
about you know simple speech so think of
it it's like natural speak speech like
you just say it like you would say to a
person and it really recognizes quite
well now i have to say with a little um
what you call that disclaimer that I
have my apparently it works well with my
Danish accent of English I don't know
how it works with German or French or
any other accents if it's as accurate
but for certain this is something that
will only improve over time
and then you can further again power
this with contact so often you would say
something like save this or share that
or share this then the question is what
is this so this depends on the context
right maybe you're at maybe you are out
running and you you're running app it
has has some sort of geocaching features
or whatever and you think this is a good
spot so you want to save the spot then
save this should trigger saving the spot
where save this when you're looking at a
picture on a web of somebody sent you
whatever Instagram picture to glass I
don't even know if they have met but if
they do and you want to save it to your
phone then save it in that context means
save the picture not your location so
you have to think about this but that
means that you can have a better
recognition or you can have a better
seem like from the users perspective it
seems like it recognizes better so how
should you how you how would you do that
like how would how do we design for
speech like we're used to doing
wireframes and flow diagrams and a lot
of screens and and and like gestures and
stuff but speech is really like you
could take a block of wood and you stand
with it and now talk to it like you want
to make it do something how would you
say it but even better you can you can
pretend to be the block or the phone and
then you can have your usual users talk
to you to get an idea about what kind of
words what they use how would they
phrase it and again the app should adapt
to the users but with these things and
with context awareness people are smart
people are adapted so they will learn
what works and what doesn't work so well
so if they find out a particular way of
talking to it is better they will
probably adapt their own behavior a
little bit so that kind of saves you I
actually have a really terrible horror
story about speech recognition this was
back in 2006-2007 for this was for a
Microsoft mobile before a microsoft
phone and
I think I think we're running short but
you can you can hit me up after the talk
I'm more than happy to to share this if
you're into speech so to kind of sum it
all up I made a list of nine things and
as you know when it's in a list it's
true okay so these are the these are the
takeaway points that if you remember
these if you remember one thing it's all
about context if you remember nine
things these are the nine things
contextual use context as a key driver
for pushing the interaction make it
efficient in and out fast micro
interactions it's not something that you
should engage in for a long time it's
not a phone make it glanceable make sure
that your information is minimized and
quick to SS be proactive don't wait for
some this is this is all about giving
the user the right things at the right
time so ideally it would be a no
interaction interface whether it just
gives you the information you need when
you need it this is it it sounds really
tricky but I'm very confident that this
is the way it will be going and it will
actually work very well so think about
it's like Google now essentially focused
do one thing at a time don't try and do
it's a one one trick pony thing do your
thing get out it's done only the
essentials as we talked about and
non-intrusive like don't hassle the user
all the time don't send tons of
notifications if you don't need to only
the essentials be synergetic like use
the best parts of each device uses
strengths together and let the interplay
of devices create this interaction space
where you create something that is
better than each device on its own and
optimized so these things they have
limited battery life and they will have
a limited battery life for the
foreseeable future I don't haven't heard
of the they're actually some quite
interesting batteries going on in some
research labs but
I don't think it will hit consumer
market anytime soon so you're better off
as a developer really thinking about
minimizing your resource consumption a
few don'ts few things not to do don't
get stuck in all the interaction
paradigms don't eyes there's it's it's
not like if it works on the phone it
will work on the wearable you really
have to rethink it into this context for
being wearable don't copy the flow like
don't think because you have these five
screens and this is how the user is used
to it that's what you they want to do in
their wearable it's that's certainly not
going to be the case I probably in most
situations you're better off butchering
your perfect flow that you spend a long
time designing and implementing and
actually creating something that's even
simpler that just does a little bit and
if you really need a complex flow then
it's probably better to do it on the
phone and then you just need some kind
of trigger on the wearable to send you
to this flow and don't break the
behavior of the platform like people
will expect and learn that these watches
your work in a certain way so you
shouldn't go too far out of the
conventions for how to structure
information on a card things to do try
them out like get your hands on some see
what it is for you I mean the killer the
brilliant best thing for me is my
notifications I spend a lot less time
checking Facebook and Twitter and what
else and I can really just see what's of
interest and then I have kind of an idea
about you know oh now there's enough
stuff that I want to dive in and reply
to some of these things and then I would
usually do it from my phone or from my
laptop you can read emails on the watch
I mean I actually do that quite a bit
try out glass it's something else like I
really really recommend you get your
hands on some play with the API so if
your developer you can do it in the
emulator just download Android studio
fire it up and just see you know these
api such really powerful stuff and it's
so easy
I think your app into context so really
think about what context your app is
going to be used in but also think
context into your app like how can the
knowledge of the current context create
a better user experience and then of
course have fun this is exciting times
it's a whole new thing it's like back
when the iphone and android came out in
like 2007 whatever this is this is this
is a whole new space to explore there's
a lot of unanswered questions that's why
this is not going to be the definitive
guide this is like just we're just
getting started ah which brings me kind
of to one of my favorite quotes by Alan
Turing is like we can only see a short
distance ahead but we can see so much
there that needs to be done and that I
think is really true for wearables right
now we're at the cusp it's at the top of
the hype curve everybody's expecting it
to do all kind of things but us
developers and designers you will now
have a hand in defining how this is
going to be and how you can create these
great experiences so what more can you
ask for so thank you very much I'm happy
to take questions now i will upload i
did some extra research for the talk so
i'll try and kind of summarize that and
post it on the leaf gasps lap website so
it will be up at some point probably in
a week and remember to evaluate the app
the awesome app if you got it it's not
on wearables yet wouldn't it be nice if
you did all you had to do was just look
it knew the session was over rate the
app you're done anyways maybe next time
go ahead
yes that's wood so the question is would
you really use speech in a public
context so if you're sitting on the bus
if you're standing on the train in close
proximity to other people or if you're
sitting at the birthday party would you
really say ok Google take a picture or
ok Google when is my dentist appointment
and you might be looking to find the
glass thing or what it it's not it
doesn't seem natural so no in most cases
I would either move away or I would do
it with with another personally so it
doesn't work very well if every like
imagine all of you right now we're going
to vote on the talk using speech that
would be very interesting and very non
an anonymous like I could really see who
gave me bad ratings right so it's no it
their cert that's huge limitations for
the technology and specially speech is
it's ah what you call it's it kind of
bothers other people as well so you have
to take the social context into
consideration a lot a really good
question the iOS platform for the Apple
watch I no no I do I have any experience
with the Apple platform for wearables I
know I don't so and it'll be really
interesting to see how it's going to pan
out if you look if you if you looked at
the launch the keynote for the Apple
watch what I found really um interesting
is that it seems that Apple that the the
design was very much like a phone on
your wrist like you had to interact with
all these icons and do things whereas
the Google where was more about getting
out of your way and this much more
simplistic design as if you think back
to Android and iPhone it was completely
opposite that iphone was a sleek simple
design very intuitive and Google was
this more messy all kinds of setting
and you can change everything so I it's
a it's going to be very interesting to
see what kind of apps will come out for
that and it will certainly set the tone
for the wearables to come also remember
that the release cycle or the innovation
cycle for technology is now getting so
short that a lot of these big companies
they're going to be releasing maybe two
or three iterations of these products
every year so the iteration is going to
be really fast and the market is
certainly going to drive what kind of
thing so if people want wanted the way
that Apple did it expect a lot of people
to put those features into the next
iteration of their SmartWatch that's
yeah sorry I don't have any experience
with that platform I actually didn't
know that they had any particular things
out trick question Jana
for for both there's actually quite a
lot so what they did is they had
Explorer programs for glass where
companies signed up so they're actually
when they launched the kind of the first
public version that you could buy which
is the Lee Explorer version that was
quite a few apps available and same for
wear and its really exploding fast a lot
of people are just augmenting their
existing apps i hade we can really
easily provide notifications on the app
that make sense so it's anything from
cooking I'm not going to name drop a
whole lot of apps here but it's ranging
from cooking apps to travel apps to yeah
pretty much anything you can you can
imagine yes
so that's a very good question is what
happens when you lose connectivity so
one thing for certain is since a lot of
it is happening in the cloud and with
Google services you will lose a lot of
functionality I mean you can still tell
what time it is but you won't get your
Twitter notification if you're not
connected to the Internet so when I came
here on the train to Berlin it's very
expensive to Rome data when you're from
Denmark anyways so I suddenly I wasn't
getting it i was just when i was just
kind of you move into in and out of
Wi-Fi zones but i don't think about it
like i don't and that's probably a good
indication of how come it might be is
that I'm not anxious that I'm not
getting notifications on my watch I'm
still getting my SMS notifications
because they come to the phone and this
is it's just a Bluetooth connection so
it's still connected it can still do
things but glass can you can use them
they have a standalone thing but
anything that requires the internet
obvious obviously won't work
any other questions yeah in the back and
regarding a valley hello you think body
how we will be a valley be able to
survive the long time in the body will
be a future in itself that's a good
question battery power is going to be a
killer I mean it already is a bit of a
killer for glass because if you use it
very intensively I think it's only a
couple of hours that you get out of it I
mean these smart watches you have to
charge them every day that might be
better it's better on other watches that
are not as interactive and and the
screen is not as why Brenda or has less
features so to speak so you can have a
lower power consumption I pretty much
charged my smartphone every day I mean
I'm really i miss my old nokia phone
that i could have for six days without
charging it and i never really thought
about almost it would always catch me by
surprise that i was out of power but i
guess personally I have now just come to
expect that you have to charge your
devices ever so often but it's a it's a
really annoying thing about it and yeah
it will be really interesting to see how
they're going to sort it from a consumer
electronics point of view
else don't be shy and come and a score
yeah I'll be around thank you very much
