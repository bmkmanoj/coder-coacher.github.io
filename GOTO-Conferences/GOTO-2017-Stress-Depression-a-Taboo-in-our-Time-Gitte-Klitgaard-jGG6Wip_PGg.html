cats in here because I've been taught
that when you have to professional
speaking you need to have cats in your
pictures and it's the first time I had
used for grumpy cat so a little bit
about me so I'm a native wired on that's
my company name I have my own company
but that's also my twitter ID and be
warned you may have noticed that a lot
of my tweets up there and I do tweet a
lot my average is 42 streets a day since
I started in eleven so I do tweet a lot
I'm also an agile coach this is what we
do we run around and hug trees so I'm an
independent agile coach and have been
independent since 13 have been working
as natural coach since 10 so I go out in
companies and help them with different
things at the moment most of what I'm
working with is actually nothing to do
with agile it's about communication
helping people to actually listen to
each other listen to understand and not
listen to just respond so that's a lot
of what I do is communication and I do
retrospectives because what respectives
is the most important tool we have to
learn I'm also a conference speaker so
I've done this several times I started
out in 13 kind of like someone
challenged me so you have to be brave on
your arm
I will you do a talk about that and then
it kind of exploded so now I speak about
10 conferences a year and this is my
first official one in Denmark so I'm
really happy to be here I'm also a big
hugger I even have it on my business
card so I do offer free hugs to anyone
who wants it I have this about being
brave because in 2011 I started finding
out that I was ok and this is to remind
me everyday to be Who I am to have the
courage to be Who I am and I also do
talks about this variations from are you
brave enough to be agile into talking
about being brave and vulnerable and I'm
a pirate and an end I don't have any
kids of my own but I think my adopted
kids is like up to 30 now and part of
that is because I like to play and they
think I'm a pirate at least some of them
do
when my nephew turned 8 I had to tell
him I was not so I disappointed him a
bit I'm also a member of something
called inclusive collaboration so last
year one of the big women in in agile
gene Tabaka died and she worked a lot
about collaboration and how do we
actually bring humanity back in IT which
is a lot of what I worked with as well
my friend Sally Ann is artistic got
diagnosed recently and she does a
amazing talk on neuro diversity and we
have a lot of new diversity and part of
what I try to do is get workplaces where
we have room for everyone not just to be
nice but because we need all kinds of
brains and if you have a different brain
no matter if it's about being autistic
or if it about being another culture we
need all that but that also means that
we need workplaces where we have room
for everyone so that's why we started
inclusive collaboration so one of things
we did for instance at go to Berlin
there's a quiet room because a lot of
people who go to IT conferences are
introverts and all of a sudden they just
get enough of people so they can now go
into a quiet room where they don't need
to talk to anyone so that they can last
the whole conference instead of just
going home because it's too much so the
question is why am I here I'm here
because I suffer from depression I'm
here because my two big diagnosed
depressions was started by stress and
I'm here because I realized that nobody
talks about this so many people walk
around and going yeah I'm stressed I'm
stressed I'm stressed and usually those
people are just busy the people I'm
worried about are the ones when you tell
them you know what the first time I was
stressed it would be a good day if I
could get from my bed unto the sofa and
then when my boyfriend would come home
he would literally take me by the hand
and take me into the shower so I could
get a shower that's how bad it was the
first time I had stress and when I
talked to people about this every single
time I did this people started opening
up and I remember when I was in IBM this
one guy said to me you know what I
started crying in my office one day but
then I just went home and I was
the next day and I see this all the time
people having all these symptoms of
severe stress and not acting to it
because we need to just finish this one
thing or when you do the next thing I
was actually supposed to do a different
talk here so I signed up for a talk
about the use of your body the use of
your voice and four weeks ago I had to
call Diana and say you know what I don't
have the time and headspace for this if
this has been five years ago I just had
done it anyway and I would have put all
my energy into it and I would have been
totally beat so I'm getting better at it
but I have been home with stress twice
last time I was home for nine months and
then I started working three hours a
week and when my doctor told me to start
working three hours a week I was like
come on three hours a week until I
worked three hours the first time and I
was totally beat up and I had to rest
for several days but me I'm here to make
awareness about this awareness about
that mental diseases that we all have or
a lot of us have is not something bad I
read last year that about 25% of Danish
people feel uncomfortable working with
someone who has a mental diagnosis
whether it is depression or bipolar or
whatever and that's a little bit scary
because we have so many people with this
and it's not getting any less so we need
to tell about what is this actually how
can we help people how can we interact
with each other
so the interesting part is how the
stress show so that's that's kind of one
of the first questions I always get is
how distress show how do I know what
myself and how do I know with somebody
else that they're stressed and I have
the perfect agile answer it depends so I
think it's very individual so one of the
things I heard when when I was home
would stress so I got I was sent home in
July and I went to the Christmas party
at IBM and people like I don't
understand how you can be strapped you
had everything under control because
their perception was that when you get
stressed you start dropping things you
start dropping ball
there's something you don't get done
when I get stressed I will get
everything done until the day I drop
like literally dropped it I will not
stop and that's the way it works with me
and other people start getting confused
and forgetting things so that's the
really hard part about this is to find
the right signals so for me the hardest
part was like I realized in November I
had a really bad project in IBM where we
had to report to seven level of managers
and me being a scrum master I protected
the team so they didn't have to do all
this and I remember in November I was
thinking if this continues I will
literally die from this and I didn't
stop I didn't go on sick leave
until July and that was only because I
didn't have a project because you know I
just needed to pull myself together I
just needed to get a grip and I hear
this so often and the other part that
happened was I start forgetting people
have often told me that I have a like
really really scary memory now I only
have a really scary memory because I
lost a lot of my memory when I was sick
with stress when it was the worst it was
so bad that I had no short-term memory I
would always carry a piece of paper and
a pen around and like if I would be
sitting in the bus I would write things
down because otherwise I would forget it
and it's not like when somebody tells
you something yeah oh yeah all right I
literally couldn't remember that I ever
had that thought I would look at that
piece of paper and I had no idea I had
that thought I was meeting one of my
friends for coffee and of this guy and
he looked vaguely familiar I'm kind of
like yeah it must be someone I worked
with or someone I went to university
with so I did the graduation talk which
means that anyone who graduated that
year knows me and I know some of them
and then we were having coffee and also
an I realized I've been working
with this guy for two years I had no
recollection of him except a big memory
of his face and that's how it affects me
and the other part is this is how my
brain feels it's like the pieces in my
brain do not fit so when
I was home the first time my friend took
me to the doctor and I got
anti-depressive and all of a sudden my
brain started fitting together again
that's how it felt like all of a sudden
the pieces fit together and I thought
this was horrible
it was horrible kidding antidepressants
because that meant that I was so weak I
couldn't handle stuff myself so as soon
as I could I got off and just sloped
slowly into the person again which I
didn't realize until six years later
which is a little bit scary but when I
look back I can see all the signs and
what I realized now is I need
antidepressants to function not to be
happy I hate the Danish term look a
pillar which means happiness pills
doesn't make you happy it allows you to
function the problem we have in Denmark
and in a lot of other places is we give
them out too fast if you have a light or
a medium depression and it oppresses
will not help you but it's an easy
solution you've make a prescription
people go to the pharmacy it takes a lot
more time to actually sit with a doctor
or a therapist and and work on this but
that's what helped work for me the
second time I met with my doctor every
two weeks and had a two-hour
conversation with him because one of the
things I found out was that there are a
lot of stress coaches around and the
ones I met had one tool which doesn't
work with me like you have to stand in
front of the mirror and say that you are
perfect I tried that I'm kinda like okay
I'll do anything and I told him you know
what I feel like I'm lying to myself it
is you just said you need to try it more
and I'm kinda like in my head I just
went you I did this for five weeks
it's not gonna work but my dark oh and
you all said you have to get out of your
head
like what and what oh and then he said
yeah yeah you get into your body I'm
kind of what I'm in my body what are you
talking about and when I went to my
doctor he said you need to stop thinking
so much and you need to start feeling
your body so one thing he told me was go
home sit on a chair close your eyes
try to sense the chair try to feel how
it touches your legs try to feel how
your feet touch the ground if you have a
bathtub go into that move your legs feel
how the water touches your legs that
will help you get out of your head and
into your body because a lot of stress
is caused by our thinking and that we
think we have to do do-do-do all the
time so another thing that happens often
I also talked to people have anxiety if
this happens you get all these amazing
things about what you do and you get
that one thing and that's the one that
sticks so I think that science shows
that you need five positive things for
every negative thing but when you're in
this state it doesn't help that one
finger sticks and it keeps ticking and
that just makes it worse for you so
that's how I was feeling emotionally so
some of the links that I have is for an
Australian movie called I have a black
dog his name is depression and it shows
so well for a lot of people who don't
have depressions what it's like because
that's the thing people think they just
need to help you that they just need to
make you happy and that's not what it's
about
and so one of the things that makes me
realize people are like oh I'm so
depressed about this and I know you're
sad about it and that's different you
can actually be happy and depressed at
the same time it kind of puts this whale
of blackness all over you so one of the
things I've been thinking about is also
why do we see so much of this in
knowledge work we see this all the time
and it's getting worse and worse I see
so many people struggling with this um
oh and by the way I'm not a psychologist
this is just all my making up stuff what
I have and what most people in the
knowledge industry have is there's
always more work to do than we can
manage we can never get done there's
always more we can do that's one I used
to be a test and one of the frustrating
things what you was that you had to
choose
what to test because you couldn't test
everything down to the deepest detail
because then we would never get done
you can't document everything into the
smallest detail I've I know clients who
said the documentation should be so good
you can just take that documentation and
rewrite the code it's not worth it but
we kind of always have stuff to do and
we tend to do the stuff that's urgent
sometimes we do that stuff it's urgent
and important
other times we do the stuff that's
urgent and not important because we're
so busy we keep doing doing doing doing
and we forget to stop and do the stuff
that is not urgent but very important I
think another thing that is a damage is
that we like our jobs so I've done this
also under the title when love for your
work can kill you because I think that's
one of our big problems if you don't
like your job or if it's just an okay
job it's so much easier to take a sick
day but we mostly like our jobs most
people in knowledge work have a high
education we spend three maybe five
years getting in high education that
means we really care about this we made
a big effort we didn't just go in here
by accident so we bring a bit effort in
it and I think that's one of the
problems is we like what we do people
have been telling me sometimes
yeah but managers push us yeah but my
biggest enemies me I want to do so many
things I've learned now how to say no to
two things I don't want to do my next
step is to learn how to say no to stuff
I want to do so I was supposed to do a
workshop at go to Berlin and I just
calculated that so I'm in Potsdam at a
child testing days I can do my full-day
workshop on Monday on Tuesday I do my
talk that we haven't written yet and
then on Wednesday I can go into Berlin
and do my full-day workshop again and I
and I said to me no you can't I think
it's better if you cancel
but I so wanted to do this because I
think it's so important to help people
and I think that's one of our biggest
dangerous it's so hard for us and then I
think a lot of us suffer from the
impostor syndrome so I have another talk
about impostor syndrome imposter
syndrome is basically when we feel like
we are fake when we feel like one day
somebody's gonna come tap us on the
shoulder and say hey you don't belong
here for me it's like oh you're not
really a proper child coach because you
don't know systems fear and constrains
theory and I mean I can at least
pronounce can even but I don't know all
the details of it and I feel like my
basic tools is listening to people and
caring about them so maybe I'm not a
proper child coach until a year ago I
would always say I'm not a real coach
until I realized yes I do not have an
education as a real coach but that's
what I am I listen to people I put a
mirror up in front of them and I help
them see what they can do themselves so
I am a proper coach but we suffer so
much from this imposter syndrome and
what one of the things that is about
this imposter cinema's people work
really really hard because they don't
want anyone to find out that they're an
impostor they don't want anyone to
figure out that they're not good at what
they do
my friend told me that her university
professor who has been a university
professor for 40 years still thinks like
one day somebody's gonna come up and tap
me on the shoulder and saying John has
been a big mistake you actually not
suited for this job that's how bad it is
and I see it a lot in our industry we
don't have any tangible work I mean when
I was a tester I kind of missed being
doing some code because you can actually
see something it's even worse now so
most of what I do is I plant in the
seats in people I help them grow I have
to take more responsibility and often I
don't see the result of this sometimes
I'm lucky that somebody comes back to me
and says you know what that talk you did
or that retrospective helped me improve
but most of the time I don't know what
my work does we don't have any tangible
things we can do and that can also be
stressful because that makes it really
hard to see if we succeed and we don't
have any natural limits to our work a
carpenter has to be in his shop he
to go in there because that's where all
these tools are we never leave our
brains at work we always have our brain
with us and most of what we do is using
our brain when you do programming so
little of it is actually typing most of
it is thinking solving problems talking
to people we use our brains which means
that when we leave we don't leave our
tools and I think that's also why we get
stressed it's so hard to let it go it's
so hard to have techniques to let it go
and then last night I was asked a
question by organized photographer who's
running around here and he said why do
you think this is getting more and more
and I just realized that a lot of what
we do a lot of what we give value is
about doing we forgot the value of just
being we have to do it work but we also
do in our spare time yeah I'm doing a
marathon or I'm taking this or I'm a
volunteer I'm everything but when was
the last time you had a weekend where
you just wore well you just existed when
was the last time you had an hour awake
without a screen or a book or another
person to talk to
we keep activating we keep
yeah I do like Yoda I don't know what
that happened uh so we value this about
doing all the time and that's also
related to the imposter syndrome because
what happens is we get praised for doing
especially when we are smart we gets
praised little girls get praised when
they're small because they walk faster
and that means that they learn that they
are smart and that when they do when
they walk when they speak when they do
stuff that's when they get praised and
we do the same in school we do we do we
do we do that work we do we do we do
very few actually at what people for
being good team workers or for taking
care of other people I see that it's
starting in some areas I just went to
this tiny tiny school in England and saw
the ending before the school school
vacation and they actually had like
certificates so it's a tiny school of 30
people but they had a certificate for
the one who helped his school or his or
her schoolmates the most I kind of like
that because then they get emphasis on
helping but also on just being and those
one is like who do everyone always go to
so I think that if we focused more on
being and that we are okay and that's
what changed it for me is I found out
that I am okay just being me I don't
need to perform to be good enough I
didn't realize this until 2011 so I
spent most of my life trying to perform
trying to do the right thing trying to
get everyone else to praise me when I
was good enough the way I am but I
didn't realize that before 2011 I would
never ever laugh out loud I would be
dressed in grey or black and I would be
trying to hide in 2006 I had the goal in
IBM to speak up in my team and now I'd
be like yeah you want to talk me talking
front of 4,000 people tomorrow sure what
do you want me to talk about I've found
that Who I am is okay by being I'm okay
and that helps me not
as stressed I still I'm still bad at it
because there's so many things I want to
do and that's again we like our jobs we
like what we do and I think that's our
biggest danger so the question is what
can you do
so if you're stressed what can you do I
have some tips some of them I tried say
no this is hard and now it comes to even
harder part say no to stuff you already
agreed to do when you realize that you
were overbooked and when I mean
overbooked I don't mean that every
single time slot is filled and you also
work in the evenings I mean when every
single time slot is booked and you don't
have headspace to actually do stuff say
no and do it if you do it early people
are not gonna gonna take that out on you
if you do it the day before yes maybe
they might get angry but they will
understand but as soon as you feel like
hey this is too much
go back and saying you know what I know
I agreed to this but I can't is there
something else I can do for you or can I
do it later of course do it in a nice
way but start saying no this is my big
thing that I should do one day plan
preparation time so if you do a workshop
for instance or you have to do any kind
of presentation whether it's a code
review for instance or whatever plan
time to prepare this actually book time
in your calendar most of what I do is
talk to people I ought to talk to people
in meetings or I talk to people in the
hallway or I do a lot of my work
actually at the coffee machine
and if I don't book time to prepare my
workshops when I do that the time just
disappears because there's so much we
can do there's so many people we can
help there's so much so many problems to
solve so I do try to do this also if you
have to fill out some documents for
whatever go in and and and book that
time in your calendar and plan this
preparation time and relax your brain I
already talked about this about getting
more into your body but it's also about
relaxing your brain so one thing you can
do is meditation this is all something
that I'm going to do one day
I do it when I am with someone who does
a guided meditation and really helps me
meditation is about finding that space
between the thoughts being that space
where you are and not where you keep
thinking all the time and what you do
all the time and also mindfulness and I
see these two things that's very
different when meditation you go in and
you find this the space mindfulness is
more about being aware of all the things
around you when you eat something
actually taste what you're eating so I I
am a consultant I travel a lot and in
the beginning I would always eat either
with a computer or a book in front of me
and I still do that some some days I'm
just like whatever I did something to
eat but other days I'll go into a
restaurant I'll read my book until the
food comes and then I'll put it away and
I will actually look at the food and
taste the food and we don't do this
often enough I will go out into the sand
and feel it between my toes I will be
aware of the wind like I went to the
Isle of Skye and you kind of stand at
the end of the world and you stand there
and the winds of the Atlantic just flows
into your both body that's amazing and
that helps us get out of our brain you
can do exercise if you are very stressed
exercise not good for you same as if
you're very depressed but exercise is
good for you and exercise is good for
you also to prevent this a lot of my
friends say that running is like
meditation it actually helps them get
out of the head I think running is
horrible I hated every minute people
like yeah but you just need to try now
I'm playing I tried it for six months
and they're like oh but doesn't feel
good when you're after what yes because
I'm not running I never really got that
one as high I don't I don't get it and
also a lot of my meal yeah but then you
have this competition with yourself when
you get better every time and I don't
care some of my friends like always run
on um what's got on a meal because then
they can see how much better they get
really care but what I do do is I like
rowing I like a rowing machine and I now
have the water rower and it actually
sounds like proper water when you row it
sounds like rowing in water and you
don't have to go outside and it's pretty
but I kind of get into this meditative
state where I just go into just doing
and doing and doing it's it's nice it's
my friend Toby he does ultra so last
year he won the 200 mile run in Sweden
he's a little bit nuts but he's also a
really good friend and some of things he
also says is that when you do ultras and
when you run that's very much about how
we work as well nobody goes out and
doesn't merit well not nobody most
people don't go out and do a marathon
and then doing one the next day I read
about this woman who actually just won
every day but most people don't when he
came back for than 200 mile run he
couldn't stand he had to crawl to the
bathroom the first day and he does it
again but you rest afterwards for to to
be able to run you need or do any kind
of exercise properly you need nutrition
you need rest and you need exercise you
need to practice we need to do the same
for our brain we need nutrition which
can be going to a talk it can be reading
a book it can be listening to a
beautiful piece of music we need
exercise we need to exercise our brain
otherwise it's going to deteriorate and
it will as we get all the periods and we
can help some of it by keeping it active
and then you need to rest and we often
forget that part
and I think part of it is because it's
not visible if I broke my leg I would be
careful the whole time because I would
know that okay now I need to wear my
crutches and people would also be aware
of what they could do to help me we take
that so much more serious anything is
Allegro's back together and I think six
more weeks or something like that it
takes a lot longer for the
rest of us for our brain but we tend to
just look at that it's just yeah oh and
this is the interesting thing
asking for help and that's I mean in
many ways so when I do a proper scrum
and teach that we talk about the treat
questions and then one that people have
the most problems with is do you have
any impediments because we don't like to
ask for help because we are afraid that
if we ask to help for help that means
we're not good enough a lot of people
suck at asking for help what I'm
practicing is asking for help when I
don't totally need it I'm really good at
asking for a black if I need to put up a
a painting in my house or whatever I
call my brother because I can't do any
of that but like even having somebody
say you know what should I carry your
suitcase because you've been carrying a
wall that is so hard for me because I
can carry my own suitcase but sometimes
accepting that help or asking for it
before it's necessary can be really good
for you the first times I had to cancel
something I actually used Toby on so I
had to cancel for the booster because I
realized that I was too stressed to do
that talk and I called him I said I need
you to give me permission to actually
cancel my talk because I was not able to
give myself permission and of course the
better thing would be if I could get
myself permission but I couldn't so I
used him to help me and he gave me
permission and I cancelled and they had
plenty of time to find a new speaker but
that's one thing you can do and I also
have some of my friends one our home
address would use me this way who kind
of asked me to give them permission to
not do anything that day because we find
it so hard to give ourselves that
permission so ask for help and take that
help and take time off that's also
sudden people go like oh so you're a
consultant because you want to be rich
no I'm a consultant because I want to be
free I took four months off this year
and part of me goes a little bit like
whose am I going to get a job
what about the next thing what if I take
all this time off are people gonna
forget me and then my wise friend again
goes when was the last time you got
someone contact you without looking for
a job all a week ago when was the last
time before that the week before do you
think people are going to forget you
know take time off even try taking a
weekend off so many of us don't take
weekends off and I know it's hard if you
have kids for instance or if you have a
spouse or whatever but try and find
these small pieces that way you can take
time off and to me I'm kind of like the
worst thing that can happen is I don't
get a job well I'll sell my apartment
I'll move in with someone whatever
doesn't matter it's just money the other
part is my life the other is me and
that's what's so much more than just
money another question I get very often
so how do I help others I'll start with
a lot of domes never ever say pull
yourself together don't worry we're
doing that ourselves when you are
stressed and when you feel bad you will
be saying this to yourself
many people are worse afternoo that's
true there are people who don't get food
every day but the problem with saying
these things is we go into this vicious
circle of them starting to blame
ourselves and then we get more stressed
and we feel like it's all our fault
or you have no reason to be depressed /
stressed you have a good life
yeah that's not what it's about it's not
like you can say logically okay you have
a job you have a husband you have two
kids now you're happy that's not how it
works it has nothing to do with that it
has something to do with the way we act
the way we perceive the world and how we
treat this and never ever ever say it's
all in your head because yes it is
that's the problem
like I said if I broke my arm it would
be so much easier but this is all in my
head and somehow we don't take that
serious and if you tell someone you know
what it's all in your head you can just
pull yourself together we will start
doing that yeah I should just pull
myself together I should just do these
things
don't ignore them I think we tend to do
this so that's a really good book called
time to think and one of the things they
mention in there is when somebody cries
in front of you we try to stop them as
soon as possible because we feel very
very uncomfortable when people cry in
front of us well maybe you should just
let them cry maybe you should just let
them get it out try listening to them
but we tend to kind of like like my
sister called me she's like there's this
guy and he's coming back from work from
from being a stress sick for six months
I don't know what to do what am I
supposed to do because I don't want to
to kind of push him into the to distress
again so what do I do
my best advice is asked them what do you
need if you need an ear I'm here if you
need something else let's find out but
don't ignore them oh and try not to be
what we call Danish Lomas cheek we'll
try not to get unfunded advice the
things that I've been talking about the
stuff that helped me and help some of my
friends but people tend to you know what
if you just take this pill or whatever
you will be happy if you just do this
you will be bah blah try not to give
this unfunded advice because it's not
helpful and none of us are experts so if
it's really bad take him to a doctor
that's one thing you can do that's one
thing that my friend did the first time
she literally took me by the hand and
took me to the doctor and that is very
necessary it's actually so that the
highest reason for men between 18 and 35
in United Kingdom to go to the doctor
exactly stress and these are the men
that go we should show so we should show
last year in Denmark that that's one of
the reasons men die earlier there was
this story about a guy he would go into
the locker room and eat lunch because he
was afraid somebody would ask him how
are you and he didn't want to lie we
trained our boys to not cry
boys don't cry don't be weak so actually
a lot of men suffer from this a lot more
than women because yeah since we're the
weak sexed we know we have to ask for
help men are not supposed to which means
that they keep it inside until they die
it's one of the reasons the rate of
suicide is higher among men and also the
way people try to commit suicide is
different women usually do it so that
they survive and because it's a cry for
help
men are usually much better at
committing suicide which is really bad
so also consider this offer your help
subtle go to that person and say you
know what I see you've been struggling
is - anything I can do for you you want
to go for a cup of coffee talk to people
listen I don't know where I got this
term but grow your ears and open your
heart we tend to want to solve things
some people say yeah men always try to
solve problems I don't think it's about
men I think it's also about that we are
engineers and computer scientists that's
what we do we solve problems like
Jessica treated yesterday one of my
quotes is the hardest thing of being an
adult coach is to keep your mouth shut
so many things I just want to say if you
just do this it would help you and
sometimes I'm right and sometimes I'm
not but I help people more if I listen
if people are stressed if you got
oppressed you help them more by listen
by caring for them and tell them to go
to a professional because we all know
all these things we can't I mean we
don't even know all the things in our
areas how are we supposed to know
everything psychology how are we
supposed to know what helps this one
person so if it's really bad tell them
to go to a professional ah sorry that
was accent me
and respect what they feel a little bit
back to the oh you don't have any reason
to be depressed or stressed or whatever
respect that people actually feel this
way because we do not read minds we do
not know how it feels to be inside
another person when I go out and do a
talk with Toby Toby on he is terrified
every single time even if he's done tons
of talks he's terrified every time I'm
totally relaxed I just feel at ease but
you can't tell you can't tell which one
of us is stressed you can't tell what's
going on inside people it's the same as
when people go oh I thought you want an
introvert because you like to go to
parties that's not what it's about
we don't know what's going on inside
people and we have no rights judge it so
respect what people feel and include
them because if we don't include people
if we keep them out to not stress them
what happens is they'll feel more
outside and I would even make it worse
and then one of the most importantly
actually care about people doesn't mean
you need to go around hugging them
though I would always offer that but
that's because I like to hug you should
never hug anyone who doesn't want to
because that's a violation but do care
about people even if it's just bringing
them I keep talking about the coffee but
bring a cup of coffee or a cup of tea
saying can I help you with something but
care about people and especially working
in teams we do need to care about each
other we work so closely together we
need to care so about including people
this is your so you probably all know
your ass'll deal he's so sad always he
is really sad but his friends always
include him they always ask him do you
want to join this do you want to join
that there's a time when he has his
birthday and I think people forgot him
and he's really sad but then people come
and they bring him gifts in Hibbing him
a cake and he's almost happy just for a
moment so even if people cannot take
place on the terms that you want them to
ask them try to include them I have a
friend who's bipolar which was also
activated by stress when I had my 40
birthday I called him and said would you
like to go to my birthday I know you
feel uncomfortable with a lot of people
around so it's okay if you don't I gave
him the option to be in or not and we
ended up going out for tea a day instead
because he feels so uncomfortable when
there are lots of people around make
space for people to be who they are and
we also need to do that in a workplace I
did talk earlier in England this year
about being human and professional which
somehow seems to be mutually exclusive
we are supposed to be professionals when
I got my hair dyed blue people go like
oh how are you gonna get a job but that
point I was working at Legos are kind of
wait duh I'm working at Lego when I got
my first to to people like oh oh but
you're never going to work in a bla bla
well if you were kind of hand light with
the - I'm not gonna work there anyway
because they're probably gonna put me
into this mold where I don't fit we
spend so much time being professional
putting on a mask putting on a facade
and that energy could be used to work to
take care of ourselves why can't we just
be who we are why do we need to fit into
this and of course you need to do this
with respect if you meet the a Bernese
business people you should wear a suit
you should show respect for them but why
do we think we always have to dress the
same way at the moment I'm working at
Spotify and they they talk about oh yeah
we don't have a dress code which is not
really true because if you come in in a
suit or a shirt they'll be like are you
going for job interview so even in
places where we don't have an official
dress code we do we have this cultural
thing that tries to put people into a
mold because that's what we like it's so
much easier if you would just fit in
be nice and logical if we know how
people act so many people want a recipe
for a child but it doesn't work because
we're dealing with humans humans are
messy humans are complex each individual
is an individual we have different needs
we have different ways of acting but we
try to put it into the same in my
ultimate team that I had high-performing
team yes I've seen one we had this alpha
geek and I've never seen a guy who could
do so much amazing stuff and usually we
would have to rule that anyone everyone
has to speak in a retrospective except
him because we knew that if he had
something he would do it we also did for
our daily we would take turns in doing
the dailies and we would have to print
out the burndown child every day so we
had it visible and my neighbor says turn
one of us did it we made room for him
because we valued him as a person and I
tried making meeting people years later
said oh you worked with him he never
says anything and I'm kind of kidding me
we had so many times where he talked
about we had a board game club we talked
about solar eclipses he travels for
solar eclipses how can you say he
doesn't talk but he felt so comfortable
with us because he was allowed to be who
he was and I think that's also something
that can help us with this stress if we
are allowed to be who we are and of
course there are I mean their frames you
can't just get anything the way you want
you need to figure out how does it work
in your team on your area but if we stay
in too many places where we do damage to
ourselves we are going to get stressed
so my stress nowadays is because I
cannot say no to all the magical amazing
things that out there it's not because
there's so many constraints on me
actually it's a minister because there's
too few constraints on me so I can do
anything I want in the whole world I
just need to start prioritizing so I
think if I live to be a hundred and
ninety I still would have read all the
books I want to read I still would have
gone to all the conferences I want to go
to still when I met all the people I
want to and that's so annoying
and that stresses me out sometimes but
I'm also getting much much better at
that I did a talk in Helsinki this year
and I was gonna like us my first time in
Helsinki and I decided to space spend
the whole Saturday in my bed instead
because I was so exhausted after doing
my talk and yes I missed out on Helsinki
and yes I may never come back but that's
okay I try to enjoy the things that I do
have I try to enjoy when I can go
somewhere and see something sometimes we
need to miss out on all the cool stuff
to take care of ourselves and yes it is
annoying so wrap up ask for help I think
this is the most important thing whether
you are feeling stressed or you see
someone feeling stressed ask for help
maybe if you see someone who's really
stressed and you are not connected
enough to that person ask for help to go
to that manager go to someone you know
who's good at talking to people that's
one of the problems with being in IT is
we learn a lot of technical skills but
nobody teaches how to talk to each other
and most definitely nobody teaches how
to listen to each other I do I don't
have you heard about coding dojo so I do
coaching videos I do listening dojos
because we forget how to listen to each
other so try doing that try talking to
each other I you say if you would just
talk to each other listen to each other
I wouldn't have anything to do because
that's half of what I do I help teams
actually talk to each other and listen
to each other and figure out that they
are different and how do they work
together I help them realize that yes
maybe we should talk to us they called
us if we're late we should talk to our
stakeholders most of what I do is about
helping and talking and if we would just
do this much more I think we would avoid
a lot of the stress that we have and
please care for each other because
there's no one else to do it you need to
care for yourself first and sometimes
you're not able to but try to care for
yourself
to take that time off it's just money
you can't eat money you can take it into
your grave but it's not gonna help you
you have to value your life and you have
to value the damage before you get all
the damages I am damaged I can see my
memory has severe loss and it's not just
because I'm getting older Bhalla memory
does have severe loss after being stress
having stressed twice and that's just
something I need to live with I have
brain damage it might be small brain
damage but it is brain damage and that's
what happens we get heart attacks we die
we get brain damage we get physical
diseases
one of my friend her like all of a
sudden started swarming up like she
looked like had elephant legs turned out
it was stress your body will do whatever
it takes to get your attention and it's
not logical so take care of yourself
thank you very much
oh and if you don't feel comfortable
asking questions here my information is
also here I am always up for talk I'm
also up to help you so please contact me
we can have a Skype session whatever so
please stay in touch thank you very much
um I have questions in this well
actually I have a lot of prices in this
app for you of course but I also have
questions I will start with how can we
forget about work problems when we get
home ah well I'm not sure we always can
I think that's the hard part
some people make rituals I know one
friend he actually has this tree outside
and he kind of mentally goes home and
puts it there before he enters the door
one thing that I do sometimes I do a
brain dump where I just have a piece of
paper and I write down everything that's
in my brain that kind of somehow knowing
that some paper even though I know from
experience I'm never going to look at
that again it helps that can be one way
of getting it out of your head but I
think you need to find your own
techniques because different things help
for different people some people like I
said do the running and they say it
helps make their head clearer and they
can just move on
one of my friends likes to commute
because yes in our home and she just
puts on nice music and when she gets
home she's let go of all the work uh so
those are different techniques but I
don't think that's one technique for all
and some of us really really suck at
letting it go including me thank you
another question
how would you as a manager handle people
who you suspect to be stressed or
depressed well first of all I would talk
to them I think that's one thing we
often forget same as when people go like
how do I make my team do this well ask
them talk to them take that person and
go for coffee a good finger friends be
to take them for lunch outside the
building sometimes when you go outside
the building it makes it so much easier
to talk about things and by doing food
which is a good pattern
by doing food your brain tells you that
you're connected somehow and that may
help that person open up to you and then
take the time to listen and if you feel
uncomfortable if you're not really a
people person talk to someone who is and
ask them to talk to this person but
figure out what's going on and be aware
that a lot of people are not aware how
stressed they are and they're not aware
of the signals so be concrete like if
you see I'm worried about you because I
see you sending emails every evening at
around ten eleven maybe they'll tell you
you know what it's because so I can go
home a tree I can pick up my kid and
then I take an hour and evening that's
okay but maybe it's because yeah I keep
thinking about this and I do this so so
listen for those signals and then ask
how you can help them find out what they
can do maybe they need to take one day
off and that's okay and we need to make
room for that but talk to them and
figure out what's going on because like
I said it's so different from us what we
need to do and stuff that works for one
person definitely doesn't work for
another questions from the audience so
thank you once more for you talk thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
