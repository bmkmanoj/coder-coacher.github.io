technical lead of the build
infrastructure team at Twitter I'm an
engineer I've been an engineering
manager of being a technical lead on
several teams at Twitter and various
other companies before that and I'm
going to talk to you today about scaling
engineering teams I will draw from my
experiences working at large tech
companies like Twitter large financial
institutions I've worked at Australian
banks I've also worked at startups
I'll draw experiences from there and I'm
also advising several startups currently
I'd like to talk to you about scaling
and engineering teams with team sizes
that vary with company sizes that vary
before I get started I've been asked to
point out and don't forget to get the
app - in order to rate this session or
any previous sessions that you attended
all right
let's start with an overview so you know
what you're in for
for the next half an hour so I'm going
to talk about fundamentally engineering
teams and the growth phases that they
can go through and the inflection points
that these growth phases show when
they're changing or how you can actually
manage them some of the phases that I've
defined as our four in order number one
speed number 2 stability number 3
quality number 4 growth and then beyond
I'll go into more detail with each one
as we go forward as a goal for this talk
I'd like to propose a system for
expanding teams you all came out here to
this talk to learn about scaling teams
which I'm assuming you care about doing
just that and that's why you came here
before I get started I'd like to get a
sense of who's my audience if the
engineers in the audience could raise
their hands great
managers great that kind of was a good
split there maybe I should have done
engineers and non engineers there but it
makes sense for any engineer to be
thorough with this it makes sense for
any engineering leader whether you're
tech lead to be thorough with this or a
manager I feel like it has scope for
improving the efficiency of the jobs
that you're doing always and the
ultimate goal here is for you to reduce
waste or churn whether that's in terms
of employees or the work that you're
doing the code that you're writing and
to increasing efficiency engineering
teams let's get started with that
I have a few questions up here have you
ever watched your best engineer and the
team turn into your weakest link
have you seen key team members get
constantly sidetracked by trivial tasks
or a critical tasks but their time
draining tasks every engineering manager
has felt some of these have you ever
worked with the team that's kicking ass
only from to hear from the external
teams but they don't know what's going
on and why they're having trouble
delivering on the goals that they set
out to do I don't know of any company or
any team that hasn't experienced this at
any stage of their growth what all these
questions have in common is simple
you're overwhelmed because everything
appears to be on fire you're worried
about that things may be on fire or
people are telling you that they're on
fire because you're getting feedback
from external teams and you want to put
out the fire so but it's all not not all
bad news there's some good news even
great news here these are all these
fires that you see up as questions
they're all symptoms of inflection
points symptoms of changes that are
happening and you're missing out on
picking those changes up before I even
get into what customer expectations are
I would like to
go through a definition of engineering
excellence that I think is very
important for every team that is an
engineering team whether you are
providing a good training model for your
employees when you're hiring people
what's your recruiting pipeline like
what's your interview process like when
you hire them are you just throwing them
into the job are you actually giving
them any kind of training mentorship
it's not just the first week that
they're on the job and they should do
the new hire orientation what happens
three months down the lines what happens
six months down the line are you setting
up any systems for open and honest
conversations no matter what size of a
team you are what size of a company you
are whether you are daily one-on-ones or
weekly ones or there are stand-ups what
kind of conversations can arise from
these are you providing tools for your
team for them to measure their success
it's very important for engineers to
feel like they achieved something at the
end of the day some can feel that when
they send out a few pull requests in a
day some can feel that when they wrote a
good piece of documentation around
system that they had written awhile ago
whatever that measurement of success is
whatever that metric is are you
providing that kind of a system for
engineers to be able to evaluate
themselves are you setting expectations
consistently and constantly if I don't
know what I'm working towards as an
engineer it's very hard for me to define
my success and as half of your engineers
in this almost half in this group you'll
probably empathize with this very
strongly now I've talked about stages
and inflection points let's go into a
bit more depth here when I say these are
the stages it doesn't always mean the
team size it doesn't always mean that
company size it means what are the signs
that you're seeing at each stage my aim
through this talk is for you guys to be
able to identify or recognize when
you're in that specific stage and how
you should act or be able to transition
into the next stage or
but make that choice deliberately and
not be in a turn of the warning signs
that you see for each stage go through
stage one speed this is very relevant to
startups very relevant to teams that
have just started it could be new teams
within an existing organization - I
think this back to the time when I was
in a startup it was a 12-person startup
I was one of the first few employees we
were building a real-time search engine
based off of Twitter data and we had no
policy no procedure no day-to-day
management it was six or seven engineers
we were sitting right next to each other
building the same thing we had a North
Star guiding us and we were working
towards it so there wasn't any need to
do daily stand-ups we were talking to
each other constantly this kind of a
situation is definitely the stage when
you're in that making mistakes phase and
you are allowed to make mistakes because
you can fix them very quickly your
day-to-day job is coding learning course
correcting and then repeating that all
over again your single most important
metric at that time is definitely on the
side of code how much code are you
producing every day you might be
throwing lots of it you might be writing
lots of it but it's definitely the stage
where you're in the pre product market
fit stage where you don't have a product
out there you don't know what's going to
be successful so you need to be agile
and nimble enough to be working towards
it very quickly and producing things
quickly fairly quickly for you to test
out what actually works and what doesn't
so team composition at this stage it
generally you'll see is mostly made up
of prototypers or entrepreneurial types
people who don't need a lot of structure
around what they're working on they
don't need a lot of direction they're
ready to make mistakes they're ready to
fail at things and restart all over
again so very different kind of a
mindset there I've seen mostly senior
engineer
trip up at this kind of a stage because
they want to produce quality code right
away great documentation they want to
have a architecture diagram around the
design but this is a stage when you're
making mistakes and to what is quality
at this stage when you don't have
customers how do you define quality so
this is definitely the stage where
you're hiring for culture fit because
you're all in the boat together I'm
thinking back to the time when I was in
the startup you're all in a boat
together you need to be in the same on
the same page about whether it's a right
boat or not and you don't want pesky
questions like should I plug this leak
right now or should I you know go ahead
and write documentation for the next two
days should I design this diagram for
everyone to understand things you don't
have time for those kind of things so
what you have time for is to build
things quickly to fail at them fast and
learn from it and then build them again
I want to a source that from Twitter
recently and I thought it was a good way
to show the combinatorial explosion that
happens when you add more people to
teams just going from 3 to 4 people
doubles and number of lines of
communication that you have again
whether you're in a start-up or a big
corporation doesn't matter but if you
look at that diagram you see how adding
more people to a team increases the
lines of community
communication tremendously which means
the things that worked when you were 3
people are not going to definitely work
when you're 10 people it's going to be
very hard to do the same things whether
there were daily stand-ups that you
needed to introduce or whether there
were some other forms of communications
weekly team briefings they might not
work at every stage the same way how do
you stay on top of that to make sure
that you're addressing each stage
properly their stage one warning signs
so these are more like you're you're a
team of few developers you're in sync
with everything that's happening you
just know what's happening through just
osmosis because
you're right next to each other you're
doing alleyway conversations you're
tapping people on their shoulders this
is when a doer turns into a weakest link
when you start seeing signs of people
getting stride a side tracked by
critical but disruptive tasks before you
had time to spend days on the same same
tasks now you're getting constantly
disrupted disrupted by important things
but they're just restrictive to the work
that you're doing when the team's
ability to deliver is being questioned
suddenly you have people asking from
outside the team or above the team and
the management what exactly are you
working on and where are things taking
so long this is when you know that
you're kind of entering stage two it's
important to know that each of these
stages you might choose to stay there as
you are but as long as you made that
decision we as when I was in the startup
we were in the stage one I think for
almost a year because that's what we
chose to do we did not have the
bandwidth or the ability to go to stage
two because our product wasn't out there
yet so we needed to be very agile and
quick in what we were working on so
stage two though gets to the more
stability phase where you now have more
formal lines of communication you might
have stand-up so you might have status
updates team debriefings I remember at
the time when I joined Twitter we had
about 600 employees and we were still
functioning as a startup about a year
into working at Twitter we started doing
these weekly meetings with the CEO it
sounds sounds like a lot of overhead but
it is what was required at this at that
time to make sure that every team every
organization at Twitter was functioning
at its best so you figure out what you
need to do at that stage that you're at
and before that there was no harness
like that there was no one asking us
from the executive team what exactly
you're working on but suddenly it became
a thing where every week I was in
audience with the CEO telling them what
my team was
hang on so team composition at this
stage shifts a little you get from
prototypers to more people who are
specialists it could be your existing
team members that become specialists in
certain areas that you're working on
people find what they're passionate
about they're changing they might be
looking at changing teams or roles you
now maybe get to a type of system where
you have a suite of applications and
data multiple services or is the same
application with multiple features
so there's definitely complexity
addition there and at this stage you're
definitely hiring for a culture ad
because a culture that you set up as a
foundation when you were in stage one is
now being added to as you're hiring more
people as you're growing your team size
the quality so so moving on from that to
stage three you suddenly now have
multiple departments this is more the
stage where one team is being split into
several teams
you definitely have words thrown about
like kpi's and SL A's you're being
judged on your success through these
KPIs and whether that you're achieving
them or not your products are increasing
definitely and you might have multiple
Suites of applications and data you've
definitely at this stage moved from a
collection of individuals to a
collection of teams and also going back
to the same way communication was
happening before now it's more of a push
and pull form so you're giving the
information to the people who need it as
they need it this is definitely the
stage which is more qualitative driven
this is where you will probably see your
engineering velocity slowing down and
it's a good thing at that time you're
you're sacrificing speed over quality
because you want long-term stability
you're at the stage where your product
is probably out there in the market it's
being used by real people
and you don't want to be you cannot be
in that same position as you were in
your stage one into where you were
breaking things and moving fast at this
stage you definitely need the more
senior engineers who are looking at
longer term stability of the system who
are designing the system from ground up
they might be having design
conversations that didn't happen earlier
things like you might start hearing
things like that's not my job
these are words that you probably feared
hearing in stages one and two you do not
want your engineers in a startup telling
you that's not my job I'm not going to
do that because you kind of need to be
very agile at that time but this is a
good sign saying that's not my job at
this stage is actually a good thing it
means that hey I have my swimlane this
is where I'm swimming towards I have my
goal and you're asking me to do
something that is outside of my swimlane
it means i'm focused at what i'm doing
so I've hired the right people to do
their job because at this stage you
definitely need the domain expertise you
don't want them switching from one task
to another because you want to be
delivering quality products so at this
stage you're definitely hiring domain
experts you're definitely hiring people
who who know how to stay focused on a
job who know how to deliver quality code
whether that's in terms of documentation
good design principles and who are also
imparting that domain expertise
education to the rest of your team at
this stage you might even be looking at
hiring consultants who can come for a
one-off project and educate the team in
the process team composition at this
stage
definitely team players you get
engineering managers happening in the
team more at this stage tech leads who
chose to be tech leads before this were
probably being quasi engineering
managers up to this point but this
starts to become a problem now because
either you can have a tech lead become
an engineering manager or you can have a
tech lead be a tech lead because the
team now needs
one who can advocate for them to the
executive team or the teams outside so
the job of the lead of that team now is
not just the engineering excellence it's
now to communicate to champion the team
to outside teams to be able to set their
charter and make it known outside of the
team so communication is way more
important at this stage than it was in
stages one and two communication within
the team so you're communicating down to
your team members and making sure that
they are understanding everything that's
going on and communicating up to the
executive team to make sure that they're
understanding what you're working on and
that you have a charter and a goal that
you're working towards this is
definitely the stage for more methodical
engineers
so the prototypers from stage one this
is a bit of a moral landmine that you're
walking into whether you're capable
enough to go from a prototyper to a more
method or methodical engineer or this
might be a stage when you might have to
start telling your prototypers to look
for other opportunities because it's
it's way worse keeping a prototyper
around at this stage than to actually
tell them to work on something that they
might find more interesting to work on
there might be still space for
prototypers drawing from my own
experience I think if we had about 5 to
10 in the earlier stages you're looking
at 2 to 3 prototypers at this stage
because what you want in the direction
of new feature development or new
products they can definitely be helpful
there but the places where you need
stability and quality you know they're
not going to be very happy doing that
kind of work so this is definitely the
stage for more domain experts the next
thing from there so now you have a team
of domain experts you might get the same
issues of repeatedly getting pulled off
tasks so you're working on your goals
and you're hearing from external teams
that you're not shipping on time you
don't have a predictable process you
might not be saying
No - enough customer requests that's
that's an interesting one because you
were at this stage in phases 1 &amp;amp; 2 where
you were saying yes to everything
because he wanted to try everything that
was out there so suddenly going from
that mind shift are saying no I won't do
that that's not part of my Charter is an
absolute shift in your focus in the
Charter for the team so being able to do
that and that is a warning sign when you
know that you're entering the next stage
of your growth multiple degrees of
communication overhead is what I define
the stage for as it is definitely the
growth stage we won't spend a lot of
time talking about stage 4 but you can
imagine that this is multiple
departments in multiple locations this
is Twitter being the HQ in San Francisco
we have satellite offices in New York in
Seattle in London these are mostly the
engineering presences so suddenly you go
from a team that was sitting in the same
place around the same work area to the
team that is not even in the same city
not even in this in the office at the
time they might be remote working
absolutely from an off-site location so
you now need to think about how your
communication processes will work how do
you get those remote people involved in
the day-to-day so that they feel a part
of the team and are able to work towards
the growth of the company or the product
that you're working on you will
definitely find at this stage a much
stronger executive team which probably
wasn't as strong earlier on but also but
it has grown and is stronger in terms of
both needing feedback from you and
actually setting a direction for the
whole company because now you know what
you're actually building and delivering
this is also the time where you might
see more engineers work in the software
architect capacity that word did not
come about so far in this talk because
stages 1 2 3 I don't think you would
have the time or the capacity to take on
this kind of role but now you need it
now you need to know where you have
dancing whether you have redundancy or
not where you're doing things that are
duplicating efforts do you have two
teams working on the same goal and they
don't even talk to each other so how do
you bubble up those kind of those kind
of issues and there might be other
stages like internationalization x'
unless internationalization mergers and
acquisitions this is more like I might
be merging with another team I might be
merging with another company we might
get acquired by someone which is what
happened with our startup we got
acquired by Twitter which is when you
restart your your faces altogether right
you might have spin-offs so the
important thing is not to know what
stage of the company you're at but what
stage of the team are you at what stage
of the product are you add to look for
those kind of signs now giving you a
whole brain dump of what kind of stages
what kind of signs to look for what are
the characteristics of each stage and
what kind of team members or the team
composition for each stage would be now
what do you do with all this information
that I've given you how do you the main
important thing here is one I hope that
after this talk that you are able to
recognize these inflection points these
changes that happen from one stage to
another you're able to recognize whether
you're in stage 1 or 2 or a transitional
phase in between maybe you don't see
warning signs at all that can also
happen it means your team just
organically was able to grow in to the
next stage and be able to handle that
transition but if you are seeing warning
signs there is no consistent way of
saying what though what the indicators
for these inflection points would be I
can't tell you what team size I can't
tell you funding amount whether your
bootstrapped
or you raise a few million dollars of
funding or whether your revenue is
cashflow positive or negative these are
not the signs that you should be looking
for definitely the ones are the ones I
went through is warning signs the
team composition what you're working on
and how your team is actually working is
what will define what stage of the team
you're in okay let me go back a little
so how do you cope up with these
managing of these inflection points I'm
gonna ask all of you to hold your
breasts for 30 seconds to be able to
show you how to manage these inflection
points I don't think anyone even tried I
was hoping that some of you would
because just but this is natural this is
human too to not hold your breath when I
tell you to do it it's a very natural
and human thing to do it status quo I
just asked you to do something which was
unnatural telling your team suddenly
that your communication style needs to
change from no stand-ups no meetings to
suddenly hey we need to have a daily
stand-up we need to have a weekly team
meeting that's unnatural it's not
something they're used to it's not
something that they have been doing so
I'm going to talk about a little bit in
terms of system 1 and system 2 I don't
know if any of you have read Thinking
Fast and Slow but it's it's inspired
from that book and system 1 and 2 is how
we think cognitively and system 1 is our
quick decision-making side of the brain
where we have very little information
and we want to make a decision it's
about picking a color that I want to
choose right now it's about I have three
parking spots which one should I park in
today I need to pick a type of cereal
quickly which one should I go for if I
spent hours making those decisions that
would be a lot a huge part of my day
spent making those kind of decisions so
we're wired to make those decisions very
quickly
it's almost unconscious you have biases
you you picked one thing maybe that
parking spot looked better than the
other so you went and parked in there
without thinking much about it system 2
is more of your thoughtful and rational
side of the brain it's the bigger
decisions it's what college should
I go to its should I buy a house at this
stage of my life sure how much should I
spend on buying a house what kind of car
should I buy these are all decisions
that require some input in terms of
information for you to then process it
and make a decision I almost want to say
that when you're telling your team to
change the way they're working whether
it's the number of code reviews that
they are sending out whether it's the
type of documentation that they're doing
well there's the type of communication
that's been happening if you're telling
them to change that you're appealing to
their system to not system one system
one is what they're used to doing day in
day out system two is what will help
them actually change what they're doing
day in day out based on the information
you're providing them so then it becomes
your job to give them that feedback of
hey this company is changing or this
team is changing on the product is
changing and we need to change as a
result of that I wanted to bring in
Rockets because no talk about
engineering can be complete without the
talk of rockets one of the finest forms
of engineering excellence on the left
there is a model of the of the be4 it's
it's the rocket that's being funded by
Jeff Bezos currently and on the right is
the wrapped or funded by Elon Musk in
the SpaceX organization these both of
these rockets they are being developed
to send them from Earth to Mars we
needed to rethink how we would launch
rockets from the Earth to Mars using a
different fuel they both use methane or
liquid hydrogen and not kerosene as they
used to what it means at this stage what
I tried to show here is how things used
to work were great
they were good they were necessary at
the time and we needed to do it that way
but now to move on to what's next if we
want to go to Mars and come back we need
to be having lighter fuel that's
and we need to be having rockets that
are reusable so we're moving to that
next stage of what do we build next to
get us up there the same with us
managing teams as we did so things
worked at a stage as they did and you
did well with them there were things
that were necessary to do but how do you
get from that to the next this is where
all your resetting of expectations and
actually communicating to people what
you expect them to do for the next stage
comes from because if you don't know
what you're asking for they can
definitely execute on it so changing
direction is what I'm getting to here is
you resetting expectations for technical
output saying to people it's okay to not
be sending a few pull requests today
it's okay to be sending a few a week or
even less than that whatever gets you to
the next stage of quality if you're in
stage one then you definitely want to be
asking people I want to see more pull
requests from you if you're in stage
four then you definitely want to be
asking people I want to see less and
more quality here definition of quality
what is that for each stage that's you
defining it for people so that they can
meet up to those quality standards what
are the process and metrics for each one
what is it the number of lines of code I
write it's the number of documentation
that I can produce is it a metric that
I'm actually moving for customers is it
my daily active users if I'm building an
app is it my must be active users or all
of these decisions that need to be made
around what kind of process and metrics
for each stage and the communication
with others how does that change how did
I go from stage one of not having any
meetings to Stage four i'm i'm bombarded
with meetings and i shouldn't be I
should be able to work and produce work
so that I can do what I do best so for
your team to focus on what they do best
you as an engineering lead or our
manager might need to take a lot of that
brunt whether from the executive team or
from down to up as well you might be
doing a lot more of the communication
why do you let your best engineers do
what they do
is work on getting as much a decoder out
writing as much good documentation
having that communication and imparting
that education to the rest of the team
members but if you treat your people
well manage their careers and hey maybe
some of those early prototypers can
become great UX researchers or new
product developers and set those
expectations for growth then you can set
people up for success and avoid the
morale and
landmine that you would be walking to
into with each of these phases changes
if your dreamed trust if your team
trusts you because you listen to them
and you trust in them and you're setting
expectations for them constantly and
consistently then you'll have a much
easier time going through each of these
transition phases to tell them what
they're up for and what you expect from
them it'll help you if you tell them
what your core values are and how they
can work around it all the time it's
very it's great to have a North Star
always guiding you and it'll help you in
turn to have a pipeline of candidates
because you'll know what you're looking
for you want to be hiring for the stage
you're in and the stage you're getting
to rather than stage that you've already
passed so if you had that kind of data
and information then you can hire the
right people for the for the job
I think we're very close to summary now
so I'm hoping by this talk I've been
able to draw from my experiences of
working in large teams small teams small
companies large companies in order to
give part of my experience out so that
people don't have the same growing pains
that we went through and had to learn
things while they were happening it's
great to know that there is a process or
a framework around how teams are growing
so that you you have something to look
forward to and you can be prepared for
it much better and more than you
yourself I'm hoping that when you go
back to your teams you can implement or
you can look for these kind of signs and
characteristics that
talked about and to even ascertain what
kind of growth phase you're in and to be
able to best work towards that growth
whether you're staying in that stage or
whether you're moving to the next one
but you make that decision deliberately
so that you can make that constant
investment back in your team which is
your by the way the most valuable asset
in any organization by far your job when
you go back is to scale the team by
managing the communication setting the
right expectations around throughput or
whether that's technical output or
whether that's communication output
whatever that might be so that the team
then you built will handle the
technology itself I think that's pretty
much it I added references there for the
inspirations for this talk it'll also be
available on the go to website so you
don't need to take these down yeah time
for questions
so thanks for your talk yes remember to
rate secession and I have some questions
here that I would like to ask and then
we will see if we still have time to get
some questions out of the audience
so you mentioned company sizes and
stages my company this from someone in
the audience my company seems to have
progressed on stage 3 while still a
relatively small company and it seems to
work for us is there such thing as too
early to mature and what are the
consequences so I don't know who asked
that question but would you mind raising
your hand so I can ask a little bit more
so when you said the yeren stage 3 what
size of the company are we looking at
6070 people right and other multiple
teams or just oh yes ok and so you say
the question I want to rephrase that are
you asking whether you're too early too
quickly or too mature too quickly
yeah did we mature too quickly did we
miss some stage you know development
cycle right so I would say if you're
already on stage 3 and you can recognize
that you are it doesn't matter what you
skipped it's more about the next ones
it's more about managing stage 3 the
best you can and also knowing that
you'll be in stage 4 very soon knowing
that you'll have remote employees very
soon or not you might make a decision
within the company to not do that but
knowing that you're making those
decisions and deliberately is what's
important so I wouldn't say it's you
you've gone into stage 3 directly and
that's a bad thing so now you don't know
what it's like to be prototyper it just
means that you got to a very stable
position very quickly right you missed
out on the early prototype err is
breaking your things at the fires that
happen a lot when you're in stage 1 in
two which are probably not there I'm
hoping in stage three you give me a
shake which means maybe is it right so
this is at the stage where
if you got to save three quickly then
maybe at this time you need to rethink
how your architecture is set up how you
can maintain that code better how to you
can improve the quality I would do
design discussions with the team
it doesn't need a reactive react attack
sure because do you have several
services doing the same thing or they've
been put together in a hacky way earlier
and now they're just working so this is
a time when you want to be making those
conversations and taking decisions
around the technical stability of the
system and then in people wise your the
composition of your team I would
definitely look for more senior
engineers at this stage who can actually
build the the product that you want to
be stable and and definitely on the
higher quality side thank you how to
make the team understand the changes
that are needed yeah so I was I was
hoping to touch on that more but it's
more about the conversations that you
would have with the team and honest
conversations these are changes that are
happening within the team I am I'm very
I'm doubting that they would not be
seeing all of this that's happening it's
just like I said it's human nature to
avoid that and to keep doing what I'm
doing thinking it's not that they're
questioning your authority it's not that
they have resistance to making the
product better it's the resistance to
change how do i how do i flip that is to
have those open and honest conversations
with the team and telling them hey there
are these changes happening and we can
go about it these ways either we do
nothing about it and we fall flat on our
face or we struggle with it or we get
ahead of the problem it's way better to
to be prepared for something that's
happening than to react to it so I would
say having those conversations with the
team about communication style changes
about technical output changes about
product changes design changes I would
do those conversations with the team
openly and honestly and tell them this
is how we need to move to the next
faith all right this is a lot of
questions in one mm-hmm how do I stay in
the quality stage when I can when can I
argue that's not my job is their golden
ratio of humans to product / services I
can use as ammunition right that is a
lot of questions so I would say in terms
of when when when can I say that's not
my job it's easier to do that when you
define what your job is I'll say it like
in my team I work in the building for
structure team right now and as you can
imagine Twitter is a plethora of
languages and frameworks that we use we
are we use Scala we use Java we use
Python we have C++ thrown in too we have
rest as well and now so there is a lot
of languages that come together so being
the built infrastructure team means I
need to support all of these I need to
support everything that's happening in
Twitter today it means I define what my
job is there I define whether I support
ABC or all of this but clearly defining
that and saying I am going to be
supporting these languages in this
repository or that and then being able
to tell people hey you're asking me for
something that's completely outside of
the source repository it's not something
that I can help you with I'll help you
move into the source repository but
that's that's all I can do right now
right so being able to say that's not my
job I can only do that and I've defined
what my job is what I will actually
support and I think we had that issue
even earlier where we hadn't defined
that I'm talking about like three or
four years ago where we were supporting
everything we have about 1,200 repos in
Twitter currently bear in mind a lot of
them are probably junk repos that were
created a while ago and not being used
but the building for structure team was
supporting all of them so about three
years ago we made the decision to
combine
of our biggest repos into one monolith
we call them on a build and then we said
that is the that is a repo that we are
going to support and nothing else
outside of it if you need help you need
to join this repo and then we'll help
you with whatever you're working on
whatever language you you're working
with whatever product whatever tool
you're working with but before we
couldn't so I would say that would be my
first thing the golden ratio of products
to engineers I don't think I have a good
insight into that apart from I don't
think you should be having several
products across the same team but if
you're working on the same part of the
stack whether you're back in engineer
and so you're working on several
services for that for several products
that makes complete sense to me do you
have a favorite stage or a favorite team
size I hope so
our golden ratio at Twitter has been 10
engineers per team no more as soon as
you hit 11 you're supposed to spin off
into another team under another manager
and I've seen it work really well but I
have to tell you honestly I was leading
the trench team at Twitter about three
years ago and when I started leading
leading the team we had about three
engineers by the time I stopped leading
that team we had about 18 so I had grown
the team from 3 to 18 I was the only
manager so it's a lot of work when you
had that many people but we were our
productive best at the time so I don't
think that there is a golden ratio like
that 10 people yes but if you had the
capacity or capability to handle more
you can I would not go any more than 20
people for one engineering manager
though all right any more questions from
the audience then I think we will wrap
it up thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
