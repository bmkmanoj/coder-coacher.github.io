my name is Andre and irreparable you as
you can see that's what I do a manager
enterprise code which I do stuff so this
what I do I I work independently always
dead and I help organizations moving
through a 21st century that's the way I
describe myself these days meaning that
I do have a technical background I've
been into software writing software
teaching people how to write software
for a long time but in the last 10 12
years I completely moved from Silicon to
Carbone as I say so I move from
computers to people and and and that's
what I do so we're going to talk about
leadership but who have a question why
do you care about leadership why are you
here sorry to wake you up but it's a
question why are you here by the way
this stage is so tall it's embarrassing
why what you want to know about
leadership why are you here what do you
care about leadership I'm sorry
be better at leadership okay and then we
have someone here okay okay okay to to
to to have challenging ideas thoughts
about leadership thank you one more one
more
anybody yes okay we're going to later
okay
good good okay good so thank you I just
wanted to have an idea about what do you
mean by leadership so let me tell you
the approach I'm going to take today
when I'm regarding leadership so I will
start from the assumption that you care
about delivering value is that right
can I start from this assumption okay
good
now of course value is a very abstract
concept because most people when you
talk about value digesting value is
money but of course money is one
dimension of value actually we say that
money is a store of value is not
necessarily value per se but there are
other forms of value like customer
satisfaction reputation learning is
another form of value right so value is
a very complicated concept but anyway as
we start from the assumptions that you
care about delivering value now who
delivers value is not you as an
individual it's your organization that
delivers value because what we do these
days is so complicated and complex that
no single person can efficiently and
effectively deliver value in a
meaningful way well you can maybe maybe
if you are a loan developer writing
mobile apps then you probably you can do
that but most of the time the problems
that we face are so complex that we need
teams organizations lots of people
working on the same problem and deliver
value so your organization delivers
value
and in which way your organization works
what determines the way in which the
organization works leadership leadership
in this context the way I mean
leadership is the people who are most
influential in the organization and
therefore they determine the way the
organization work and therefore that
determine the way the organization
produces value well so that's why
leadership is so important and
leadership is not something that you
learn from a book leadership is
basically a mindset and a set of skills
also but is primarily a mindset so your
mindset as a leader the term is the with
organization works which determines how
you deliver value this is the kind of
council the kind of a line of thought
that would like to follow for the next
45 minutes more or less so talking about
organizations like a question are you
guys familiar with this book anybody's
read this book or inventing
organizations by Frederick lelou one
person to three a few a few people ok a
few people thank you very much so for
the rest of you what I'm going to do is
give you a very brief introduction to a
couple of concepts in this book and the
reason why I want to do that is because
I need a vocabulary that you and I can
share when we talk about organizations
ok so I'm not going to discuss the book
but I need a couple of concepts that we
need to cooperate now so the idea of
well first of all the reason why I like
this book is because it's a set is a
collection of case studies there are
about 12 case studies in this book each
on a different organization and these
organizations can be very different
private sector public sector very small
very large technical healthcare lots of
stuff and what lelou they did with these
case studies was to try to understand
why these organizations they stand out
compared to their competitors and and he
came up with a few ideas actually some
of the ideas in the book he
as adopted from other theories so I mean
it's not entirely original but anyway I
like the way it's presented so the
concept is that organizations developed
in the history of humankind let me give
you let me give you an example let me
give you an analogy if you take my brain
actually not my physical brain but the
structure of my brain there are certain
certain parts of the structure of my
brain which are extremely old very very
very old to millions of year old
everything that is related for instance
to regulating my metabolism is extremely
old in the structure of my brain and
everything that is related to survival
or reproduction is a bit younger but
still very old other things like social
skills is a bit more recent and old and
other things like logic are kind of
recent in the history of mankind so the
idea is that my brain contains part that
can be very old in terms of their
structure and very new and we can think
that this could be applied to
organizations as well for a very simple
reason organizations or companies if you
think about it companies they do not
exist in nature can we agree on that
companies do not exist in nature
companies are a creation of the human
mind
therefore they reflect the way the human
mind works does it make sense good so if
you look at organizational development
from this historical point of view you
can see that one hundred thousand years
ago or ten thousand years ago we had
some kind of organizations and then one
thousand years or years ago we had other
kind organization and so on and so on
and so on
the other thing you may notice is that
this scale is not linear so apparently
there's been an acceleration in the
evolution of organizations in the
history of mankind is actually faster
and faster the other thing is you can
you may notice that this organizational
let's say styles or
they are being color-coded on a scale
and the idea is that there is no it's a
continuum okay that's that's the idea of
this color scale so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to describe a few of these
organizational paradigm very quickly and
then we talk about leadership in this
context okay good you're still with me
yes good you guys at the back he's still
with me good just checking so red
organization's okay when we say red
organization's we are saying that we are
talking about organizations that are
based on a very specific paradigm and
this paradigm this metaphor is the
metaphor of the pack of wolves and let
me explain why we say that the paradigm
is a pack of wolves let's take a a kind
of organization that still exists today
street gangs
let's take street gangs now a street
gang is an organization it's a group of
people who share a common purpose that's
an organization right a group of people
who share a common purpose right
good now in this kind of organization
usually the dynamic the or the trust
relationships were smart are very very
simple either you are the boss or you're
not very simple either you dominate or
you're being dominated and you stay the
boss until somebody kills you and take
your place very simple so so these kind
of organizations are kept together
primarily by fear that's the way these
organizations are kept together that's
the glue fear okay and power and
violence and so on and so on
however these kind of organizations have
have produced a couple of concepts that
we still use in organizations like
division of labor is one division of
labor because you are either dominated
area or you dominate so if I dominate
you say what I do you're sorry you do
what I say
so if I dominate
okay you do what I say I said the
division of labor and you do that and
you do that and you do that division of
labor very simple effective simple and
also commendable Authority clearly okay
so that's a brief introduction to read
organizations let's move to ember
another color
now the metaphor of amber of candy
remember organizations as you can see is
the metaphor of the army now not a
military especially not the military
today the military today they can do
excellent things in terms of dealing
with complexity all the VUCA concept and
having heuristics on the battlefield and
so on and so on and so on very very
sophisticated I'm not talking about that
I'm talking about the army in the most
traditional way in the sense of a rigid
hierarchy rigid hierarchy where it's
very well-defined what's your authority
what's your responsibility and so on and
so on and so on
an example of this let's say for
instance public school systems if you
think at universities today universities
today of course they do different things
than 500 years ago but the structure of
a university the organizational
structure is not very different from 500
years ago right and in fact universities
they take pride in their history right
they take pride in preserving the past
repeat in the past is that right there
is this strong concept of tradition in a
university right so repeat in the past
maintaining the status quo is very
important in this kind of organizations
most churches work the same way in a
church is very clear what a hierarchy is
is very clear about what the rules are
and by the way if you do not follow the
rules we will punish you right in these
kind of organizations if you break the
code not the code but the behavioral
code okay if you break the code if you
break the law we punish you you are an
erratic for instance in churches right
I'm Italian and I know that Catholic
Church healed quite a lot of people
because they didn't like how they
thought
right because they are heretics so this
is the kind of organization so with
these kind of organizations what you
have is very clear hierarchies and
processes because processes are a way of
keeping repeating the past very
well-defined process keep doing that
keep doing that keep doing that most
rituals in churches are just processes
that will repeat over and over and over
and over for centuries right does it
make sense
amber organizations now let's move to a
more recent type of organization this
one or an organization now it's very
likely that 90% of this room is working
in orange orange organization because
Oregon orange organizations are
basically children of the Industrial
Revolution
and the idea is that the organization
the metaphor is that the organization is
like a very well oiled very very
efficient machine and people are just
gears in this machine and that's the
reason why you start measuring
individual productivity for instance you
start giving bonuses to individuals if
they perform better if they meet
objectives if you are efficient then we
reward you it's different from amber if
you don't do what I say you get a stick
in an orange organization if you do what
I say you get the carrot right this is
the concept so efficiency and
competition of course because you want
to be efficient because you need to
compete against your competitors
innovation accountability because I need
to give you a carrot if you do what I
say no stuff like that it's very annoyed
isn't it so sad I mean I can feel the
sadness in this room you gotta say old
time that's so right that's what turbo
no come on there's hope there's hope
believe me okay so these are orange
organizations that again it's very
possible that 90% of you are working in
orange organization these days this is
very very common there's a Maurice
and type of organization the metaphor
for this kind of organization for green
organizations is the metaphor of a
family now in family organ I'm not
talking about family-owned companies
which of course could be an example but
not necessarily I'm talking about
companies where the bounding the
relationships between people is even
more important than roles processes
hierarchies and so on and so on and so
on I'm not saying that green
organizations they do not have
hierarchies and processes and so on I'm
just saying that the bonds that people
create are even more important than that
and you can see that for instance in
startups when you have when you have a
small startup founded by a bunch of
friends in like you know high school
friends and they put together a start-up
the bounding is more important than
formal roles and you still have formal
roles because anyway every company must
have a CEO bylaw is required by law
right but still is not that the most
important part I'm not saying that green
organizations are necessarily good or
bad because remember in the same way
that families can be extremely
dysfunctional green organization can be
extremely dysfunctional or can be very
functional depending like so it's not
necessarily a good or bad thing these
kind of organizations usually are kept
together by strong values lacking family
we stick together because we believe in
the same things because we share the
same set of common values and that's why
we stick together
and these values could be of any kind
could be servicing the planet could be
whatever right in these kind of
organizations you have empowerment what
does it mean empowerment means that even
though I do have authority I trust you
because I have a bond with you I trust
you and so I empower you to do stuff you
have the power to decide and you but
you're not accountable you have the
power to decide
or multiple stakeholders model usually
these kind of organizations they
understand that they are interconnected
with a larger system so it's not just a
matter of keeping happy that the the
person or the organization who pays you
but for instance they they care about
social issues or political issues
financial issues so they have this sense
of being part of something bigger and
these are green organizations now a few
comments before we move on comment
number one as you can see no
organization is mono color remember I
was just oversimplifying when I was
talking about green orange red and amber
organization an organization is of one
single color in the same way that no
person is a one single color I could be
extremely red when it comes to sports or
Indiana can be very green when it comes
to friendship right
so no person is mono color and no
organization is mono color if you if you
go talking to a multinational you talk
to legal to the legal department it's
quite likely that they are very amber
legal but if you talk to research and
development they could be very orange
right so depending depends on who you
talk to still in every organization you
can kind of feel what is the dominant
color in every organization can feel
that now the other thing is no stage is
good or bad each stage is just adapted
to different context remember it's just
a depth or different context that is why
it's called evolutionary organizational
development because 10,000 years ago we
had different problems that we have
today so for that context it was very
well adapted and the other thing is that
in the same way that my brain has
evolved but still includes very old
parts and I need these very old parts
every new paradigm includes the previous
ones so if you're talking about green
organizations there are still a radical
there is still a number component there
is still an orange component there are
just different layers in this
organization so no one of these stages
is necessarily good or bad now it type
of organizations we are starting to see
that starting to appear is what we call
teal organizations teal and teal is a
color the we are not really sure which
is the best metaphor to represent teal
but usually we talk about living systems
so organizations that are like living
systems now if you think about it most
multinationals or most companies today
are orange which means that then the
line concept is mechanical division of
labor roles procedures efficiency and
rewards and stuff like that teal is not
mechanical is organic meaning that we
consider the organization as a living
organism and that is constantly evolving
depending on how it interacts with the
external world and now it works
internally so it's a constant
questioning what do we want to be how
can we serve our larger system and so on
and so on and so on in these kind of
organizations usually you see some
things like people are perfectly able to
self manage let me give an example one
of the companies that are described in
the book is a company in the Netherlands
I'd say they're actually an organization
in the Netherland and what they do is
they provide health care at home for
elderly people so they provide health
care at home and they have about 7,000
people on the field and 55 zero people
in the headquarter so let me translate
this is like a company's like an IT
company with 7,000 developers and 50
managers can you imagine that okay a
software development company with 7,000
technical people developers and 50
managers clearly the 7,000 they know
what they have to do they're perfectly
able to self manage self organize and
make decisions together
and they don't need this kind of
supervision of mechanical hierarchical
supervision they know what is right and
they can work together they can self
manage that's in one thing the other
thing is this idea of wholeness meaning
that most of the time when we go to work
we wear a professional mask basically we
don't bring all of our selves into work
and that's a pity
especially with the kind of intellectual
work that we do it's a pity that we lose
things like creativity intuition and
emotional intelligence a fun humor and
stuff like that it's very such a pity
that we lose this kind of essential
traits of the human being because we are
trained to wear a professional mask when
we go to work and this is not going to
happen in two organizations we respect
individual as individual as the entire
individual so these kind of things you
can see here there's a loosening of own
ego I'm not talking about abandoning the
ego I'm not talking about the spiritual
path in which you do abandon the ego and
you become one with the universe I'm not
talking about that but I'm talking about
understanding that you're just part of
something bigger understanding that
you're part of something bigger good so
let's move on why am I'm talking about
Teil organizations connected to
leadership now I assume that this is an
IT conference so I assume that you guys
practice some form of agile one way or
another or maybe you think so I'm
kidding so if you practice some form of
agile you have seen the agile manifesto
you know that India had this kind of old
because that this was written 16 years
ago and in fact I'm going to make two
changes now hold tight okay I've just
updated a manifesto okay so what I did
is instead of working software here we
have working product which is more
contemporary considering that we now we
use agile to
develop fighter jets prototypes okay so
working product and stakeholders
collaboration not customer not only who
pays you but whoever is affected by your
product okay good
couple of updates now in the agile
manifesto we say that these things on
the right are important and these things
on the left are even more important
that's what we say right so for instance
processes and tools are extremely
important for what we do and individuals
and interactions are even more important
good so the the question I asked myself
was ok so if I wanted to put colors on
the manifesto on the values of the agile
manifesto what those would be so let's
take for instance processes and tools
get process a member right by definition
a processes amber
tools tools we use to be more efficient
so orange processes and tools amber an
orange good how about individuals and
interactions most likely teal and green
does it make sense so what we are saying
is that the first value of the agile
manifesto implies that we need to shift
from this kind of mindset amber and
orange and we need to shift still
including that one but we need to shift
to a teal and green mindset that's what
is implying right and remember that
mindset determines leadership so I hope
you starting to see the connection
comprehensive documentation well
documentation is like the Bible the
Bible is amber so amber
period
working product well first of all you
must be working so it ought stew it's
orange and second it must be a product
that somebody needs somebody likes so it
still it's for the larger system
contract negotiation
well contract is another Bible and so
it's amber and in my opinion there's a
little bit of red in the way we do
contract negotiation most of the time
because most not always not always but
most of the time contract negotiation is
something like so okay so I'm the
customer I have lots of money and you
are a supplier I can find ten hundred
suppliers like you so you do what I say
and that's a contract negotiation either
you dominate or you're being dominated
so little bit of red okay not always but
has that ever happened to you this I've
ever seen this kind of negotiation I
have the money you do what I say okay
dominate or being dominated on the other
hand stakeholders collaboration by
definition is teal and green following a
plan amber stick into a plan okay
following a plan amber process
repetition and responding to change well
for me they remember in agile we respond
to change we don't change out of whim
okay okay oh today we want to try
something new no that's not a thing you
respond to change you basically you
change the plan every time the existence
every time that the the reality tells
you that your old plan is no longer
valid because now you have more
information that then you had when you
made the plan now you have better
information you respond to that better
information and you change but you
change because you want to have an
advantage from changing its efficiency
and it's also for a larger purpose so
how's it going so far
you okay still with me okay
okay good I'm just checking the time and
I'm sorry I'm just joking because it's a
lot of stuff I understand it's a lot of
stuff for first short talk anyway why is
this relevant to leadership remember my
first slide I told you that mindset
determines leadership leadership
determines how the organization works
and that determines how you generate
value okay so leadership and mindset
meant mindset actually is that is at the
beginning of this chain now what are the
do suggests and that makes sense to me
is that the stage at which an
organization can operate is determined
by the stage of its leadership because
leaders are the most influential people
in the organization so if the most
influential people in the organization
are have an amber mindset primarily
amber mindset guess what color the
company could be if the most influential
people have an amber mindset right does
that make sense yeah good so we need to
talk about leadership we need to talk
about changing leadership in a certain
way which is by the way what I've been
working on for the last four years so I
just want to make a quick distinction
now between management and leadership
now first of all I found it much more
useful not to talk about managers and
leaders but talk about management and
leadership talking about the activity
not the person's yeah
so I'd like to use the words from Seth
Godin here from the book called the
tribes for to define what is management
and what is leadership there are
hundreds of different definitions out
there about what's management and
leadership I chose this one because I
like it so management is about
manipulating resources to get a known
job done
so what are these resources I'm not
talking about people I'm a 21st century
coach and I don't talk about people
using the word resource okay so what are
these resources resources could be well
time money infrastructure
legal agreements everything everything
that you can buy your cell that's a
resource right I'm not talking about
people so management is about
manipulating these resources to get a
known job done we know we have to do
something and we're going to use our
resources in a certain way to achieve
that and I as a manager I am responsible
for how I use these resources and it's a
big responsibility when a manager signs
a legal agreement that's a big
responsibility right on when he spends
five hundred million euros or over
budget that's a big responsibility so we
need good managers but we also need to
understand what is management
let's least in this context the thing
about managers and management is that
managers have reports so managers
because they have big responsibilities
they they also have big authority so
they operate by Authority and they
expect accountability from people that
do what they are told to do because they
are accountable for what they do right
so managers have reports leadership on
the other hand is defined in this way
leadership is about creating change you
believe in leadership is about creating
change you believe in leadership is crea
is about creating change you believe in
leadership is about influencing your
environment is about bringing change
about is about not having people who
follow orders but people who follow you
because they want to leaders have
followers managers have reports it's a
very different concept very different
concept leadership creates change
management can also create a change by
manipulating resources but leadership
creates change by influencing people and
that's regardless of your official
position in the company it's not about
status is about influencing people in a
certain way being able to to
have people follow you now I'm not
saying that these two things are
actually what I'm saying is this I'm
saying that if you want to bring about
change in your organization you do need
these two forces the force of management
and the force of leadership to be
aligned now it's very nice when these
two things coincide on the same person
sometimes we find excellent managers who
are also excellent leaders but honestly
that doesn't have a very frequency what
I see most often is very good managers
with very poor leadership skills or very
good leaders who have zero authority in
the company almost zero stars in the
company is that right
do you see that as well very good
managers that can exercise authority but
they have no leadership skills people do
not follow them they take orders
different story or very good leaders who
decided not to or didn't didn't happen
to have a formal position in the company
okay do you see what I mean yeah hello
let me check you guys in the back are
you okay good thank you guys yeah just
just check you guys in the front you in
the middle good
left right okay
covert so what I'm suggesting is that if
you want to use your leadership
effectively you also need to have
support from manager for management and
vice versa
that's what I'm suggesting now let me
ask a question I assume that you are
practicing some form of a gel or you
think you are doing so so if you if we
were to talk about leadership in our
context leadership in IT leadership in
an agile company because of course
leadership in a leadership for a for a
Orchestra director is very different
from
1490 company right okay so let's talk
about what we do
so what is our gel leadership well first
of all let me tell you that it's
definitely not what this guy is doing
okay this is not an example of agile
leadership and let let's start to see
why okay
how many metaphors is about leadership
you can see in this picture that
probably do not fit in what we do I'm
sorry now being brave yes being brave
yes the hero and so on what else what do
you see no other people guys alone right
the guy is alone and he's a hero and
violence or force in general yeah the
sword and fighting against the dragon
you can see the fire coming from and
what else it's not a unicorn which is
kind of depressing yeah yeah
anything else I'm sorry yes you the
protection and you and you want to
protect somebody and protect yourself
and so on and yeah there's a castle here
and the guy is out there doing stuff and
I don't know maybe there's people in
here we don't know what else can we find
two more three more because what I'm
suggesting is that our general
perception of leadership is affected by
a number of metaphors that we have
acquired unconsciously but let me tell
you one he's a man we are so used to
this idea that we don't even notice it
why does a leader have to be men okay so
what else yes
special kind of okay okay yeah yes yes
yeah he's so royal right looks like a
prince or yeah
so stay to status and so on okay good so
that is not agile leadership so when I
run workshops on agile leadership in
house or public workshops part of the
workshop is asking people so who would
be a good idea leader or a good leader
for you what's your definition as a
group of an agile leader and I always
always always end up with something like
this okay now this is half in French
because I was in Paris at the time and
half in English it doesn't matter but I
always always end up with something like
this for instance
good communicator good listener empathic
is able to or she's able to give energy
to energize people proactive critical
sense he's he knows himself or herself
and stuff like other things visionary
open mind a sociable charismatic and is
able to create bonds between people and
then of course by all of this and also
this person is humble of course of
course
okay and I always see something like
that and as I usually say I mean if I
found this sound a person like this I
don't care about the gender I would
marry this person because that's such a
wonderful human being right yes it's
amazing okay that's amazing
but you know the thing is that's not a
good question to ask the question is not
what kind of leader would you like to
have I think the best a better question
is what kind of leader do you want to be
because that's where you can make a
difference it's pointless to to to ask
okay I would like to have leaders like
this no
the question is what kind of leader do
you want to be which kind of influence
do you want to bring about in your
environment which kind of change do you
want to bring that's a better question
because there you have power you have
the power to do something that's a much
better question so for me in the kind of
organization that we work in if you
think about orange or green remember the
thing about manifesto we ended up saying
that for what we do today the 21st
century
in IT or knowledge work in general for
what we do if you remember the colors
that were in the back we need a more
tillage greenish orangish mindset rather
than a red orange and amber mindset to
remember that okay we still need this
but we need to move over there we need
to be able to create organizations where
the interconnections mark was talking
about that now the interconnections
between people are what makes the living
system which is your organization and
this living system must be able to
constantly adapt and evolve and rethink
itself and the only way to do that if
you see is it's like a metaphor of you
know brain cells and synapses that are
interconnected so what I'm suggesting is
that the kind of leadership that you
might want to consider is a leadership
in which your system your company
organization promotes promotes
synergistics acts of leadership in
everyone something like this you don't
need a leader you need people who can
influence somebody for a certain amount
of time then other people take over then
other people take over and this is
constantly changing what you want to
promote is multiple synergistics
concurrent pacts of leadership inside
the organization remember the 7,000 with
the 50 managers okay something like that
and you need to promote safety and other
things so what I'm saying is these
leadership concept when it
brought to what we do is first of all
you want an environment where everyone
must feel safe or the one feels safe to
lead anytime
when is the right the right time to do
that okay
can you can you imagine for a second to
be able to create even a team let's say
let's say that you have a team of ten
people seven people five people whatever
but in this team everybody feels safe to
be a leader whenever is the right time
to do so maybe for five minutes maybe
for half an hour maybe for a week but
when it's the right time I take
leadership so everybody leads from time
to time which means that everybody
follows from time to time that's a need
more interesting concept and that's why
this idea of loosening the ego is so
important if you are attached to your
ego to your white horse to your status
to your shield to your sword and so on
well it's very hard that you can step
back and let somebody else lead
so if everybody leads everybody follows
and learning when to follow and when to
lead is very important not easy but very
important and it's also extremely
important to grow other leaders if you
are a leader if you are in a leadership
position not management position
necessarily but if you are in a
leadership position because people
follow you then I believe that part of
your responsibility is growing other
leaders so that you can stand back and
let other people lead and that takes
courage and that takes letting go over a
number of things but it works it works
because you create an environment which
is much more intelligent collectively
then when one single person is leading
all the time there are of course
supporting qualities I'm not sure how
much time we have left we still stick oh
not much not much not much okay well and
I don't have much more to say
okay there are certain qualities in a
person that will help you provide a more
effective influence on your environment
well then by the way the way you use
your influence is entirely up to you I'm
talking about leadership in the context
of context of influencing your
environment and bringing change about
and then if you bring change about for
your own interest or for some
questionable cause that's your problem
okay I'm not saying that leadership is
always good or bad leadership is
something that you can do and how you
use it it's your moral responsibility
but there are certain qualities that can
help you exercise this influence first
of all your ability to communicate with
people
for instance creating trusting
relationships or listening or by empathy
and so on and so on and so on providing
a vision leaders who don't have a vision
usually don't have followers right
follow me where I don't know probably
not working okay trust mark discuss
about trust already there are other
things that are part of the what I'm
trying to explain in this slide is that
please please please please please if
you can focus on your character not on
your personality there has been a shift
in the last 50 80 years when we talk
about my about leadership and if you
read books written one rather 100 years
ago about leadership they would talk
about the intrinsic qualities of a
person that makes that person a good
leader intrinsic qualities like honesty
for instance or integrity for instance
if you read about leadership these days
most 90% of the books they will teach
you tricks to become more influential
it's about the personality that you
build
around your character and not not about
your own character so what I'm talking
about here is about which kind of
character traits make a good leader not
personality personality you can build
character is what you are okay so I'm
talking about character
so these ability of taking
responsibility and not letting go a
little bit about your self but at the
center of all this and I think this
would be my probably final slide and
I'll skip a couple of slides but that's
okay at the center of all this it's self
awareness which I believe is a fundament
it's the key point for good leadership
so let me recap I told you that you want
to deliver value call you need an
organization or K you need leadership
that creates certain type of
organizations yeah okay and then you
have certain mindsets that produce
certain kinds of leadership which are
more interesting than others now at the
core of this mindset at the core of this
mindset in my opinion water from what I
see for myself and for the people I work
with is self awareness being completely
aware of what you want how you feel what
you think and so on and so on and so on
and for a very simple reason because you
cannot lead anyone you cannot lead
anyone if you cannot lead yourself in
the first place if you cannot lead
yourself in the first place you cannot
lead anyone and to be able to lead
yourself you need to be totally self
aware of who you are what you want watch
how you feel all the time okay and this
is essential for good leadership it's a
fundamental concept you cannot lead
anyone if you cannot lead yourself you
cannot communicate with anyone if you
cannot communicate with yourself in the
first place so I think the time is
almost over and we want to have a few
minutes for questions right so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to skip a
couple of slides
is just a set of meta practices I used
to promote leadership by the way the
slides are on SlideShare so if you go to
SlideShare look up for my name
you find these slides and a lots of
other presentations this lights are out
there and I'll skip zeros clip say the
skip skip skip skip and also be around
if you have questions
that's a recap I will let you read the
recap but anyway it's just what I told
you remember to rate this session and
I'm done so if you want to keep in touch
which I'd love to you find me on
LinkedIn you find me on Twitter and you
find me in the hallway for the rest of
the day ok and thank you very much
[Laughter]
Thanks well thank you oh that's quite
informative definitely took some notes
for me and my team so we have time for a
few questions so I guess the first one
would be some leaders do not like to co
work with other leaders if we promote
leadership among everyone how should we
approach this problem
fire them I'm sorry that was my first
automatic response but either you take a
long road of trying to X first of all
understanding the other person
understanding why this person would not
let go of his or her status whatever and
then try to make yourself clear about
why it's important for the organization
that we let somebody else lead it's not
a matter of formal position is a matter
of letting people develop if people
don't develop the organization dies so a
quick question yeah that you've heard of
Alistar Coburn's guest leadership
concept so any differences from what
you're presenting today we understand
and I share a lot of concepts about this
I think that the different take from
from between what I'd present and and
his approach is the emphasis I put on
the importance of self developing as a
leader so investing a lot of time to
develop yourself as a leader
understanding what that really means
yeah so how can every agile leader align
with management to rethink the
organization hmm good question
how can you align with management to
receive the organization beer no no I'm
not kidding
yeah yeah you need to build trust you
need to start talking on a different
level but then again if there's one
message I can give you about because I
think that the see the scene here is
conflict or different perspectives and
the only suggestion quick suggestion I
can give you but this is is more
important to understand the other person
then try to convince the other person
start from understanding start from
trying to understand the other person
and then perhaps the other person will
do the same with you and then maybe you
start really talking to each other all
right I do want to say thank you
everyone for your questions it's making
my life really hard up here to try to
read them through and pick I'm gonna
give you two more but I'm gonna propose
that you stick around later because
there's some specific questions that I
think some of you might want to ask him
directly mm-hmm is there any value in
giving brief up leadership opportunities
to someone who is not ready and relate
to that is it are you able to just be a
leader for a short time mm-hmm if you
remember when I was talking about
growing leaders that's exactly the
concept what you want to do is you want
to help people who are not accustomed to
leadership to to give the opportunity
and the support to grow this kind of
skill now and I perfectly understand
that some people they do not want to
have any form of leadership and I
respect that and just leave them alone
okay
so respect people but if you see that
someone might might have a spark
becoming a good leader than what you
want to do is to Kindle that spark to
take care of that to let this part
becoming a nice warm bonfire okay one
last question yep how can we learn more
about these theories about what what
you're presenting so the organization's
the
drop me an email container no I mean
there are hundreds of references about
all this stuff in terms of books
workshops that you can take conferences
you can go to coaching that you can have
and so there's a there's a entire world
out there regarding leadership and so I
don't have a short answer but I'm making
myself available if you if you're
interested contact me write to me on
LinkedIn and I'll try to give you all
the references I can thank you so much
can we do one more round of applause
thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
