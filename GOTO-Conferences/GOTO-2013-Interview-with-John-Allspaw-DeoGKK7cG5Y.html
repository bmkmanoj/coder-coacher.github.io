with John all spa the SVP of technical
operations of NC so let's start off with
a simple question with the complex
answer what step moms that that's a good
question it's word it's a it's a it's a
good word I think it's a bit i think
it's a word that that describes a what
Patrick dubois the corner of the word
would describe a wicked problem I would
say that the the word describes oh I
think cultural and professional movement
I think is that is the way that's
generally described almost said of to
some agree a set of practices not really
prescriptive a set of behaviors set of
organizational values essentially the
respectful collaboration of two domain
expertise is coming together and
augmenting their abilities i would say
how's that what what is demo2 not ah
it's another product I don't believe
it's a team I don't believe it say I
don't believe its role I don't believe
it's a
strategy I don't believe it is a recipe
I don't believe it's methodology I think
that I think that the difficulty with
with defining it or not defining it
points to how how engineering as a whole
as computer science of the whole has a
relationship with abstraction in general
there's a double-edged sword with with
abstraction and I would say the DevOps
is a construct is other as an
obstruction I it's a it's a funny thing
so at Etsy we were talking the other day
we never used you never hear the word
DevOps at Etsy at work in regular
conversation it just feels weird to say
all oh that's because of the DevOps now
we would never say that it feels really
silly and the way I like to think of it
is as if you if you replace if you sort
of search and replace in your inner
monologue where you would say DevOps and
replace it with collaboration
coordination cooperation communication
if you were to replace where you would
say that ops with those things that it
would sound silly oh we've got the
cooperation group there on the case
cooperation groups going to totally kill
out you know they're going to they're
going to think and solve that problem
you're never going to small enough yeah
that's that's they are so keen on
collaborating that's I mean course
that's their that's their name so
therefore that's the thing that they do
is they collaborate nobody else really
collaborates of course because otherwise
collaboration so yeah that's that's sort
of my my view on it I think that any
amount of unease that we have with
definitions needs to be okay and I think
that most engineering projects no matter
what domain it is deals with uncertainty
it deals in Vegas the interesting
engineering problems and interesting
engineering solutions all come from a
place where there are gray areas and if
we if we expect solidity we expect
certainty of expect sort of a hard
science definition on essentially what
is a social science construct than were
worth it didn't so or at the very least
says a lot about the person wanting to
use it in a very strict prescriptive way
so a few years ago as part of it as part
of discussion I had I tried to reduce
agile down to one a one word description
the word came up with was communication
it seems that all of the agile processes
and practices are about increasing
communication of some kind so builds
communicate failures developers
communicate with product owners it all
boils down to communication and
increasing bandwidth and frequency
communication do you think that the that
the devil office perspective on thing on
that increase of collaboration
communication is that kind of part of
the same thing that led to agile on the
developer and business side there's
there's a lot in there um that's a good
question and it's a question that's been
asked before and in a matter of fact I
think I remember
you know before Dubois came up with the
word DevOps he and inter Schaefer I
think we're at a an open spaces they
were the only attendees at an open space
talk discussion called agile web
operations let's set that aside for a
second I don't know if I agree with the
premise i would say that and I think
maybe I'm mostly unseen for
clarification I would argue that it's
not about more communication now in a
world where there's a dearth of
communication more communication or the
volume of communication can be is
arguably good thing i would say
different and constructive communication
for those scenarios you can have a large
volume of communication between a very
toxic relationship between development
and operations so more communication on
it and say this is not exactly equal to
better so i'm starting i'm realizing as
i get over become more of a language
nitpicker so i apologize for this i
would say that that yes that that
engaging in sort of joint activity which
is really what what both of those
domains I think ought to be doing at
least if they if they if they ever hope
to provide the company with progress or
enabling the company or your business to
to have value then then they want to
sort of you know act as joint joint
groups now the people over process that
sort of thing that's a good question to
what extent is agile or to what extent
of the tenets of NATO a manifesto feel
like content
and like Schafer says common sense isn't
common so I would say that they just
have the hallmarks of a good idea good
idea is extremely simple and it's also
fascinating that you hadn't thought of
it before and so I would say that where
does this come from I would say that the
most successful companies places where
you would say a culture of this sort of
culture of government collaboration and
deferring in domain expertise and
augmenting different skill sets is you
know bears fruit Google's Amazon's
Facebook's Etsy's flickers i would say
that in those scenarios it just simply
became a competitive advantage it was
easier to gain leverage in the it was
easier to gain leverage basically I
wouldn't say that it's that the the
source of DevOps is simple simply
something that came from a capitalistic
urge you know it's a I don't think it's
an artifact of through the commercial
pressures however i think what resonates
with most people when they're when they
when they see talks on this or when they
hear stories about the the benefits of
these two groups bringing both of their
domain expertise in a you know together
in a scenario where they're both
deferring and augmenting then that
strikes a chord right because it's a
different
relationship it's you know my you know I
had a you know abusive relationship and
then we broke up and now I've been a new
relationship and it's awesome this
transition who doesn't want that
transition and so I'd say that there's
probably my guess is that there's that
there's something that there's something
emotional about that transition that
sticks out for people right we have the
grumpy sort of bofh in the corner with
the stereotypical the caricature right
big guy beard who says no all the time
right and then there's the sort of the
archetype of the sort of prima donna
developer who you know thinks they're
smarter than everybody and nobody ever
views themselves as those archetypes but
they knew the other people as those
archetypes so if there's an Elvis to say
actually it turns out that you know
there's a different comic strip like
those cartoons actually you can put down
that comic book and pick up a different
one where you know these people working
together are much stronger than either
of them or individually that's that's a
bit of that feels hopeful so that's
probably why it became strong but but
again I think he would be would be a
mess if we didn't think about the how
how getting good at this sort of stuff
is absolutely a competitive advantage so
one of the teams I've worked on in the
past when rebuilding the website from
scratch
I mean the company's main reason for
being one of the major changes was that
we included operations in the
development process and they the
director of operations was in on a lot
of our discussions our weekly status
update future planning etc and what I
found really interesting about that was
because of the very different world of
experience some of the operations
background could come up with completely
different solutions that you would
expect and they also tend to have the
whole view so for instance and as a
software developer and I by myself
falling into this trap you think of
things in terms of code in terms of
algorithms in terms of how the system
works inside of a single VM you don't
think of things like how much network i
own my burning you don't think of well
if i'm communicating with all in other
nodes then when i get past about 60 have
I just completely rendered my network
and accessible because of the amount of
chatter it just it seems that because of
that the two different perspectives and
bodies of experience he end up having a
far stronger team as a result and then
if you do something like create a dev
ops team which is a 13 and stick in the
middle you've actually made the silo
problem words for anything better agreed
agreed you know you touched on something
there about having you know the scenario
where you have you know I have my hammer
my hemorrhoids code this is going to
reflect with my skills and also my
experience right when I'm faced with a
design decision like oh we need these
two nodes to talk to each other one note
has persistent a persistent store of
some kind say it's a database or let's
say it's something else and the other
one doesn't and one else asked questions
right so you have design decisions
always should I should I use what's the
protocol I could use HP
p use TCP I could use some other thing
maybe I should invent my own you know
binary protocol and I'll do this and
I'll do that and whatever the lessons
you learn as you develop those sorts of
things and I do think that there's
something very very inherent about
distributed applications are essentially
any application that requires more than
one machine right and we had our own the
slide Eric header and slide earlier the
fallacies of distributed computing I
would argue that that could be an update
that would be a gateway drug for
developers to think operationally the if
you were to you know when I think when I
first saw those policies of distributed
computing as an Operations person sounds
like yeah of course you know and for a
developer who's like who has scope and
can be forgiven for this you know his
scope is here's your functionality is my
goal right and and along the edges of my
goal I hope hopefully maybe I'll have a
sprinkle a little bit of fault tolerance
a little bit of reliability maybe you
know some transactional nature I don't
want to lose Davis and therefore put
some safety mechanism guard relevant on
it but however it's still going to do
this thing right pictures of cats movie
files you know audio processing whatever
it is they can be forgiven about about
making their assumptions when they make
design decisions operations of this as
well but but it's only when you have
that conversation that you realize oh
the world is a nail and this is the hand
that feels not only is the thing that I
have code or network or resource
consumption metrics collection right my
world isn't actually nails it's only the
world that I can see because I have a
hammer in my hand and and oh hey there
are their bricks they're out in the ward
off that's kind of crazy I'm going to
bring my and so as a developer I'm going
to bring my my skills also my expertise
what's bitten me in the past I may have
a bias because I may want my future
decisions not to bite me like that and
so does not pursue one of the examples
of where this conversation to take place
is when designing especially when you
involve operations folks early on let's
say we have that scenario before where
we have more than one machine talking
and it needs to talk to other machines
right so this is the thing that happens
so how do we distribute this like let's
say we need you know we would like
redundancy we don't want to lose it all
if one box goes down so how do we
distribute conversations amongst a group
of nodes well well depends are these
notes different let's say that they're
sort of different but not really
different let's say these really groups
of clusters all right well how can we do
this so in my application code I can
write an array with host names and I can
shovel through them with some sort of
algorithm right round robin I can I can
completely outsource this decision
making to a network device and a load
balancer I can completely outsource it
to a decision maker let's say a DNS
almost unknowing round robin or some
other sort of waiting dns response so
I've relegated decisions to either a
different device
protocol a tipping a different
application or I'll take responsibility
for the application each one of them are
fine choices absolutely fine choices
each with pros and cons and dissident
advantages and disadvantages which may
or may not work in every scenario
welcome to that uncertainty that I
talked about earlier having a mature
conversation about those constraints
right as upper I want to have it in code
because I can do a lot more clever
things with it if cleverness is required
of cleverness is not required I'd rather
not deal with it so just give me a
magical virtual IP that we'll just
pretend like it's at these group of
nodes and it'll just do whatever sure
the balance or mumble mumble I've got to
do this stuff already so in that in
navigating that decision that's sort of
in navigating both the choices the pros
and cons of each and how long we expect
to have that conversation since on the
spectrum between efficiency and
thoroughness I can decide it's the array
you can decide it's the load balancer if
we say if we say well we don't know what
it is yet or we're committed to having a
conversation about it and let's say we
don't the conversation be more than an
hour okay we know the conversation to be
more than six months okay then with the
conversation to be more than a year
these these bring various you know
concerns to the table that will almost
certainly be invisible unless we have a
conversation at least at least
acknowledge
where how does how those sorts of
decisions are being made I don't know if
I kind of talked at you for a little bit
of this answered a question but I
definitely thank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
