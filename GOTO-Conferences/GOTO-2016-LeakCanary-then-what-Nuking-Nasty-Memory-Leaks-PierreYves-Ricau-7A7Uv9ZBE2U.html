work at square on the API team and one
of my pet projects is called the canary
so today we're gonna talk about that in
the best I've talked about how the
canary is built today we're not going to
do that we're actually going to start
looking into what we can do with all of
this information that the canary is
doing and how we can actually fix memory
leaks but first as with every talk here
I encourage you to engage and ask
questions anything even tricky questions
happy to take those so let's start with
sort of a story to kind of set the frame
so let's say we have a fictional
engineer and let's call him Steve he's a
bit of an artist and he wants to make a
statement about how mobile apps they
kind of take they steal the focus away
in our life you know were always like
clicking our phone so I decided to make
an app and to have the user still the
focus from the app kind of a Ven you
know revenge kind of approaching so the
app just comes to life when it's focused
and then that kind of dies down when
it's not and so I decided to decided to
use multi-window is that and so to like
it's an app that took the app it's just
the top part the bottom part is Evernote
and it's just blue and then when when
you focus outside becomes gray and then
it becomes blue it's like the most
amazing app ever so it releases that and
on the Play Store and obviously he gets
a lot of downloads right and like so
many downloads millions of dollars great
success and then it starts getting
one-star reviews because of crashes
people complain about crashes so he adds
a crash reporter in tree sap and checks
out what's going on and it turns out
that he gets a bunch of out of memory
errors Wow
so you gotta now remember what do you do
what's the solution to that well they
kind of start popping up in different
places so he realized is what about just
marking it at fix and you know it's
forget about it and move on with our
life and maybe it's not gonna happen
again
the problem is it keeps happening and
over and over and over again with
different stack traces so then he hears
about a library called the canary and
haven't ya and how it's supposed to make
everything easy and to help you fix
those things so you had you know
dependencies to use the library and then
update his application class so that you
just you know it's two lines of code
it's install and then he uses this up
again and now things are starting to
happen you know like you use the app you
try to focus I guess I need to start the
video and and yeah we're gonna wait a
little bit you know it takes a little
bit of like five seconds probably and
then don't being memory the app will
freeze bro you probably seen that if
you've used liquor in the past so what's
going on the canary is acting now the
next thing you get is a notification and
when you tap it on the notification you
get you know this Freddy thing that
might be a little bit scary like what
does it mean what are we looking at here
so let's pretend I'm Steve and I'm
looking at this and like I have no idea
what's going on but I see this view here
it sounds like this is my code okay I'm
gonna just look into that this
neo-realism view which you know it's
actually the view that renders blue it's
the most important view in the in the
app and the way it kind of focuses in
and out it's just by registering an
activity life cycle callback and
changing the Alpha of the view based on
the beauty activities resumed or post
now if you're a bit of an Android expert
you probably noticed that we're
registering an activity life cycle
callback and what does that mean we're
getting the application class which is
singleton and we're adding a listener to
it so that every time an activity is
resumed and pause we you know we learn
about it we get we're gonna call back
the problem is we're never unregistering
that callback so our view instance is
leaking right so what's the fix will fix
sounds obvious
you know when the views detach just
remove the call back from the
application so we fixed the problem but
did we really fix the problem what did
we do here I think what we did here what
Steve did and what we all kind of do
when dealing with this is that we kind
of try to guess what's going on and we
see a bunch of classes that look
familiar and we jump into them and we
look at them and like oh I think there's
a leak here so this is the leak and we
fixed the leak right and sometimes that
works but when it doesn't work you're by
yourself and you're like I don't know
what to do this is probably just an
Android leak and then you forget about
it and move on with your life so
intuition helps but and that's what
we're using here the problem is
intuition is that it makes you take a
shortcut that's the whole point of it
but you want you don't want to take
logical shortcuts and you need to kind
of step back go back to the first
principles apply some sort of scientific
method because you know we're engineers
it's kind of what we do
so let's come back to school and talk
about class well so we have a class
class a and then we have class B Wow and
there is we're gonna class C and we're
gonna create an instance of Class A all
right that's pretty easy so what happens
when I call this method triumvirate like
at the end of it
well if I call this method at the end of
it a is garbage collected because
obviously there's nothing keeping a
reference to a so it's useless and it's
going to be average collecting oh it's a
garbage collector goal and it will be
garbage collected in the future now
let's come back to a let's say that we
also create an instance B and an
instance C all right not very
interesting so far but then we add a B
field on a and you know see field on B
and an a field on C and still nothing
still the same right but now we're gonna
start setting references so we're gonna
change the code so that a dot B
references B same thing for C same thing
for a so we have these three objects in
the reference to each other
now what happens at the end of this
method
well again three objects are garbage
collected right
they all have incoming references to
them and they all reference all the
things but they're just connected
together so when nothing y'all is rate
retaining that nothing else is retaining
them they just get garbage collected
well that's cool now let's add a static
field right we're gonna make a static
field single son and we're gonna
reference a we're gonna passivate the a
reference to the single time now what's
going on if I try to if when I lead the
method
nothing gets garbage collects it because
the entire group of object is held in
memory so the static a singleton here
it's called a GC root that's what I've
shown as the yellow box it's something
that's never gonna be garbage collected
it's a reference that is never cleared
so you could think of static fields you
can also think of local variables on
threads or reference is held by native
code like binder for example so that's
interesting but let's like zoom out and
think about the Java memory if you think
about it you entire memory is pretty
much a bunch of GC roots that have
references to objects that have
references to other objects it is a
directed graph you can think of the Java
memory as a directed graph and so we can
apply some graph theory to it like some
very tiny things so we can look at the
the block of objects over here they are
not connected to anything they're kind
of on their own there are islands so
they can be garbage collected right and
they're gone so an object can be garbage
collected it's if it's not connected in
some way to a GC root and that's very
important because this is what creates
memory leaks so let's say that we do the
red thing here is an activity and on
destroy has been called by Android on
that activity so we know that it's
useless at that point and that nothing
really needs a to use it and it
shouldn't be in use but it's still you
know holding on to a lot of memory and
we want it to be garbage collected
and so this activity is held in memory
because there's a path there's a bunch
of references that eventually reference
the activity and that's why it's kept in
memory right so the activity is leaking
so if we wanted to figure out why it's
leaking we have to find a path from
those yellow boxes to the activity it's
called a path to GC roots all right so
that's what it looks like in that
example there's in the Java memory
usually you end up with an infinity of
fast because there are so many objects
that are connected together so you could
look at like 10,000 paths that's not
very helpful
what's more helpful is if there's let's
say there's only one leak one bad
reference that's causing the activity to
leak then there is an affinity of path
but there is one that is the shortest
path that is guaranteed to go through
that bad reference so instead of looking
at 10,000 paths we can just look at one
and we're going to look at the shortest
because that's less information to deal
with so this is the shortest path in
that case and then that's what actually
what lis canary gives us the display
that we saw this is exactly what it's
showing in a kind of a textual way now
this is interesting but this is where
like the entire trick starts to apply ok
we have this path what do we do now
what we do is we identify the objects on
the path there are supposed to still be
in them in memory and the objects are
supposed to be gone and it's not just
going to be one for example maybe the
top green one is the application class
it should stay around forever because
it's a singleton maybe the first red one
is an fu class and the second red one is
the activity and the view is detach
should be gone so if we're able to kind
of identify the ones that should be in
memory and the ones that should not be
in memory then we can sort of splits are
the paths in sort of two areas and we
can identify the the connection that's
creating the problem all right so
what's gonna happen is in for every
single leak the top part is always going
to be objects that should be in memory
and the bottom part is always going to
be objects that should not be in memory
and the key part for you is to identify
each of the two zones it's not going to
interleave so the top is always green
the bottom is always red and the the
place where it changes is where there's
a bad reference that you need to kill
and if you kill that bad reference then
the object is not connected to GC with
anymore and the whole thing can be
garbage collected all right so that was
a little bit of theory and now we're
going to look at a couple of examples
the idea is I think it's nice in the
abstract we need to kind of practice to
get the idea of how to fix these things
so let's look back on the first example
right we had this dictionary like this
very simple app so the first thing is
you start looking at that and you might
not be familiar with this guy here
there's like a dollar one if I'm if I'm
Steve I just started writing Android
apps and I'm like oh what is this class
that's name dollar one and then there's
a field called dostala' zero what is
this so let's get onto that so we saw
that code and we saw that there's a life
cycle callback is actually an anonymous
class right and that's what what it is
so in in Java this might be of use to a
lot of you but Java doesn't actually
support anonymous classes it's a lie
it's all a lie you write an anonymous
class and then what it does it compiles
it to a real class and it names you a
dollar some number and the number is
based on where it's defined so the first
one in store one the second one is
dollar two in that class and then the
name of the field is going to be like
this dollar zero so if you come back
here and when we look at this tick trace
now we have a better understanding of
what's going on we can see that at the
top there's a class called activity
thread it has a field called called as
current activity thread and that field
points to an instance of activity thread
which has a field called M initial
application which self points to an
instance of the application which has a
of lifecycle callbacks Exeter Exeter
Exeter scared of how you read these
things right so like I said we can spit
the leak trace in two areas the good
stuff and the bad stuff and once we are
able to do that we know that the place
where things need to be fixed is where
there is difference between the two so
here that would be the if you look at
that you can see that the view should be
it should not be in memory the lifecycle
callbacks should not be in memory but
the list of lifecycle callbacks should
probably be in memory so let's start
from scratch and kind of do it step by
step if I'm looking at something fresh I
know that my activity is leaking because
that's what the canary reported because
the activity is destroyed I also know
that the application class is a single
term and it's always there so it's not
never leaking right so if I can say the
application class is good and then
everything above it is good as well I
don't even have to care about it and
then there's a view here and we kind of
know that the view should be gone
already but let's check that out how do
we figure that out and so the canary has
a thing called a share info and it's
gonna basically share a bunch of text
that gives you more detail it's kind of
a textual representation of this it
looks like that and you can kind of see
the same like references Valvo by the
same view but at the bottom there's a
detail section and the detail section in
mice sounds like it's kind of crazy it's
just a ton of stuff but it's all the
values of the static fields and the
fields in the objects on the chain and
so if you slide down through the view
which have here and we start looking at
fields we can see that there is a field
called M attached info which is no so
what is M attached in for well if we
open the view class we can see that the
method called is attached to window
actually checks for M attached info so
being null so when when M attachment for
is no the view is not attached to the
window and if the users not attached to
the window then it doesn't really have a
business being around it should probably
be garbage collected because who needs a
view that's not attached to the window
right that's kind of our hints that this
view should be garbage collected so we
that we can like go up and include the
view and then the call back being kind
of tied to the view should also be gone
so we're pretty much back to where we
were I added the last the list basically
you so am activity lifecycle callbacks
it's an ArrayList and then you can see
that it goes down and your release is
implemented by an array and then the
first limit of your waypoints to the
callbacks right okay that's good so we
saw the first principles that get it
let's get into more interesting leagues
so when you install it canary and and
like you pass that in you know you make
an application and you have everybody in
your company use the dev application
with the canary on what happens when
when the canary is triggered and
notification shows up so you'd think you
know people will sit down bring it to
you fix it well know what actually
happens is that you swipe the
notification away and you just do
something else and you pretend like you
didn't see that there was a leak look
it's kind of annoying and you don't want
to like change what you are doing so we
had this problem we thought of a way to
fix it which is to automate the leak
reporting so that they would be uploaded
in background so that was great great
idea but nobody wants to write a
back-end for that I certainly didn't so
what we did is we decided to upload to a
crash reporter and to fake a crash so we
basically you can fake a crash with
making a fake stack trace this is how
you make a fake exception and then you
can then pass to a fake stack trace to a
fake or to a crash reporter and then we
have you know we reuse back snag and we
had a bug snag leak uploader that
converted the leak trace into a fake
stack trace and then it's so cloudy to
black snag which then gives us this this
looks like a stack trace but it's not
but you can see because like there is at
traveling object and then the method
name is like zero which is weird or 97
but there's another tab where we
actually added the kind of meaningful
information so the nice part here is
that if you get five times the same leak
going to lead to the same stack trace
and then back slag or crashlytics is
going to group it together so you get
grouping and counting and you know the
leaks that happen the most often so
that's really nice but then there's
another time give me a second
oh sorry there's another tab which
provides like the same useful
information
so let's look into that one what's that
about and you know if you do a quick
scan you could say oh there's support
library in there I don't want to know
about that let's just walk away but no
we don't want any leaks so we're gonna
look into every leak so I start with the
top we can see that there's a looper at
the top and it's under the field that's
holding on to it is called main main
looper so you're pretty sure that this
is the looper of the main thread and the
main thread is around forever the looper
of the main thread is run forever so you
know that's good
another at the bottom we can see that
there's the leaking activity all right
that's it this one should be dead then
we're just going to poke around let's
look at the middle one there's a class
called rank you and it has a field
called M actions and what is this like
who who's ever looked at the code of run
queue before the room
no one no one that's good but Android is
open source so we're gonna do that right
now
right so we have the view route info
which is actually the view that is that
at the root of your view hierarchy it's
not exposed by the Android SDK but
that's how it is in the code and rank U
is an inner class of that and run queue
has a method called post delayed which
basically lets you pass it a row normal
and it's gonna wrap it in a handler
action and then it's gonna just add this
action to M actions which is a list of
actions right that's easy and then
there's another method that's called
post and it just goes postulate with a
delay of 0 right so so far so good so
what it looks like is that when you call
post you are actually in queueing a
runnable into M actions and when is it D
queued
let's read the Javadoc Javadoc says the
work is executed during the next call to
perform travel souls on the thread so
this is the view routes this is the one
that handles the traversal that are
going to measure your layouts and it's
basically saying I'm keeping things here
until I get the next traversal and then
who's calling that say if the run queue
is used to NQ penning work from views
when no handler is attached so this only
happens when you're in between two
traversals and there is no view
hierarchy around to execute the work so
let's verify that if you look at the
view class and we open person and put
some animation in post we can see that
the first thing it does is get the
imitation flow which we so can be know
if it's the views node attached and you
know if it's not know first four wheel
into the choreographer or the handler
but if it's no get the run queue and
post to it all right so that seems to
confirm what the Javadoc was saying so
the idea is at that point we don't have
a view we don't have a hierarchy the
view is detached start attached to a
window but we're posting to that queue
and next time we get a new view
hierarchy we're going to execute those
things and where is get rank you well
it's the static method where's the rent
you coming from so it's coming from this
get run cue method and what it is it's
stored in a thread local so you you you
you know a thread local is it's a
variable for which each thread has its
own value but for the purpose of this
you can just think of it as a static
thread that's pointing to the rent you
accept every thread as sorry as a static
field that's pointing to rank you and
then every thread gets its own so then
if we look at the rank method then it's
basically if the accuse not know which
on the queue otherwise create one store
it and return all right that's pretty
easy so that brings us to two that where
we can see we can start to understand
the things that are below like right
here that thread out local values it's
not the run you feel that we were saying
but that's basically how thread locals
are stored on honest right on Android so
the rank you you know it's the static
field
doesn't sound like there's anything
wrong there so it just holds onto a list
of action so the rank you and it's list
of actions should actually stick in
memory so if you just go down there yeah
there's like to rank you actions the
list itself not the elements in the list
but the full list itself should be in
memory so that's kind of we now have
these things in there so let's look at
this weird class name I've compared to
the gate in pole 323 what is that well
it's an instance of app compat delegate
so it turns out that if you use the
super library on Android you have to
extend app compat activity and what app
compat activity does is IP also delegate
and it delegates all of the calls to
that delegate and then you have
different implementations of the
delegate based on the android version
and so because it creates an instance
right there when the activity is
destroyed the delegate should be
destroyed as well right there's one
instance per activity so we can come
back here and now we know that delegate
should be gone all right so that's the
reasoning that you keep applying when
you look at a little bit trace so let's
look at the one above so V nine dollar
one so it's an anonymous class so I
talked about how there's been a bunch of
implementation and V 23 actually extends
v 9 eventually so let's open the v 9
class and the dollar one class is this
runnable i'm invalidates panel maneuver
normal and then it gets posted on a wii
on a view with special animation right
and so if that view was not attached we
already know what happens you post our
animation the views not attached it gets
put into the run queue and it will be d
queued and executed the next time that
the the next time that there is a view
hierarchy but what if you activity is
destroyed and the user goes away and
there's not an activity for another 30
minutes then the runner ball is still in
the queue for another 30 minutes and it
leaves the entire view hierarchy and so
you're basically keeping the entire view
Turkey and all of its bitmap for another
30 minutes until you get some other
activity so it is a leak and so the way
you could fix that I don't know that
this is the right way but one way it
could be
well when the delegates know that the
activity is destroyed just remove the
call back from from the run queue
basically so this was an interesting an
interesting sort of leak we actually
filed an issue this is or this is a real
leak that we found last week so I
haven't seen any response from the the
support library team but they are
looking into it so like we need to give
them time eventually it's going to be
fixed it's not like one of the biggest
leaks but I encourage you the reason I'm
showing that is because I want to
encourage you to do the same next time
you find a leak Android is open source
you can go and even if it's not in your
code which by the way it's still kind of
likely to be in your car like most of
the time it's in our code not in the
support library but if it's not in your
code don't just drop it on the floor
look into it look into the code try to
figure out what's going on and then
report a bug on the iOS P issue tracker
because if we all do that then we make a
movie make android better and then
everybody profits from it all right so
let's look at one that's maybe a little
bit harder it was harder for me I was
really confused by it originally so this
is the link to new leaked rice today I
checked for to make sure that I wasn't
like showing any bad names or any
sensitive information that shouldn't be
in there but I think it's good but this
is real square code so so let's let's so
let's do the same like so I said don't
use intuition or rather don't use
intuition to make shortcut logical
shortcuts however intuition helps here
to know to find one good thing to look
at right like there's a lot of
references or a lot of objects here and
I kind of don't want to look at every
one of them because if I can find one in
the middle and I know it's good or I
know it's bad that
I can bring down the green part or bring
up the red part alright so we're gonna
be kind of smart about this and I can
see that right in the middle there's a
class called path guard passcode and
lock view this is a view and I kind of
know how do we verify if if you should
be around or not right we already saw
that so let's look at that view
and check if it should be garbage
collected so same thing we go to the
details and we can see that imitation 4
is known so the view is detached
we can assume that it should be gone at
that point which is really nice because
now we can just make all that red that's
good you know that we don't have to look
below that the leak has to be somewhere
above the that fault
then let's let's keep going another
anonymous class so guess what I names
classes they tend to be very often
presents when you have a leak because of
the natural you know they always have an
outer reference to the class where they
are declared so that tends to create
leaf it's not always the case so don't
jump to conclusions now here it's kind
of an interesting one it's called dollar
one dollar for dollar one so you can
have like any number of dollars it's
because it's an anonymous class in
anonymous class so let's we can that's
so we have this basket and knock view
what it does is we have a small utility
method called weight for measure or you
pass a view and a callback and it calls
you back when the view has been measured
and so that's to first I don't know miss
class that we're saying seeing but the
second one is where things are
interesting what we're doing is we're
getting a request creator object which
is a Picasso objects Picasso is are kind
of open source image library to make it
very easy to deal with images on Android
and so here this is something that
basically makes a request after the view
has been measured and you get a call
back when it's successful or error so
you know let's look at the Javadoc of
this request that into method because
because the guys they're smart and
they're telling you what you should do
and what you shouldn't do so when you
call into the Java Docs is
asynchronously fool
feels the request into the specified
image view and invokes the target
callback know right so far so good but
there's also a note which is the
callback program is a strong reference
and will prevent your activity of
fragments from being average collected
haha
so I was like yeah that's it
and it says also if you you know use
this method is it strongly recommended
you you invoke an adjacent because of
the cancel request call to prevent
temporary leaking so obviously sounds
like we forgot to do that so I opened up
the pass code and another you guess what
we were actually already calling cancel
request what so at that point I was like
okay I don't know what's going on I was
kind of lost I decided to take a look at
Picasso what cancel request actually
does and so you open together like
that's the cancel request method and
essentially what it has but it does a
bunch of things but he has a least of a
map of target to actions in it you know
takes your imagery which is target
removes it from the map gives you the
action back and then it goes cancel on
the action right and so what happens
when you call cancel on the action a
bunch of things but in the superclass
there's a boolean called canceled and it
becomes true and the reason I'm going
there is and what I do when I poke at
the code is I look for state because I
know that that I can go and see if that
state matches in the details that I have
about the leak all right so if I come
back to the image view action which is
an action then I can look at the states
Oh cancel these faults wait I call the
request cancel but Ken's all these false
can't happen because requests cancel
sets cancel to true this is very
confusing so it really looks like the
leak is definitely there but we have no
idea what's going on so it's very much
shows us that the leak is that basically
we can very easily reason now we know
that the Emmy imagery action should be
gone it's tied to the image view the
past and past : review should be gone
we know that the the list of actions
themselves are probably should still be
around so we know that the leak is there
but we don't know why it's happening and
that's where things can
get kind of annoying like what do you do
now we found the leak but we don't know
how we created it well we did another
hack so what if I could poke around the
memory and like figure out more things
well turns out that's what a heap dump
is for which is what leakin our uses the
Canary kind of takes a shortcut and
visits you the quick view but you can do
it the old way which is by poking around
in memory so you know we thought well we
kind of need those hip jumps when the
leaks happen so we need to upload them
but again I'm too lazy to build a
back-end right I don't want to do that
so what do you do instead well it turns
out that slack has a very nice API for
uploading things or chats or whatever
and you can upload a heap dump just like
so and that's true we have a slack
channel that just gets a bunch of leak
reported and you can see that it
actually has a binary so far so good
it's like hasn't really reached out to
us telling us to not do that I'm
expecting that someday they're gonna be
really unhappy but maybe if everybody
starts doing that we'll see anyway it's
very nice it's very practical because
then I basically I go on back snag I
just go there I find that leak and if I
need more information I go and slack so
the thing with slack is that it's hard
to like get that grid view that I
haven't backs now but when I look for
something specific I just search in
slack and then I download the binary and
then I have it so I downloaded
downloaded the hip them from slack then
so we know that the first thing we do in
in this Picasso class when you can sort
cancel a request is remove the targets
from the map right to the map should not
have that entry anymore so let's look at
the map search for this action object so
I open the hip dump with something
called your kids which I believe you
need a license for that there might be
some free licenses the other option is
to use Eclipse memory analyzer tool Matt
I like your kid for I guess two reasons
one it works with Android hip terms and
for eclipse match
have to convert them first and then you
can load them but the other reason is
that it is more beautiful it feels
better
I don't know Eclipse just feels bad and
wrong so there's like something about
that that turns me off anyway so I
started you know easy you search for
Picasso and something interesting pops
up which is up there are two instances
okay I'll just look at the two and so I
look at the first one and I see that the
target to action map has zero entries
okay
and the second one the target to action
that has one entry and one of those
entry is the imageview action the one
that I was kind of looking for and so
and you can see that the reference is
like it's an image room so that's
interesting
that means that the action is still in
there and hasn't been removed which maps
with the idea that cancel was false so
again don't jump to conclusion it's not
because we're seeing like the image
reaction in here that this means that
this is the cause of the leaks like we
can see strong references here but this
sorry we see weak references here it's a
weak hash map so this is not it's by
itself causing a leak but it sort of
plays into it so we have that action and
it's not canceled and not removed it
means that cancel request wasn't called
but we saw that we call cancel requests
so I came back and I looked at this
class and I was like okay we do call
that method let's look at what the
Picasso instance is on that object so I
looked at the Picasso object and then I
opened it up and I looked at target to
action and I see zero here so I had two
instances of Picasso and one of them had
the target to action that I added and
the other one had zero but the one that
had zero was the one that was referenced
by the view so it means that this is the
wrong Picasso basically what's going on
here is that we're getting a request
creator from Picasso from another
Picasso instance and then we call cancel
request on the wrong Picasso instance so
we're canceling nothing and that's how
we were creating that memory
we were unregistering from the wrong one
I couldn't have figured that out with I
mean I maybe could have in retrospect
looking at the data I found some ways
that I could have done that but it's
much easier when you can poke around
memory so that's why downloading the
heap dump eventually really helps you
alright so I kind of go through a
summary so the idea the general idea is
don't run to conclusions you're going to
see a bunch of classes that you know
hold on for a minute think about what it
means and then try to you know look for
instances there should be then the first
thing is like go back to first
principles don't jump to conclusions
then try to find the objects that should
be dead and the objects that should be
alive this is really what's going to
help you figure out what's wrong and
then you can you know split the leak
trace into two places find the reference
to kill and hopefully you can you can
fix your back so this is last night you
can write this session send questions
and that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
