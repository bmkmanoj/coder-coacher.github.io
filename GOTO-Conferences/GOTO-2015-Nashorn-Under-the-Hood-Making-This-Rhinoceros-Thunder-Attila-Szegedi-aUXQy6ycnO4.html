saying that whatever I stay here please
don't trust me if you
product purchasing decisions so this is
my without saying that for whatever I
want really convenient so talking about
mass but I think by now most people know
what mass for years and some basic an
extra 50 at one time that's built into
JDM but there's a lot of great things
about it among those is that it's it's
completely open source right now so all
the development is ninety openjdk so all
the codes out there we openjdk twinkle
it has shipped a standard part of Oracle
sir jobs and an additional start of
evolution eight and it is accessible
through standard JavaScript API it
doesn't meaning you don't really have to
learn an API to use if the descrip take
the eyes that are in Java Sinjar six are
used to access it it does have its own
package if you want Taylor some aspects
of the users Union staff we will
actually
in my case presentation you can run from
command winders jjs languages are
conciliating there is a lot to a face in
java that's after jay-z and jps which is
the ps4 java processes and then
obviously the javascript launcher that
uses jollies their name jjs another
interesting tidbit that will also be
emphasized in this talk is that that's
what does not have an interpreter it is
completely the codes always been filed
and byte codes so what we end up running
is always job classes within an anything
pilot and loaded into the kdms has the
curb execute why would we even want to
create a nice form well it is we wanted
something that has full Xcode 5
compliance in one more than JavaScript
with one code base we had to bind them
before but it was showing its age and
one thing that it's not really quite
often brought up is that it's also
security-minded used to integrate mind
before and wine ilysm created before the
java to security model actually came in
place and with nostrils associated as
part of the jdk aston disick us to the
internal architecture has a lot of
attention to actually do well all the
all the intricacies in the java security
model we also visit as a proving ground
for more dynamic and we are also using
it to flesh out the requirements for
general general Mann clan just support
from the Java platform which is pretty
much my long-term goal with all of this
we do a lot of performance work
javascript is a wonderful target
language if you enjoy the compiler
optimizations as I do because it is a
super reason to write very slow language
runtime just the one ace interpreter and
box everything is objects and hate runs
it is diluted runs you can spend a
lifetime writing with musicians in your
runtime and the more than any of the
languages less is explicitly given
statically the more work you're
optimizing compiler has to do actually
you could provide with exceptional
performance so yeah I think
job security and not very well this
however organizations of i equal wealth
so actual all the shows and practices
for integrating mask on that will make
you make show that when you use it it is
actually faster now when when I accepted
to give this talk this is first time
giving this talk and I realize that by
by giving that talk about how do you
need to use nuts and in order to make
things faster I saw painting myself in a
corner really so I set up myself am
because I mean I know this runtime so
why don't I just make it so that it's
fast without any intervention in your
heart right so basically my saying that
hey I don't want I and part of the table
we drove this one time and here's what
you do need to do in order to perform
really well I might as well admit in
comet assay I have an idea what how I'm
doing it because why would I just made
it so listen in to do anything so as as
a experience Speaker I realize that
there's really one way to go about it
which is MSI's everything with it well
and of course shift the blame for
everything that isn't so I will be
trying to do that in the next few slides
so it works well with in it if it
doesn't work well it's your fault i will
show you the nice things first so NASA's
internal
smart by now we did actually a lot of of
fairly crazy stuff with a small team in
a relatively small amount of time job 18
came out none of this actually shipped
most of this these three things that you
see here actually shake the jar 18 of
840 we do specialize population of
functions such a path invoke a function
with int parameters we will compile a
special version of that function that
takes advantage of the fact that the
parameters passed it begins with bubbles
generic objects once we start generating
code we would actually do static type
inference or local variables so that as
far as possible will try to keep
everything not now and primitive and for
those things that you cannot figure out
how to we can improve statically at
compile time that this particular
variables an end and in jobs it's really
easy to get at a bit or point we can
prove anything about a expression are
taking such easy as all easy simple as
between the property from an object
containing an element from
invoking a function what will the return
type of all of these beings you have no
idea generation already so after their
this as we also build a framework where
you can we do optimistic assumptions
about these types Compton it's
optimistic assumption basically your
mystic sumption is hey let's just zoom
it will be a 32-bit signed integer why
not because JMM is those well and when
those are evaluated need to do something
we'll see whether something is but where
the NASA can blame you where I need to
shift blame somewhere else it's how do
you integrate it into your job based
system and whether you are structuring
your code in a ways that are too hard
for the run time to actually reason out
so i want to show you how the parameter
pie specialized population works what we
have here is that if you find one single
function which squares 11 is passed into
it and then you looking twice once with
an end and once with something that's
not an int it will actually generate two
versions of the code first version of
the code will taken it and hope that it
can return an end and as you can see
it's a very simple JM Curley close the
two arguments in books multiplication
function is that doesn't do I'm all
which is just a built-in Michael and
there's a reason for that and the reason
is you have an overflow because numbers
can just over
because javascript in human can specify
a level it only knows about 64-bit
voting point numbers so we cannot just
overflow multiplication we must smartly
then expand tightened down and if you
later on invite you to invoke it with a
with a double parameter it will generate
enough another version of the function
and I'm showing this
still getting used to so
square function here it is cinco isn't a
slide and if you're not one is code with
dash trim coat
a lot of things happen and I will just
start to try to find be so first time
its involved as you can see we will
generate the version that takes event
returns names and it does what I said
once the arguments doesn't indicate as
multiplication returns and some later on
here you can actually see the out to the
prints the print the result saying 500
square 200,000 afterwards it will
generate the second version of the code
as you can see all comers lazily
generated Nazareth it's so bayesian
cogeneration that he does not even
compile them to talk level program until
you actually invoke it so in compiler
script we will do some our signal do
some preparations will store some
metadata that speeded for efficient
he'll generation later on we will take a
generation program because anything be a
special cases we then 10 special case
server if a particular variable function
is not yet generated we will only
generate it as part of invocation so if
they did is when you invoke the function
if it's not linked yet then if the code
is not ready then the compiler kicks a
composite function links it and goes on
so as you can see in the perversion of
the
after we printed the result of the
invoking the installation of the
function and at the end of it because
there is a lot of other things we're
going to have the actual for that so if
you you just run the same curve without
without written code then obviously you
just get the expected not without any
without any conservation frills this
parameter types of accumulation helps a
lot Stefan type inference so i will i
will be using the octane trip the
benchmark later on to demonstrate things
and here's a little hot function from
from the crypto benchmark this this one
is the core of the benchmark is doing a
lot of calculations you can see there's
a lot of inter-ethnic bitwise and shifts
with 30 phrase multiplications additions
etc etc so all of everything going on so
last one if you do not use of a mystic
night in this kind of typing going
presume everything is an end if it's
definitely not on by default we have
shifted Java 8240 but it's off by lethal
and you are going to type something like
this
is not so bad a laser pointer here
excellent so
too much caffeine
so as you can see these will begin sand
this these will begins but that pretty
much the story starts here the
parameters are weird because some of
those are objects even though they
promised so we have to be in some of
those with bubbles it again depends of
what could be in fur at the color site
and then generate a particular signature
but as you can see problem spots
decrement operator ends up promoting its
its operand double and here's as we have
multiplications they might have folder
in begging the doubles and oh my god
this guy here l it became an object why
well because in a non optimistic world
there is an array read here and can't
know what will you get that from that
array so what if it's a string and if
it's a string then javascript being
wonderful language that it is this +
operators must act as concatenation of
directors right so has to presume that
this pool l even though you know this
will be an end it conservative it has to
assume an object and C becomes a double
because of the this multiplication here
and that says the sea is returned than
the return type of the function cell is
another so not so bad but nothing to
write
either with a mistake I babe if you tell
about mystic typing then as a consumer
or the the color sites will make a lot
of assumptions that that the parameters
are gains and all the trouble spots are
gone because women presume that the
current never overflows consult the
figure in our because if you knew that
but Kepler when we get a positive number
in the first place unfortunately so we
will presume this doesn't overflow we
will presume this multiplication don't
overflow and the addition of a powerful
either or so this my stadion and if able
supras unit these guys are ends then
this place will remain an int as well we
will eventually figure out that these
two expressions are not ends but that's
all so this is great if you want to
compile this we get code that's as
efficient as if you just wrote that same
code with types in job again
can run run run run love it and an awful
lot of coal gas generators all have to
find the one that we are interested in a
3-1
this is this is the last version pro as
you can see l will need to look very
deeply into this but as you can see it's
all interpretations all the way there's
nothing else it's just that at various
places when you invoke dynamically
they're trying to retrieve an element
from an array we will just make
assumption that it's all an impt and if
we scroll down all the way to hopefully
finding a local variable table you can
see that this is an object w is an
object is an object really this w array
of objects everything else is in it
which is great
so synergy that's a little that's a
great word that's been hijacked by I
marketing but it really means that
multiple agents are collaborating to
achieve something that's more than the
sum of its parts and its taste really
can do that because look at this this is
twice as higher order function it's a
function that takes about a functional
Isaac twice on a break so what are the
types of this actually be so if we
improve twice with when we have an
increment function with acid five what
types will end up with and then we
invoke it with 5.1 again what do we end
up with so what's nice is that if you
just back from home if you do this
yeah here it is so what happens if we
want this is
we will have that version twice
generated which gets an in corporate and
curves that can return an int result and
then what it will do is it will if they
be loading its if you'll be looking its
functional parents and try to invoke
them and hope that they to look me in
the end and in that case we'll return
again in cases can be turning it and
then sometime later after we generated
this you can immediately generally the
first version of the increment function
adjusting some intimate as Anthony
really does that we can infer that below
did we add one to it and we will
tournament hoping they're a bit also and
then some time later when we do we will
do a version that takes a double but
will still be hoping it actually will be
able to return an end we don't know
whether the function supply will be
returning the double so let's say I
start running and first thing it does it
for votes air so we will need to cap is
now again the increment but we need to
generate new
that makes an SS tactical email that
returns a double because static analysis
actually figured this out so we'll have
a double-double version and now the
execution goes back and what happens is
that we actually create a new curve for
double we're disgusting location already
realizes hey I supposed to occasionally
turn a double button maybe the second
one will still return an int so I might
still be able to overall have an int
result and then this will prove to be
false as well so we will be generating a
yet another version of the function this
time twice takes a double it turns a
double if you invoke twice the function
and go to through these times it now now
is the day lil return double so your own
type will also be a double so what
happened here is and I can show you the
same thing you know nicer way first we
have to train the which kicks off the
whole thing it hopes that it might be
getting back again and as you can see
they also be the tights that I showing
the world square brackets so we know
already that the increment will be will
be returning double the function itself
it hopes that even if it passes on
doubling ever getting back and get it so
that's they that's this part and then it
how's that if it passes that into
it will get them in so can we turn it in
but then this will actually proved to be
false they function return the number
but it still hopes that if it passes it
into another implication nice to get
back in it it doesn't and in that case
already these are propagated elements so
there's a lot of conservation one on the
I am the Kings version still amazing
memory we keep them so tight
specialization means that what function
has going to have multiple PI
specialization live better dice relation
based parameters live so if you later
gonna get involved with an end it will
pay the penalty of finding the double
vision because it will actually go to me
into version that we call the
international bit of the increment so
basically what happens here is that legs
compilation parameter type
specialization static type inference and
optimistic typing work hand-in-hand to
make sure that you always generate
various chattering up the tightest
version of the code that can run the
data that is thrown added so that we
don't why don't you double sort of
objects anytime you don't have to so how
many of us running come by the way
because everything is shown you right so
me to replace the code while it's
running so the twice function when it
calls ink and get back and double
instead of them into just have one
within Inc version anymore so what it
has to do with at this point you don't
actually have
elaborate system exception handlers
there that make it so that it juts out
into the caller the quarter is linked so
that it catches the exception divides
into the compiler compiles the new
version of the code then it compiles a
long time continuation because we need
to resume the computation from that
point 1 and it jumps back into the
continuation that's nice and officially
manage to do all of this without
containing weather tricks so it's a few
micro solution so if you listen to
something that's not an Oracle janian
nice from the work would be able to work
off its magic all right so from some
integrations now let's write small and
application there is a ton of very
exciting web frameworks out there these
days vertex is using javascript and
masculine as one fits implementations
there are job boards of know Jas etc etc
they all have a huge drawback which is
that I
never actually found the time to learn
anything so I will just use the plain
old server ap I chose my age I guess I
just do jack is embedded server so I
also i mean you have to you have to
forgive me for i meant spending most of
my time to compile and so i don't really
do web applications a lot so it will be
ugly and the example itself is some of
the tribe of bear with me so what i do
is i am taking this google thing
benchmark crypto which is doing an RSA
encryption decryption and the logic
isn't calibrated in JavaScript it is a
reasonable accommodation it doesn't do
any higher I'm not showing anything
that's ILO because JavaScript doesn't
have built-in I libraries and so you can
just end up using jobs I facilities and
there is really no JavaScript
performance story in that so it performs
just as well as a few multisim job right
so it doesn't move loudly in an
application it shows you a text and then
shows you a text field and then it
encrypts it shows the encrypted version
then
verification shows you the decrypted
code so a little texted should match the
original plain text so how you will
office and what we talked about this is
that JavaScript the language in a lot of
dynamic languages don't give you any
kind of a specification for compile time
one time etc I mean JavaScript execution
specification is pretty much here's some
source code here's how you might it
doesn't tell you anything about data
sharing Isabel it does help and have us
a story it doesn't tell you need to
compile it it doesn't even tell you need
to parse it for I mean sort of does
because there are early errors that are
syntactic errors that need to be cold
before you start running but that's
pretty much it it doesn't even tell me
that you need to parse it it doesn't end
in person pilot run it tells you hear
some source code here's how you run it
and when you integrate we need to
yourself figure out a sweet spot between
the source code and running the code
that fits your expectations so what
things you can do is that when episode
qwest you can just pissed and she ate
brand new script engine and just
evaluate the JavaScript code in it
because in all phases expectation is the
most plane approaches you can take just
I have served i will show you in a
moment so we're going to be evaluate
function which is involved a navigation
to drink less you can just ask your
script engine manager to get you learn
askim engine you evaluate the script in
doing that comes from an interview world
and then just trim your variables into
it and I way the encryption type into
the decryption functions and return that
you can do it it will work so
maino my classes with a number item so I
can just go get confused which one is
the next one that needs to be
demonstrated so here's the most name one
it's doing pretty much what I just show
you socially or slide if you love this
guy
I have an action venture man like here
that does to you I began of course try
the ey as well so if we do this and hit
submit we will wait for a bit now it's
also bad as the curtain two seconds it's
horrible so if you have to address and
we test for you know thousand requests
come on should I time I am killing you I
I was thinking you know I could really
cut down the slides if I just had the
audience stare at a blank screen wait if
it's not like that super exciting except
with you I mean is not snail races now
we won't we won't be doing this and it's
horrible source for those few requests
those 27
to do it this time as you can see the
the percentages is horrible so what's
happening here as you can see the most a
post on television how does it performs
not really well so these are the record
it's that run around and that I've been
subjected to a fool right now what's its
doing is that if you if you try to
visualize James ova what's happening
then I mean this is artificial message
is blocking the raking pole but then you
have something like dining hall cycling
internal called site initialize code
installer run install class create
living so what's happening here classes
are being generated bootstrap the link
each and every time you started from
scratch because you're creating a new
engine you don't have a contact doesn't
know that there was a previous engine
that only compile this code code is
loaded parts compiled linked every
single time so you can do this probably
will be happy so what's the solution
let's try using a single engine instance
so the the significant difference here
is that you just we just have static
engine instance and silver through all
the lumiose of static you use something
that is bounded the soul of context then
want to be dependent
and lose the extra point of the triangle
demonstrate and then you can just take
this engine create new bindings this
interesting thing and then evaluate your
script into it and then invoke
encryption and decryption by retrieving
the functions which are first class
objects by name us knowledge that this
as the actual arguments and then create
a result so this guy actually performs
much better so if I were to run this if
if whatever reason I finish this talk
early and you don't feel like rushing
out for lunch in life have fun with
running these otherwise others show
slides and ask you completely fluent in
the first light I told in an hour
alignment so this looks much better
right so in those 50 percentile is 200
issues in the seconds 99 is not so bad I
can fit this oral yeah it's happiness is
but it's already much better however
behind percentile there's three seconds
and that's the first time you vote the
engine that's when it actually needs to
parse the well no they skipped classes
itself the engine itself is building and
benefits 222 real person compile and a
new strap and ask oneself because it
wasn't loaded before so there is
actually called cash into the
single-engine ease and that's a really
good reason to use a single engine
instance nice ones also smart enough
that if you pass an URL neither to Apple
then it will it actually checks whether
the meter that it has been is a URL
reader and if it is it extracts the URL
sees whether it already has curved
compiled for a script coming from the
Torah and it will just use the already
cached class for it so it's much better
this is much better in this regard so
even though here you see you you are a
leader so you are opening the reader in
your passing to eville it'll actually
didn't read the file if you look in the
URL said ya see this already so it will
just use the cash but still it's a good
practice to just be opening readers
because it's I oh the end sometime
imprima offered so if you don't even
read the script I will open a reader so
another thing that you can do is you can
usually compatible interface and
compiled script which is basically the
script energy and we cast something
that's called compatible and this is
also part of the JavaScript API and then
you can compile it the script and obtain
hopefully optimized version of ppl park
version and then later what you can do
to just evaluate it your back later
script into a script context which is a
brand new space for a little variance
and if you notice now it gets better so
as you can see surprisingly even just
opening a leader it it does shape of
time so we get to get better again it
still look like super good but it's
still better this got slightly higher
doesn't really matter but if local if
fifty percent how actually no matter so
yeah
I mean we have a reevaluation everything
so even though the script is compiled we
are still doing an arrow into a variable
space so now we will clearly be
evaluating everything because this
Krypton test is actually most of what it
does is it different functions so what
happens is that in the binding space it
will just populate a bunch of functions
in with functional objects so if you'll
say that al for will be very layin for
will be bound to a function object and
few things but nothing really thirdly
extensive happens so functional object
is just to pull in NASA learn javascript
in general of its lexical scope and
curve is shipped across from beakers
curly so we created once and the lexical
scopes created pre-register while Watson
evaluation and then you are just
basically creating those tools options
actually cheap once they're compiled so
we have this flexible separation of
compiling laughter if I was telling you
about is that you have a screen set of
choices how we want to split the tasks
going from here's my source code there
running so if you refuse compilat script
in between you are you're getting a
pretty good sweet spot of course there's
further time video very nice places so
what if we just feel the single bindings
object so we're defining those functions
will be creating a new global scope for
jobs to program because that's what
justice and ethics is about and we are
just on each elevation will populate
between the functions and then we will
involve two of those functions which we
know the rest of them so if you did save
ourselves a little time and space and
just used in a single bindings because
the engine itself actually has bindings
built any so if you just as part to the
static visualization just do an
evaluator reader into the engine which
has a built-in bindings or any violence
just a bolus goes mobile very the space
monster and then we statically extract
two functions you just stainless way and
then we just call them you just called
it was passed the plaintext cycle thanks
and see what we get back so how far does
this perform wow look at that when done
from 150 and like ninety percent it was
my
milliseconds actually went out some
convenient decent 3560 the worst case is
still the worst case it won't improve by
the rest of them you know this is the
sectionals okay what's this I think I
might even go to the trouble and just
take this particular version and right
single 2-3 single I'm single my next
version this is nicole gosh this is the
code version that does that as you can
see i evaluate and starting block I've a
lady breather and extract the functions
and then in the actual evaluation I just
invoke them so if we now run a little
that application of this
this might be actually something that
you might spend half a minute on the
signal masters
so the first time I requested a google /
because the first one takes three
seconds as you can see improved so then
this is already much better so this
weekend we can actually afford to so
even member
of course there's a little shout out
here we'll get back to that and family
laughs eternally optimistic biking
through that we need to do a different
kind of usage which is you need to use
the Nazca API so JavaScript API so you
actually need to explain explicit master
script engine factory ambassador from
online argument you can do this to
actually obtain engines with with
customized online documents from Aspen
general if you do this what you get is
it goes down from like the fifteen
percent diversify my sister family sex
in two to three times faster actually so
it's great this is this is the fastest
you can do however its logo to start up
you can see that the initialization
actually went from from three seconds of
4.7 and that's not bad that's a good
organist is slower to start because when
I cannot proven statically then we will
have to pursue did some in and the
assumption fails when we compile code I
time I measured it crypto benchmark has
certified functions that then we compile
67 times total and that's after this
article's optimistic slowstar because in
this example like random the compile
function like this dr. ray turns out to
be an object so it has to be a
compartment
ads implications are not in the wild
filet is not in service options we
combine one two three four times before
it can run however our dota ray is
actually actually ended up not being
recompile that's a great benefit of not
having a separation between your part an
umbrella time the more clever thing we
can do is that I'm pilot with kicks and
recompile function we can actually we
can actually make it so that it peaks at
side-effect free expressions and
practically values and to see whether
it's an object and if it is then it will
be optimized akin one girl some look
like batch the optimizations for cosine
factory expressions I would over the car
analogous list but i'll skip them
because i think we will be out of time
soon
nASA has a pipe in for cash and this
photo was going to tell you about if you
want to improve your performance for
optimistic what you can do is you can
use the system property and tell it how
many files do want to add in the cash is
openly for because we don't want mass
independent writing anything to this but
all these decisions of what types were
income from doing the execution can be
persisted into a local cache which is
near persistent cache directory so it
can you meet if you don't need it and
then next time start up your system it
will actually remember those decisions
so one good thing that we can do is that
not optimistic remember were stars like
three seconds for this example in
optimistic it is 4.7 and the type cash
actually got two down 3.5 so sit still
straight off but we'll need to live with
this much about it so okay i have more
material if you feel like you'd like to
talk about it and I we have to catch up
to you later on but I think this is
probably all I can do in this time frame
there is a have a few more slides making
it checking out the state flags
what a fine if you're interested because
I can cut everybody's eager to get to
lunch and
fortunately because of scheduling
actually have to stop a little late so I
don't have to I don't have to leave you
