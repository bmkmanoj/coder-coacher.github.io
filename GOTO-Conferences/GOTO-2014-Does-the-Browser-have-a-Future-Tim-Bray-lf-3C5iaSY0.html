know I'm more
is there is the browser doomed and stuff
like that so so sorry about that in
advance advance but you know I have to
say that by doing this I'm staying
within the bounds of a sacred and
long-lived web tradition back in 1998
Wired magazine for first forecast the
death of the pro you can't see it very
well I kiss your browser goodbye so
people have been forecasting the death
of the web for a long long time and it's
still here so with any luck it'll
survive my doom seeing as well so let's
go on in that tradition and I'm also by
the way going to exercise key notice
privilege and hijacked the last 10
minutes of this talk and talk a little
bit about privacy and security and so on
because I've started to get awfully
upset about this stuff and have been
working on it and in the age of EDD
Snowden you know anybody who is not
worried about this stuff probably isn't
doing their job so so you will forgive
me in advance for going down that track
so there's probably a few too many
people here for this to be comfortably
interactive socialist I'm probably not
going to do questions but here's how it
works I'm going to talk here for a
little bit less than an hour and anybody
who wants to go to the party will then
go downstairs and there's buses coming
on at the Oak Street entrance which will
take it over to the party and I will
cheerfully drink beer and argue about
any of the things I've talked about
there at the party for quite some time
so hold your questions and come and
let's do them over beer which is a
better way to do that kind of thing
anyhow okay and I'm not going to spend
my whole time up here talking about you
know the death of the browser and how
we're all doomed and so on because it's
not actually that complicated or
controversial I wanted to actually start
up in sort of a cheerful mood and talk
about us being in the Golden Age of
server-side software we really are I
said Golden Age and I meant it things
have never been better I've been doing
both server and client side software for
three decades or more and right now in
2014 where we really are in the Golden
Age things have never been better and
they are getting better all the time and
a lot of you folks here are
too young to remember although I see a
lot of quite a few grey hairs that
they're so not all of you remember that
we went through in our profession a sort
of a decade and a half long period of
what I would call the the Java nuclear
winter and and you know that was the
period when you know everything to be
taken seriously had to be programmed in
java and you know everything every all
your data to be taken seriously had to
be persisted in SQL which probably meant
writing a great big fat check to Larry
Ellison and and it was that means a lot
of good software was built but it was it
was really sort of a painful experience
jeepers who is that guy is he you know a
hip young programmer or a street person
they hauled in for the shoot and what on
earth is that computer I mean I think
they photoshopped his computer to make
it look bigger anyhow I guess you have
to be hip to program java these days and
so things are really immensely getting
better I mean let's be honest even Java
is getting better you know around the
margins it's still an overly ceremonious
language that is verbose and rigid in
places that make you uncomfortable but
you know they do work at it and they put
all the way and the JVM is a fantastic
piece of work and gets better but but
these days the really important thing is
that when you're going to build some
server-side software you have a lot of
choices I mean you can you can you know
there's things like PHP of course and
and we all like to sneer at PHP well I
do anyhow and but but we should be
exercising humility because whatever you
may think of PHP we should bear in mind
Facebook and wordpress and Wikipedia and
things like that or existentially
dependent upon PHP so even if it's not a
very good programming language and no
it's not a very good programming
language that doesn't mean you can't
build beautiful things with it so but
it's a perfectly plausible choice you're
not going to get fired for choosing and
of course there's rails rails has moved
you know from a radical idea to totally
in the mainstream and actually starting
to feel a little bit enterprise-e and
boring these days you know but you know
and you know surely could come up with a
better slogan and web development that
doesn't hurt I mean I hope it hopes it
could ask for more than that and of
course Jango has never been more than a
minority religion but it's still a
strong minority religion and it's
awfully good software actually and these
days note of course note is definitely
the new hotness and I'd have to say that
I don't think I've ever seen a
technology come out of the weeds and
into the mainstream quite as fast in all
my years of programming as I've seen
with node and you know you're totally
not going to get fired for using node
these days lots of lots of very very
mainstream operations are using it and
by and large it seems to you know really
be a pretty nice piece of gear and you
know that this is the stuff that's
mainstream and there's all sorts of
interesting stuff emerging from out of
the mainstream as as well but before I
talk about let's talk about why it's
actually easier to be good on the server
side than on the client side if you're
building server-side software the
environment in which you're developing
is a fairly small API surface you have
to deal with the operating system stuff
you know files and processes and things
like that which I'm representing with
tux and you have to do some persistence
and you know whether that's SQL or post
relational and of course you have to
deal with the actual web server
connections which I'm representing with
the Apache feather and the effect is
those of us who write server-side
software most of the code we actually
write is application code dealing with
application objects doing application
work it's app it's a plethora gramming
it also has the characteristic that
reality is mostly composed of requests
coming in which are mostly text and
results coming up which are mostly text
which means that by its very nature this
kind of stuff is nicely sandbox able
nicely mockable and very very nicely
unit testable so by and large you can
have an excellent culture of unit
testing around server-side software
without actually working too hard when
you're building client-side software say
in a mobile native mobile app you know
your API service surface is immensely
huger you have the same old stuff you've
got an operating system to deal with and
a
persistence layer which universally
seems to be sequel light and of course
the web stuff that you're going to have
to talk to but you've also got a
microphone and the thing and some
speakers and telephony and a compass and
GPS and three or four different radios
and a vibrator that you know you have
with your laughing you think I'm kidding
there's the vibrator API right there
that that you have to deal with and one
of the typical logic that you write in a
nut kind of an app is nothing to do with
business objects nothing to do with
business flows what happens is you get
poked by some API saying the user you
know touch this remove that and you you
know just a couple of variables and you
branch off to another area that huge API
service to to achieve the result you
want and one of the effects of that is
that unit testing is brutally horribly
difficult and is by and large not done I
know there are exceptions but you know I
speaking only for myself I ship software
on both sides and over the last few
years I don't think I published any
server-side software that didn't come
with you know a pretty serious attempt
at good unit test coverage I'm not going
to claim to be a pure TDD bigot but you
know I really do firmly believe in unit
testing as should we all and apply it as
much as possible and I will freely
confess that I have not shipped any
mobile software that has any significant
unit test coverage because it's just too
bloody difficult those slides come out
of a blog post I wrote a little while
ago called type system criteria which
examines these issues and deduces see
there's those pictures deduces that for
apps in which there is a large API
surface and mobile and unit testing is
therefore difficult there is a strong
indication than those environments using
statically typed languages is a win
whereas in on the server side where you
have a small API surface and it's really
easy to write unit testing it's much
more plausible to get away with
dynamically type ranked languages like
you're you know
script Ruby and Python but that's that's
another speech of another conference but
it I think it's actually true okay let's
move on here yeah so the other nice
thing that's going on in the in the
server-side language service I is that
we are really starting to make leaps and
bounds in our progress on dealing with
concurrency and you know concurrency is
the it's where you have to go if you
care about performance and everybody
cares about performance Moore's Law
still works but computers don't get any
faster they just get wider and and I
remember when I went to college you know
the functional programming unit in the
fourth level software course you know
broke everybody's mind and made them
confused and feel stupid and you
couldn't understand why person would
want to think about computer programming
that way and these days you know we all
are going to have to start to learn how
to think in functional programming terms
if we are going to get any sort of
decent performance and you know the
world kind of discovered Erlang just a
few years ago and her lying although
it's very weird has taught us a lot of
things you know here's some some airline
code oh it's way too small to read never
mind here's some airline code that
increments a counter and it takes you
know a dozen lines of airline code to
implement something that increments a
counter will add one to something and
then report the count and however you
can have a hundred thousand of these
things operating in parallel and you'd
never get a race condition or any of the
other horrible things that can happen
with concurrency because you don't have
any shared mutable state and Erlang just
knows how to do this stuff in the best
possible way now get back to my notes
here I I don't actually think however
that that Erlang is going to sweep the
world and become you know the mainstream
tool that did everybody uses to build
their software it's just a little too
weird it doesn't have variables and you
know it doesn't have types really or
classes or objects or any of that other
kind of stuff that we've liked but even
but you know despite that it taught us a
huge number of important lessons about
how to think about concurrency and and
stuff and you know let's not sneer at
Erlang it was a significant part of the
whatsapp software suite that
Facebook just spent I can't even say
that number four you know and it's
obviously serious stuff and you know for
those of us who kind of like Erlang and
wish it were a little more friendly what
you really want to do is to come see
Dave Thomas's talk tomorrow where he is
going to talk about Davey here um who's
going to do can talk about elixir which
is an attempt to take all the good stuff
about Erlang running on the Erlang vm
and add in some some more familiar and
reassuring language idea mystifies lark
derive largely from Ruby so keep that in
mind and of course erling role a sort of
the central leader and how to think
about concurrency it has been has become
taken by closure I think which is you
know sort of the the poster boy for how
to think about concurrency in the 2010s
and if you've never been to a talk by
rich Hickey the guy who did closure you
should he's a tremendously compelling
speaker and it's thought about this more
more than anybody else and it takes you
know sort of Erlang like ideas about
concurrency and combines them with a lot
of other thinking that's come along
since then and gives you more or less
exactly what you need to write very very
fast how they concurrent software
without staying out of trouble having
said that I also don't think closure is
going to take over the world and the
reason is that closure is a lisp and you
know whatever you may think about Lisp
and I know many of us are full of wonder
the ineffable magic of Lisp but you know
if list we're going to have taken over
the world it would have by now and it
hasn't so it's not gonna and of course
particularly since you know Martin's
coming here tomorrow to talk i should
mention scala which has been causing a
lot of excitement among people who like
you know static typing and functional
programming and the JVM Scala is moving
in fast out of the mainstream and is
actually in use at a lot of big
production websites once again I have my
doubts about whether Scala is going to
hundreds ensure that Scarlett has some
super important lessons to teach us
about how language programming platform
should be structured I have my doubts
about how far it will sweep the world
it's got a lot of syntax
just really a lot of syntax and I find
serious scholar programs hard to read
but I could easily be wrong on this and
then of course you know even even going
back to the mainstream node no Jas has a
really good concurrency story if only
because the implementations are single
threaded and everything is a callback
it's it's it's you know it's hard to get
yourself in concurrency trouble there so
so you know the notions of functional
programming and and are really becoming
mainstream in the server side which
makes it a wonderful time to be alive
but you know here's a little program I
wrote which into which you it's an API
but it's got a program on the front of
it you give an email address such as
mine and run it and it goes and I'm
going to do that again hoops yeah yeah
yeah you do that again I could have just
hit refresh anyhow and what it does is
it goes and tries to find a plausible
internet identity provider for that
email address by looking at MX records
and probing google and looking at web
finger and looking at web fist and
applying some heuristics and so on and
so forth and this kind of thing is
important in the future of identity
systems because it's going to be
important to find out whose identity you
know what I'd any provider you want to
use in world where there are lots of
them now to this to work it has to try
all these things in parallel so it's by
definition a highly concurrent problem
and I implement it in the go programming
language and that's more or less all the
code that matters right here and I think
go it's a really super important sweet
spot and I don't work for Google anymore
I did up until a couple months ago but I
don't anymore so so so I'm no longer you
know under such deep suspicion for being
a go fanboy but but go hits a huge sweet
spot here's the code that does that and
then I'm going to walk you through it so
what happens here is and the second you
those of you who at the back and want to
see it move up otherwise just you know
wait five minutes and I'll be past the
slide and I think this is the last slide
with code on it so so what happens is we
we make a check
all in the second line there a channel
is this thing and go where it's a pipe
it's a pipe like a unique style pipe
only it's typed you can only send a type
variables through it so we make a
channel that has a search result type
and then i say go timeout and i just
need to make just screen a little
smaller and then timeout here's time out
down there at the bottom time we'll just
a little routine that waits to two
seconds and sends a result down the pipe
this arrow here sends a result down the
pipe saying oh I timed out you know two
seconds have passed okay and so I say go
time out and then I say for each of the
searchers I've registered and since it
goes as a statically typed language with
nice and in a nice interface
architecture I can have anything and
call it a searcher as long as it has a
method called search on it and so i'll
say search for that email and here's the
channel to send the results on and
here's some some some housekeeping stuff
and then I go and my result and my loop
here I just each time around the loop i
read from the channel that gives me a
search result from somebody it blocks on
it and then i do some saying well you
know if that was a timeout I give up
otherwise you know if it didn't find any
ID PS don't worry about it if it if it
got in IDP that's verified and
believable you know stop waiting for
others and break out of the loop and so
on so this gives me an essentially
functional programming style of
programming without having to really
think about all the weird things that
things like are lying and Haskell and so
on make you think about it's a very it's
a very conventional kind of feeling
programming language but the functional
programming idioms are natural enough
that people are going to pick them up
and start using them effortlessly and
what it reminds me of is the way Java
made object orientation palatable to the
world you know back before Java came
along there was a lot of people in the
computer science community who thought
that you know object oriented garbage
collected languages are great for
theorists but no ordinary people will
never use them and then Java came along
and it looked like C and kind of smelled
like C and had a comprehensive library
to do everything everybody started using
it so I think go actually has the
potential to make functional programming
idioms palatable and friendly and
and change the world and actually if
you're a functional programming purist
you may be upset because go is just good
enough that it might like hittin 8020
point to make further work on functional
programming somewhat less cost effective
things are good not only on the on the
programming side things are also
wonderful on the data persistence side
you know we have an embarrassment of
riches and if you if you still need to
use SQL and sometimes you do there's a
wide selection of excellent high quality
free open source versions around so you
can do that without having to write a
check to Larry Ellison and you know I
strongly recommend not writing checks to
Larry Ellison it but and you know but
you don't have to use SQL there are a
plethora of really terrific post post
relational databases out there that are
sort of over the course of the last
decade cross the divide from being
bleeding edge experiments the things you
can bet your business's on now Adrian
Croft was here this morning talking
about this and at this point I'd like to
refer to this talk he gave a couple
years ago almost exactly one year ago
actually almost a year ago talking about
Cassandra in particular and you know I
like to hold Cassandra up as an example
of the kind of thing people who think
they need SQL should look at you know
Cassandra shows that you can use post
relational semantics and have absolutely
world-class performance which obviously
places like Netflix need so that's an
awfully good talk I recommend going
through in particular the slide about
how talks how it moved 18 terabytes
across the country in almost no time
with almost no work and it all just
worked and you know cassandra is not the
only option and maybe for your problem
not even the best i started this section
by talking about all the choices you
have out there here's some more is
another example a tricia g gave a talk
earlier today in which she built a
non-trivial web application in less than
an hour using groovy and Mongo and
angular all technologies I haven't even
mentioned yet but choice choice choice
we have it most of the choices are good
you know if I'd been doing that thing
that Trisha was doing and I probably
would have used going
Sandra instead of groovy and mongodb we
probably both would have got great
results so for those of you in the room
who are not server-side developers look
at the other people and envy them
because their life is just great right
now and getting better but let us turn
to the client side and the impending
death of the browser or not how many of
you here right client-side code again so
I'm looking at all maybe 30 40 hands go
up there so if there's say let's say
there's there's there's 30 of you just
to make this even that means that if I
want to get client software written done
and I have a certain amount of time to
do it I have the equivalent of 10 people
to deploy why is that because I have to
write it three times I have to write the
browser version I right to have to write
the Android version and I have to write
the iOS version and hey it's getting
worse Mike you know windows phone is
coming along and you might end up having
to write everything four times instead
of three times wouldn't that be great I
don't see any way around it there is one
group of programmers on the mobile side
who figured how to cut that corner and
to illustrate that I'm going to look at
the top selling games on on the Google
Play Store for Android and if you look
at the top selling in particular the
top-grossing money grossing games on
Android you will discover that a very
high proportion of them are written with
the toolkit like unity or unreal and are
in fact written in C++ so you know for
those of us who grapple with many eight
for many a year with the whole write
once run anywhere a problem the answer
seems to be with us and the answer seems
to be a C++ I don't think that's the way
the future was supposed to work out but
it sort of has now at this point when I
start moaning the fact that you have to
write everything twice there's at least
five people in the audience who are just
squirming to wave their hands and jump
up and say Apache Cordova or you know
phonegap as it was formerly known or one
of those other things where you just
write at once with JavaScript using
modern browser technologies and you get
an app that runs on all those platforms
and every
just great you only have to write at
once unfortunately I just don't believe
that you know reach out and point and
show me the number of apps that have
really had a big impact and change the
world and in fact I written was that
kind of mobile web technology now that
doesn't mean you shouldn't embed a
webview in your app whenever you want to
display text nothing wrong with that
whatsoever but you still have to write
the app once for iOS and once for
Android it's a great dream and in fact
it does have a useful role for people
who are doing quickie enterprise apps
you know inside the enterprise that
aren't going to be shown to the world
just to you know get this done write an
app for our for our company meeting to
gather talk ratings or something like
that sure go ahead use cordova you'll
get something that won't be very pretty
but it'll be perfectly useful but you
know if it's something that's going to
be part of your public facing brand you
can't really do it so how about this
whole mobile versus browser apps thing
this really matters and I can't find the
quote but somebody in Google from google
said in public just the other day that
this is this year 2014 is going to be
the year where the number of queries
google sees from mobile devices exceeds
the number they see from desktops and
you know that's not going to go back
down right you know it's going to it's
going to keep exceeding it by more and
more and more and you know it's also
partly because 2014 is the year that
mobile phones you know well things
exceeds the number of people in the
world so so inevitably you know we say
it's a cliche it we've said it so often
that it's become a cliche but it's
really really really true that the
number of the number of interactions
with the internet are going to become
increasingly dominated by things that
runs through mobile devices rather than
conventional desktop browsers and for
those well the pressure starts to come
on to have a mobile app because whenever
there ever the mobile devices go they
drag the apps behind them so is the
trend away from the browser towards the
app ification of everything real is that
really happening and why and is it a
problem and if it's a problem should we
do anything about it
and it matters because I'm old enough to
remember how much of a boon to the world
the arrival of the web was you know I
can remember back in the day when
everything was running on a visual basic
or motif or swing or something like that
you know custom compiled app for the
desktop and then the web came along in
the early mid nineties and all that
stuff was thrown into the dustbin of
history in about 15 minutes because
people really really liked doing
everything through web browsers oh you
mean I can do everything I need to do by
filling in some forms and pressing
submit and if I get confused there's
always a back button why would I ever
use a visual basic app again I can
remember like yesterday I was at some
document management conference because I
was in the business at that point and
this woman from a large computer company
got up but she was in their
documentation group saying how it's so
parade now all the content management
vendors had to go to web front-ends
because you know they had to throw away
all that stuff that didn't really matter
and you know they should have simple
menus with simple options and a submit
button I had a company did I helped
found called Open Text at the time we
were a content management company and we
slaughter the competition for years even
though in many cases they had better
products because we were the first to go
to a pure web front end it was you know
it greatly improved the quality of life
now what happened was as soon as that
happened and the browser took over from
everything else people started saying oh
well that's okay for simple user
interfaces but we really need something
more you know responsive and and envelop
and immersive and so on for real people
and of course they were proposing things
like flash or Silverlight or javafx
really javafx you know as a substitute
for that and you know the ordinary
people were just fine living in the
browser and you know all the javafx is
and silver lights and flashes lost in
the browser one and that was a good
thing for the world up until about
twenty ten and about twenty ten mobile
apps really started to push on to the
center of the stage and push everything
out sideways and at the moment a very
high proportion of the IT management
community really truly believes that
they need to have a mobile app you know
they absolutely believe they need to
have them well it doesn't matter what
their website is there
to have a mobile app or they're not
doing it right and this gives me my
chance you know like 20 minutes into my
talk to use my first XKCD cartoon you
know and they're fortunately there is a
certain amount of popular pushback of
people who recognize you know the many
virtues of mobile apps and do not want
the entire Internet to vanish into the
apple app store and the google play
store in fact we have an adult audience
here so this is for the famous a tumblr
you know it's having a not safe for work
URL is stylish i say which has many
examples of people who want you to
download apps and and you know we're in
the places where you you really wouldn't
want to do that right and if you wanted
more serious take on this Jeff Atwood
the coating of the stack overflow guy
wrote a really outstanding piece on this
called Apocalypse Now worrying a lie he
it the same XKCD XKCD cartoon worrying
about this so it is clearly the case
that a certain amount of the drive
towards having a moat native mobile app
for everything is a function of pointy
haired bosses but not all of it you know
there are just a lot of things that you
can do in a mobile app native mobile app
easily and straightforwardly that you
know are awkward and stupid and slow and
I have to confess you know a lot of the
a lot of the things that I do on my
mobile device our apps that could have
been websites but they're better as ups
you know let's not let's not fight
history when when history is against us
one of the reasons for this is the
quality of the developer experience if I
want to in a nap have a scrolling list
of things that you know that we're the
one that's in focused displays a nice
image when I pop when I touch it it is
flip side wedge or something like that
well yeah I can do that in a browser I
can do that in 26 different libraries
you know and have to pick which one I
want to use if I'm writing an iOS app or
or
android app there's one canonical way to
do that you go and use this API and the
app framework and it does what you want
and it just works and there's a you know
an IDE and a debugger and a profiler
animalyzer and it's all set up for you I
mean here's a picture I made once of you
know the the Android app ecosystem and
what it looks like and these got this
and you're the it's a nice logical
picture and you know cocoa-touch the the
iOS stack is just as good but you know
the html5 advocates jump up and say but
you know we're working hard on this and
we can produce experiences that look
just like native apps and they can use
the GPS and detect movement and things
like that you know okay I guess that's
sort of fair but no let's not forget
that this and the the iOS are both being
built ferociously hard by elite
engineering terms for two years i sat
next to and worked with the Android core
engineering team and I've never met a
better engineering team in my life these
are not wet behind the ears kids these
are people who helped build you know
things like BOS and and motif and Amiga
and you know all sorts of stuff and they
really deeply understand the issues of
what programmers need and what users
want in a graphical user interface and
they have in each case produced i would
say superb GUI development tool kits so
you know it's not as though html5
competition is standing still I've
learned over my years in the industry
that one of the chief things that you
can use to predict which way development
is going to go is follow the develop
polity developers you know if you make
something easy and pleasant for
developers to do that's what's going to
happen and I got to say these days
building Android and iOS apps is pretty
easy but you know nonetheless html5
rocks it's even go to URL saying html5
rocks so you know it must rock and and
and there's a huge amount of work being
done out there cross-platform code
native like experiences and so on and so
on and so on look at all the stuff is
being built on top of it there's jquery
which should have become the assembler
level the lowest level to which anybody
programs javascript anymore and and you
know sass for your CSS or less if you
prefer that
and you know there's angular so you can
have an MVC right there in your
JavaScript or you know you can have
ember which is angular's competition and
you know you have to have a PhD to
understand which is better and then
there's you know there's there's
backbone to do well I've actually never
actually figured out what backbone does
but it's important and you know if you
want the ultimate importance there's
there's a sm performance at ASM jas and
if you want google's take on what the
ultimate performance is going to be you
switch into dart and then of course
there's bootstrap since you know
everybody finally decided to stop
fighting with CSS and h1 at a grid model
and by the way um you know I've done
bootstrap a lot but you know which type
the first eighty percent is easy and I
find myself then fighting with bootstrap
a lot and and these days there's there's
things that give you the the the grid
paradigm of bootstrap without all the
extra stuff and then two that are really
getting my attention lately our bourbon
do and Zen grids calm both of which are
SAS based and I'm predisposed to like
them because SAS uses Ruby and I like
Ruby but you know the whole notion of
having grid-based layouts is entering
the mainstream and so you look at all
this energy and all these you know super
advanced frameworks that are being built
on top of the browser architecture and
you think wow this is wonderful this
must be the place to be and it is
wonderful it's certainly energetic but
it oh pardon me I forgot some more stuff
polymer right brick what it reminds me
of is this it reminds me of the Cambrian
explosion you know when evolution went
crazy a few hundred million years ago
and produced all these strange weird
bizarre things including this famous
creature which you know had seven eyes
and eleven legs and long nose and so on
and so forth and you know evolution went
crazy and shot off in all directions and
I guess it was a wonderful time to be
alive particularly if you were one of
those but you know in fact most of those
turned out to be dead ends and usually
when you observe a technology that's
charging off in all directions at once
with a whole bunch of engineering
victories all of which are incompatible
with each other you know the conclusion
you want to take away is that well you
know
maybe there's something simpler there
under the hood waiting to be discovered
no that's not to say the Cambrian
explosions are bad in fact that that
brief burst of evolutionary creativity
well brief it was only like tens of
millions of years long produced
directions that led to a micro things us
so you know it's not entirely a wasted
effort but I have to say that I am kind
of dubious and i think that the browser
programming platform has become a
confusing place to be you know which
libraries are you going to use it's hard
to choose and people have you know
strong religious feelings about what
your better and in one of the ways that
if you care about the browser and you
want to bring back its values would be
to try and accelerate the evolutionary
process and converge on a smaller number
of options to do you know the things we
want to do of course that's tough
because it means somebody's somebody's
stuff gets sent to the Graveyard you
know here's the thing that I that I
posted on reddit and this was a really
smart comment somebody made I'm going to
read it to you so I recently worked on a
six month long project with three other
developers and they were going to
building out an internal data analytics
tool that would let non-technical fork
slice and dice data and they thought
they'd soon they assumed that the server
side piece would be where they spent
their time but it was actually trivial
you know they had you know s3 and scribe
and Hadoop and post grass and Redis and
configure it with chef and run it all in
AWS and it all turned out to be easy and
more or less just work you know on the
client side you know they had to learn
JavaScript and jQuery but have some
really strange quirks and they'd learn
CSS and sass and no you can't just do
height hundred percent why well yes it
is strange that your div is behind your
other div even though it's got a higher
as the index and you need to clear fix
that outer div to fix all the way the
things are floating each other or what
the clear fix what everybody knows that
and there's backbone and marionette to
make backbone better and require j/s
because javascript isn't have a linker
need to package and minimize this stuff
together and you know it's tough it
really is and and if we're going to if
if we are going to make things better we
need to simplify and converge a little
it and frankly we need to start building
on a better base because well okay I
just can't get past this here here is a
little console on which I'm going to run
node and I'm going to make an array I
don't know and I'm going to sort it yeah
JavaScript sorry anyhow it give me the
right answer even though it okay okay
there's an excuse for that but why
should I have to make excuses for my
programming languages I just have a
really grave doubt in my mind as to
whether javascript is a satisfactory
base on which to build the client
architectures of the future I know lots
of people are doing wonderful work in it
but I feel like they're sort of fighting
with one hand tied behind your back
here's a tweet I tweeted not that long
ago my browser size seems to have gone
crazy no Twitter I don't want to sign in
so a modern browser consists addresses
its data with URLs and talks to the
network with HTTP and displays text with
HTML Estelle's it with CSS and
fundamental API as the Dom API and it
uses JavaScript to write code in and
some of those things are good and some
of those things are not so good and in
fact all of the stuff I talked about
basically our work arounds we wouldn't
need all that explosion of creativity
that's going on if we already had a
grid-based stylesheet model or if we had
an API more like jQuery and less like
Dom or if we had a more modern and well
thought out language in JavaScript so
that's the kind of thing that makes me
pessimistic at a deep level about the
future of the browser that feels to me
like building castles on sound
and you know as Gregor Roth boosts
famously friend said vertically and
horizontally centering a div with CSS is
the hardest problem in computer science
and you know that's kind of true so what
are going to do about this I don't know
but you know I think we should do
something because if I'm right and the
combination of management motives and
technical choices drives the browser
into a niche role that's bad it's a
problem here's why because the browser
has two super important characteristics
that i think matter a lot and I'm very
very reluctant to loot use lose the
first is that if I want to do something
on the internet there's a well-known
right way to do discover something and
do it on the internet which is you put
your cursor in that little search window
at the top of your browser and you say
how do I whatever and you get a result
list that probably has a very good
answer in your the top and you click on
it and it takes you to the app and you
do whatever right there in your browser
it's a top-level citizen of the internet
if it turns out you need to use a mobile
app well hey then you're off into the
App Store and you're not in universe of
what anybody can put on the internet
you're in the universe of what Apple
thinks it's appropriate to sell you if
you're an Android it's a little less
painful because the place to Google Play
stores no monopoly and you might find
another app that's outside the Play
Store but you know the Play stores are
pretty good these days but they're a
pale shadow of what you can get on the
internet I think it's very very
important that the solutions we use be
top-level citizens of the internet and
web apps are and mobile apps are not and
I think that's a big deal and it matters
I hate the notion the apps I'm allowed
to use our curated by somebody else you
know that's not what the internet is
supposed to be the other problem is that
actual web apps are deeply better than
native mobile apps because you can
update them right down in real time you
know if I've got a problem I can update
my code and the next person the next
person to hit the site gets the new app
if I find it in an iOS app i'm looking
at a delay of weeks potentially days it
best to get my updated code out there
android is probably only hours but it's
still not good you know do you have a
data losing privacy leaking low security
password leaking bug in your mobile app
well sucks to be you you know I think
that's a big problem so I really want us
to get back to a state somehow where we
can have the important virtues of the
web app how are you going to do that I
mean the app stores are okay but they're
too slow and too commercial and so how
are we going to get there well we need
to fix those red patches right I think
the only way we're going to save the
browser at the end of the day is to fix
that problem have a browser with a
first-class native grid oriented
stylesheet a first-class native API
something like jQuery selector based a
good programming language probably
statically typed because you know the
API surface is so huge inside the
browser with a good debugger a good IDE
a good profiler who could do that Google
could do that Google should do that one
of the last things I did before I left
Google was tell them to do that I know
if they will but I don't I think if that
doesn't happen we're going to be forced
into a niche what is the niche for the
browser well news I don't know
publications people say oh if your app
is really a publication you just do a
browser app well I don't buy that you
know I use the the BBC app and the
economist app and lots of apps like that
lots lots of the best news sources or
inside apps these days and that's crazy
they shouldn't have to be that they
should be web apps so there's a problem
there in the short term you know you
might want to make sure you have some
native mobile native app building
competency because guys
ladies and gentlemen that's the way the
world's moving whether you like it or
not I don't like the way it's moving but
that's the way it's moving let's try and
push back okay enough about that all
right so I have a little bit more time
okay let me spend the last few minutes
of my speech talking about something
entirely different let's talk about
privacy add no I didn't and yeah we've
all met in it ed right and this is such
an incredibly polarizing subject I've
noticed that you know the people who
think ed Snowden is a hero and people
who think is a traitor it's not that
they just disagree they're not even
talking the same languages you know that
they have no basis waitlisted edge
Snowden's a hero hands okay at Snowden's
a trader 12 couple okay fair enough did
the people you know these people are
sitting on the opposite sides of a gulf
and don't even have language to talk to
each other I think it's a problem I'm
clearly in the hero camp on this who's
watching you who is actually watching
you so it turns out that the people who
are watching you sort nicely into four
buckets the first group of people who
are watching you on the web are the
monetize errs Google Facebook Twitter
that kind of thing they want to know
everything you do so they can figure out
how to sell a better add easy to
understand the second group is of course
what I will refer to as
over-enthusiastic public servants you
know the NSA and their friends your own
government watching you third group
that's watching you is foreign
governments most people don't have to
worry about that because you know if you
work for Google you do or if you work
for a national security job you do but
it is absolutely the case that that
foreign spies are out there looking at
you and the fourth group that's watching
you are of course crooks you know people
who are trying to steal your identity
steal your money we often talk about
crooks in this sort of abstract sense
being
they're not obstructed all their real
here they are meet them by access com
this is a sip website in Russian where
you can buy stolen accounts there's the
stolen accounts the number that are for
sale the price per thousand five bucks a
thousand for stolen mail.ru accounts
fifteen bucks for rambler are you
myspace while they're still myspace but
look they're more expensive they're $100
account where's gmail there's no gmail
here usually oh there it is yeah gmail
gmail you know the the people who
actually have good security groups you
can tell because the numbers of accounts
for lower and the prices are higher so
don't kid yourself there are bad guys
out there watching you all the time but
you know it's easy to understand you
know for the for the for the crooks and
for the foreign governments you know
they are there to be resisted we should
do our best to resist them with the
tools at our disposal when it comes to
the monetize errs well that's that's
that's an issue for politics really you
know there's no consensus a lot of
people like having free services and
don't mind having ads pay for them other
people are just horrified that the idea
that gmail reads all your ad reads all
your mail to you know what has to sell
you and you know this is frankly a job
for politics which is perfectly okay
because that's what politics is for you
know making those kind of rules and that
leads us with the spooks with the
government agencies who want to watch us
what can they do well they can put boxes
at the big internet exchanges and run
pipes from the rooters capturing all the
data it goes through and they do they
can use visa I don't know what that
stands for but it's particular court
that issues national security warrants
they can use visa to make your telephone
company tell them everywhere you go and
they do they can use FISA to make your
ISP give them all your traffic and they
do they can use visa to make your email
provider give them all your email and
they do they can use FISA to make the
sites you visit disclose what you do
when you're there and they do and they
can use face it to make your IDP
disclose where you've been signing into
and with what identities
and they do that too but it's not really
a problem I mean these are public
servants they're just trying to protect
you there's lots of bad people out there
trying to do bad things terrorists
criminals and protecting you is
important these D you're not in it for
the money and anyhow if you don't have
anything to hide why would you want
privacy I hate that I hear that all the
time and I hate that line of argument I
think it's deeply deeply deeply wrong
and I think we should all be equipped to
push back against it so here are some of
the reasons why that's just a complete
load of first of all the people
the public servants who are spying on us
at the end of the day they're just
people most of them are saying honest
prudent public servants who are
underpaid working too hard but they're
just people a small proportion of them
are crooks or crazy or stupid or just
nasty this is inevitable it's a nature
of the human beast and and they have a
huge amount of power they can you know
they can arrange that you go to
secondary processing every time you go
to the airport they can have a normal on
influence on which of your research
requests get funded they can they can
keep you from getting a job requires a
security clearance or any other
background check so you know people who
go off the rails in this profession can
screw up the world and another problem
is that i've known you know a lot of law
enforcement and actually intelligence
people over the years and that culture
has an unfortunate tendency towards you
know tribalism and and people tend to
think that well you're either in us in
it or against us and and we see it time
and time again in every society even the
most civilized societies where you know
a public servant is cut a law
enforcement officer a policeman or a spy
is caught doing something wrong and they
close ranks you know and their first
loyalty seems to be at each other and
his story has shown that this can go
completely off the rails and lead to of
the overthrows of governments in the in
statement of dictatorships so there's a
cultural problem there and we need to
respect our law enforcement people pay
them well and regulate the hell out of
them and not trust them we have to do
all those things at the same time it's
tough but that's what we have to do the
other thing is one of the favorite
techniques that the spooks use is
putting back door
networking equipment and pipe and wires
and Reuters and so on so they can see
what's going on well let me tell you
something there's no such thing as a one
as a one way back door if they can use
it the bad guys those you know guys who
run those Russian websites can use it
too and I know we all know that the guys
the bat really bad crooks out there know
that the spooks are going around putting
back doors and things and they're
following around looking for the back
door as the spooks put in it it's just
not a reasonable thing to do to globally
we can everybody security there's also
the incredibly orders of magnitude out
of whack cost effectiveness of it how
dangerous is terrorism as a problem in
real life how many people have died as a
result of that as opposed as opposed to
for example distracted driving or
smoking or alcoholism or you know all
the other things that can go wrong many
other preventable things the amount of
money and the loss of Liberty and
intrusive pneus if we're under going to
attack what at the end of the day is
relatively speaking up that big a
problem makes no sense on a financial
basis and the last point I want to make
is the most important one privacy is not
important as a means to an end privacy
is a virtue it's one of the things that
we've won for ourselves by a virtue of
being civilized we're civilized we don't
have to walk down to the water to the
river to bring water we don't have to
poop in a ditch we don't have to live in
a little village where everybody knows
how good our sex life and our digestion
is we are civilized people we have
houses with doors that close and when we
close our door we can do whatever we
want behind it as long as it's not
actively endangering other people and
that is something that didn't come
automatically it's something we chose as
a civilization to build privacy is a
virtue in and of itself it's a pleasant
thing to have not to have privacy as
unpleasant and huge amounts of good
social science studies have proven the
people behave differently when they
think they're being watched then notion
you're being washed to something that
decreases the quality of your life so if
you're out there defending privacy you
don't have to say we need privacy
because of this other effective produces
we need privacy because privacy is good
we got am I being civilized let's not
give it up
so if you like me believe that people
have an entitlement to a certain amount
of privacy when you use the net okay
let's assume that everybody here in the
room is building an app or it wouldn't
be at this conference right everything
this room has an app whether it's a
website or a mobile app or whatever how
many of you are using are confident the
ear and Apple work using only HTTPS I
see a few hands go up okay I love you
guys you guys are the future if you are
not confident the ear app will work
properly using HTTPS you have a problem
because if you're trying to make a
judgment call based well i'll just use
https for the stuff that sensitive or
private or controversial you know how
much chance do you have of making that
correctly how many ways are there for
you to be wrong worse if you're asking
end users to choose between private non
communications they don't have the
information needed to make that kind of
a choice you're asking to make a choice
they just don't know how the the
consequence of a negative failure which
is a positive failure which is well you
gave them some privacy when they really
didn't need it is pretty mild but the
consequence of a negative failure where
they needed privacy and you didn't give
it to them is horrifying in particular
if the app that you are building offers
services to people who are children or
downtrodden or seriously disadvantaged
in life you really ought to be offering
them privacy but my blood run cold
there's people offering apps that work
for elementary kids they don't use HTTPS
so Joe bad guy parks his car outside the
elementary schools uses firesheep and
he's got personal identifying
information on every child in that
school that's shocking if particularly
if you are running an app that is public
facing and used by large number of
consumers and you are not supporting
HTTPS today you're in a bad place you're
in a bad place morally and ethically and
you could be in a bad place legally if
it's discovered that somebody's life is
really screwed up because somebody
watched what they were doing on fire
sheep
and saw what you were doing so to start
with step zero support https start doing
it today it doesn't cost that much it's
not that hard yeah it's a little extra
bureaucracy and it's a few hundred bucks
a year for suits and so on but you know
do it you owe it to the people who use
your stuff by the way just last week or
two weeks ago maybe I HTF published RFC
7258 I atms the net internet engineering
task force this is an official finding
on the behalf of the people who build
the internet protocols that the kind of
pervasive monitoring we are that we know
is going on is an attack and the
designers of all future internet
protocols are required to show that
their design has taken pervasive
monitoring into account and has things
in place to mitigate it so I don't think
your responsibility is any less so you
need to at the very minimum support
HTTPS then you need to think very
carefully about what data is being
persisted in your app that belongs to
other people and you need to be
explicitly clear about what you're
saving why you're saving it what your
stance is as regards public servants who
come in with warrants where your hosting
is what regulations cover your hosting
under what circumstances you share the
data with anybody else this has kind of
been a luxury up till now but it's not
anymore okay so i stood up here for like
an hour and said negative gloomy things
but you know life's actually pretty good
we get to work on software on the
internet it's fun it's interesting it's
well-paid you know you know anybody who
is willing to work at all and take the
training can get a pretty decent job
we're qualitatively improving humanity's
experience with the world our tools are
getting better all the time the networks
are getting better all the time we have
the chance to if you care about this
kind of thing and you should we have the
chance to apply mobile internet
technology to lift another few billion
people up out of poverty be a big piece
of that we have the chance
to encourage democracy encourage
prosperity encourage peace make the
world a better place and you know if
you're in this profession and you don't
sit and you can't say that you've helped
do any of those things we only have
yourself to blame you know we're in a
uniquely privileged uniquely advantaged
lot we have more leverage over the
course of history than just about any
group has ever had so take advantage of
it build something great have fun thank
