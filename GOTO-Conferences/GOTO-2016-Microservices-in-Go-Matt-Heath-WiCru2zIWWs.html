here on Twitter so if you've got any
other questions just feel free to ping
ping me and I'm I basically work as a
back-end engineer I've worked
specifically with go for about three
four years now and at the moment I'm
working with a company called Mons oh so
Mons oh are a new starter we form the
company February last year and basically
we're trying to build a new kind of bank
and that's kind of a bit of an
interesting thing to do banking for me
is kind of like this I don't know if
anyone else has this kind of experience
if you ever go into a bank branch that's
super dated and certainly in the UK
banking is is terrible as a mobile
experience it's kind of come on the last
couple of years but you just can't do
the things you would expect to do from
any other kind of internet product and
you can book a taxi and it will arrive
in two minutes you can book food and
arrives in half an hour but I still
can't like pay someone I've never paid
before through any of my banking apps I
have to like log into their website set
them up as a new person and then I can
somehow do that and it's just a terrible
customer experience and a lot of the
reason for that is because at their core
banks have quite dated technology and
this for example is the system/360 fun
fact if you wrote COBOL or other things
that run on this you can still run that
on current IBM said series mainframes so
that's great like you can run code from
50 years ago but it's not really ideal
if you're trying to build new products
you have these extremely large
monolithic systems at the core of your
bank and lots of banks use extremely
modern technologies as a kind of veneer
around these things but they can't
change the core and as an example
Barclays in the UK spent three billion
pounds on IT infrastructure in 2014
who here has three billion pounds to
spend on i.t
anyone one put one guy cool so just
think what you could build with three
billion pounds like probably something a
lot better than the current banking
experience and we don't have three
billion pounds not not by a long way and
we're basically trying to build
something that normal people would use
people who spend all their time on their
smartphone and they expect very quick
interactions to sort out their finances
they expect things to be automated and
taken care kind of automatically so we
started last year we give out super fun
hot coral prepaid cards and we've
basically been going through the process
to become a fully regulated bank and
that kind of happened a couple of months
ago so these cars will convert into
normal current accounts probably early
next year
um and these are connected to an app
which is mobile first we kind of give
you spending analysis we tell you how
much you spend for example I've paid
James's sent me some money here and
actually shows his profile really basic
things like icons of where I shopped and
that's just not something that any
current bank does um I don't know why it
they just unable to and they're kind of
constrained by their technology and all
sorts of other fun things so you can do
searching you can actually search with
emojis so we we look up coffee it's a
very important feature we can attach
receipts I attach pictures of my brunch
and other things like turn your card on
and off with a single tap so if you lose
it you can you know like disable it cool
it's lost and then you can re-enable it
magic and I mean this is obviously like
a boon flag in our database right but
technically an enum but it's I mean
that's just something you can't do with
any other Bank so if we're starting from
scratch we would obviously have some
form of application and all right the
beginning we're startups so we should
start off really really simple and
inevitably we'll have some kind of
applications and databases and over time
this is going to get progressively
larger and in our case we
need to work with lots of distributed
teams because we have to integrate with
lots of different systems as soon as we
expand internationally we have to
integrate with lots of payment systems
and these things get really complicated
for example we have to have actual
physical fibre delivered to physical
data centers which is kind of a bit
weird I just assumed you could put all
of that stuff in Amazon these days but
that's not a thing
so eventually these things have become
quite complicated and we potentially
need more databases our application is
very big we maybe had some searchings
and caching various other features that
are essential for a bank and inevitably
and I mean the reason that we're kind of
all in this room is that these things
like you hit problems with them and
you're actually hidden quite quickly and
I've worked on a lot of kind of big
projects where we just have one big
application obviously we have to ship
that we have release cycles and you just
can't do anything and so this is kind of
like my impression on that so right from
the beginning we we decided we didn't
want to do them and starting out by
breaking our application apart into
essentially a series of micro services
at the beginning is kind of a risky
prospect there's a number of things that
you don't necessarily understand and you
don't necessarily kind of break things
upon the right way but we were able to
start isolating those things so we
started with a series of micro services
fairly small these communicated via
either synchronous or asynchronous
message buses and the main kind of
principles behind this were again like
standard things that we've heard from
people like Netflix Amazon Twitter are
our services have a single
responsibility they do one specific job
very well in order to decide what they
do we take our part our whole domain and
bound the context so we have small
chunks of our business logic which we
can isolate into unique applications and
then by doing that we can build very
well-defined interfaces
for example we can split apart
transaction model and our transaction in
my bank account shouldn't really need to
know things about the merchant like if I
buy something at a shop obviously that
has a logo but the transaction doesn't
need to know about that we can relate
those separately and we can also because
we're doing that we can apply different
availability constraints to those so our
transactional model needs to be
extremely reliable but that kind of like
merchant data if it doesn't work we
could kind of provide four bytes to
customers and we can kind of abstract
that away and once we break these apart
we then get really good composability so
we can break our services break our
application apart into reusable units
reusable services and then actually we
can build products much much quicker
because we can reuse some of that
functionality so when we started we had
a number of different options and one of
the things we we really wanted to look
at was the kind of language we would
build most these things in in our case
we chose go so has anyone here used go
yeah loads of people awesome so if
anyone who hasn't used Go Go has a super
cool really cute mascot this is the Go
gopher who makes an appearance on pretty
much every talk and the thing that I
really like about Coe is that as a
language it's extremely simple so there
aren't a million ways that you can do
things and go there's kind of like one
way there are other ways but they're
usually not easy ematic and it you're
almost fighting against the language to
do things in a different way however in
addition to being statically typed which
for a bank is quite useful we don't
really want kind of we had type
conversions and things obviously
rounding money is quite dangerous ego
also has a really comprehensive standard
library so although the language itself
is very simple there the language comes
with a huge number of
that you can use and as an example the
HTTP server you can spin up a new server
in about three lines of code and as of I
think go 1.6 or 1.7 that is now
automatically HTTP to server so all
you'd have to do is take your code we
compile it with the latest version ago
and it will transparently upgrade your
clients to HTTP 2 if they support it and
that's just something that's built into
the language like the the standard
library has all these things built in on
top of that the there is a number of
really cool language features so one
really big one in go is those extremely
lightweight concurrency and by that I
mean you can literally run any number of
functions just concurrently with each
other almost too easily to be honest so
if we had a function for example which
is going to handle a request this
function call block
so we'll execute them go off and we'll
kind of come back at some point in the
future hopefully we have some timeouts
if we're handling requests and we'll
assume that's dealt with if we want that
to run concurrently say we are in a kind
of loop that is reading off a socket and
with we're passing requests off to
something else we can literally just put
go before it and that will now fire that
off in a separate go routine and these
long threads these are extremely
lightweight almost like green threads if
anyone's kind of used those a long time
ago but they're extremely lightweight
ways of running your Co concurrently and
the reason they're so lightweight is
when you far off a new go routine all
you're really doing is allocating like a
K on the stack it's like really really
small and in go are the stacks
automatically expand so you don't need
to kind of worry about that the stock
will start off really small is extremely
lightweight and then as you're kind of
stack grows then go or dynamically
allocate memory to that so in practice
you potentially have thousands tens of
thousands even hundreds of thousands of
these running
and go has a really good scheduler
built-in so the scheduler will basically
run one operating system thread per call
and then all dynamically scheduled in
userspace
these go routines across those threads
and if they block on i/o then it will
kind of put that to the side and it will
schedule another go routine so that all
of them can make progress if anyone
wants to read about that is like really
really interesting about probably a bit
bit too much for right now but the
really cool thing is like even Network
IO isn't blocking so some of the talks
I've seen before where we're using
specific frameworks in hate say Java
they're literally blocking on a thread
while a request has gone to an external
server now that's obviously like pretty
poor design but in this case that
doesn't happen like we run go routines
we run potentially hundreds of thousands
of them and every time we fire off a
request to another server it actually
goes into a separate i/o thread and all
of the network is taken care of and it
will just kind of pass that back to the
go routine as soon as there's data to be
consumed so given that we have all of
these concurrent kind of almost threads
running how do we then communicate
between them so if we need to share
memory if we need to kind of share
values between these things inevitably
we're going to have to put loads of
mutexes and things around these and then
go that's not the way that you do this
so go advocate sharing by communicating
between processes rather than sharing
memory and this is kind of based on CSP
if anyone's heard of that communicating
sequential processes I think by Tony
Hall in the 70s and channels provide a
way that go routines messages between
them and these can be either synchronous
blocking calls or asynchronous so we can
buffer them and put them in a queue and
this again is something built into the
language so we can literally pass
messages between all our go routines and
that allows us to do fun things like
kind of funny
out funding in messages we can run
worker pools and all of these things are
kind of enabled and used in the standard
library just by being able to run go
routines and having channels that
communicate between them
on top of that if you are building
services and deploying them go is
statically linked or leased it is if you
pass in a specific number of billed
flags so by default go will use Segoe
which uses some of the go library of
some of the C libraries available on
your own machine but if you disable C go
you can statically compiled all of the
native go code and it will it will then
run on any machine anywhere any machine
with the same architecture without any
runtime dependencies and this is really
cool if you then want to very easily
deploy binaries you can compile your
whole go program to a single a single
file single binary you can put that
somewhere you can drop that onto a
machine you can execute it and that's it
you don't need a runtime you don't need
to install loads of stuff on your
machine so if you're kind of like want
more immutable infrastructure then this
is like a really cool way to do that so
if you want to start with go as a kind
of micro service framework there are a
couple of things that you can use to do
this so one of the big ones is go kits I
don't know if anyone's heard of this a
couple of people so peter borgin who is
the kind of lead honest eye is doing I
think a workshop later this week so if
you're interested definitely go along
and go kit provides a kind of framework
that allows you to build services really
quickly really simply and you can plug
in all sorts of things like service
discovery and tracing and kind of all
the other kind of tooling things that
you need out of the box and those are
kind of all configurable in go kit
there's another one called micro which
basically is quite similar but it takes
a kind of different philosophical
approach so micro is more of a kind of
ecosystem and as well as providing a
framework that you can use to build
services it also provides lots of other
tools so there are specific
discovery services that you can run id
generation services all those kind of
things
so if you want to kind of build all
those things into a system really
quickly then microbe provides quite a
few of those unfortunately neither of
those existed when we start our company
so we have one call month called time
it's available MIT licensed on github
and it's basically a really kind of
really really simple framework so all it
does is allows us to build kind of
clients and servers that can communicate
to each other and then we can configure
them in a kind of standardized way so in
our case we started off with potentially
a number of services these are
communicating to each other and the real
question is how they communicate so in
our case right at the beginning we
needed something that kind of worked
down the box really really quickly among
way of kind of cheating is basically to
put a message bus in the mail so if you
use something I rub a McCue you
essentially get a request queue and you
can name these request queues and then
you can have n number of instances of
what you can to kind of consume off that
named queue and that gives you
essentially service discovery for free
because you can just publish a message
to a queue you don't actually need to
know where the instances of a service on
and it will be consumed at some point by
a queue um it also kind of gives you
kind of again cheating at load-balancing
because the model here is a pull model
so you have a queue of requests that are
outstanding you potentially have a TTL
on those within the queues so you don't
fill the buffer and if we have one
particularly performant instance and one
which has a really noisy neighbors so we
have really bad performance then those
will just consume messages at different
speeds and to be honest that got us
quite a long way we started off in
February and we've been progressively
adding more more services to our
infrastructure building out the features
of our Bank core banking systems
basically everything so 95% of the stuff
that we built is from scratch and we've
kind of starts off at obviously zero
and we're now on about 140 or so
services so the services that we run are
quite small they do again one thing one
thing well and we run a number of copies
of those within our infrastructure for
availability so when we started with
this that was absolutely fine because
the only language we used was go and I
don't know if anyone's ever had the
problem where you need to do something
in a particular language and you don't
have any libraries for it whatsoever
some like everyone must have hit this
problem so if you're using a
particularly new language and go is kind
of getting to the point now that it's
quite mature you don't necessarily have
libraries that cover every possible
eventuality and as an example if you're
integrating with financial
infrastructure
you basically have to use IBM MQ so who
has used IBM MQ here loads of people or
good who enjoys using IBM MQ here
literally no one oh no one person okay
sorry and in our case we which one to
move fast as a startup so writing well
there are libraries which you allow you
to use those particular things but to do
that we'd have to basically use the C
bindings and compile them into our go
binary which would be really terrible it
also doesn't have the same level of
functionality is not as well tested
whereas using something like Java for
that one specific service gives us much
better flexibility and the problem we
now have is if you have built a micro
service architecture and you have n
number of services that are
communicating towards between each other
you probably have some standardized way
of doing this and if you've done it all
in one language you've essentially built
a quite large tool chain so just in that
language which means introducing any
other languages into your infrastructure
becomes almost prohibitively expensive
and actually the place that I worked out
before munzo was halo where we moved
from like a PHP Java kind of
infrastructure there to one that was
built in go
with a couple of Java services for some
specific things and the problem we had
there was we ended up with 198 go
services and two Java services so we
have to somehow main maintain feature
compatibility on these libraries even
though only a tiny amount borrowing
structure was was doing that so a quick
way around map is to use a client and
server the every language house which is
obviously HTTP bit of a stupid things
have gone all the way full circle but
the reason that we did this was because
right the beginning we could get all of
those things like service discovery and
load balancing free and we can write
that in about three or four days whereas
in order to jump in straight away with
kind of basically HTTP based services
you need to think about all of these
kind of things so you need to be able to
discover where your instances are which
IPS they are ports if you're doing dns
to resolve them or some other discovery
mechanism you need to load balance
between them
you obviously need circuit breaking if
some of them a slow will fail and the
real question is how you do all of this
and if you do all of that again in your
own language your your again building
this big client and server library that
to all of these things so in our case we
chose to simplify those quite
significantly and we're actually using
link addi in the middle to do quite a
lot these things
so as anyone's seen a pinnacle from
Twitter I see it's written in Scala so
it's not something we wanted to directly
import into any of our services
but linka D allows us to run that as
essentially a standalone proxy locally
and we can offload all of these things
kind of into that proxy and because lots
of instances are passing through this
proxy it has a far better knowledge of
what's going on in our infrastructure
which leaves our services like really
really simple and they can still have
all of the kind of performance and
flexibility we need but without having
to maintain a huge amount of code to do
all these kind of complicated things you
need in a micro service architecture
so to start with our the top of
infrastructure we obviously have a load
balance that comes all of our
traffickers into we go into some kind of
routing layer so this is just going to
take a HTTP request decide where it's
going to be routed to and drop it into
our proxy and this is routed to an API
service now these services are no
different they essentially still just
take HTTP but what we do is we define
kind of our endpoints on our API by
these particular types of services and
that means for example we have a public
API which has a web hook endpoint that
allows you to register web hooks on your
bank accounts and we can route all
things that go to the web hooks route
through our proxy into this go binary
and then once we've done that we can
kind of process that we're literally
going to validate the request to send
that on to kind of Authenticator maybe
kind of actually create the web hook and
register that for callbacks at some
point in the future and these again have
different databases and potentially
those can kind of call out to any
external provider literally is just
going to be a bog-standard HTTP server
that's going to process our request for
us and the cool thing about this is
because all I'm doing here is deploying
a new section or API and we have this
routing automatically if I want to
deploy any new functionality which for
infrastructure we don't touch any of the
other services we can deploy services
individually we can add new services we
can add new endpoints on to our API
without any impact whatsoever and the
only realistically be the worst thing
that possibly happen would be we deploy
a number of instances and they consume
all the CPU and memory on those
particular servers and kind of those
crash as a result and then we'd get
replacements at some point so in go the
way we do this is by defining a type
which we call a service and all that's
going to do is take any request so it's
a function that takes a request and
returns a response so if anyone's seen
anything again like in pinnacle
basically you you pass it
kind of defining your service as a
function you just pass in some requests
get a response back and you allow kind
of the the libraries to wrap all of
these kind of filters around those and
given that we can use a bog standard
HTTP routing library so we can register
routes on here and again each one of
these so list register and D register is
again just a function that takes a
request returns response and it can do
anything we need to do that so this
stuff's like quite easy to do and go you
can spin up HTTP server literally a few
lines of code there's some really good
routing libraries and you can just
register your function just straight
away so the main problem we then have as
a bank is that we have to be really
really reliable so it's all well and
good having like fails and our services
going down when it's just kind of the
app that's affected but if it's our card
payment infrastructure and no one can
buy anything in the store then that's
that's a really really big problem for
us and this again is kind of the the
reason that we started off with this
kind of infrastructure is because we
need that 24/7 availability we we can't
add all the banks in the UK have like
overnight batch processes or their
systems turn off for like five hours
overnight and and we can't really have
that we we need our services to be on
the whole time and that means even
though we're running in Amazon or any
other cloud provider we will inevitably
have failure that we have to deal with
so in our case we obviously everyone is
using docker because it's so hot right
now but in our case we can actually
compile our go binary we can statically
link it and we put it in a scratch
container so we don't have anything
inside that container at all there's not
even a shell so if you had like a
breakout like some kind of bug in our
code there's no shell to actually
execute code within that container and
we can then run those on kubernetes
so is anyone use kubernetes here cool a
few people so from our perspective we
actually start off with measures and
marathon and the
because right the beginning we didn't
feel Cuba natives was really kind
production level at that point and we
had kind of mixed mixed experiences with
that we found operationally it was quite
difficult to run especially if you
aren't really a kind of Java shop which
were not so debugging it was quite
difficult and overall I think the the
kubernetes kind of design architectural
is is significantly better having said
that if you ever want to run it yourself
on Amazon rather than using a
self-hosted one to run that in are
highly available mode is still quite
difficult so there are a few blogs
around them and it's kind of a trial by
fire though but we've kind of tested our
stuff quite a lot now and it's worked
out quite well and the advantages we've
seen from that is this is we did a kind
of migration in August so what two
months ago and this is the expenditure
on our infrastructure so we started off
with this red area which was our old
infrastructure and we spun up on new of
structure and then we kind of
progressively shut things down and the
reason that we've got great cost savings
here is because we can pack our services
much more densely and also we can use
spare capacity for things like our
compilation jobs so we used to have
really big Jenkins machines which would
like compile everything and push the
resulting binaries up to s3 where as
Cuban entries makes it really easy for
us to just run those with a lower
priority using spare capacity so we
don't need to run any of those servers
anymore so that's been a massive massive
win for us so given that we have a
number of instances these service we can
use a combination of communities and
linker D in our case to kind of resolve
things like topology changes so if one
of our services are explodes in a kind
of shower of flames at some point fairly
soon we'll get a replacement
automatically because we've defined i3
replicas of our pods in communities and
equally if we get slow or kind of
transient errors linka d will kind of
resolve these for us so internally is
using
exponentially weighted moving average
load balancer which will detect failures
become quite sensitive to latency and
all these things kind of happen
automatically and you can build these
things quite easily and go using a host
pool and there's really a couple of
really good libraries from bitly that
will do this for you but my experience
is if you want to build like a micro
service architecture you're kind of
putting all those things in your
services is kind of the thing you should
probably try and avoid because again
every time you want to add additional
components you then need to build an
exponentially weighted moving average
load balancer in that service in our
language and you just have like a huge
kind of step before you want to you want
to do that work and then the other thing
we do um in RF structure is push as many
things as possible to being asynchronous
so there are certain things we have to
do which are synchronous for example if
if I buy something in a shop we
obviously need to check I have enough
money to actually be able to make that
payment and in order for that to happen
we have to make some synchronous call
through and get a response back to the
card Network and that doesn't have to be
too quick but it does have to be a
synchronous response however we use
Kafka to publish events of everything
that's happened in our infrastructure
and for example if we have a service
here we would have some kind of business
event we'd publish that this has
happened then any of elsinore
infrastructure can consume that and then
from these they can then make additional
synchronous requests and if those fail
the kind of queuing system will allow
them to retry with some kind of
exponential back-off the problem with
any kind of infrastructure like this is
inevitably you have no idea what's going
on so I might know like this section and
someone else in the company all know
that section and this is some something
that you have to deal with if you are
making calls between different services
so having well-defined interfaces which
allow you to essentially read the
documentation rather than speaking in
depth to different teams is kind of
really really useful for that
the other thing that's really useful is
various tooling so someone used kind of
tracing systems like Zipkin know okay a
couple of people so Zipkin allows you to
trace a request as it goes all the way
through your infrastructure which if you
have a number of services they all kind
of crossing a request boundary that
that's extremely valuable because it's
the only way you can really do bug
things like this so go allows you to do
this really easily so given a request
that's kind of propagating through three
services we'd start right at the top we
in our API tag every request with a
unique ID which is just a type for you
it and then we pass that down through
each request and kind of we basically
marshal at once the wire send it as
headers unmarshal it in the server and
kind of pop it all the way down the
stack and in go we can use the context
package so go how use this used to be
actually an external package and it's
recently at 1.7 moved into the standard
library so it's available built into the
language and the context package is
essentially providing something like
thread-local variables so go doesn't
have thread-local variables there aren't
any threads and in a context it's
basically an object that is immutable
so it's thread safe and we can store
values of any key and any value and that
allows us to store our trace ID and pass
it all the way through so we can pass
that ID all the way down and then each
one of these steps we can kind of send
off instrumentation data and then we can
aggregate all of that we actually use a
tool called phosphor internally but
Zipkin basically does the same thing and
probably much better and then we get all
of that data into something that is
completely unintelligible like this but
obviously this is intended for a machine
consumption because we can take that and
we can generate core graphs so this is
an example
of a kind being charged in the store so
we have our API right at the top we have
done this section that's synchronous
which is kind of the minimum things we
can do to charge someone's card we kind
of need to look up the cars we have to
record the transaction update the
balance kind of things like that and
then as a part of that we fire an
asynchronous message on take Africa
which is reliable and nothing else
happens synchronously so in the app you
have a list of things essentially on
your bank account that happened and at
this point that is not appeared and it
will appear at some point because we
have a durable queue but it's not
essential that I appears immediately so
we can kind of shunt that off to like an
asynchronous processor and then at some
point that will get picked up and we
will take the transaction and we'll look
up what the company was we'll try and
get a logo for it see if it's already
got one kind of like add as much
metadata to that as possible and then
we'll far another message asynchronously
and then something picks that up and
actually insert it into the customers
feed in their app and then that again
finds something is infamously and then
at some point they get sent a push
notification which looks something like
this and the cool thing is here we have
a coffee cup emoji because it's a
Starbucks which is clearly an extremely
important feature but the cool thing is
that all of this stuff happens and you
get this before the receipt prints on
the machine even though all of these
things have happened asynchronously but
if anyone was broken your card would
still work and you just get like a
delayed message like 10 seconds later or
worst case scenario if it's too late we
wouldn't send the push notification but
it would arrive and people can still use
their card they can spend their money
and they still have a very reliable
system even though we have all this
additional functionality we want to
provide in actual well in actuality this
is a massive lie what actually happens
is that so there's lots of other things
that happen and the other cool thing is
each one of these things we can
aggregate log lines
using a logging library we have this
trace ID we can write that on every log
line we can pump that into analog
occupation system and that means we get
every log line for every one of these
requests even though they're on
different servers different services and
we can tie all of those things back
together and obviously expire them quite
quickly because there's quite a lot of
data and again you can use this kind of
data to aggregate kind of maps of your
systems and like really understand kind
of how these things work so why should
use go from my perspective go is a small
simple and really easy language to learn
so we found it really easy to be able to
like hire people obviously hiring is
quite difficult if it's language that
not many people have learnt so having
the ability to pick up really easy
idiomatic code has been incredible for
us and I don't think we've had anyone
who's had any any problems of that at
all
on top of that go has excellent
concurrency really good communication
the networking stacks amazing
so for micro services where essentially
all you're doing is communicating over
the network all the time that's kind of
like a really really good thing to have
there are inevitably some downsides so
as I mentioned if you're integrating
with kind of some specific technologies
there might be not be libraries that
particular one tested there have
historically been problems with vending
so if you have dependent libraries they
obviously change over time and you need
to kind of pull all of that source code
into your tree so the way that we do
that is we actually vendor every version
into a single giant repository which is
pretty huge but the advantages there is
that we can vet those dependencies as
they pulled in so we obviously have to
do things like change control is as a
financial company and we can vet those
and we know that that is the code that's
compiled and it's a deterministic build
every time so should you start things
with micro services
probably quite a contentious thing I'd
say the disadvantage of doing this is
when we started building a company I
knew nothing about banking and I
probably still don't know very much
about banking and if you don't know a
huge amount about your your business
that you're trying to build then it's
very difficult to make those kind of
delineations between the services that
you want to build and you end up with
interfaces that then change which then
causes problems however if you do
understand your infrastructure and you
understand your kind of product that
you're building really well then it's
kind of a really easy thing to do you
can easily pull these services out and
pipe them across and go as a perfect
language to do them and that's about it
thank you very much
so there are few questions yeah how do
you transactionally commit events to
Kafka so Catholic itself we run in
cluster mode so you write to a partition
try and remember exactly how the code
works basically we when a request comes
in we will write those into Kafka the
credit card network is kind of an
interesting one because it's essentially
a two-phase commit we we will get we'll
get an authorization message we will
write that into our transaction database
if that fails then we return failure
back to the card Network if that
succeeds but we still return failure
then they kind of retry and if that
still fails then two days later it
essentially gets undone by the card
network as far as I actually going to
Kafka we we write everything to kind of
partition so you have your key will
basically hash to a specific partition
and you write it straight into them so
yeah there aren't enough to be failure
modes I mean there always are in
distributed systems but yeah Kafka kind
of means once it's committed it's
definitely replicated to multiple
machines ok go by default has a very
peculiar way of organizing source code
files how do you structure your source
code and why interesting and so go
stores code in packages and essentially
we would define a package as a folder
with many files as long as they will
have the same package name it doesn't
really matter how they're broken up
across those files but we usually try
and kind of break up as an example if we
have a service with multiple handlers so
multiple kind of different requests
that's going to handle each one of those
will go in a different file within a
handler package and then go provides a
way to either export those or keep them
internal within the package so we would
export which you basically by giving
them a capital letter at the beginning
you export kind of a defined interface
and the default thing is to basically
keep everything
encapsulated unless you specifically
want to export like a kind of node
interface that okay how do you define so
next term sectional boundaries when
multiple services are invoked within a
single unit of work and what about
rollback undo the service
number four out of five fails within
that unit of work so distributed
transactions basically yeah that's
that's like not really a thing so
basically the way we do this
specifically using Kafka for those
things is Kafka is not really a queue
it's a replicated kind of log and that
means that we define define our messages
very specifically so every message has a
specific schema and we publish those so
one worker will be consuming particular
messages so if it can't process one of
those messages it basically means the
entire system is down and that consumer
will kind of that consumer in a consumer
group incalculable pause and kind of
wait until we can then resume them so in
the case of specific the only case
that's really counts is where you're
moving money atomically which is
obviously something that's quite
important and in that case we we do like
kind of two-phase commit in the database
and again if that fails our Cod
processes upstream will send us a
failure message and they retry that wall
most indefinitely so all I could really
say is like if there's anything you can
ever do to avoid distributed
transactions you should I'm sure you can
by extremely expensive proprietary
software for it but there's nothing
really in the open source world that
will do that for you
so yeah we basically log transactions
and then kind of retry them and alert if
those have failed his database support
good and go what are using yeah so
database support is actually really good
if you're using anything that's SQL
based the standard library has an SQL
driver you can then play
in specific database drivers into that
and it gives you a standardized
interface essentially for like normal
SQL databases we actually use Cassandra
which is because we was we used Sandra
if like 95% of the data that we use
there are certain things you can't
really use Cassandra for where you need
kind of atomicity but Cassandra means
that we can run a distributed database
we run it with quorum reads and writes
within a data center and we route
request to the kind of correct place so
that we can read and write a corn the
support for Cassandra is okay and go I'd
say most of the problems mostly outages
we have a probably due to that and
that's something that we are
progressively improving but yeah a mixed
bag can you show code and go with a
micro service mm-hmm some samples uh as
in some of my code
yeah sure okay let's find something good
not very sure wasn't scream come maybe
not that whole thing go
okay so let's use the web poker service
as an example yeah I am just trying to
find our first kill just close all the
other things I do okay uh so Oh wrong
screen yeah that one we have quite a lot
services but oh I can't see this at all
sorry everyone okay so if we have a look
on our um web poke API that I mentioned
a minute ago our - libraries open source
so we basically in it with a few kind of
known settings so all all go programs
have an extremely small there we go all
go programs have a func main and this is
the entry point your entire program and
in that all we really do is we define a
service and then we run that service so
that kind of like an internal library
the kicks off HTTP server and then all
our handlers are doing is each one of
these
let's find lists so if you want to list
your web hooks which you can do by the
public API we have registered get slash
which would be slash web hooks flash and
that is well this is kind of using a bit
of a terrible compatibility layer
probably the wrong one to have picked
this is going to take in a HTTP request
and some parameters and then it is going
to check for an account ID it's going to
return a validation error and it checked
if you authenticated we also pull out
your OAuth client ID and then this is
the interesting part where we use
protocol buffers anyone use protocol
buffers few people
okay so protocol buffers for us are just
a way of defining essentially
message request response and they allow
you to compile that to any number of
languages so it's really cool if you
want to use request responses across a
number of services and we just have our
particular response type and we make a
request if anyone wants to come in like
specifically ask me this is probably not
hugely useful on on this screen but I
can walk you through kind of like a
slightly more sample application what
turn ative x' to go did you consider a
good question so actually in our case um
myself and a few other people worked at
halo before so we moved from PHP and
Java kind of originally kind of
monolithic system to a service-oriented
architecture that had kind of run full
of services and then a few more services
and then we rewrote that in a
combination of going Java and actually
as a result of um go was kind of our
default choice we did we did consider
Ruby for a really short period of time
only because that was like super fast
startup kind of get approached hype out
but that would never have been a kind of
long-term solution for a micro service
architecture look you kind of suggest
splitting your problem into micro
services is hard is this not something
then can be done continuously rather
than upfront yes it is so if you're
sorting all from scratch and you have a
really really basic product then you
probably only have a handful of services
and you can probably understand that
problem well enough to break the problem
apart so in our case we obviously have
some kind of known constants things like
a bank account has transactions so we
have a transaction service we have a
number of bank accounts so we have an
account service equally people have a
profile with their name address and
various other things and those things
are very easily discernible the problem
comes if you then realize you haven't
quite broken apart in the right way and
that's something that's much easier if
you're doing a migration because you
understand your problem domain much
better than if you're building a problem
like building a company entire from
scratch um so it is a continuous process
and actually
on one of these slides I think in the
the one we had no mail as long as
there we go I'm sorry this is a good
example where we we starts off with a
kind of a slow growth and then we
rebuilt some things and actually deleted
a large section of our infrastructure
and then that's kind of gone up and down
and fluctuated as we've gone up and
there have been many times where we've
kind of refracted at one service into a
couple or delete those and that's
definitely a continuous process did you
consider encapsulating that Java MQ and
a go service we did however what we've
actually done is encapsulated literally
in something which will take in messages
and call a specific other service which
is go so we have a driver service that
essentially connects to MQ and we don't
pull the messages off and that's virtual
it does so it's written in Scala and
it's probably like 50 lines of code it's
really really small and that means that
all we're doing there is pulling
messages off and dispatching them to
another service which is an NGO which we
then have all of our domains or chicken
so it means it's like really nice and
small and actually reusable so if we end
up having to connect to multiple
different providers but with different
configuration we can actually just
configure like this set of instances of
that service to push data there and this
one depreciate that okay that's it
remember to rate and thank you man thank
you very much
