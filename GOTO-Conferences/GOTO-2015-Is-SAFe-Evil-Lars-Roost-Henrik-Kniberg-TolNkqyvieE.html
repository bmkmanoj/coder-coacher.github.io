lost and I am a consultant part-time at
Lego and balloon I live in Sweden but
spend some time there and I'm last I
work at Lego you're normally I've been
there for two years I had the pleasure
of having Henrik with us a week every
month or so and I work with the digital
marketing and that's where we get to
play a lot yes and we are on a very
interesting journey and we'd like to
share some experiences with you yes and
and the course of topic today is is is
this right and you're all waiting for
the answer right all waiting for the
answer and we're just gonna cut it short
and just give you the answer oh so are
you ready got your notepads right okay
oh no no no wait that's the wrong one
okay here comes the real answer so I say
people lush no yeah right thank you very
much thank you yeah so I think we're
early yeah we made up the time maybe we
have time for questions questions shall
we do questions or elaborations do you
want us to say some more you're not
happy with this answer okay let's try
something okay be difficult and yes
that's it oh this is a tool this is
another tool yeah any favorites it has a
favorite - hammer yes hands up pretty
much just a joke no no no saws who likes
saws best nobody likes salsa evil yeah
these are tools right tools are neither
good nor evil right it depends on what
you do with it
my three old had one of those I was
even the most even the most innocent
tool can hurt right
even those innocent things can be used
in a way that hurts you so we look at
safe as a it's a toolbox right see it's
a toolbox safe it's a toolbox there's a
bunch of tools in there you can use
tools or hit yourself in the foot or you
can use tools for valuable stuff right
so we know we don't think safe as an
either evil nor good nor anything else
right so maybe we should talk about what
this is yeah why right
this is scaled outdoor framework any
questions fairly self-explanatory I
assume right now this is the picture you
see when you go to the scale to add your
framework site and it's kind of scary
right Oh big scary so we hope to decode
this a little bit and here is the very
short much shorter version of it or the
shorter version of the description um
you know the agile thing right it's like
an umbrella it's a bunch of great ideas
and then there is a bunch of concrete
methods that are implement these
principles well safe is just another one
of those frameworks that tries to be
agile although it encompasses scrum and
XP and other methods right that means
nothing let's get more concrete really
short really really short and five
minutes okay summary of safe safe
assumes scrum at the team level it just
as soon as people are doing scrum right
so it's an agile framework that has to
assume people are doing scrum at the
team level and that they have product
backlogs all those safe calls at team
backlogs which actually is a probably a
better term right yep it assumes stories
that are supposed to be testable it
assumes Sprint's that are two to three
weeks typically at lega we do two weeks
and it doesn't say much more than do
scrum now if you do is from then what
safe does what safe adds to the party is
this second level called the program
level it basically raises abstraction
level level a little bit and provide
some guidance as to well what if we're
doing something bigger so it introduced
the concept of a team of teams which for
some bizarre reason is called an agile
release train very confusing but
actually it means the team of teams it's
an organizational unit right so this
team of teams is called an art release
train it introduces a notion of a
program backlog which is pretty much
just like a product backlog or a team
but at a higher level so here we have a
features instead of stories they're just
bigger things that's all we mean things
that are too big to fit in a sprint
there should be releasable testable
customer valuable and then just like you
have Sprint's there are two weeks safe
introduce the concepts of product
increments which is just a series of
Sprint's so you take a team of teams
high level higher level backlog and you
string together three or four sprints
and then that's pretty much the the
program level and safe right so high
level planning um nothing safe is really
new it's just recognizing kind of
patterns that people are using and just
putting some words to it
then there's a third level which is
really about interfacing with the kind
of more corporate side of things with
how we do budgeting how we do portfolio
planning they provide some guidance as
to how to do that I won't go into
details but it introduced notions such
as portfolio Kanban system ideas such as
epic which normally an agile epic just
means a big story here they're a little
bit more specific and say they're epic
is like a mini business case it's
something that you might never even
finish that big it's just an area in
which we're doing work so think of epic
as as a factory that generates features
and a feature is a little factor that
kind of generates stories so three
different eye lenses that you're kind of
wearing when you're looking at the world
does that kind of make sense because
this is buried in hundreds of details
but the underlying core idea and safe is
pretty much this and it's nothing really
strange a lot of companies do this
anyway safe or not so the idea of
two-tier planning is kind of fundamental
in any kind of a complex scenario we got
multiple teams building something big
you need to look further than just one
sprint at a time so safe gives a little
bit of the how you might do that
another idea or more like a mr.
misunderstanding a common source and
misunderstanding is that oh and say if
you got these big batches right you got
to work two months and then deliver
something huge at the end no that's just
a misconception we have this longer
cycle here this cycle that's just a
planning cycle so you can release her
release candy you can do continuous
delivery and have release candidates all
the time you shouldn t release when when
whenever you want so that idea and safe
is not we should batch this up that D is
just planning cadence but release is
release on demand
so that's it that's the theory part now
you know everything well okay some parts
of what you need to know about safe
let's give you an example
yeah so just pretty much like going to
Mass the Devils in the detail and stuff
kind of gets more complex and its skills
so it's spent some time looking at the
how this actually looks at Lego I really
like pictures there'll be a lot of
pictures yes that's awesome as the ones
from us but anyway here's goes so let's
start with this so the call thing is
really that Julia to tier level planning
and the biggest change for us the Lego
has really been introducing that second
tier of an 8-week program increment we
keep those all were the planning events
and that's what I'm going to talk to you
about this is the rough agenda for such
an event I don't look at all the details
what you really should take away with
the ego here from this slide is it's
happening every eight weeks there's a
lot of kind of like this going on that's
all the blue stuff and there's a lot of
team breakouts sprint planning ish kind
of activity that's the yellow ones and
then there's some icing on top of it
management meeting when everybody's left
so um how does it look pretty much like
this right there yes it's a two day
event it's for us the last time one of
them forty people gathered in one big
room and it's a lot of experiments still
going on but also leading up to it
ending looking like kind of like this at
the beginning this is out looked that
was more big ish we had a total room
took your chess seats really didn't even
time it with the releases stuff but it
was a great start so so that's a in
order to kind of keep these things
started like today we need to kick this
off right if you have a hold for 140
people seeing a room you want them to do
planning look ahead you kind of forget
to have them in the mood so we start
with and it's looking back so what's
what's brought us here
so we think of these two days events
where they're happy
our management kind of making some
general statements about so how did it
go
while we ads and we we mix that up with
some data for the teams giving them a
foundation on to build well we should we
go what we were we have and then also
partly because it's legal and we're
doing a lot of cool stuff we show what
we've done so we let me see sound
doesn't really work so I'll experiment
you
so we pretty much make a little video
showing what what we've accomplished
what has been pushed live throughout the
previous cycle and this is just some
highlights not everything nope
and this is kind of this what we start
with when this is done with the looking
back part is done and we started
preparing the teams for doing planning
so most of the cases where people are
supplies safe it's a lot of teams
building one product so it's about
setting a vision for that product it's
about giving information about that
product that's not the case for our in
our situation so digit solutions that
does digital marketing it Lego we were
14 teams when we started this with 21
teams by now and we're not building one
product building a lot of different
experiences released on a lot of
different channels and we're doing that
with the teams building on shared
components she had beggins services but
adding a lot of different stuff on top
of it and we're doing it in an
environment where teams constantly are
changing the relationships between their
so that's the complexity that we try to
help the teams grasp
we're foregoing is planning and we do
that with a lot of lightning talks so
safe doesn't say anything about
lightning talks it's been some of the
things that emerged why we took off of
this journey so we have lightning talks
about high-level priorities for the
biggest of the experiences that we're
going to work with in the upcoming
program increment we have lightning
talks about architectural stuff we're
doing something with Lego ID you really
all should be aware of that stuff is
changing your architecture and you may
be affected with it but we also take the
time to talk about things that affect
our teams that they don't really think
about um so it's stuff like digital
child safety it's Global Insights
changes in privacy laws around the globe
so all kind of topics that are related
to planning that the team should think
about be aware of when when looking at
doing the stories and we also do again
spent some time looking inward today
anywhere this hackathon event coming up
make some time for it would be cool
if you participate that's a set is a
result of experimentation so we do spend
quite a lot of time throughout this
event also to gather feedback from all
the teams participating so we have
feedback boards just giving us instant
feedback on not expensive with the app
here but anyway so how should be this
evolve how should look next time and
these events rarely look the same from
time to time so we've done it five times
now and been really really different
each time I'll be different next time as
well so this is a picture from from the
breakout sessions so we had the first
day started with a lot of from the stage
talks like this where for lunch and the
team start breaking out into actually
looking ahead for the four sprints so
you do kind of sprint planning like they
would we still have spent planning so
this is a bit more high-level and it's a
bit more output facing so it's preparing
you really look at your stories you
really want to get it made what you do
in the upcoming sprint this is just as
much looking towards all the other teams
looking at what changes do we expect who
do we expect to work together with so
the teams will talk with each other both
about dependencies but also about
figuring out if you can help help each
other and since this this takes up about
half of the first day and it takes up
about half of the second day as well
that's quite some time and since we have
21 teams they don't all need the same
kind of time to plan so won't be
finished early some will finish late and
general thing goes off to feet you can
do whatever you like
at these events we expect you to live a
a result by the end of the day we expect
it to stay at the venue because somebody
else made in YouTube but basically in
the meantime and the breakout you can do
whatever you like
that does the job so there's some kind
of things that we do in order to support
this this event first of all is even
though we don't build one product we do
have some major products that are come
out experiences and for those there's a
backlog going into the event so the
teams
eternal owner that prod owner will be
have been part of maturing work going
into the vents but at the event they
kind of pull the stuff that that they
want to work on so this is the program
backlog with features that it's that
second level we talk yes we experiment
with that a lot so currently it's a
digital version it kind of works also
yeah you can do that with most tools but
again it's it's it's you know experience
kind of building on to going here
getting here that's not soon you maybe
knew what what the teams need to deliver
by the end of the event is basically
this one it's a team board stating I PR
objectives high-level intents of in
business terms of what the team wants to
accomplish throughout the next two
months some stretch objectives of course
risks and then they they are free to
kind of put in the main user stories on
these policy sports are taking what the
team's home so it works as a visual
radio information radiator both what the
team is doing but also at the event I
have to share them with each other have
something visual to talk about this is
filled out one so you see here they
they've added all kinds of information
also about load velocity a basically a
high-level plan for each sprint this is
what are their kind of business level
objectives we want to achieve and then
some risks just a little picture of what
this team is gonna be yeah well
typically the first point is per
detailed the rest not so much things can
allow to change within reasonable limits
another thing we're really grown grown
really happy with is the program board
it's basically the big piece of paper
where the Sprint's down here we have all
the teams as columns here and as soon as
team identifies dependency to another
team they get together in from the board
they talk about it and they put up
sticky notes kind of indicating well
here we need to work together or here
you need to have something done before
we can start doing our stuff this grows
a lot which is cool it's about four by
two meters or so and it's really awesome
both for the teams to work with on the
events but
also for me as program manager coming
back home can recognizing pattern so you
probably see somebody here having really
a lot of dependencies to them
dependencies are from yellow to red so
this is this one and here's some teams
will be pretty independent this upcoming
program commit and we we really hope
that this way would help us kind of
structuring the event so that we
wouldn't have to bring everybody every
time but it turns out that dependencies
really change from programming to kind
of a a centralized tool but it's it's a
centralized tool to enable a
decentralized behavior so thanks to this
we don't have to have some genius to
figure out all the penalties instead
people can kind of self organize yeah
I've just really been been limiting all
the the overhead done outside of the
teams kind of trying to figure this out
for them and so instead of self having
them it's something that we also use
during the program in command so we we
take with with us back and we have our
sconce grumps a couple of times each
week in front of it keeping track of
what the stuff develops at with as we
thought it would
putting up new dependencies removing
those that weren't there anyway
yeah I know the typical calm stuff
another one we uses there is a report I
mean the concept of roaming resolve own
accept mitigate risks is not new but at
least many places I it's it's not
something that edge our teams use a lot
at some way but but this is our attempt
to kind of get them to work with the
during the event so having a dar seems
actually think about what risks do we
see getting it up as posters involving
the immediate management kind of to find
a solution right on the spot and also
keeping track of stuff that hasn't been
able to resolve i've been resolved so by
the end of the day they all team will
have a board the team Paula I shorted
and safe says now you do a draft plan
review so everybody gets to hear
everybody's story about the draft plan
that doesn't really work for us because
we have a lot of teams that doesn't
necessarily work on the same stuff so
that was a really boring hour
instead what we do is have up put up the
boss around the room have one from each
team stay back to be able to present
what they what what their plan is and
have everybody else give them the
opportunity to circle around and talk to
what team they think will be most
interesting we structured the bit so
they'll be four rounds the first two
with ten minutes at second two or five
that seems to be a good balance but
pretty much empowering the teams to
figure out what they think is important
without trying to micromanage it
basically we learned that nobody wants
to know everybody else's plan but almost
all teams want to know some other team's
plans except the balance once this is
done the first day is pretty much done
the teams can go home sleep a bit on the
plan before coming in on the second day
and since we have all this visual
information the risks both program boss
the player the the back locks for some
of the major experiences it gives us a
pretty unique opportunity to bring in
senior management and go through risk
balls go through program board go
through the back locks having a product
owners to say well this I don't see any
problem here we don't have any risks
that need to be escalated I'm pretty
okay with what has been pulled from my
back lock until now and kind of just in
less than an hour go through the the top
things from the first day and the great
thing about this other than creating
some transparency visualization upwards
is being able actually for management to
get back to the teams in the day on the
start of the second day and we give back
to them what they think are we on the
right track is there something that we
need to look more into and especially
also so you raise this impediment this
risk was really painful for you we've
done something about it or at least
we've put found somebody who's going to
take a care of it and that I think is
really powerful about doing this as a
two day event pretty much the second day
is straight forward there's more team
breakouts like the first day we have a
final plan review and final plan
feedback part here we still kind of keep
to the old way of doing things so
everybody will hear everybody's plan
this is one of the things that will
change because it doesn't yet work for
us of course if a confidence vote or
something I think we're going to change
voting you're giving your confidence and
stuff that you're not involved in not so
energizing I say and again we don't take
the opportunity to learn from this so
the event concludes we're there a
respective well it seems to retrospect
this on their own and we have the scrum
masters coming in and kind of collecting
the data from all teams into one big
improvement back lock both having some
data on how they find that this works
for them it works okay I think yeah up
there
that's really really happy not so happy
yeah so we got most people are fours and
fives nowadays some some still hate it
but but usually their feedback is very
concrete it's stuff we can do things
about so what what what's good to say
about this is that generally speaking
people seem to like the idea of this
type of event the devil is just inside
the details yeah so um yeah so the
question is is it safe or not where are
we following the rules or not and the
answer is who cares because I don't know
how many of you follow the building
instructions when you build Lego how
many of you sometimes don't did you see
it did you take a photo of that cop that
right okay yeah the thing there's a
really useful model just a little bit of
theory again I'm just check around time
bit behind what should be cool so
there's a very useful model called shoe
hurry from Japan basically describing
different stages of learning and I find
it really useful when talking about
processes when at the shoe level you're
basically following the rules if you
learn to ski you're probably doing
something like that right because why
because the teacher tells you to not
giving you any theory they're saying do
like that do what the teacher says and
why do you ski like that in the
beginning well because it's fairly safe
it'll get you down the slope right
without dying probably so when you have
to sure level you don't want someone to
give you theory and options and
background you just want someone to say
just tell me how to hold the goddamn
golf club or whatever is you're trying
to learn give me the recipe at the high
level you're kind of beyond that I kind
of get it I can get down the slope now
what if I find my own style I want to
combine it
technique I want to move faster take
some risks right when you got the high
level you don't want someone to tell you
exactly what to do
instead you want to look at different
toolkits for example and you want to
experiment a little bit and a
three-level you don't need a rules at
all
that doesn't mean you're really really
awesome it just means that you're at the
point where right now you don't need
someone you don't need to think about
rule so probably most of you are at a
three level when you ride the bicycle
right anybody here think about rules and
techniques when you're gonna ride the
bicycle probably not maybe if you maybe
if you're gonna start competing on
bicycles you might jump back to the shoe
level for a while to get better right
but generally speaking it this is a
useful model because when you take
something like safe you need to think
about what at what level are we do we
have a basic functioning scaling
situation today then maybe you don't
need to just go by the rulebook
however if you feel less confident and
you want to you don't yeah and you you
want you want to use like a recipe
affiliate you want answers you want
someone to tell you what to do then shoe
could be very useful so basically if it
takes you level scrums shoe level XP
shoe level Kanban shoe little safe
they're all pretty good they're not bad
but they're not awesome
so take the shoe level it'll get you
going it'll get you down the slope but
then start braking and tweaking the
rules so we started pretty much out at
you right doing by the book doing this
right shoe level scaling and then we
quite quickly started tweaking and take
taken away and stuff we didn't like
keeping the stuff we like and now we're
kind of in some I would say more aha
state where we're experimenting a lot
and whether or not what we're doing is
officially safe it doesn't really matter
I would say mostly yes because we're
doing mostly stuff and safe but in the
end a year maybe it won't even be
recognizable okay so yeah a little bit
about our actual journey how yes so why
did we end up where we are when I when I
said when we started to work with this
about a year ago we well probably all
heard about Lego did close a lot it has
been it has done for quite some years
and it hopefully will do so for some
years to come yet so so stuff just grows
and it gets more more complex and we had
a hard time kind of keeping up so we had
something working at the team level
that's scrum thing but kind of worked
so so we really wanted to focus on
simplicity and that collaboration that
we have in the teams and try to see if
we could bring that to all the stuff
that was happening around the teams so
team works all that stuff around it not
so much so what do we do with we have a
lot of teams so we're looking for
inspiration that there are definitely a
lot and this is not even coming close to
being a complete map of frameworks
sources for inspiration on how to scale
a child beyond the team level and now we
use them we use the the tools metaphor
another metaphor is most because I
really want to show you this picture is
recipes so so we were looking for
cookbooks with recipes that we could use
and saves definitely a really thick
cookbook a lot of good ideas but but I
want to highlight a couple of them
though so so we had we had teams some of
them were using scrum something using
Kanban and we have a portfolio process
running in Lego it's not just for
digital stuff it's for all of Lego so if
impact logistics and operations and plot
development all that nun gets digital
stuff at at Lego but but what we didn't
have is this middle part that thing
between the teams and the non digital
portfolio process and and actually the
dude concept of having that and the
picture that kind of conveyed that idea
to those we needed to convince to get
start on this journey and also the way
it does it actually gave us a lot of of
great inspiration so we haven't done all
of what's in here we don't have our
formal release management group and all
the kind of stuff we have some of them
what made sense for us we do have
assistance teams for example but but the
biggest thing we did was actually
introducing that guy the release train
engineer or program manager chief scrum
master or what ever you want to call him
and that's that guy that's this guy
basically somebody who could speak of
behalf of teams of teams
and somebody who could try to focus and
work with processes that weren't inside
the team and also weren't traditional
management thinking but was something in
between finding a bridge between the two
of those
but the facilitation role not not our
management role no I don't have line
management responsibilities so we but we
really really gained at first and
foremost is transparency into a lot of
things so everything from details such
as not not aligned definition of done
across teams - I would love waste in the
way that we try to get projects from the
portfolio to teams a lot of that stuff
kind of pops up when you try to try it
we started running big man big room
planning so we all of different things
popped up so one of the first really
solid effects we saw is that instead of
having a program which program
management office that was doing a lot
of Excel sheets calculations and
figuring out how to best combine people
in order to do the projects at what we
thought one on here a year in advance
would be the perfect timing didn't work
so instead now we try to flow the
project to the teams let them pull based
on business value right now and we
actually have found out that the team
start to organize themselves so we don't
tell the teams to move a developer the
teams suggest that we maybe should lend
the developer cross teams in this
program and comment which is really
awesome we also see even though it's
it's not as apparent that we hope it
would be increased predictability in the
way that stories flow through our
organization so we really had a big
impact when we started to start at this
thing our first time was here but since
then at least the data indicates that we
are becoming more predictable in the way
that stories flow through our
organization and what this does it calms
down stakeholders it takes away some
frustration and waste when we get a
little bit more predictability as what's
gonna be delivered when roughly yeah it
is survey asking the team's how they
feel about safe and what it's done for
you them so something great things is
that we experienced that
most are getting a better picture of
what our priorities right now so it
becomes more visual because we have it
open they can see it for all teams not
just their own and they generally
believe they are starting to add more
value whether they are actually adding
more value or just being more aware of
it I don't know but at least it's a good
thing but there are also some things
that aren't working out for us yet so we
thought well if we do this big planning
meeting will probably need less
alignment meetings along the way I
didn't really look it like that so I
haven't asked the obvious question
whether they're actually spending more
times and meetings my gut feeling tells
me that a lot of developers are spending
more times at meetings but I think it
may be also a good thing to some extent
and we are not and we have not focused
on limiting our work in progress so we
thought that we expect that where we
probably have a better foundation going
forward to work with the concept of
limiting work in progress
not on a team level but on a program
level you might say what what has
happened with SAF has increased
transparency which means making us more
aware of the root cause of whip overflow
but it's not solving it so just like
most agile messes they show you the
problem they don't make the problem go
away
so we got to keep experimenting with
that yeah and there's some other less
tangible things so the teams are
starting to feel a momentum so having
this big event every second month
creates a sense of urgency a sense of
urgency inwards towards the team's being
able knowing that there'll be a lot of
attention on what has been delivered at
that point in time and it's also
creating a sense of urgency towards the
organization around us so previously
what will you give that agile group you
can take and stuff anytime right it's
somehow knowing that this is when we
plan and then there'll be two months
kind of helps people to recognize maybe
we should get that last requirement done
now instead of waiting just that one
week or two weeks and maybe three it
also creates a lot of advantage of
change so big change is there but seeing
at the events seeing that stuff has
changed it's not the same as last I
think helps us enact that we are in a
changing environment that we want to do
differently tomorrow than we did
yesterday and that we want to improve
and I think this this is really a great
opportunity to show it not just to talk
about it and finally we do have a
corporate IT department those are doing
our infrastructure those are hosting our
service that we be built on top of they
are running waterfall and having this -
second layer of planning with two months
increments kind of thing seems to be a a
reasonable Bella middle ground between
waterfall and our agile process
something that we both can work with
helping us to know that these are our
synchronization points yep so we're not
done yet this will probably look a lot
different than a year two but something
that we we do see is that we bring in
stakeholders to these events so some of
the people that we are making it
experiences for but also other people
that are building software solutions and
Lego and we see that this safe concept a
big room concept is sneaking in
everywhere so everybody from legal
education or doing their own thing to
corporate IT who are really keen on that
waterfall process are kind of starting
to look at this table this may be
something we can work with like a virus
spreading right it's very interesting
and it's actually a pretty I'm actually
amazed about what I'm seeing it's really
interesting to see other parts of Lego
come to our events look at this or like
wow we want this not of course exactly
this but they see that okay there there
is a way to be more agile than we are
today
and now we see how roughly that can work
and a lot of very interesting change is
happening so we're this is a very real
thing happening spreading around so yeah
now we're gonna give you some opinions
our personal very biased opinions
there's some things okay
let's start with what we like first of
all being beyond being just a tool to do
planning big complains actually a big
social
thing as some of the first times we had
we had a director coming in in the
middle of it and Wow this kind of feels
like a startup so this love also energy
in this that I personally really think I
like so this is another one of those
it's one of those ideas and say if you
can do this without safe it's just the
idea of planning as a social event as
opposed to planning being a bunch of
project manager sending email to each
other right so getting everyone into
room it just turns out to be a pretty
effective way of doing it also the
program boat I really like it as a
conversation tool so both having
conversations want getting stuff up
there having conversations about what's
up there and having conversations about
what changes are there and seeing
patterns I I totally love it there's
another example of evolution in the
first few of product increments we had a
lots of stuff up here all the features
what was all that what was each team
working on was up there which is felt
like a really good idea in theory in
practice it wasn't because it was just
information overload so we have now is
just dependencies yellow is something
that depends on pink the red yarn shows
the connection and that's all we need
where are the dependencies that need to
be sorted out if there's stuff you're
gonna work on that doesn't have
dependencies you don't need to put it up
here and again it's it's transparency if
you have a mentor thing why is that so
difficult what you do it is this complex
we can't just make that go away
and I think talking about risks that our
teams having a formal lightweight tool
for that having it visualized I also
think works yep but it's it's not all
yep so like those were some of the stuff
we like and it's not just us I think
most people we talked to kind of
appoint these out as things that they
like but there are some things to be
aware of don't get stuck in Shu right so
you've attended the four day or the two
days certification and they come back
with tons and tons and tons and tons of
manuals and checklists and whatnot and
if you do all that well yeah it can be a
huge problem so be careful Xiu can get
you started but don't take the whole
elephant maybe right take the parts you
need and maybe follow through some of
the rules for awhile and then start
bending them some things to be aware of
watch off accusing
matches yes so there is if you look in
this picture and this picture by the way
is pretty much useless unless you've
attended a course understand all the
parts in it but once you do have to have
attended of course it serves as a pretty
good reference for remembering what was
in it but anyway inside did you see lots
of little cues kind of everywhere and
their click here they can be a blessing
they can be a curse so you got to be
careful with that safe can easily turn
into this big monster if you have
everything if you have all these lists
and don't believe in hype or or anti
hype that applies not just a safe but
most things right there's been a lot of
hype around agile in general there's
been some anti hype around the safe
which is kind of interesting which
brings me to the point where we might
insult some people so I apologize in
advance if I'm gonna insult some of you
but that is probably gonna happen who's
seen this picture before right it's a
pretty good picture right what it shows
you is how much knowledge you have of a
topic and correlating that to your
willingness to speak up and spread your
opinions on that topic right and how
loudly and you know what that is
those of you have seen the picture
what's the name of this mountain
it's called Mount stupid this is the
Mount stupid this is when oh I I just
saw this website and damn I don't like
safe safe is crap and then he started
telling anyone safe is crap that was
very real for me because a couple of
years ago people started asking me
randomly out of nowhere
Henrick what do you think of safe and I
was like safe what's the tech is that
what do you think is safe and and I
would go find the site I'm like whoa big
hairy thing well I don't know it's just
feels a bit scary but I have no training
in I have no experience in it I don't
know how can I think anything of it and
then ask what do you think is safe and
they say it's horrible it's it's
terrible it's like this big monster
eating agile and I asked him oh wow so
have you had experience in this no have
you had any training in it
no so you're on Mount stupid that
exactly what amounts to pit is how can
you know if something is good or bad if
you haven't seen it or had any training
in it at least one of those two I would
kind of expect so I've been trying very
hard not to be I'm not stupid
I just see this as a toolkit which may
potentially be great or or a horrible or
maybe somewhere in between I don't know
until I got contacted by Lego and
they're in this journey and I had to
help
okay so I better learn this so I spent
some time learning safe attended the
certification spent time on the ground
now for on and off for nine months and I
think kind of I think we're beyond not
stupid now yeah this hope so
probably hope may be somewhere here and
can kind of more confident to say that
no this is not evil this is a toolkit
and it can be used for good or bad right
so yeah just beware about stupid it's a
very common problem right so that was
the part where we get the insult people
okay let's let's wrap it up
takeaway points one is again just a
toolkit learn as many tools as you can
right learn how to use them learn when
they apply learn which parts apply when
that's a good habit especially people
doing agile coaching it's a good but it
be kind of independent of what's your
what's your what you work with if you're
a developer you want to learn as many
frameworks and tools as possible so you
can pick the best parts right just tools
either good or evil yeah and they're
certainly certainly a lot of them in
there so I heard the the assault read
the picture about the safe being like
this but when you cook spaghetti taking
you throw with the wall whatever sticks
you'll keep it's pretty basically like
that so there's a lot of linen and HR
principles in there
and a lot of this is sounding good so
yeah that was my big takeaway when I did
the course because I wanted to go to the
source I want to talk to be left will
understand what's a thinking behind and
that's gonna realize ah this is based on
lean and agile principles so
fundamentally most it kind of makes
sense it's just if there's maybe too
much of it right so safe is too little
scaling it that's my personal kind of
interpretation or simplification I think
of it as shoe level scaling it gives you
all the answers which is a blessing and
occurs again right gives you pretty much
all the answers you dig around in that
big picture you click on somewhere it'll
tell you exactly what they mean by it by
a DevOps team or what they mean by a
program backlog or whatever it is right
release train engineer it tells you
everything which can be very daunting so
just take just take take the stuff you
need yeah but this it does bring a lot
of useful to the to the to the party
we've we on the lower part bunch of
teams working together different
products
that just have a lot of dependencies it
helps us kind of manage or itself manage
that complexity but it's designed for a
bunch of teams working together on the
same product and I think it would make
it a lot easier than it has been for us
because you just can be much clearer
about what everybody's doing right yeah
so so this I guess is the sweet spot for
safe that's what it aim towards if you
attend a course they'll be kind of
assuming a context of budget ease
working on the same product but it turns
out that other contexts where you're
working on different products but you
just have a bunch of dependencies you
need some of this stuff anyway with or
without safety it's some kind of
synchronization and some kind of program
level a planning process some kind of
dependency management yeah and finally
again don't don't get stuck in Shu right
so keep keep experimenting and that's us
just and wherever and we finished early
how did that happen that's amazing right
we have time for questions we have five
minutes of questions anyone have a
question yes we didn't talk about IP so
install it does anybody know what IP
Spencer um safe introduces the concept
of heavy reserving the last sprints
within a program increment for
innovation and planning so basically
telling you do not plan the last print
because you should have some time for
looking ahead and you should have some
time for doing other stuff because most
of us know great scrum teams kind of get
in so that moment where they just crunch
stuff and and they sometimes forget to
breathe think and be innovative so what
we experience is when we plan three out
of four sprints and a program increment
we usually do deliver what we plant and
attendant on to do but it usually also
takes a bit longer so we don't plan the
last Sprint's but use it as a planning
buffer it's conscious very twisty by IP
Sprint I'll talk to a lot of people
about this also other places where
people are using safe and my conclusion
about that is it's it's a brilliant idea
they built in slack in the process
itself I don't really see other methods
do that scrum sort of does it via
yesterday's weather but here they're
explicitly saying leave this blank don't
put anything there right doesn't mean
we're gonna sleep there just means that
we leave space there for hackathons and
discovery and basically stuff that we
could really plan for and it has dual
purposes one has an overflow buffer if
some of these things took longer than we
thought they'll flow into there instead
of you know busting the whole plan but
it also provides a space for innovation
to happen at a place wrote for this big
planning meeting and other training
stuff fabulous this is like that noise
she's put probably also say so so we it
depends on context so within our context
we can reasonably assume that the world
doesn't change too much within a a
two-month time frame and also having
only four spawns in there's maybe change
outside if you look at what safe
kind of suggests but has been really a
good thing for you of us primarily
because it allows us to do this quite
often and we do change a lot from time
to time so it's been a way for us to
keep our iterations short and go in
faster so what we notice there is that I
haven't seen anyone succeed in doing
that anywhere yeah doing safe it's one
of those things that we should be doing
it but we don't really do it as in most
of the time disappears and you don't get
a lot of innovation but what I've
concluded is that even just trying to do
it it's helpful so you can if you just
do it to 20% it's helpful so it's a very
good ambition to have IQ sprints and I
think we're getting a little bit closer
every time we will have the Hat all this
time right we will have the heck of
something I thought it's gonna happen
right good question though yeah
yes to both let's find the big picture
right there all right yes we have a
systems team looking at our deployment
pipeline trying to improve tools for
everybody so system team is pretty much
what most companies have anyway they
just call different things yes which is
a team that is there to support other
teams I work a lot at Spotify we got a
whole bunch of teams like that their job
is to help other teams become more
effective so and say if there's a term
called architecture runway
become a which is a knife or for that so
there are there are a few functions that
are considered to be belonging to the
release train itself and their job is
not to be a bottleneck their job is to
make an able other teams to be faster
and if you look historically at the
development seems quite a few of them
were specialized so there was a
specialized legal ID team working with
them if there was a search team there
was a analytics team psycho team and so
on but what we've seen is that the
concept of having to pull from a comment
backlog having to figure out how to help
each other to achieve common goals has
motivated the teams along our nine-month
journey to become a bit more willing to
work outside their main area of
expertise so we're on a journey where
the teams bit by bit gets more broad
we'll talk about this t-shirt that you
probably must be a photo operations
right what do we do before pie yeah good
what general weather we showed an
example of the eye planet that's just a
synchronization event during the rest of
the time of course people are doing that
basically that the usual agile stuff so
the reason why we showed that example is
because that's one of the more visible
aspects of safe what preparations before
that yes so so what it what it requires
of us is that we need in order for those
common backlogs that are going into the
event some kind of synchronization even
before that so the proud owners and as I
said there's one for each team they do
spend some time too
gather leading up to this events talking
about priorities across teams we haven't
spent an awful lot of time on the
Wichita stop first technique which is
part of this but we've tried that among
other things to make sure that
priorities are aligned before going into
this and there's a lot of practical
stuff yeah I just yeah just a short
notice but there is a prioritization
technique in safe called weight as the
shortest job first it's not really from
safe it just happens to be popular
writes through that and I won't go into
details about you can read about it it's
one of those interesting things because
most people who look at it and including
me I was like it sells this makes
perfect sense we should use this and we
did and then I heard just as late as the
day before yesterday that some of the
teams have stopped using it and they say
we don't we don't need it where it
doesn't work for us so now a my feeling
is maybe that's a good stepping stone to
get to a point where stakeholders talk
to each other in more and more looking
at the world in on and a wider
perspective than just business value I
think it's one of the topics that I
probably would have focused more on if
you were building one product and not a
lot of different stuffs it's really hard
to really figure out so something for
legal to come worth more than let's say
a new app for a certain frame franchise
it's it's tricky to compare these kind
of things things like business value you
got things like time criticality you got
things like a risk you got things like
how big is a task right so wait as for
this job first gives you a little bit of
an algorithm it kind of shoe level
tricky to get to get your backlog in
priority order so yeah will be this
break now we'll be happy to chat to
people here you don't want to get
drowned and people outside there but
