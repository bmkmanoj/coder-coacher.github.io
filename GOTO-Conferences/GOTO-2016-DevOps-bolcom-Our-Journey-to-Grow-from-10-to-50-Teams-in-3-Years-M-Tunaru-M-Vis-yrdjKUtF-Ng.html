come for almost four years and i'm a
software engineers in one of the scrum
teams we have right about now over 45
scrum teams and i will be sharing my
story today from the scrum team
perspective also here with me as Meno
who will be talking about the
transformation of them oh let me take
that on out password let me introduce
myself since he said get a lockdown so
I'm as miele said I'm a man oh man a
fish joined boulders come about five
ninety six years ago already life goes
fast time at ball the gun goes fast and
I'm responsible for one of the one of
the IT department at our organization we
call a thing space but we'll dive into
that a bit later does its part of our
journey in which you'd like to share a
view anyhow so today we're you know
we're both here to to share our story
with you both from a management
perspective and also from a team
perspect from saga engineering
perspective and I think we're back on
track we're going to start with her give
you a bit more insight in both gone and
last week I was in place far away leaves
for me and I asked it audience who move
you know Baldoz calm and it kept quiet
you know there was one dish person in
the room and then you raise his hand so
I'm going to ask the question again I
expect a bit more hands in the air so
how many of you know but let's go cool
still suppose you don't know it okay so
think of because I made some slides yeah
back onto it thank you and so bold is
gone well it's not so difficult let me
see if
let me see if this one works let me
watch me a little click
good for web shop and not just the web
shop with the leading web shop in the
Belgium in Belgium and Netherlands and
actually bit more than a map shop I mean
we've developed ourselves into a into an
e-commerce ecommerce platform meaning
that we do not only sell your own
products which we also sell products you
know that I delivered fire partners kind
of a marketplace type of solution and
overrated this moment thirty percent of
our sales of our revenue know is is
provided this is being a lifted high our
partner network this is how the website
look like for me at least look like a
couple of days ago for you it will look
differently both because we have
personal days in place and because we
keep on keep on changing it I mean we
firm we've grown fast over the years I
look up back to that in you know during
this is the und story we've gone fast I
mean if you look at the numbers nowadays
you have over six million customers 606
dot for in the Belgium and the
Netherlands no we've been you know not
only that I mean if you look at the
number of visits we have a pretty much
close I would say close to a million
visits on a daily basis and if you look
towards the end of the year when cinta
class arrives in the Santa Claus as well
you know it's going to be way way very
very more meaning that we have you know
we have about 100,000 products shipped
in sales and shipped and shipped each
day and next to that mean we are with
one hundred one thousand one hundred
persons already based the Utrecht we
started out knee behind and moved to
another location you tricked and
nowadays you have 1,000 on her person
working at ball that comb you know the
day by day basis and out of those we
have about 300 325 IT folks meaning that
we're not just a web company we're not
an e-commerce organization we also
consider ourselves a IT or a technology
company because we do need technology to
be able to you know to be successful on
the shorten on the long run you imagine
it we we do have partners selling for
our webshop more than 11,000 at this
moment and growing fast and we have a
couple of pickup points I mean very part
of the ales organization so when you you
can order online about that government
we ship it to
well among a long different channels
will also fight it out with Heinz got
two more slides a bullet go especially
for those who don't know it yet so we
started out in 99 long time ago long
time before i joined really really small
just selling books you know one of the
would say one of the first ecommerce
organizations in europe and we've been
expanding ever been expanding since so
we are pretty much selling everything
right now and if we're not selling it it
might well be that we we will sell it in
the in the in the near future that's our
model you know expand whatever we can
you make make available whatever people
want to buy via our platform growth when
you should look at the numbers which are
just shown I mean those are not those
are numbers from nowadays completely
different from a year ago completely
different from 5-6 years ago now I
preparing this to this speech I told
Mikayla that when i joined the company i
got the opportunity to shake hands with
everyone at the company everyone you
know i got in first day you know made a
walk you know we were in the building in
New hang in XD you know I was introduced
everyone was on board she would do it
right now it will take forever probably
yeah just so we're not doing it anymore
just to be clear we're not doing it
anymore we doing on those things now but
if you look at growth I mean gross that
is challenges yeah I mean growth means
growing pains I also checked our website
you know what you can find with to know
which books how many books they are
available with the title golden beige
paint and it's 95 so you know it's
something that other companies are
experiencing as well and we fir you know
we free free fed our pains we've had a
challenges
that's actually what we like to share to
you today our journey yeah and we've
called our journey we've got our
initiative to you know to change things
around we've called the man on the moon
and the picture you see us you know on
earth you know a very nice building not
a large is one of all obviously you mean
leave me even they did we've made a
drawing so we that's what we do and no
we're kind of not really stuck on ours
but it's getting a bit crowded on earth
you know intense competition but also
many more people on board many more
teams and we needed to change you need
to change and how we do things you know
and I when I enjoyed both come but
actually when I came with swarms of a
software development which was my first
full we had about ten teams ten scrum
teams we've been we've been an agile
company ever since about two years ago
when we started this initiative we had
about i think twenty around 20 and now
we have 45 the meaning if you're growing
you know you have to do things
differently so what's what's happening
we have more people on board I've
counted those so keep on clicking f
practices they said i will say is alien
times with a couple of times it's not so
easy to keep on clicking and keep on
talking but i'm trying a miele for me
when the last pop as a person has
arrived we have many more teams on board
you have many more teams meaning more
dependencies and more complexity we need
to align continuously we're in danger of
losing our productivity we're in danger
of moving forward and this is this is
something which really struck us about
two two and half years ago so back in
2014 you know what how we're going to do
that you know what does it mean if we
you know back then estate remember 20 25
teams what does mean if you could double
the organization again now we had to we
had to change the way how we organized
we had to change the way how we work we
had to change the way how we how it can
be successful as an IT company psyllid
era quite a bit for the Dutch process in
the room those are the bellies Billy is
our mascot so everyone everyone knows
them you can think of me I mean a
multiple ways to solve the challenge of
becoming bigger you know one of the
things we could do as
if you become bigger and you have more
dependencies oh you have more teams
delight you have more teams one things
you can do it they're putting more
coordination power or getting more
project managers more managers I don't
like that managers and more no flow
control process process managers
whatever you can think of all the things
and we've seen a lot of companies but
first of all I don't like get too much
secondly you know you're only you're not
really solving the hood course you know
you're trying to manage around and so I
think we should do you know not only me
but we thought I should do things
differently if you do things differently
in our scaling up that works I mean like
to be inspired in one of the reasons
that were here for you know it mean that
Mia and I here is ready for another Lee
yeah also the rest of the colleagues is
to learn from other companies now we've
been here a couple of times ago too
we've been at other conferences we like
to hear what other companies are doing
what our channel if and yeah if you like
to learn it we like to hear yeah it's
also good to give something back so but
you like to be inspired and we not only
we're not only inspired by other
companies or events like this we take it
to the next level maybe so we're
inspired by by this guy JFK who I need
to get my notes because it's a bit of a
long story too to share but we know he
had a famous speech back in that back in
2012 on his trip to the moon not his
trip to the moon but what is flaming to
do because it made a thing big as well
you know it's September 1296 e to rice
stadium load by heart I don't do the
rest my heart that we choose to go to
the moon we choose to go to the moon in
this decade and do other things not
because they are easy but because they
are hard because that goal will serve to
organize and measure the best of our
energies and skills because that
challenge in one is one that we're
willing to accept one we are unwilling
to postpone and one which we intend to
win which is also what we thought thank
you
so we think big you're in order to to
take us to the next level we have to
take a drastic route looks like liquor
you have to really to do things
differently so we embarked on a long
journey to the moon episode hey instead
of putting so much focus on coordinating
or managing we really should look at the
autonomy because autonomy will help us
to include the organization further
without too many growing pains it
doesn't mean that all dependencies will
be gone and there was still with
dependencies you still there still there
is still a need to be aligned which we
wanted to organize and situated to be
that it would be very very less than in
the past and when the but you know
beeping work or if scrum we've been
developing software for not forever but
for many years now and we were really
successful but I had to change so
autonomy for us means that a team no
look look below team shouldn't work in
the same code base anymore meaning that
we had to move to a service oriented
architecture smaller applications teams
owning an application makes it very
easier to own that piece of software it
makes it very easier to develop new
features because you know you're there
with your team you can just do it but
also the other way around you know if
you look at how we migrated or moved you
know our service for more I software
actually from from development to
production you know we had the scrum
team would develop it then you know we
will test it then we'll be building a
major release major leaves will be
accepted tested etc etc so you had so
many persons involved to move to the
next actually to move you to our
customer to bring something life for our
customers and partners we thought we
could do better there and again this is
a couple of years ago we were not so bad
we released our major release every four
weeks
so what we try to do and share this with
you because I will get back to that at
the end what we try to do is to you know
what we wanted to achieve that we both
wanted to not really safe costs but we
wanted to be cost-efficient yeah yeah we
had to be scalable also from a cost
point of view that's one of my roles as
a manager yeah think about the money
part but next to that we also knew that
we had to go to organization because we
are growing as a company we saw so many
opportunities and to be ordered to to be
successfully needed to have the right
people on board we still had to deliver
benefits or features for customers and
partners so it was an option just to
stop to stop for a while then continue
we had to continue working productivity
had to come up I had to go up at least
stay the same yeah and we had yeah we
needed to have some fun at least I think
that's not so bad to do and that's also
writes the big as well because it's
priceless and I said at the same time
you're not on around women we are
commercial organization there's fierce
competition going on yeah we have you
know even right now but also back then
we have other companies entering the
market or they already there so we had
to go with something that we were
changing but at the same time we're
delivering features for customers and
partners again we couldn't stop for
three months rebuild everything and then
continue I mean unacceptable
unacceptable
so what do we do let's make sure that we
like to be inspired so we just looked at
the Stars it's nice to do from time to
time it's not foggy so sun is shining
have you looked at this you know the
thing you seen it spotify if you're an
IT you know you're hired you could have
missed it i think you're highly could
have missed it and what we did actually
we just looked into it you know we
shared it we talked about it with you
didn't copy it now we use it as a source
of inspiration to become you know to to
really learn from it like we learn from
other things I also think about it I
we'll know in a second because we know
the first thing on the first things we
did was we organize ourselves you know
in order to be successful in growing
organization we want to move away from a
architecture department a sulfur
development department my team at a time
and operations department and we wanted
to change to something different so we
came up with spaces spaces and fleets
it's a bit cooler we thought bit more
modern and tribes in squads now we think
of ourselves as a pretty modern company
so come up with spaces me and the idea
of the spaces is that within one area so
I'm a small so for the top one from the
video platform space we as it group as a
group of teams of a group of persons are
responsible for both design developments
are building the software testing it
releasing the to production and running
it in production so we really move to a
devil's model in order to make it happen
it's not enough to say that you're going
to do it it's not enough to put some
tools in place i think you mean we
thought was also wise and a good idea to
change the organization and to make it
yeah to make it look like that to move
to a deaf up set up so with innovative
platform space with all capabilities
available to run or to build and run
software ourselves me L will explain
what a space reliability team is in a
second we still have a platform space
team for the you know for managing the
technical infrastructure
and then we got started I never get
moving and now it becomes from because
now Micaela could share with you know
from my own perspective how it actually
is being in a team going on the journey
yeah now it's time for my side of the
story how it really looks from a scrum
team from a software engineering
perspective well we had as many said we
had to do something when I joined the
company we had four weeks releases the
developers the software engineers would
be responsible for writing the code for
testing yet so does the development
environment testing environment from
that moment onwards the release manager
would take over so from the former
operations team you can imagine you can
do that if you have I don't know Dan
scrum teams 20 scrum teams but if you
have 45 scrum teams that becomes a
little bit unmanageable to have such a
huge release where there are a lot of
things that can go wrong so we decided
to get going obviously we started with
phase zero where software engineers
that's where we start and we asked
ourselves the question in the scrum team
what if we are able to actually take
production responsibilities and do
everything on our own so when it comes
to the environment such as mentions
development testing acceptance pre
acceptance and production that would be
in the hands of a scrum team obviously
you would still need the operations guys
because they have skills that are not
yet in the scrum team so we split up
application level that would be in the
scrum team operating system level that
would still stay with you with the
operation guys so all the infrastructure
there so their responsibilities but we
wanted to have our hands on production
so we asked ourselves what if we could
actually just make it happen so we were
over there iterative development so four
weeks print we wanted to go right in the
middle continuous delivery well I can
tell you right now we're not there yet
but we're very close to it
and yes this is how it looked like back
then we had a lot of scrum teams these
are the services and applications that
we that we owned and we tried to move
those services and applications that
were developed by those scrum teams all
the way to the moon all the way to the
center that everyone could just release
on their own and how do we how did we
feel about it because you can imagine
you're not on your own we're an IT
organization of course but we're a web
shop so we like to satify customers
software engineers ourselves we were
damning Suzy assing it was about I don't
know getting production rights rights
you get a shorter in line to the
customer who doesn't want that everyone
wants that system engineers is a no is
there any system engineering house
because this is how system engineers
look to me they're always straight face
it's like nothing disturbs them I don't
know maybe it's the night shift no idea
but this is how they look to us so
they're all okay probably in the
beginning they even saw that were joking
when we told them that we're going to
get our hands on production and business
stakeholders they were very intrigued
they thought really is it possible to
deploy more frequent than four weeks
because that's what they knew we were
working scrum from 2009 and that's
pretty much that was the rule in house
every four weeks you know exactly you
went live with functionality and this is
this was just trying to break the rules
so they were intrigued they were looking
for more and we got started and you can
imagine moving so many scrum teams you
can't just make it happen overnight it
was possible when we adopted scrum in
2009 we just said well from Monday we
work scrum a job so we had the external
consultants coming in house helping us
out so we just shifted but that was a
different kind of organization it's not
a huge organization that we have in
today so we said we're going to do this
differently and we're going to go hm
we're gonna pilot on it
have to front running teams just getting
all the front wind and diving into
asteroids and stuff and see how it goes
learn from it and make it better for the
rest of the scum teams to just come
along and join the adventure so phase
one what did phase 1 mean to us because
we said well we're definitely building
it but if we want to go for the other
phases running it and loving it then
this meant that we started deploying on
our own so we got the production rights
but we had our ops engineers still happy
helping us out so the space reliability
team that we mentioned that meadow
mentioned in the beginning they were the
backup so they were there to help us out
and for this particular phase because
you can imagine they have been doing
this all their life they're not going to
let go to the production those
production rights just just like that
they were approving all our changes for
high business impact changes even if you
think about it we had change advisory
board meetings so they will just gather
together in the room they will decide
whether it's safe enough to go to
production and that's how it how it went
this is the business that I mentioned
over there all excited that we were
moving faster than four weeks to
production they were all watching ready
for the magic to happen this is for
example in my in my scrum team the scrum
team was responsible one of the services
was the product content service you guys
all know the website by now what that
means we're responsible for all the
content information for the products on
the website that means title
descriptions all sorts of attributes
like color etc and
this is a production environment right
to deploy all our services so we were
there and this is the number of
executions for example the run deck you
can see over here for production
environment it's it's it was no longer
one every four weeks and what this meant
on how did how did we feel about it at
this stage well the system engineers
weren't really happy now were they
because instead of just doing their own
thing they would have to just put stamps
on every deployment that everyone was
doing right now so this was no way to to
just stop here we had to move forward
and we did earn their trust because we
were still very enthusiastic we prove
that we can handle the responsibility
business stakeholders yeah was there to
say there imagine for example when the
fingerprints think came game live we
adjusted our mobile app to actually have
the users use that functionality we
didn't have to wait for four weeks for
that implementation because the mobile
team was the other pilot team going
along with it so they can just made a
bitch Esther could make it happen so
that was phase one phase two yeah phase
two was full control this is how phase
two looks like no approval anymore this
is me and my team doing our very first
deployment it's a coincidence with a
sunny day outside that doesn't happen a
lot in the Netherlands to help the two
think we're running in parallel and we
were so enthusiastic getting the rights
that we actually done a deployment on
Friday and we normally don't do
deployments on Friday because our system
engineer's don't like the excitement for
the weekend coming up so we said whoops
and we moved forward production comes
not with a lot of joy only but also with
a lot of responsibility so we got a
physical monitor with looking glass
alerting in place we got a team phone
that we would keep with us so we got the
responsibility for the production
environment during the working hours so
the opposite engineers were no longer
responsible it was really anything that
would happen on production with land
directly on our plate the team played
and yeah this also happened a lot
because the green stuff what I'm showing
over here yeah this is the the heavy
flow but you can also get this and now
this looks exciting doesn't it all red
and everything and this is I think
that's the moment when we realized that
system engineers the cool face it's
probably day I don't know how to get
used to this popping up because we for
sure freaked out for the first when
first time it all turned red so that's
also over there very happy when it was
all green nice and quiet and freaking
out when it would just turn red because
we learned the hard way what has to be
done system engineers they are back to
their original state no approvals
anymore so they will call with it and
business stakeholders well that's an
interesting story because you can
imagine if the scrum team is responsible
that that means that everything that
happens on production lands on your
plates that means that you drop
everything you're doing you fix the bug
so there's no one else taking care of it
you have to pick it up and well it's a
mindset shift if you ask me because that
time was spent somewhere else it was
spent in the IT operations organization
back in the day because they had the
service delivery manager and they would
look up to see exactly which scrum team
would be responsible and then you would
get it with the tickets and they will
talk to the product owner so in the end
we do think that this works better
because you get it on the spot it's your
problem you fix it on the spot so it's
it's less imposing for the customer so
that's the business stakeholders it's
get them a little bit of getting used to
where they're in a different state right
now get to that but this wasn't easy
getting this
and getting at this stage because and
before you jump to any conclusions this
is just a the knobs engineering minds in
a developer body that's because that's
how it felt to us and that's because it
really was a steep learning learning
curve for us you had to learn all the
tooling monitoring you had to learn how
to balance everything how to do your
daily work because the company still
went on words we still had to innovate
for our customer this was just something
that we were doing on the side and we
had to be fast in reacting to the alerts
that we were getting we got access to
the rock we had personalized dashboard
for example for the product content
service that we mentioned you could
build your own stuff with whatever needs
you had for example for the product
content service we had all sorts of
metrics on the calls that were important
for our webshop response times resource
management everything was in there what
was critical attached to it also logging
in cabana it's also quite important all
sorts of logging access logs error logs
you name it so it's all there
personalized per team also and yeah
we're still learning we're not there yet
but hey we're on the moon because we are
responsible as we speak for everything
that we develop and we also celebrate
the accomplishments my team was actually
the first team to actually push the
production button I even made jokes back
then that I really wanted you you know
you can buy online those big red buttons
that you can push like with I don't know
20 people they freaked out they said no
no no no we're not doing that if the CIO
see is you then they're going to freak
out we let's not make a joke out of it
and this is us enjoying and this is the
team with celebrating the certificate
menno is also in the picture over there
we had everyone involved product owner
is also in the picture
and well we were the first ones but we
had another 40-something teams that had
to move along with us so we started to
share our story within the organization
we used a little bit of storytelling and
we explain to everyone how much easier
it is not to have to deploy every four
weeks and have to get the four weeks of
code into one giant release that if
something went wrong that means amount
delays of a few days fixing regression
testing all over again it was a
nightmare now you had your own thing but
travel fast light without safer and this
is pretty much how it looks right now if
you guys remember in the beginning we
had all our services and applications
really at the outskirts now we're
getting there and we're not there yet as
i mentioned continuous delivery almost
there we still have some those
monolithic legacy applications that's
those won't disappear overnight we're
working hard on splitting them up
getting rid of some stuff that's no
longer relevant and just I don't know
redefining our services and we're trying
to think small also so in the direction
of micro services and it looks it looks
pretty good because we're yeah we're
there we're we're sort of loving it
right now it can always be better we're
also still improving all sorts of small
things just to make sure that it's it's
it's smooth for us we're improving our
alerting and monitoring because we would
like to have our business stakeholders
engaged and involved especially the
product owner so you can mention what
pops up on our monitors right now the
alerting it's very technical I can't
have my product owner understand
anything of I don't know garbage
collection complaining or something like
that so what we want to do for example
is go to functional monitoring so then
that particular alert if it's critical
gets translated into business value and
what sort of impact really is for the
customer
that's the way forward so where we're
going that way and because we're working
autonomously right now and you have your
own saying you're doing your own thing
you build your own dashboards that gives
us the possibility to work with a lot of
cool new technology we use everything
from elasticsearch to cucumber obviously
we automated most of our tests because
you can't do continuous delivery if you
don't have that under your belt so this
is what we're really proud of and it's
part of having fun in the in the scrum
team and this is how it looks right now
we're getting a little bit of the
straight face I think we're I don't know
two years later we got used to the phone
ringing we got used to monitor turning
red what we did learn is exactly how to
act to act fast to pick it up have
everyone involved product owner over
their communication with the customer to
let them know if something happens but
it's a it's really about fail fast and
safe basically business stakeholders
they got their joy back because in the
end they see the results at the customer
side so that's that's good and system
engineers really get to focus on what I
mentioned operating system level
infrastructure stuff and building tools
for us to use and yeah this is pretty
much my own scrum team and the journey
that my scrum team went through was all
the other scrum teams went along with us
as i showed in the in the previous
picture so we're moving towards the
center towards the moon and many will
share with you some of the results that
we managed to gather so far in the past
two years since we have been doing this
cute I actually also want to start with
the smiley side slide it's a bit
difficult to come up with smiley because
I as a manager somehow we have to look
cool or under control everything's under
control sometimes on the inside was a
bit worried she can imagine so maybe bit
like to create this carrot picture
because hey it feels like you're losing
control feels like you know you're
giving away stuff somehow I'm towards
the team you know I had to be positive
so I had to smile no it's also had to be
fun so I couldn't come up with a picture
so I'm just sharing interview now so
actually it was all in one but anyhow if
you really look at the results it's
coming yeah in hindsight not a hindsight
we need a particular but I'm really
really pleased I'm really pleased
because it was our ambition to become
not only more productive but also to be
able to go to organization and to
deliver software for our partners and
our customers way more often and this is
a snapshot is actually snapshot from
from which we achieve in which we put
together it's not so easy to see because
if she's posed to be a yellow young like
a yellow thing underneath but i think
the monitor no the air the the bonsai is
not good enough but let's see if you
look at the number of ideas and that's
it you know this line you cannot see the
number of ideas are not here but those
pretty much like this so we tripled the
organization the IT organization in
three years we've doubled it since 2014
since we started you know since you
started our journey towards the moon so
if thought organization and again
remember the challenge was can we stay
productive so in productivity I mean oh
it's not so easy to measure so if the
multiple things are one of the things we
did is look at orrick still delivering
software are still delivering future
features for our customers are you still
finalizing user stories you know it goes
up and down I'm admit you know if you
look at it it goes pretty much on the
same level bit higher even compared to
the year to the number of people who
have on board an even more scary at the
beginning how we're going to deal with
incidents no because in the past
whenever was an incident I would go to
the first livery manager hey what's
happening what's going on you know he or
she will dive into it go to the team's
maybe go so it may be go to another team
because you entered the wrong
team maybe 13 and but it felt like you
know there's some control there's a
person managing it there's someone who
whom I can go to and in a new situation
now a load pops up I don't even know
about it and it's fixed which is good
which is really good but at the
beginning is also a bit scary well if
you just look at the number of incidents
over the time over time it really has
gone down we've had two challenges so
you see a bit of a bump you know towards
the end of last year october november
2015 so we had some had so much energy
dammit overall you really see it going
down and that trend has continued this
year so we're doing more yeah with more
people we deliver a more features to
production let me have less incidents
that's pretty cool so I can put on much
smiley face again as a manager and the
number Feliz's I go back to it in a
second because I have an old slide on
that yeah fun remember the slide 50 you
know the the celebrating Billy you know
there but what we wanted to achieve yeah
we not only we mean we as a company but
can we believe that you know you really
should have fun to be able to be
successful which is applicable for the
teams so this is another team you know
another team which was on the phone or
the front runner team just one of the
teams you know we got that certificate
and their smiley and not because I asked
them to smile for the picture oh there
they would really happy that they could
you know that they did have and they do
have the production whites themselves
another Lee they are happy management is
happy even towards the board mean that
that's Michele he was respond so for for
marketing so with each board member and
we actually asked him to not really push
the red button that push do you think
the enter button or something push the
button to move a like a front-end
release to production and it's a bit
scary I had not Fame we told him you
just press down and vocal fine and it is
go fine luckily but he you know he
really saw the benefit of being able to
move move new features faster to the man
to production shorts a time to market
and that's actually what we tried to do
and not only get you get everyone on
board make everybody really why we're
doing it and there's a benefit for all
so this is a graph which shows the
number of deployments are weak a while
ago i think half a year ago something
like that if you look at the white boxes
the white box is the major village we
have and we still have was very smaller
every four weeks the Super Bowl so if
you look in the past if you would have a
graph going back way way further you
would only see white boxes every four
weeks a white box and then what what you
know it started happening and we started
to deploy more you know every colored
box now the color actually indicates a
specific service and the size of the box
indicates the number of deployments so
what you see happening in time is that
we have a very more deployments per week
of a more services you know not only
that also a service is deployed Milt
know multiple times so we are ya guys
yeah we are capable of releasing very
very more than we used to do in the past
you still see the white box the other
white box is still there it's very small
an hour which is still there because of
the legacy we are not so old 70 years
old but we do have legacy legacy or
heritage if someone told me software
that has been imported for organization
is still is imported for organization
but you're getting array of it because
it's so much easier to deploy small
service yeah money I mean I like money
but that's more with this is not what it
is about as a manager I mean we I do
have to take care of spending which is
not my probably not my favorite topic to
do but the nice thing is that you know I
was really worried a couple of years ago
about you know how can you manage the
growth and do we want to hire those
coordinators and those process managers
and put more procedures in place and
deliver less and so we want a taxi to to
stay scalable and to double the
organization without doubling the IT
budget and we've managed to do so we've
managed to do so it's pretty simply
think about if you have less incidents
know you have less time to spend on
those so this time left to become more
productive but so
have actually more maybe need to good
bit less not so many people if you have
more deployments you know also look at
the other side we will all benefit from
those features you know so the customers
will benefit from it and so of all that
 if you look at making small changes
with less risk yes also we need to
discuss it to a very shorter the less
dependencies no no need to coordinate no
need to talk to each other no need to
spend hours in a meeting room drawing
all the dependencies and trying to
figure out how how we can go live so the
money part is you know it was a big
thing don't think the teams are aware of
that whether the men's would level we
certainly had discussions on it no
besides their own risk and taking a
leave in control etc but we yeah we've
met is pretty good so well well yeah I
don't consider myself a cat but you know
I needed something while sitting on the
porch looking at the moon because that
was my dream a couple years ago and I
still sells sit on the not on the boys
on the terrace looking at the moon you
know what what how come it it used to
work for it how come and I think what's
really what you try to explain today as
well as that is it was not only really
pushed by the managers now we you know
we should be try to start it which very
soon we got those you know enthusiastic
teams on board and those teams we
started thinking about how cool would it
be if we could do this how nice would it
be if we could deliver software faster
so really the engineer Sammy Ayla I mean
she's telling me what to do naughty
other way around and sees telling me
what's important for a team he's trying
to make it happen it's also easier
that's true I'm not kidding it em but we
try to endorse it then we try to you
know I try for instance to convince or
to talk to a stakeholders to the
marketing director you have it because
it is also forums a bit afraid what do
you mean contains slavery what do you
mean devops what do you mean with moving
something to production you know if
you'll take time doesn't it so endorse
my management and also to embrace the
business as shown in the pictures the
business is really on board with this
it's really on board
so what we like to share with you are
not only share this may be more question
or I like a you know a call fraction
what are you waiting for start moving so
we started moving two years ago start
small think big or the other way on
think big start small so moving good a
framework in place so it's not like
everything is allowed you know there are
limits also former compliancy point of
view if you look at privileges for
instance but start moving stop moving at
and the look sorry the pool will
come the pool will come and again it's
not that really fits in the company we
should have some fun with it you know
we've had a great moments and not only
eating pizza would also move the
production in the Sun it's it's really
nice if you see if you see that things
can actually change of any company so
where are we now because I journey as it
ended the first art for sure it has not
ended because not all teams you know
have reached the moon yet they're still
underway I think that hardly anyone left
on earth the only things which we left
on earth are the things that you wanted
to leave on earth no systems that will
be decommissioned soon now that we are
replacing my newest services but I
journey probably on the dance now we've
moved to the moon now now which we
believe was a great idea for now and we
still think it's a great idea and we
will continue but who knows what's going
to happen yeah it's difficult to predict
the future so I think we will move on
now somehow we will move on to Mars if
you think about it I'm just going to be
even cooler yeah moving to the moon and
then trying to move from the moon to
Mars that's going to be the next big
thing even further away no even I did
nicer you know it more dangerous strange
but i'm pretty sure that in a couple of
years now you know we will have moved to
march with something and we will have
you know we will be able to get back
here and share our story on that one no
no then we might have teams left on the
moon not left on earth but left on the
moon think about it life can't go fast
so 23 years that's it
but anyhow we reached I to share our
story from two perspectives we've tried
to give you so many sight of what's
happening in ball of gum and how we try
to work and how we tried only things
ahead and we'd like to thank you for
that forgiveness at opportunity also on
behalf of Michaela and think we have
some time for questions so if you have
any questions just shoot I think we have
to do something with the mic by the way
oh what about it
I believe you still have dependencies
between teams could you tell something
about how do you manage those
dependencies yeah I don't hear it really
close let's take it off a bit better a
bit better it's cool standing on top of
firm up any of em so your question is
how do you manage dependencies a
multiple ways so first of all we've
tried to organize yourselves in such a
way that teams are you know that are
working closely together I i I've
somehow that is somehow related you know
they they're building something we call
a fleet so fleet consists of multiple
teams with one manager with on how I
should act around which are linked to
one business stakeholder so it's one way
to manage because if there are
dependencies in New for instance choices
have three minute on priorities we can
always go to one business person for
instance to do that so that's one way
and the other way is if you have you
know if you're if you are embarking on a
big initiative if you have multiple
teams trying to come up with their
contribution towards in order to
whatever you have to achieve I mean we
either have product owners helping out
there scrum masters helping out there
and for very large initiatives you do
have a project manager we only have a
few of those of any organization so out
of those 325 persons we have three or
four I think so that's about the end
that's the number with you if you do
need it yeah you need to arrange the
Tama but it becomes less and less if
your systems are small and also way
easier good any more questions over
there sorry sorry is it here we asked
whether you have to ask again
oh dear pass the it's too close now how
do you pass the knowledge between the
first things that migrated to towards
continuous development and the others
who were later in the process well we
when we started and we had the two pilot
team so my team and the mobile team we
gathered our experiences we had team
meetings what we do with the entire
organization those are once a month and
we did storytelling like what we just
showed but also between each other we
had workshops organized so also
workshops organized by us so to share
our experience from a scrum team
perspective but also workshop organized
by the system engineers because you
would get training on all sorts of
tooling like em dash angra fauna &amp;amp;
Gabbana and you name it everything that
was in there you would get yoga training
performance testing also everything how
awful more than tunings well whatever
whenever you will be ready to to get
started to move to a new face you only
had to talk to your space reliability
team because you have a handful of
people in there added you would have I
don't know maybe around twelve to
fifteen scrum teams attached to a space
reliability team and in there you have
two to three minute where engineers you
would have around two DBA or some
infrastructure guys and that's really
the team and you can just yeah send a
hip chat message or know if you guys you
skip just that that's that's that's it
it's a small organization still at heart
we still work a lot at home does that
answer your question let me take this
one last question
you drew the development team scrum
teams and the system engineers has
separate groups are they still separate
groups or is there some sort of
integration it systems engineers are
partners continues well as I said we
don't have a lot of system engineers in
house this was also one of the reasons
why we said it's not going to scale up
in the future so it's not necessarily in
the scrum team but we get the knowledge
from them in the scrum team and what we
do nowadays so this is like a new
initiative with a young professional
program so we have graduates joining
ball can come we actually have them work
on assignments with the space
reliability team and then they get to
come in the team with even more
knowledge than you would normally get
you know just by working as a software
engineer so that's also our way so it's
also a bit of a practical reason so
ideally what you would like to have all
skills within scrum team with a
five-person a team you're having anti
DBA knowledge and all middle-end
knowledge and it's it so we this is for
us the best the best method to try to
bring as much knowledge across both ways
programs yeah we're getting it one more
or not one more oh sorry come to our
list we have stat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
