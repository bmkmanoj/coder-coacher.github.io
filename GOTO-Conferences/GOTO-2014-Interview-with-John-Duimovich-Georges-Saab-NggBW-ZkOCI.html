go to Chicago and I'm pleased to be
sitting with John do image from the CT
OPM's at IBM and George you're not CTO
so here they hello I'm vice president's
entourage president software development
the java java platform where's Ike is in
those long titles so these are two of
the folks that are responsible for
bringing you the latest and greatest in
the Java platform and we have had some
great talks here and javon we're looking
forward to just getting their thoughts
and where javis going next or perhaps
where it should be going next it isn't
so I didn't want to kick it off John you
were talking about Gavin X sure yeah so
Java PM has been around for a long time
so there's a lot of mature technology in
there so you look at it and you see lots
of great stuff and you can probably look
at that and say that we're done but the
reality is hardware advancements that
you use things like evolving the
platform for compatibility reasons
things like a better security all of
those things are pushing to move to Java
ecosystem forward or the requirements
that are pushing the need for
this reporter so today we talked a
little bit about the need for better
external memory access via some people
packed objects something that we see
necessary to drive the next level
exploitation of emerging Hartford like
GPS so that's the kind of stuff we're
looking at talk about over today's yeah
I you know Dave I think there are a
bunch of really exciting things coming
we're in a you know kind of a period of
a new Leno songs for java and you know
this is really sort of a time where you
go on past the sort of low that existed
I think people are very excited about
Java again and and in fact that we're
kind of evolving you know both
continuing to evolve DM technology which
team continue to happen in that period
but also that the language itself is is
men import again it's very exciting so I
think some of the things you know we're
we're pretty certain nerve and coming
next version I'd say modulation is
clearly one of the most important things
there and I think that that can also
bring with it a lot a lot more goodness
so be interesting to see what those
things are and then I think further
afield you know as John mentioned for
the function interface improvements
value types of something that's been
discussed and Joan Rivers has blogged
about and I think one of the neat things
is that with the updates to the new jet
process in openjdk it
be even more possible for people to see
like ideas that people have a discussion
about them in the OpenJDK community so
so that's really cool I think people
have been pleasantly surprised you know
the prediction that you know going to
Oracle and IBM citing when Oracle would
actually you know continue the slow Java
down and I think it's been actually the
opposite of that my impression maybe you
don't want to say to me you had a big
punch-up outside but it seems like
there's been a really good cooperation
between the different different teams to
try to bring things together and you
really bring out the releases pretty
much concurrently now we're still
working on our new one but yeah the
thing is we do compete pretty
aggressively and we do battle
head-to-head on a lot of issues and so
there's lots of things that don't get a
grievance that's certainly clear but the
thing we did agree is that we do the
ecosystem together and bring data
forward together because it's really
good for both customers or really the
reason we do this we just need to
address our customers needs and drive
innovation that they are asking for and
what we wait they're going to make the
job ecosystem better to work together so
we've been able to do that let's work on
some other agreements later for now
that's a pretty good thing and and the
things that have been happening in the
ecosystem the lambda support which is
cool for developers but extension method
team Atlantis or interface excuse me
that makes them more consumable and
allows you to vault compatibilities
first sort of a watershed functionality
in Java doesn't just performance and
functionality that developer would hack
against it's a way to move the ecosystem
for a particular credibility it's a
great story to be more that he's our
customers in the best
billions of dollars in software and that
stuff has to move forward with the
platform exploit more than features so
it's pretty pretty good time to be more
working go west yeah yeah I I think it's
been great I mean you know collaborating
in openjdk is tremendous and you know in
addition to drive am of course you've
been a number of other temperatures also
join there and what I think is kind of
great is that we've gone past you know
the sort of initial group of folks who
are you know kind of usual suspects as
VM implementers and we now have you know
folks joining up in jdk who are more
like expert John users and I think
that's something that's very very
valuable because what you what you
really get is you know the ability to
directly affect what's going on by
people who are using this day in and day
out and really kind of push the envelope
it's a lot of excitement at least the
developer communities and said new
languages are always a excitement so
tomorrow morning we'll have a Martin
Luther ski talking about Scala and last
year here in Chicago a rich Hickey
what's what's your your sort of viewing
supporting those sorts of languages I
mean closures and so on are in principle
go along that way but you know in
practice things like tail recursion and
kind of lunch of other things really
really put a lot more put a lot more
pressure on it on the JVM to change in a
more radical way yeah I you know as a
couple things on this I think you know
one thing is of course you know we're
we're always very glad to see languages
that like to target the JVM is that
time of choice and we've been doing a
lot of work on this you know for the
past at least five or six years so you
regularly get together with people who
implement languages all your today on
the JVM summit it's a gem language
summit and you know one of the reasons
is we want to hear directly from those
folks what they need is I think you're
right things like television and other
kinds of things are you know may-maybe
the things that come out of that I think
the other you know the other interesting
thing for us of course is the things
that we can learn about about language
evolution and things that work well and
not work so well in other languages
maybe things that didn't want to bring
to java or pitfalls we kind of what you
think that there be one positioning
could be that you know Java's got all
the Chavez just with a few one or two
more things is enough and maybe you
don't need to go to scala's that kind of
a little message there right you know I
think think people have to choose kind
of what's right for them um you know I I
wouldn't say the Java is sort of you
know everything that everyone needs for
every possible using and Paulina memory
you know just like Nolan no one
languages yeah I have those features
that you have eight past it will road
this gala does but because the question
is in our from our perspectives there's
a lot of languages but and we've done a
lot of investment in runtime technology
some of it your Java some of it
clickable elsewhere and what we found is
that lots of languages that look like
job or map to javits you really
others not so well so there's been a lot
of effort in trying to extend the Java
platform evoke dynamically like those
but so far it you know that just hasn't
tipped the balance and unlock that I
would say is world class TM technology
for other languages it's not there and
so I think there's great opportunity to
find a path to let that he access by
other BM and runtime developers java
bytecode sets great for java java like
maybe could evolve for more but i think
there's a lot there's other paths that
will work and so that's one of the
things i want to see happen and with the
technology on it's just on the way to
line up going hope the source it's a
great way to investigate this so just
switching topics not that anyone really
I'm sure it's not your favorite topic
but we were just talking with Aaron
bedre well known for his work in
security been a lot of a lot of heat in
the market industry of late with the
security concerns and so on I know both
of you in certainly George field is a
number of things back a while ago with
that quickly the app on the Apple
platform what sort of things are are in
the works are trying to improve the
security model for java well I I think
certainly long-term there are some
things that we want to look at investing
in and but but I'd say that you know
even in the shorter term both in do
things
to address issues that have have been
reported to find issues that haven't
been reported and fix those as well but
also some things in order to to just
tighten up this pretty model overall so
you know these are the kinds of things
like requiring signing on like putting
in place you know a way of being able to
lock down your web deployed application
so that if you for some reason have to
stay with an older version of Java you
can say that only that particular
application trusting of can Ronald so so
I think those are all good steps in the
right direction and I think there's and
so when you take security seriously so
we've done iBM has done a lot of things
like we've released all of our major
updates concurrently we went to know
staggered release product releases that
contain all the security fixes across
everything we have the production four
times a year or matching the subpoenas
and that means a customer from large can
just get the latest on any version you
know you surprised how many older
versions of Java are still in production
they work they're fine they don't get
changed they still get updated dirty
lies so that's something our customers
like now the question is what can you do
better what can the VMS do work in the
low level stuff do you know things like
read-only objects to prevent corruption
or an internal corruption of data you
shouldn't be messing that's important
that's being talked about for the
roadmap to that body types can help as
well and on for to the pointers so
there's technology solutions they'll
just be tools i'll make the platform
stronger there can still me you know you
can still have secure a component c can
then meet not used properly and security
issue the curve so the best you can do
is attempt to prevent those in the
engineering secure engineering rules
which we actually shared p.m. IBM Oracle
do together and we have our own process
to do that plus you know frequent
security refreshers when needed so you
just don't aren't you know cuz things
happen you gonna fix it yourself
up lots of teams may be our last one you
don't have too much time about to start
up time and share ability for java
what's the future look like for that
look at the sort of time it's faster
every day you know the both of those are
certainly areas that you know we're
interested in and and are looking up
yeah we've been doing that for a long
time so it started stuff we have shared
classes pre-formatted ready to run in
shared memory Jeff class files converted
into wrong for that so what that means
is you memory map their share class cash
they're already ready to run we put get
code in the cash so what that means is
the previous guide and ran compiled
object you don't have to compile out
and more start if you get twenty thirty
percent so we've done some of that stuff
multi-tenancy is another way to do that
there's a hot be and running give
isolation so there's lots of really nice
things for start-up in our in our world
that but it's not done so you if you
want running down apps where you're
going to run start versity requests that
down there's still more work to be done
for start-up performance and so the
kinds of things that we see profiles and
javi are subsets which is certainly a
nice way to use less so if you can
actually take your application and map
it to some smaller set of libraries it's
going to come up more it also has
smaller surface area for security issues
right to do I'm going to tag all the
stuff there it's not all there it's also
great for cloud deployed to strip out a
bunch of stuff we're using smaller on
time and deploy so there's more things
coming and I think it's a huge
opportunity especially for cloud where
you might want to spin up more instances
and you're spending instead of 40 50
seconds you want to spend less than a
second to bring something up and be
ready and that's there's still some work
to go there but our multi-tenant ems our
sub 50 milliseconds of stars of 2254
free running everything ready to go even
regular be answering
in the milliseconds to start if you
don't run everything widgets graphics or
any of the stuff she's not me some
service is getting better but I'd love
do these things like for another crazy
stuff we'll have to see about see where
we get to go mouth yeah i think you know
even even looking forward to
motorization in mine i think there may
be things that be done there great well
thanks very much and be great for our
audience to get a update from the
Oracle's Java but I'm yep i was using
oracle in the other which I the other
one congratulations big step that boy
you look at me and do what I say looking
fun we can see the cooperation is
continuing thanks very much the George
and John for sharing their thoughts in
the future of Java and I think for java
users have things will continue to look
good so the platform is going to
continue to improve and hopefully will
be all just clicking and having instead
start up sometimes in the future thanks
a lot thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
