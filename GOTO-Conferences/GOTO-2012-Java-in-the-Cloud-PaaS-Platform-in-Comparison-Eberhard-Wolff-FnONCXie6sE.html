in the cloud passed platforms in
comparison now let me say a few words
first so my name is a bad wolf I'm I
station technology manager for adesso AG
in Berlin here the the officer said
bashed also not too far away it should
probably say leading IT consultancy in
the drumming speaking area so we do have
offices in Switzerland and in Austria as
well and we are among the 25 large
society consultancies I'm responsible
for things like the training of the ITX
at adesso I'm also responsible for the
technology strategy so that's what I do
I am a speakers you can obviously see I
am an author I wrote the first German
spring book I do have a block latest
entries about the waterfall model
everything you ever wanted to know about
the bottle for model I do have a Twitter
account you can find a lot of
presentations at SlideShare and for
old-fashioned communication there's also
an email address ok so let's start with
a general definition of a cloud there
are three different types of clouds as
in the services that they offer first of
all there is infrastructure service that
is basically just something that offers
you well virtual bare metal surfaces so
it is it provides your servers they can
be started quite quickly so it's usually
just a matter of a few minutes or even
seconds and it's quite similar to
virtualization the difference is that
there is a self-service portal so you
can go to a portal login start a server
and there is no manual process or manual
labor involved so that means instead of
going to your operations department
asking them for server and wait for I
don't know a few hours days month weeks
whatever it will give you a server basic
instantaneous however the problem if you
look at it from a developer's
perspective is that you will have to
manage everything yourself so it's just
bare metal you will have to install the
operating system application server
database whatever to make it in any form
usable if you look at some companies
that provide services that there's
obviously amazon web services they have
a future of rank around infrastructure
as a service we will see later on that
it's actually more than just
infrastructure as a service and as one
of the providers in the more private
space I've chosen VMware here they are
well they probably own the enterprise
virtualization market they do quite some
cloud stuff so if you're looking for a
cloud that you can run in your data
center it's one of the companies that
have an interesting thing to offer there
then there is platform as a service I
think about it as a sort of an
application server that you can just
deploy applications to and everything
else is done by the application server
it handled several issues that a cloud
has like scaling out so adding more
servers depending on load shutting down
servers if there's less load things of
that nature and it's mostly that means
the application is mostly managed by the
provider so instead of you having to
manage the application and the
infrastructure you rely on the service
of the platform to do that well we will
see quite a few examples one probably
well famous example might be the google
app engine which you can see the logo of
in the upper left corner it's probably
like the original platform as a service
so that's why it's a unique and the
other one that I brought is a cloud
foundry which is an open source project
we will see a lot more about that later
on it's an open source project image by
the mbar and then there is software
service as a developer it is probably
some software that you are using like so
I wrote an article over the weekend and
did it using Google Docs because it's
very easy
to do it collaboratively on that
platform so and that is software service
because it's similar to all the other
office productivity suites that you can
have however it's in the web so that is
something that you do as a developer you
probably use those it's it might also be
something that you want to integrate in
your own applications as the foundation
for your application or things like that
so examples so there is the Microsoft
Dynamics air suite which is a CRM system
customer relationship management system
that we are also using in several for
several customers that is obviously
something that you want to customize and
that you want to provide additional
services on so that's an example there
is microsoft office 365 which is the
office running in the cloud and and
there is another example that i think is
quite interesting it's actually one of
our products so the ribbons is an
application that we've created for
insurances for it will air for juristic
of things so what it does is if you go
to your to your android lawyer right
sorry about that so if you go to your
lawyer it actually takes your case and
talks to the insurance whether that will
be covered by the insurance so that's
what it does and the special thing about
it is that it's a platform and you pay
it sort of peruse so you get an account
and you pay per use so it's not a shrink
web product that you buy a license off
it is something that you pay per use so
it is in a way a software-as-a-service
but it's very focused on a very niche
market and I think it's actually one of
the things that we might be see more of
in the future these niche applications
provided as cloud services so why would
I care about cloud I think the main
benefit is flexibility so as I said
earlier it's very easy to get a new
server and to start in your server
it's an automated process so there is no
complex manual process instead it's just
automatically done I think that's the
main benefit there is another benefit
that is often spoken about which is cost
reduction however that is only valid if
you look at public cloud and it's
actually more about economies of scale
so if you look at Amazon or Google they
have these large data centers and of
course they are able to to operate those
data centers at the lower price than
your server sitting somewhere in some
room so I would argue that this is not
necessarily unique too clouded this
rather economic economy of scale there
is a special thing a concerning constant
cloud also for public cloud so you just
pay for the capacity that you're using
at that very moment so you can basically
pay it by the hour or whatever so that
might be another thing and that is
actually unique to the cloud that allows
you to reduce your costs for private
cloud so if you run your cloud
environment in your own data center I
believe there is not too much of a
cost-reduction you could argue that you
might be able to consolidate your
servers however you can also do that
with virtualization so it's not unique
for cloud so I think in particular if
you want to run your cloud in your own
data center the real advantage is around
a flexibility and not the wrong cost
reduction so that might be something
well special or something that is not
too obvious if you talk about cloud in
general why even talk about a private
cloud well if you look at some of our
customers like insurances and banks they
obviously won't go for they obviously
won't go for public lands okay so much
for the introduction so as a developer
one of the interesting questions is how
is cloud a challenge for me as a
developer
there is a challenge concerning
availability so if you look at cloud and
if you look at the terms in terms of
service that Amazon for example offers
it basically says well you know
individual service might feel even
though who data center might fail and we
don't take responsibility for that which
is very different from what you're used
to if you're doing enterprise systems
because enterprise systems usually run
on high available hardware and and
failure of a service is usually a real
nightmare here the platform doesn't
offer you any guarantees on how the
server on the availability of the
service well there are some guarantees
but they are pretty relaxed so your
system must survive the failure of
individual nodes and there are
applications like there is this somewhat
famous application called chaos monkey
that just walks around and shoots a
different service in the head and the
point is that your system must survive
the way of those servers and that leads
to quite a few challenges and
interesting architectural concepts so
one of the things that sort of emerged
from the cloud is our no sequel
databases that rely on a large set of
servers unreliable service and you scale
out to scale to larger amounts of data
which is very different from what you're
used to in relational databases where
you have single or just a few servers
and you scale up by providing more
powerful servers so that is something
there are obvious things that we are
probably used to like you should have
stayed on your web service because they
might feel you could store the state of
your web servers in a database or some
centralized storage that is highly
available but generally speaking it does
it's more advisable to not rely on state
on the web service so now this sounds a
little bit well frightening because
basically the the platform that you're
working on
it's very shaky but at the end of the
day if you look at systems like Amazon
or Google they are very very highly
available and the reason for that is
that for example you get a lot of data
centers that your software can run on
which is otherwise quite hard I mean if
you are an average company you will have
one data center probably too but if you
look at amazon they have data centers
all over the world and even in each
region of the world they have multiple
data centers that is something that you
couldn't afford otherwise and that gives
you high availability if you do your
architecture right because if you do
your architecture right you can run your
system on the in different data centers
and that way if one data center feeds
your system will survive so you end up
with a higher availability and I think
sort of the the proof that this is true
are the system's by amazon for example
that are highly available Aunt Em
scaling so if you look at scaling as I
said there is pay-as-you-go on the
public cloud so you just pay for the
capacity that you're using so you
shouldn't size your system for the
maximum load because that doesn't make
any sense because then you would pay a
lot of money even though the load would
be less than what you will pay for so
you need to be able to start and stop
service depending on the load that
you're seeing and that again means that
you have a lot of challenges so you need
to provide your system as VM image for
example so that you can run more and new
instances or some kind of automated
installation what have you and we will
talk we will see that the talk later on
about a continuous deployment that I
think might be a good solution for that
okay so platform as a service as I said
this is basically around the sort of
virtual application server that you just
deploy your system on
so a lot of the challenges that we've
seen actually hidden from you by this
platform as a service so what are some
benefits and some problems or challenges
that those platforms as a service might
have if you look at the advantages first
as compared to application service that
we are probably all used to they include
a lot more so it's a complete platform
usually there is a database that you can
also provision there is some messaging
system and so on and so on so I think
it's actually a complete platform I
think that's one of the things then
there are these issues that we've spoken
about so there is scaling you want to
scale up your system depending on load
if there is less load you want to scale
it down provisioning starting new VM
starting your instances getting most of
us that is something that is done by
your platform as a service and for
tolerance so restarting service and
dealing with failures on the hardware
level so that is another advantage you
can easily run quite a few environments
this is something in traditional
software development that is hard you
need to do it you need to have a test
environment unity of SH environment you
need to have a production environment
and you need to somehow make the code
aware of these different environments so
you need to have a configuration that's
as well use this database or that
database depending on whether you're on
staging or in production some of the
platforms as a service allow you to do
like to do quite debt just without any
changes to the code or the configuration
because the platform offers all the
things that you need like the data based
messaging system and so on so it is easy
to start a new environment and provision
a new environment which is very which is
great compared to the nightmares that
you otherwise have to just get a
testament up and running yeah and it is
easy to get something up and running so
if you want to run your application on
the internet on a proven infrastructure
scale-out to quite a few users you can
do it on the cloud on a cloud platform
which otherwise would again be hard
because you would need to have is some
system in place you will need to deal
with scaling and so on and so on and the
past platform will L certainly deal with
some of those issues so might be a good
foundation for coming into continuous
delivery and we'll see whether there is
more about that in the next talk so just
starting new environments getting new
servers that is very easy and if you
want to continuously deliver new
releases it is something that you
probably need to post those releases
okay problems or challenges there is a
predefined package so basically if you
look at the cloud offering its as well
we do have some environment a tomcat
some surf that environment some
additional services like a database and
so on so if there is a service missing
you do have a problem and the same with
fine tuning the environment so if you
want to change the heap size of your
environment if you want to have a
specific p.m. perimeter things of that
nature it might be a problem in your
environment so that is a challenge and
we will see later on that there are
different trade-offs concerning that and
there are more dependencies and there is
a lock in so if you get the complete
package it means that this package is
usually available just from one source
and these proprietary services will lead
you to a login to be honest I believe
that even if you use standards in normal
projects so to say you still have a
login so what I'm trying to say is if
you focus on avoiding a login it will
probably not work even if you have a
standard Java EE server for example you
do have a login concerning for example
the upper
raishin side so if you are used to one
specific job is over and you switch over
to another one it will be hard because
the operations department will see a
completely different platform so the
question is whether there is a way to
avoid locking at all and I would argue
there's probably not a way however as we
will see later on there are real likely
world issues concerning logins okay so
let's take a look at some of the
platform's ourselves that are out there
first of all this amazon elastic
beanstalk and if you look at it it's
based on amazon web services which is
the public cloud of rain by amazon it's
mostly infrastructure-as-a-service so
there are virtual computers that's easy
tube there I lastic load balancers that
also allow you to start new servers on
demand and also shut down servers that
are not used anymore because there's too
little load that is actually auto
scaling so that's also part of the load
balancing there there is a simple
storage service s3 that you can use for
large services like locks or your the
artifacts that you want to deploy and
elastic block storage for virtual
hottest so if you look at it it's a
complete of ring that gives you
computers storage all these things and
also some are too skinny so that's quite
nice as I said there is more than just
infrastructure as a service on the
Amazon Cloud so there is for example in
SD cash which is a turnkey ready
memcache dbase server so it gives you
memcache d caching without a well
installation of any extra software or
anything like that there is RDS for
relational database service for Oracle m
is equal there's dynamic DB simple DB
and so on and so on and they're also
quite a few third party offerings that
run on ec2 so there is one for mongodb
there is another one for
to be those are no sequel databases and
what this basically means is that there
are predefined building blocks that you
can build your application on so if you
look at for example RDS it gives you a
turnkey ready relational database system
which otherwise you would have need to
install to tune to run on the cloud
infrastructure and so on and so on and
that is not true easy so I mean you can
easily spend quite a few days installing
a relational database in tuning it and
here you get it turnkey ready there
might be some tuning of course but still
I think this is quite an advantage of
this platform and in particular the
relational database services at least
for Java developers are quite nice
because that's usually what they are
used to so that's also something i think
makes it quite valuable so what is
amazon elastic Beanstalk so what it is
is basically they have you they've taken
ec2 to run the applications on plus EBS
for a local storage local hard disks
auto scaling to start new instances f
load increases the load el se lo pans
are to balance load between those
started instances and then a pretty
standard Java stick I would say so
tomcat web server Linux operating system
and OpenJDK as the jdk and a nice web
console to run your applications on that
is basically it um there are some
alternative sticks that have been really
ever released recently so there is a PHP
that you can run on top of it that uses
apache httpd and you use the gate
versioning system to deploy applications
to the cloud and there is also support
for the net that you could run on top of
that so that's quite nice yeah so why
would I use it and I think one of the
advantages is that it's actually pretty
standard
so if you look at it it's what you used
tomcat java servlets send a standard
system it's also quite flexible so if
you want to tweak the operating system
you can do so so what you do is you use
the Amazon machine image so the virtual
machine image that is used by elastic
beanstalk you run it on some note you do
the tweaks that you want to do and then
you tell us if instruct to use this
modified machine image later on so
basically everything that you ever that
you can do to your operating system you
can do here to Frank jr. system so that
means you can you know change the Tomcat
that is running change the Tomcat
configuration you can change the virtual
machine image and so on the foundation
is proven so Amazon Amazon Web Services
is what Amazon runs its own
infrastructure on it's what Netflix uses
and several other large companies so
that's quite stable environment and
there are other services so there is a
relational database oracle or my sequel
whatever you want to have there are the
other ones by provided by some partners
you can install new versions of your
software easily without any down time we
will see that in a moment and you can
also there is also burgeoning of the
artifacts that you're deploying and
there is s 34 locked files and all of
those things so it's basically a very
nice combination of the of service that
are already there and they are provided
to you turnkey ready so it's easy to use
them challenges well it's currently in
beta so that means that you are
basically out there on your own so to
say if you run into production it's not
available in all regions so the way
amazon works is that it has separated
the world into different regions and
currently it's only available in u.s.
East you West and asia-pacific us is
Ireland that's also the nearest reach
that we have here in Berlin so i think
it's it's quite ok for german usage
there is no full support for job ie so
it's just Tomcat we will see later on
that this is actually well very common
and well in my opinion running
applications on tomcat is perfectly fine
so that's not really real issue however
if you have a java application well that
might be an issue it scales based on
machines so if you have too much load it
will start another machine so that's
that means if you if you're just above
the range of one machine you will get a
complete new second machine that will be
started and runs your application which
is well not that cost efficient because
you need to PA each machine but well if
you just run your your system on one or
two machines it's probably not worth the
cloud anyway and you shouldn't run it on
one machine anyway because that machine
might feel so you will run it on quite a
few anyway so how does it work m1 to
give you an impression and I've walked
through the installation of a system
using the console everything you see
here can also be done using command line
utilities or there is a soap api that
you can also use so if you want to
automate things that's perfectly
possible to give you an impression what
is possible it's probably best to walk
through the slides and also I mean one
of the things that I think it's quite
nice about Amazon Web Services is the
sort of out of out of box experience so
if you have signed up for an account and
you go to the elastic Beanstalk page it
welcomes you with this nice interface
and it says well do you want to launch
our sample application or your own
application so and if you just launched
a sample application you're basically up
and running in a few minutes but we are
going to raise the bar a little bit and
upload my your own application so we
will give it a name and upload the war
file as you can see here also that's
Beanstalk
demo destroy a double that we are
deploying in the next step we will give
we will create an environment so an
environment is some collection of
servers that your application runs on it
has a ul as you can see and you can
choose different container types in my
case I'm using 32-bit Emma's una Knox
running tomcat 7 you might also use
tomcat 6 or 64-bit amazon Linux or the
PHP or Windows Error net versions of the
environment of course then you can
change your configuration details so you
can give an instance type there is so
that's the the size of the computer that
you're running on you can have a key
pair if the keeper allows you to log
into the running system and change it
later on if you want to and provide an
application health check URL which might
be used or useful if you have a specific
URL that the load balancer should go to
to see whether one instance is still up
and running and then you're good to go
and you can start the application and
what happens is that an environment will
be restarted so that's the idea so
Beanstalk environment that is currently
starting after a while you will get the
green light and the application is
available at that point so you can go to
the UL that you've configured and you
will be able to hit the application at
that URL and you're done and if you
scale up the application there is a
default configuration so it will start
new instances and you can easily scale
it up you can also change the policy the
the scaling policy so there's quite some
flexibility there and do that what you
can do as a next step yeah so what I'm
doing now is I've decided to
load a new version of my system so I've
chosen to upload a new version the
version will be called a 2.0 and at this
point in time I won't deploy it to any
environment I could choose to deploy to
the environment that it's already
running but I don't do it so now I have
two versions at the top and I can so
that means those two walls are somehow
start in s3 and I available for
environments to use so as a next step I
will start a new environment I will call
it new adesso Beanstalk and and deploy
the new version 2.0 to that environment
and well that's an old story so after
some time the new environment will be
there I can now test it see whether it's
working the way I a I expect it to work
and yeah well published the UL to some
guys and tell them to test it as well
and so on and one size I believe that
this version is fit I can swept the
environment you else and when I've done
that then yeah so I now say okay please
swap those two UL and once I've done
that the new version is available and
running without any downtime because all
i did is i change the system behind a
specific URL so that is that I think it
shows you what you can do it's very easy
to deploy applications it's it gives you
scaling it gives you updates of your
system without any downtime and so on
and so on so and you can do that well by
mouse or if you are real developer you
will probably do it with the command
line utilities or some automated scripts
or whatever you have okay um I won't
show the other ones in that much detail
they do differ but this is just to sort
of give you an idea of how easy it is to
really get started of one of those
environments the other ones are not that
that much harder they they differ in
terms of features they have but i think
this this shows what you can do using a
pass approach okay so next in line is a
google app engine now what is it i think
the rule that google app engine place is
the role of a pioneer so it has been
very early in the market it has been one
of the first available platforms as
ourselves out there it has a support for
python go and java ergo is a language
that Google themselves introduced for
systems programming it's a public cloud
only amazon elastic Beanstalk is also a
public cloud it's in a way it's a true
path so that means as compared to amazon
web service Emma's an elastic Beanstalk
where you could actually tweak the
machine log into the Machine and do
whatever you want you you want with
those machines this is off limits in
google app engine Google App Engine it's
a complete obstruction so you just have
your your system and you don't know even
see that it's running on a web server or
on an operating system that's all
abstracted away and that means so there
are limited possibilities in terms of
what you can do for tuning so there is
no way that you can change the Emperor
meters or anything like that that's just
not possible it is ready for production
so Amazon is the Beanstalk is still in
beta but this is really released
software and is used in production at
several companies or several air service
systems there are some additional
services so there is a no sequel key
value store that can access using radio
or JP a radio is the well older
persistent standard JPS the more
recent one to be perfectly honest I
think it's not a perfect fit because jpa
is obviously something that is specific
for relational databases that relies for
example on joints if you want to have
the full capacity and obviously you
can't do quite a few things on annuals
on a no sequel store so i think the
benefit that you get is that if you are
used to jpa it's not too hard to use
this no sequel store because it's well a
similar API however in terms of
portability or using different positions
engines you're probably you will
probably have a hard time converting
things from google app engine to a
different environment there is a
database called cloud sequel that is in
preview right now it's my sequel based
so it's very much like my sequel but
it's only a preview at this point and
there are quite a few other services so
there is a caching servers a blob
storage service there are air services
for image manipulation XMPP chat and so
on so the point here to note is it's
limited so there is just a no sequel
store and in particular there is no
relational database available if you
talk about a production-ready system so
there is the preview but I'm not sure
whether I would use it in production
yeah so what are some things on the road
map so em well outbound socket support
to talk to other services this is not
possible right now so it's not possible
to open up a web a net connection to
some other services from google app
engine there is support for the site
java there will be support for the java
software 3.0 api for as acronis transfer
MapReduce API and blobs on migration so
advantages well it is Samuel in
production and there are quite a few
people using it and of course
it's running in a google data center
there is quick access to other Google
services there is a nice integration
with android so I think a common use
case for google app engine to run the
backend of android applications on that
system it is free for small applications
and SS it's a very fine grain model for
scaling so basically you pay by request
which is different from amazon web
services so those are the advantages so
there are certain limits in terms of the
capacity that you allowed to use they
are actually not that low so if you have
something that is not enormously
successful you can basically run it for
free and I don't know they deleted from
the top of my head to be perfectly
honest but you can sign up for it and it
gives you a nice information about about
the concrete limits okay challenges data
centers in the US only which is not a
great if you injure or across and not
just because of data privacy but also
because of latency there is a very
limited white list of classes that you
can use and there are nice articles that
talk about how you can actually run jsf
on top of Google App Engine which is
probably a technical challenge that I
wouldn't like to solve because I assume
that you know web framework just works
so that is a problem there and I'm not
sure about the other languages like
Python or go but this is really in my
opinion is severe limitation because and
it's a wide list so it doesn't say well
you know here are some classes that you
cannot use it says here are the classes
that you can use
this in a way leads to a login so if you
look at it there is the JPA API to talk
to the no sequel store which is very
specific for this no sequel store if you
want to run your applications in well in
a performant manner you will have
specific classes that you are using
there are specific services that you're
using supporting an application from
google app engine will probably not be
that easy and for some reason they
change the pricing not too long ago and
that caused quite some let's say
confusion among the developers and I
think that's actually not a pleasant
situation to be in because you're
basically locked into this specific
environment and then all of a sudden
pricing is changed and while there is no
easy way to get away from from the
platform so I think those are some
problems yes I said it's a very
restricted environment there is a
limited sandbox there is for the focus
on no sequel databases there is a limit
on the startup time for applications
there is a limit on the response time
there is a way that you can access the
operating system which I called the true
path in a way and you can't even access
and find food web server so and there
are even specialized frame works for
google app engine such as Gaelic for
groovy that just focus on Google App
Engine which in my opinion again shows
that there is some kind of lock and of
course there are standards of course you
could probably migrate a system away
from google avenge but at the end of the
day there is locking and what I well I
said before that that logging is
probably not something that I'm too
afraid of what the real problem is my
opinion is that this platform is not
like a real Java platform because it is
it has this very limited set of
whitelisted classes
so Google App Engine then the next one
is cloud foundry what is it it's an open
source project led by VMware and it's
apache license so Apache License
basically means that you're free to do
whatever you want to do with it so you
can even create your own fork and sell
the software what I think that is very
very interesting if you look at the
other platforms they are closed sauce I
mean of course they do incorporate open
source projects but there is no way that
you can use that you can run the amazon
elastic Beanstalk infrastructure in your
own data center same thing for Google
App Engine this platform here actually
gives you the ability to do so and there
is a community that has built its own
systems around this core so one of the
goals of this system is to become the
Linux for cloud so to say or four pairs
and there are other commercial offerings
around cloud foundry at this point there
is public cloud by VMware that is in a
beater there are private offerings so
there is active state as stick to that
you can use and there is another one
that it has been announced by VMware on
some forums or not like not not a very
public announcement but if you look at
the forums it actually says well we do
have plans to provide a private offering
and there is a micro cloud that allows
you to run the reduced version of the
cloud in your own on your own laptop
basically to test things and to run your
system in your own environment yeah
there are quite a few languages that are
supported Java Scalia groovy JVM
languages but also Ruby Erlang nodejs
Python PHP and that is another another
nice benefit of open source so there is
a community
and they add features like language
support for example so that's nice and
there is it's a pass so it is between
our two a google app engine and a
Missoula sabine store so you can do some
tweaking so for example you can
configure the memory that is reserved
for for an application but that's it so
there is no detailed waking like you as
you have it in an Amazon alyssa
beanstalk yeah so other things there is
supporting you ubuntu and you're going
to you you to a provision systems
running Cloud Foundry there are images
for amazon list ec2 provided by right
scale they haven't been updated for
quite a while there is a dotnet port
iron foundry the vmware gas have
recently released Bosh which is their
system to provision servers at cloud
foundry com so there is a whole
ecosystem and quite a few partners that
are that are building their business
around cloud foundry one thing that is
very specific to Cloud Foundry is are
these services so if you look at the
other what that means is that cloud
foundry will provide access to the
application to specific services like
RabbitMQ pasta square my sequel neo4j
red is MongoDB and so on and your
application will get the reference to
the service from the environment so
usually what you do is your right your
application you say okay there is a ul a
jdbc UL for the database and you need to
configure it that's different here so
what happens here in your code is that
you go to a cloud foundry and say well
you know I need a database and then
confirm recess well you know there is
this postcode squares over around here
that we are using so why don't you use
this and here is your URL
is your username here's your password
and that means that you can run the
system or the application unchanged in
different environments which is nice for
staging testing and so on to do that you
need an integration in the framework so
there is for example the cloud namespace
in spring that allows you to say well I
need a reference to a database here
similar things yep there's an an
automatic configuration spring as well
so if there is just one data source will
be overwritten by the data source that
the cloud foundry will provide other
framework supported a play and lift or
you can use API calls so the way it
works behind the scenes is that when
your application starts there are
environment variables that contain the
information of the configured services
and you need to read out those marmont
variables and then they will contain the
UL the username password all these
things and then you can use your normal
approach to access those services or you
use the framework integration which is
of course much easier and nicer to use
so why would I care what's the advantage
well I think there is a lot of open
source innovation happening in this
space so that's interesting and there is
a private cloud story so if you look at
the other offerings they all focus on
public cloud and as I said earlier there
are banks insurances and so on that will
probably never run their system on
public cloud if they sell want to have
the flexibility of a pair solution they
can use cloud foundry there is micro
cloud for laptop and desktop testing and
there is this service model which is
unique to cloud foundry so service is
injected in your application basically
there are some optimizations so if you
upload your application what the
libraries will be cached so instead of
uploading the complete war file with all
the dependencies just your code will be
deployed automatically behind the scenes
so as for databases are shared across
all applications so it won't start your
own application at your own database
server which is again quicker and also
probably more cost-efficient and it's
again the standard programming model
that we are probably all used to a
tomcat for Jabba the standard amount
challenges well first of all the public
cloud still is in beta and there is no
pricing announced private cloud is in
beta or it's available but not from
vmware there is no full support for java
ee so it's limited to tomcat as i said
earlier i don't believe this is such a
big issue but well data centers only for
available in the u.s. however you could
run it on easy to install your systems
on ec2 and integrating additional
services is in principle possible
however you would need to change the
code base so if you want to rely on
Cloud Foundry and confirm the service
model you will need to change actually
change the code base of cloud foundry
itself which is well probably complex so
that means there is a limited set of
services so if you look at amazon
elastic beanstalk basically every
database that is running on ec2 can be
used from elastic beanstalk it's just
that you have to have the traditional
configuration mechanism why here there
is an automated configuration mechanism
but there for the choice is limited and
you will need to provide integration in
your framework another problem if you
run cloud foundry on your own system
it's actually quite a complex piece of
software because there are all these
services that are integrated and the
other problem is so how are those
servers the scaled I mean if you want to
have a postgresql
my sequel running in production you want
to have a bulletproof installation that
is also able to scale and probably that
will be different from the standard
installation that cloud foundry offers
so that's an end challenge and there is
there is a problem because if you add a
new service you probably also need to
have integration at all frameworks so if
you have x frameworks and wire services
then you have x times y many integration
points which is well not too great ok
last in line again I think completely
different approach is cloudbees cloud
beans has actually two offerings so
there is def a card which i believe is
probably the the thing that makes
cloudbees very interesting and also sets
it apart from the competition deford
cloud is developed our developer
services so it's a continuous
integration server that checks out your
sources compartes them there is maven
repository for snapshots and releases
there is there are subversion git
repositories and there are also some
partners for testing static code
analysis analysis wikis and so on and so
on so basically you get except for the
IDE you get everything you get
everything that you need to run your
your project which is nice and it's also
quite different from the other offerings
because they focus on production
environments or environments that your
system can run on there is a run a cloud
environment that uses ec2 and a tomcat
on top of that it's very easy to deploy
a war file there are some configuration
options one speciality that there is
support for the java web profile so what
the other competitors that we've seen so
far are only able to support solids they
actually provide support for the web
profile which is more complex there is
support for elastic scalability ring
there is a simple my sequel database you
might also want to you
can also use Amazon RDS of course and
there are also partners for other
services so let's run at cloud
advantages well its production ready so
they have left the better status for
quite a while now and they also support
the development process and they have
more than just saw flights they have the
web profile and this energy over
programming mode it runs on top of ec2
so you have access to all the other
things that Amazon Web Services has to
offer challenges well run at cloud is
not that it doesn't really have that
much flexibility in terms of
configuration so I think those that is
the main problem so I think the way it
is positioned is as a system that
supports developers that's the main
point I'm not sure where the end the the
rudder cloud of ring is well separate
and probably not my opinion not the
focus copies might disagree not sure
other so there is Heroku that's a path
that is now on passage false previously
sets was had a collaboration with VMware
that is now model as the thing of the
past Khan supports Java however as a
beta only and also only in US data
centers and it's different because the
way it works is that you push your
source code to a git repository it's
automatically compiled by Heroku and run
on their cloud platform it's very well
it's very popular among i would say Ruby
developers in particular and while it is
sort of starting or has a Java offering
out there for a while now then there is
Microsoft it's primarily targeted at net
but there is also Java support
the reason why I have included it in the
presentation is because it's again well
it they have worldwide data centers much
like Amazon they are production ready
they have a very complete offering so
they have a relational database service
they have a no secret service as well
they have caches and so on and so on
they even have a support for linux
workers now that has been announced I
think this week and they have a turnkey
ready Hadoop solution as has amazon so
the reason as I said wife included it is
because I believe if you look at Asia
it's probably the other system that is
available worldwide and its really
interesting and as second only to Amazon
probably yeah Oracle public cloud has
been launched this week based on their
sweet and there's also red head open
shift they have a complete job are you
offering again so that's another thing
that you might want to look at however I
don't want to dive into details their
pricing yeah that's interesting so the
bottom line is it's very hard to come up
with numbers so the models are very
different and you can't come up with an
estimate that says okay your application
will cost this on that cloud environment
and that on this other cloud environment
because the way the charges are
calculated are very different if you
look at Emma's room for example it's
based on the number of instances that
you're running and how long you are
running them if you look at Google App
Engine that's completely different
because they don't have they don't even
have instances so they can't charge you
for instances of course
yeah so that concludes my presentation I
hope you got a nice overview about all
the different offerings and I would be
happy to ask questions if there are any
first-degree the sort of directing so I
know from spring
where John Adair that is also offering
for the development boots so I mean we
use Jenkins custom knowledge and polly
pocket so critical for all those
robberies or is it does owe me as in as
a necessary as I have multiple
environments I testing out development
are staging and so they will be good to
have different environments as well is
there any support yeah so usually there
is some sort of command line utility
that you can use so if you look at
California for example they have this
BMC command line utility that you can
use same thing for elastic Beanstalk
they also have an API that you can use
same thing for a cloud-based and for
Google App Engine I believe there is
also something like that also all of
them do offer Eclipse plugins so there
is an eclipse plugin for cloud foundry
there is one for a basic Beanstalk and
there is one for Google App Engine but
if there is known for cloud-based to be
honest and if you look at Cloud Foundry
and elastic Beanstalk in particular it's
just like your tomcat so it basically
says here is the server deploy stuff to
it and you're done also so that's
actually quite quite nice and convenient
way and if you talk about support for
like the real development process like
cloud piece has to offer and there is
this announcement by vmware together
with task top about co2 cloud i'm
actually not really sure about this data
about the the status there it seems to
be really early announcement so i'm not
sure whether they are following up and
and as i said i believe that cloud is
actually quite unique a uniquely
positioned in that regard and they have
the Jenkins committer on the payroll so
um i think they are they don't quite us
the joints are alone may not have a
relational data model so it doesn't mean
that the design of the operation is also
restricted you may not have a complex
project folder because usually you have
a public updated model and you transfer
it to a complex data model that's not
possible or well I mean the point is
that on a no sequel database you can't
really well or on these kinds of
databases not no sequel in general you
can't do joints because that would mean
that you would need to that also have us
need to talk to each other and that is
not feasible so yes there are limits you
could still come up with ways to
navigate from one object to another
however it will be different from what
you're probably used to and as I said
earlier I believe that is one of the the
issues that Google App Engine has its
not to say that you can't run complex
applications on top of that because
obviously you can it's just different
but it's also different from what you're
used to from because most of the Java
developers I actually experience with
the relational database model and if the
question to me is also whether there is
so it's sort of a price that you pay
question to me is what do you get and if
i look at it and if i'm honest I'm not
sure what you get because it is well
there is a different pricing scheme so
you might be better off concerning
pricing but there are so many technical
well challenges if you come from a
traditional Java background because
there is this whiteness of classes there
is a no sequel database that's different
from what you're used to and there's
also a login so yeah to me the question
is why would I use it the only point
that I can come up with to me is this
integration with
android so that seems to be a good thing
maybe if you want to run simple
applications and if you stick to the to
the free tier that is also something
that might be valuable but otherwise I
would probably not use it and the reason
why I've included it in the presentation
is because a lot of people and in
particular from a Java background belief
that pass and cloud is like Google App
Engine and actually it's not I mean
there are even people who serves I had a
discussion online somewhere and there
was this the the the guy basic said well
you know if you want to have a true
cloud it has to be like Google Evans you
have to abstract away from the operating
system you can't touch the web server
and you have to use a no sequel database
and I think that's just wrong and
because there are other things that have
a different trade of that no I have no
idea yeah I believe that it's let's say
it's i believe it's rather the starting
point if you look at it most of the
stuff that is done is still i mean it's
an enterprise technology so usually what
what happens is that the stuff runs in
your own data center there's a lot of
interest and with the announcement of x
by oracle this week it's pretty apparent
and and also i mean cloud is supposed to
be one of the major subjects for java ee
7 I won't talk about why I believe this
is actually not that true but let's it's
a different subject but it is on the
radar screen of quite a few people in
the Java scene and I there and there is
a lot of investment going on as you can
see so I think there are things going on
but at the same time I would say it's
still a the traditional application
server model in your data center that
that we are seeing most of the time
