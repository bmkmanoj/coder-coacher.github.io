designer developer I've basically done
the whole spectrum of anything related
to making websites or web applications
so from back-end and database
programming all the way to high-level
products design and conceptual business
strategy etc but today I'm going to talk
about constraints the things that limit
freedom and of course on the sound of it
constraints sound like a like a bad
thing you know they don't sound like
something you'd want they don't sound
like something you'd enjoy you know
something that limits my freedom I don't
want that Americans don't want that mind
you I'm Dutch despite my heavily
American accent I live in San Francisco
and have for a couple years so excused
American accent I feel at home here in a
country full of people who bike it's
great so anyway I created moderniser who
here has heard of modernizer cool okay
so modernize is a JavaScript library
that helps you work with css3 html5 all
these new technologies being put into
browsers it's an open source project we
have like 50 plus contributors at this
point and it's pretty popular you know
it's actually kind of the third library
right after like jQuery and jQuery UI
which I don't know if that counts even
when so anyway constraints I don't like
constraints right ah I want freedom but
constraints are everywhere there you
know literally everywhere the rooms
surrounding us the streets that we drive
in bicycle on balancing our bank
accounts constraints also are our legal
system which provides us with disability
and morality and the systems in place
for us to pursued freedoms that we enjoy
and that are beneficial to us freedoms
to pursue dreams and careers &amp;amp; hobbies
and whatever else we may want
so constraints are all around us and for
the most part to actually serve a pretty
good purpose but I think they're more
than that I think they're there's an
innate beauty to a constraint in
whatever form it may come it doesn't not
always have to be positive but it
certainly can be very positive for
instance this is Gary Chang he's a hong
kong-based architect and he grew up and
lived most of his life in literally a 35
square meter apartment that is smaller
than the stage that is like half the
stage maybe even listen that it's really
small and that was his life and he felt
really trapped because it was arranged
as any apartment or house really is no
there's a bedroom over there there's the
kitchen there's the sort of a living
room area you have two bathroom and that
was sort of fit but it was all very tiny
and cramped because it's Hong Kong space
is extremely valuable there and he
didn't like that he was an architect so
he worked with in this physical
constraint of the apartment unit that he
lived in and he turned it into something
that has over 30 fully livable rooms in
it so he made in adjust abholen terior
walls that can move around they can be
flipped over up and down however you
want however he wants it so he has a
library he has a den he has a living
room with a big TV he has a full kitchen
is a spacious bathroom he is a very
comfortable bedroom with adult
queen-size bed and he did all that
within the constraints of the
physicality of his tiny tiny apartment
by thinking in a very different way
about what he could do with that sort of
space and admittedly lots of money but I
think this is a great apartment and I
would actually love to have maybe
something a little bit bigger I'm fairly
tall but I would love to see more of
that elsewhere in the world because it's
such an efficient use of space and
generally we can only be in one room at
the same time and we have guests over we
don't really need to show them the
bedroom
so much so I think this is a really
awesome thing that he worked within
these constraints but he wasn't even a
first in 1924 the dutch architect david
rietveld was commissioned by a woman to
build a house and her request was I'd
like a house without walls okay so how
do you do a house without walls you know
it's kind of a weird commission for for
an architect but he kind of worked with
that challenge and he made he thinks he
thought very differently about
everything about architecture and
everything he had ever learned
everything he'd ever thought of doing or
did before he thought differently about
everything in he had to so he built
something where the interior walls again
are adjustable not quite as much as Gary
Chang's apartment but the whole place
has these areas where they sort of flow
into the outside and you can have this
feeling of extreme spaciousness because
you never feel fully enclosed by four
walls of course it still has four walls
around you but it's all very differently
designed and architect and it feels very
different and unique and as a result
this house I mean now if you were to see
this photo or look see a house like this
somewhere you think oh you know it's
built somewhere in the last 20 years
maybe 15 feels very modern but it was
built 90 years ago and it's because the
constraint of his extremely unusual
commission that he ended up with such a
forward-looking aesthetic and this was
also part of the things that introduced
the style which is a pretty well-known
dutch design an aesthetic movement that
began around that time now of course we
also have financial constraints every
project has a budget limitations and the
sommelier had a very limited budget she
was just starting out he didn't have a
lot of money for a branding or design or
anything like that but the design firm
kaserne figure out a way to work within
that extreme financial
and they gave her this beautiful
branding incredibly elegant every
business card is unique but put put two
together and you can tell this is like a
cohesive whole this is something that
fits together beautifully this is
something that is designed specifically
to be this way and all they did was take
a cup of wine bottles and stamp the
glasses across everything and she had
this beautiful branding that fit her so
perfectly and it didn't cost much this
was the cheapest but the very effective
branning that they could offer you can
also impose arbitrary complete
constraints and I'm kind of a fan of
that arbitrary constraints really mean
you impose something that you don't
necessarily have to you have more
freedom than this you can use it if you
want but Instagram chose not to they
chose to keep their photos square now a
lot of people go like while they you
know they simulated Polaroid the
polaroid photos weren't actually square
for the most part they were near squared
error rectangular Instagram came up with
this in simulation perhaps of Polaroid
but it became their identity they
started as an iOS only app at a time
where iphones and ipod touches were only
the three by two resolution and took
photos that were three by two resolution
so they had to crop every photo and they
had to kind of break a certain
convention about photography and
storytelling because there's elements do
two three by two aspect ratio which
helped tell a story and frame a picture
make something more memorable but they
figured out a way to make it memorable
after all and part of that was this
arbitrary constraint that they imposed
on themselves which then led to it open
doors to new forms of creativity and new
options new design opportunities that
they then pursued and it also gave them
a unique style that helps set them apart
from all competitors you see you see a
square
you think Instagram especially nowadays
but even in the very early days when
they just started out they were kind of
known for the square photo thing and
they were very popular from day one
another one is attention spans there's a
it's not as well known for among
presenters and even conference
organizers but when there's more than
five seconds of reading material on a
slide people stop listening to the
speaker because research shows that
people are really bad at multitasking
for more than five seconds when we have
different methods of communication going
in we can only really manage five
seconds of it for more than one at a
time and then we start to face one of
them out this is where death by
PowerPoint comes from people not so much
that it's bullets on a slide but there's
so much text and people think oh it's
it's on the slides it must be important
you put it on a slide but that's not
really helpful because people lose
attention they stop listening to you as
a speaker and they have to dilute their
are their attention gets diluted and the
experience gets kind of worse for both
my me as a presenter use as a presenter
and everyone in the audience now not
everyone is unaware of this ted is
pretty famously aware of this but they
think of it in a slightly bigger picture
they did the research or they looked at
research about the human attention span
for big topics in general how long can
people really comfortably and cogently
sit and watch and hear about a certain
topic and take it all in and retain as
much as possible and that limit is about
20 minutes guess how long ted talks are
18 to 19 minutes they're limited based
on the human attention span and I mean
who here has seen a TED talk right
everyone or almost everyone and for the
most part they're really good talks
of course they have a good selection of
very high profile people and they
trained them but it helps that these
talks are very memorable because they
fit exactly within our attention span
for anything that isn't our personal
field of expertise our personal domain
that we know a lot about it's a bike for
biking your bikes around it kind of like
this in North America as the cities were
being built there they had lots of space
loads of physical space that they could
take advantage of build houses give
everyone a garden front and backyard
picket fence around them lots of space
and then going to store to buy groceries
or do anything at all kind of tedious
either a really long walk now this is
just easier to drive and with all that
space even in a densely populated cities
people drive everywhere they drive just
two blocks or maybe four blocks to the
corner store because just ads for long
blocks to walk the whole culture exists
around driving there it's slowly slowly
changing but here in Europe I mean
there's a everyone here who lives in
Denmark or any other Western European
country knows biking is pretty popular
it's efficient it's effective it's
healthy but you do need infrastructure
that is safe for biking that stimulates
it it makes it you know appealing for
you to bike and they don't have that in
North America for the most part it's
really freaking dangerous also because
drivers they are not used to bikes
because no one ever freaking bikes
anywhere here in Europe we've had cities
builds for you know over 2,000 years now
that we still live in we've had extreme
space constraints forcing us to think
very differently about how modes of
transport how to get around how
be efficient about just doing your daily
routine North America not so much you
can really see the difference and now
they're slowly coming around to try and
get a biking culture there because hey
it's healthy and efficient and it
doesn't cost you expensive fuel and you
don't have to buy an electric car to
feel good about not making the
environment bad or worse so these space
constraints that involves all naturally
here they never applied them in north
america and now to sort of paying the
price in many ways what about software
who here thinks they can write zero bug
software almost no one right but if you
work at NASA or in the financial
industry or in medicine you kind of have
to because when you introduce a bug in a
space like a rocket or a space system on
orbital satellite of some sort you risk
people's lives your risk billions of
dollars of equipment that's that's a
kind of software bug dead you know I
don't have to deal with because I right
web applications and it's not that you
know it's not that it's it if I write a
bug and someone experiences that it's
inconvenient doesn't kill them it's a
pretty big difference there so if you
have to live within a cereal box
software environment within that
constraint you have to think very
differently and very creatively about
your unit testing and I don't know if in
walls here for the previous talk but
this is discussed beyond unit testing
this goes to scientific peer review of
every line of code you have to think
very differently about automating that
sort of process because your code is
extremely important now I have to
unfortunately turn my back to read this
but there's a great quote by Rob Dunn
trees have evolved in the struggle
planned against plan many times in
vastly different lineages the highest
leaves win and so trees tend to evolve
to be as tall as possible given the
limits of physics and precipitate
precipitation without competition every
force would be a thick film of green
life now imagine if nature didn't have
this kind of constraints around it and
the earth would really be covered in
just rocks and a thick film of green
life we probably wouldn't have life the
way we know it at all here these
constraints from nature helped develop
and helped produce the evolution that
has led us to this point and because of
those constraints nature kept finding
away around them they kept trying to
fight away for life itself and humans
have done that for as long as we've been
around as well we run into a constraint
home how can we work our way around this
but if the path is open we just kind of
walk their path of least resistance
which is great but you don't tend to
think very creatively when you're just
walking straight forward and you don't
have to do anything about it now I'm not
trying to say that constraints are the
only thing that inspire creativity
that's absolutely not true we can be
incredibly creative who knows this
building so this is the sagrada familia
in barcelona designed by gaudi in 1892 i
think they started in 1894 they're still
working on it they don't expect to be
done until 2030 2032 so another 15 16
years or so this is a masterful
Cathedral who's been there just a quick
question ok so probably everyone who's
been there will grade this is one of the
greatest works of human architectural
history ever right this is a fantastic
piece the most creative building you've
ever seen it has tiny details and every
every corner every crevice there's
phenomenal creativity in this building
it's
mind-blowing ly beautiful and Gowdy was
given no constraints essentially you'll
stalled just go make your make whatever
you can think of make the most beautiful
work most beautiful cathedral you can
come up with I'd say he say he succeeded
is a beautiful piece of art in the sense
and he had no constraints so constraints
they can help creativity but they're not
the only thing for it we can still be
incredibly inspiring and creative
without them of course the problem was
he also wanted it funded entirely by
donations which makes development on it
kind of slow which is why it's going to
take about 140 years for this to be
finished so how do we find constraints
in our work how do we benefit from them
well in a sense in as digital workers
we've always worked within a certain
constraint the physical screen in
whatever form it may have been but
within that not a constraint it was all
digital behind the screen we could do
whatever we wanted if we wanted we could
have created this vast canvas with text
anywhere we wanted yo I controls
anywhere we want it would have been
credibly inconvenient to work with
though because we can't figure you know
what's scrolling all the way around
can't sucks so we naturally created the
constraint of just vertical scrolling
and whenever we encounter a website that
breaks from that pattern well people are
complaining certainly if it's like a
high-profile website from some major
brand and they create a horizontal
scrolling page and everyone's just like
why did you do this it sucks
so we had these constraints and in some
ways we didn't some of them have been
extremely positive some of them have
been less so for instance at some point
we decided you know I think 980 pixels
is a really good with for a website who
remembers those days it was sort of the
collective wisdom emerging from the web
design industry saying like oh you know
yeah that's a good whiff we'll just
stick to this this is now this is a safe
with and then of course it wasn't and
then mobile happened and it became
incredibly clear to everyone now that it
wasn't and when I say mobile happens I
really I kind of really mean like the
iPhone era of smartphones that allow
people to browse and visit and news
websites in the same way or mostly the
same way that they were used to on
desktops now there were phones before
that there were smartphones before that
and feature phones that it could browse
the web but it was often a pretty broken
experience and wasn't greedy similar to
what we were used to as a web site until
about two thousand seven and then
everything just sort of like went to fit
in a good way it was just chaos madness
fun though I like making websites that
work in all these different constraints
different screen sizes different devices
and browsers they helped me they made me
think back to two thousand two and three
and four when Stuart Butterfield he ran
the 5k contest does anyone know or
remember the 5k contest like three
people yeah so these were contest where
he said go build any website you want or
a web application can do anything just a
web page of some sort you can look like
anything you want can do anything you
want you can be game can be a nap but
all of the code and all the images you
use in all the JavaScript you write for
it all of it has to fit within five
kilobytes of course you had the
naysayers going like ah
this is ridiculous we can't do that it's
way too little my JavaScript library is
already 10k candy this is ridiculous and
others were okay interesting challenge
and then we saw this immense creativity
happen people were coming up with the
most fantastic solutions to work within
the constraint of having only 5k of code
bill people wrote entire web apps in
JavaScript that generate generated the
interface so that it wouldn't need as
much code to actually write out the
interface normally it would generate the
code on the fly generate like algorithm
algorithmically generate everything
needed to create entire functioning app
that in expanded form was more than 5k
but the original code was within 5k we
saw this amazing creativity and then of
course he ran the contest two more times
because of it was so popular and then he
has great quote saying rigid constraints
of designing for the web forces to get
truly creative since the space we have
to explore so small we have to look
harder get more creative and that's what
makes it all interesting so true so true
in fact that years later a list apart
did the 10th k contest and instead of 5k
you now have 10 kilobytes of code that
you could use plus mm one or two of the
major popular library is being used
almost everywhere like jQuery etcetera
so oh and of course a new constraint it
had to be responsive is you know most
not 2002 anymore and these again that
served to be an extremely popular
challenge because lots of people created
fully-fledged apps that are actually you
know you can do something productive and
useful with them and they fit within 10
K it's fantastic in similar vein there
was a faci is a Zen garden who's
familiar with it and most people the
same garden was kind of really important
at its time he brought it back recently
relaunched it with
an updated experience and focus more on
the modern day with development web
development and design principles but
back then in two thousand three people
were not as convinced by CSS a lot of
people were just saying like Oh CSS is
useless count dude layouts it's so buggy
and broken we should just stick to
tables they've served us really well for
all this time they work really well
they're sturdy and reliable and robust
now Dave's constraint in the Zen garden
was well simple design any website you
want design whatever experience you want
use whatever CSS you want right NEC says
you'd like but this is the html5 you get
to use and you do not get to change it
the only thing you get to changes which
CSS files imported that's your CSS file
and that's it everything else has to be
the same and this proof phenomenally
popular it created thousands of designs
for it and 1,200 really high profile or
high quality designs professional
designs for this one simple page over
1200 that were featured it was so
popular that it became a book
interviewing some of the most creative
creators and designers for the site or
for the various same garden themes but
more importantly what this did was this
helped establish something very
fundamental to today's web design
principles which is you CSS and it's
extremely capable it's extremely
flexible we could do almost anything
with it and people proved that and it
was the most compelling argument because
people basically stopped using tables
very short very shortly after the
popularity of the same garden took off
and I was pretty important for the web
design industry and community but it was
also just a fantastic observation for
seeing how creative people would get
just from being told you may not
change the HTML here that inspired them
to do something creative something more
creative than they might have done
before that a lot of people blog about
how it forced him to think in new ways
and they look at CSS in a different
light and look up see suspects to learn
what else they could do with something
this inspired so much creativity it was
fantastic it also taught us important
things about the separation of HTML CSS
and JavaScript which I probably won't
have to repeat the benefits thereof at
this point but back then that was also a
really big thing even today it's still
important to remember how valuable good
maintainable code is not just for like
other people who may work in your team
but also for yourself six months down
the line when you haven't touched that
code for a while and now you're suddenly
going back to it in your life what the
hell was I doing who's been there yeah
everyone else is just lying separation
is very important and CSS and garden
help illustrate that of course I was
talking about mobile resource
constraints are really the biggest thing
on mobile all the school stuff we can do
on on desktop browsers and full laptops
doesn't always work as well on on mobile
certainly not on the older devices and I
like this verdict is like all of the
iphones throughout the generations all
the way up to like the latest models
which is kind of cool but the older
devices are still unused maybe not the
very first ones but no 2 3g and 3gs
still widely used around the world they
are slow compared to everything we have
today but they're being used and we need
to sort of think about that we need to
think about these resource constraints
that we don't stuff our websites follow
like cool things that we only test on
the last three models of smartphones in
Angola okay well this is working fine on
all of them so it should be good now of
course with moderniser we had API
constraints all we had a lot of
constraints in the design of this
the API constraints was that it had to
be extremely simple had to be extremely
intuitive and easy to use mmm the
messaging around on the site may have
not have been that great for it at times
not as effective in doing this but the
API of the library itself was always
really clear and simple in fact has only
had one tiny tiny tiny change at the
very beginning and since then since then
has not been updated or changed from an
API point of view stayed the same still
still great and all it does this tell
you that hey you want to use you know
css3 transitions this browser has them
oh this browser doesn't begin just a
modernized at CSS transition it'll be
true if the browser has it it'll be
false 50 browser doesn't support it and
in HTML element it will add a class
saying CSS transitions if the browser
has it no CSS transitions if the browser
doesn't you can fork your JavaScript you
can fork your CSS based on the
capabilities of the browser and and
that's it it's super simple it's really
intuitive you can create beautiful
designs and still control exactly what
will happen for the user if they don't
have support for these cool feature so
you started using there we also had size
constraints this was something that was
going to impact the look and feel of
your site or your application possibly
in a dramatic way so it had to be loaded
at the front also if you wanted to use
to html5 shift that was part of it to
enable you know modern html5 elements
for older IE browsers it has to be at
the top it had to be in the head of your
page so it had to be small had to be
really small now by now we have over a
hundred sixty tests in there which is a
lot but you don't need all of them so we
have a builder that allows you to just
choose the ones you need generate a
build with just those tests in it super
easy and really small usually with any
of the common set of tests that people
use it's only a couple of kilobytes for
the entire thing
and that's that makes it easy and fast
to load it also had to be fast to
execute because again this is something
that might change the style of your site
visually very very strongly and you
didn't want to offer your user something
like this is what it's going what the
site is going to look like all sits
loading and it's only switch to some
other look and feel entirely because
they didn't have support for certain
features you were using so it had to
execute really fast as well and we kind
of set the bar at 50 milliseconds and
ideally we wanted it to be 50
milliseconds of load and execution time
but within a variable latency and
network conditions we settled for at
least 50 milliseconds a full execution
time any time before that it had to be
done and that helped that was a good
constraint for us to set now what we try
to be even lower than that we try to
just be 15 16 maybe within 20
milliseconds but depending on the amount
of tests you use it may fluctuate quite
a bit but it helped for us to set that
as a goal those arbitrary but it was
important because performance is
incredibly important so where's all this
going where you know where is this whole
landscape of constraints leading us I
like to think that what we're seeing
slowly very slowly is a fifth towards
opinionated interfaces not quite like
hell though I do appreciate him as an
opinionated interface also Marvin from
Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy also
very opinionated mostly depressive but
nice and sarcastic I like that but
opinionated interfaces really what they
are all about is an interface that by
design tells you don't don't do this
thing that's actually not as good do
this thing instead
interfaces that encourage you a certain
direction or in a certain way and either
discourage view or outright prevent you
from doing something you might want to
do or might feel you need to do but
maybe you don't actually need to do it
it it's an interface that doesn't give
you a lot of options to fiddle with in
part because we kind of know from
research that about ninety-five percent
of people don't change default options
anyway they leave them at the default
because they think well that's probably
what's best right opinionated interfaces
can help really set you in a direction
that is good for the work you're trying
to do or whatever you're trying to
achieve even if that may not have been
what you thought you were about to do we
can also help prevent cognitive
cognitive load which is when users are
presented with more options or more
things than they need to deal with it's
kind of what happens when as a non-pilot
you see your photo of a airplane cockpit
and you see all these dials and all
these levers and garlic holy fit I'm
glad I'm not a pilot because I would not
know how to fly this thing right but an
actual pilot goes like well I know
exactly what all of this is one example
of that is my own product which is
presentation software and we came across
a really good example of this we're in
PowerPoint or keynote if you start to
create a new presentation one of the
questions the software asks you is what
resolution do you want your slides to be
in I don't know I don't care why should
I care something big because I want them
to be pretty I want them to look good
and I want text to look sharp but you
know why is it why should that matter
why is that a question the software
asked me and it shouldn't be
that's the question that software can
take care of automatically as a soft
that's kind of the example where
software should be a little bit more
opinionated and just think for itself a
little bit I mean this is by design from
the people who create the software but
the software should be like oh well we
know that basically any projector in the
world is a rectangular projector okay we
know that another rectangle fits inside
of a rectangle so that's easy all we
need is an aspect ratio that's the only
thing that really matters so that's the
thing that we just define by ourselves
in present aid it's a fixed aspect ratio
and you don't have to worry about slide
size we don't ask you about what
resolution because it's any resolution
it's responsive it should be any in all
resolutions it should fit to the screen
with available because it's a slide it's
supposed to be big and and engaging it
shouldn't be fixed at 1024 or you know
640 by something it should just be
however big is possible so we make it
however big as possible but you got to
design this into the software that
you're making or into the website you're
making consciously you cannot just say
like oh you know what I'm going to slash
this feature here I'm going to cut this
oh we're opinionated software now that's
not how it works these opinionated
principles have to come from my for
design process where you think about
what the user actually needs em maybe
also what they're expecting and whether
or not what they're expecting is
actually what they need or what they
think they need which is a different
thing is it something that they're just
used to it's something that they're just
sort of like well this is how it's
always worked but is that actually
beneficial to what you're looking to do
is that does it help you achieve your
goals so you have to implement these by
design in a way that furthers the users
needs that
they actually have and not necessarily
the needs that they think they have or
the things they want that's opinion a
this offer and you have to pursue
simplicity simplicity is a constraint in
its own way and it's not about dumbing
down features my iphone is extremely
feature-rich lots of apps lots of
features lots of capabilities but it's
all so simple and intuitive to use I can
give it to a two-year-old and the child
knows how to open it and play with it
and tap on things the simplicity is is
about making something intuitive for a
user not just stripping out features
sorry and making these features
available in a way that is obvious for
them not necessarily obvious for you as
an engineer or designer because you
think in a specific way and you're like
a cable at this point I would want this
feature some people may want to that a
different moment and may want to expose
to them at a moment when they need it
only and not that moments when they
don't need it because having more
features in front of you adds to the
cognitive load of an interface if you
see a whole row of buttons you kind of
have to think through okay which button
do i need you have to look at all of
them do I even need any of these that
creates cognitive load and distracts the
user from actually focusing on the task
at hand on what he's doing hipstamatic
is also kind of an interesting example
of this they they try to simulate the
old photo camera like three old ones
whether it's Polaroid or whatever but
one of those features was you have to
wait for the camera to recharge itself
to be able to take another photo same
seconds now I don't know about you but
when I take photos I like to actually
take photos not take a photo and I stand
there and then tell people to just like
okay hold on wait for it wait for it
okay seized again make sure I got a good
photo there you know they kind of killed
themselves with this process they
simulated the experience of an old
device in both the good ways and the bat
they also had a tiny viewport like this
is on a phone and like okay this just
looks kind of cool but when i'm using a
phone without an actual view port or
camera without an actual view / to look
through i have to use the screen to take
the photo and they made that screen tiny
tiny tiny they shrunk it down to the
point where you could barely see what
photo you were taking because they
simulated the whole view port of an old
camera so you can overdo it you can
definitely overdo it and even Apple has
a history of overdoing it I'm glad
they're stopping it skeuomorphism is
about interfaces behaving similar to how
a real-world equivalent might work or
does work it's not necessarily visual
realism though it often goes hand in
hand visual realism is making something
look like a real world object
skeuomorphism is making it or trying to
behave making trying to make it behave
like a real-world equivalent so like a
knob to dial or to turn like this a
really good example that is the ical
page flip you know you want to go to the
next month oh just flip a page on your
calendar we're on a digital thing
there's no page here and it's tedious it
took two seconds for that thing to
complete before you were able to reuse
the interface again and go to the next
page if you next month if you wanted to
so I was really glad that they can't all
of that nonsense well most of that
nonsense in in all the various latest
os's because yeah everyone can fall prey
to doing this stuff that looks
feels kind of cool meindl actually serve
the user in his or her needs leather
buttons seriously who has ever seen a
leather button in the real world elles
awful so anyway I'd like you to think
and go away from the stock thinking
about how constraints in your work can
inspire creativity how you may be able
to actually impose certain constraints
on your project on your design
constraints you don't have a need for
but that might be an interesting
challenge for you that might prove the
or that might force you to think in a
more unique or a different way about
what you're about to do the work you're
doing design you're making set creative
constraints around your work also in
your hobby like I am I like writing and
so sometimes I said very specific and
completely arbitrary constraints like
okay today I'm going to write
specifically hundred words for this
piece or specifically 501 words for that
piece makes no sense but it forces me to
think very differently about what kind
of synthesis I use especially closer to
the end and whether I can fit my whole
message in there or not think about
resources that you use and can you reuse
them more efficiently more creatively do
a gary chang and rietveld it or about
budgetary constraints can you be more
effective and efficient using less
costly resources but above all do pursue
your dream of creative and innovative
work like Goudy did even if you're not
building a cathedral thank you very much
there's some questions okay our
constraints only good if they force you
to break other self-imposed boundaries
no they can be good they can be bad
under any circumstance really obviously
certain constraints are just painful or
annoying and you don't want to work with
them but what they do encourage is a new
creative way of thinking around those
constraints or within them really like
can i still make this app the way I had
envisioned it within this constraint
that I'm suddenly forced to work with
him or even if it's like it like it is
even if it is a self-imposed one it can
be useful to work within that constrain
and see if you can work within it and if
not if its self-imposed you can break
free from a little how do you decide
what artificial constraints to make as a
good one there's also a tough one I
think it's about trying to perceive
opportunities and sometimes that
opportunity becomes readily apparent
maybe it's inspired by something someone
else did sometimes you kind of just have
to take a step back and look at your
work in a bigger picture sense and go
like okay we've built all this stuff
we've written all this code have we been
sort of like behaving like North America
city building have we just been going
all over the place and not really
thinking about how big our code base is
becoming how performance our app is and
sometimes that that thinking that step
back really helps helps you kind of get
the clearer picture of where things are
going and if you're still had
in the right direction with everything
and other times it's just a matter of
sitting down and thinking okay how can
we create some constraints in this that
would actually benefit us because just
saying like oh I'm going to say five
kilobytes of God for this toolkit I'm
writing right now nodal no more that can
be useful but if it's something that's
comprehensive and really need to be
interoperable with other stuff it might
not actually be a particularly relevant
constraint to create or it might be the
wrong constraint to impose on yourself
maybe 15 k would be better suited maybe
no file size constraint and some other
type of constraint would be better
what's the next ucss instead of tables
not sure that's interesting I see a lot
of stuff happening with canvas now I
think there's an inherent potential to
canvas and using canvas for new and
interesting things especially because we
can load images into the manipulate them
extract data out of them and then
repurpose that data or reuse the image
in a new form but what I don't see as
much is people making accessible things
in canvas thinking about what it means
to also you know create this thing that
you're creating for screen reader users
or you know other forms of accessibility
that you may need to consider for the
purposes I think I think from from a web
perspective we're seeing so much stuff
happen at the same time everywhere that
it's no longer a singular best practice
or best approach to do something anymore
we've had we have so many toolkits and
frameworks to work with we have so many
boilerplate templates and responsive
design frameworks
and we can choose from and many of them
serve slightly different purposes now in
some ways that's great we have options
to choose from in other ways it's less
great because we spend a lot of time
researching them figuring out which one
is exactly right for you and whether or
not they can interplay well with each
other and it's particularly true with
JavaScript libraries that just kind of
go like okay well this is my library
have fun and then you find out it
doesn't work with this other library you
use certain someone makes a micro
library to glue the two together and
make them work with each other and that
has piled on and on for a number of
years now to the point where we have
thousands of these sifting through that
is kind of a pain there are entire
websites made to help you with this to
help figure out which library is the
right one for you but it's all kind of
about having different purposes we're
making such completely different
websites and applications now that the
different purposes have different needs
and we are catering more effectively to
all these different needs I think our
our industry has become so big and so
all-encompassing at this point that
there is no singular answer any more for
like this is the best way of doing it I
mean they're in many ways there never
was but now that has expanded in scope
and there's a million opportunities for
everything to exist and reasons for
everything to exist and you have a
thousand things you can choose for your
one project and it's just a matter of
figuring out which one and that's it for
questions thank you
