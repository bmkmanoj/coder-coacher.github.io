good this is gonna be so you know could
be terrible and then you'll regret it do
you know what that is
that's actually a group of outsourcing
folks from India and I mean if we look
at the the picture there you know it's
relatively generic because it's not any
one particular group they represent a
concept this picture could have been
taken in India this picture could have
been taken in Indiana
either way it's a group of people who
are working on code and for many people
this represents a threat see when I was
a kid growing up and it was well let me
put it this way when I was a kid the
Transformers were still an animated
television show on Saturday morning
cartoons that gives you an idea of how
old I am but the exercise the plan here
was pretty straightforward the idea is
you get good grades in school you go to
college you graduate with your degree
you get a nice job you get married you
have a house white picket fence
one-and-a-half kids right nobody ever
quite was able to explain what a half
kid looks like but so be it and the
system quote-unquote that we see in
terms of education in terms of getting
into universities and so forth really
really encourages this notion of study
hard get the right answers you can be
successful in the States at least we
have a number of different tests that
are used to try to measure way somehow
figure out quantify your intelligence
level we have of course the classic the
scholastic aptitude test the SAT we've
actually got a preparatory SAT test that
you can take actually when you're in
junior high school before you wouldn't
get to high school if you want to go
into law there's the legal SAT the MCAT
there's even a test called the Wonderlic
test which is used to try to judge
people's unit general sense of
intelligence
matter of fact the National Football
League has been known to use the
Wonderlic to evaluate the intelligence
levels of their candidates you know for
draft day and so forth because you know
it contrary to popular opinion you do
actually have to have a brain in order
to play football well that's what they
tell me anyway
we even had tests that were designed to
tell you which field you should go into
back in junior high seventh-grade ago
seventh grade or so 13 years 14 years of
age I took one of these tests and they
said basically I should be a priest now
I'm not sure why you're laughing
unless you've been out with me at the
speaker's dinner last night but yeah
there's all of these tests that are
designed to help perpetuate this notion
of go to school get good grades get a
nice career but the problem is that the
formula is changing out from underneath
us in a number of ways when you look at
for example some of the graduation rates
that are occurring elsewhere in the
world India 350,000 engineering
graduates each year China nearly as many
engineering grads as the US and I think
actually that number has since been
surpassed
Egypt Brazil Poland all of these
countries worldwide have begun to
realize that in many cases you can get
into software development without having
to build a whole bunch of national
infrastructure we don't need trains we
don't need railroads we don't need
bridges give us a good internet
connection and we can work from pretty
much anywhere and based on simple laws
of economics they actually require a lot
less money in order to be successful
according to their local economy this
concerns a large number of people do you
know who this is here to be forgiven if
you don't there's a lot of American
references in here sorry about that but
I don't know European legends quite as
well as I do American ones this is John
Henry and John Henry was well the
classic quote is he was a steel-driving
man John Henry is an iconic American
character who worked on the railroads
back when the United State
was still laying out the track
connecting up the various parts of the
country and so the story goes as
epitomized in a song by Johnny Cash if
Johnny Cash does a song about you you're
famous by the way just so you know a man
came by with the steam-powered drill in
other words he came by with some new
automation and John Henry who believed
that man was better than machine
challenged the drill to erase and it's
an epic epic story in the beginning of
the race the drill got out ahead and
John Henry fell behind but then you know
he spat in his hands because that's what
you do apparently and started swinging
harder and eventually caught up and got
all the way to the very end they're
neck-and-neck John Henry puts on a burst
of superhuman strength finishes the race
defeats the drill and dies I didn't say
it was a happy story just said it was an
iconic story this is the first case that
we know of anecdotally speaking of
course automation beating man do you
know him
Kasparov yes probably the finest chess
player of his generation perhaps the
finest chess player of all time Kasparov
had his own little John Henry moment
right he went up against computer
computer designed specifically to play
chess he won his first World
Championship against another human of
course 1985 from that point on he never
lost a match until he faced deep blue as
a matter of fact as the story goes in
Kasparov's own words he was so rattled
by the computers play in the early in
the first round of the match that he
just couldn't focus from there on out
and basically ended up pulling a number
of draws rather than outright losses and
fortunately he didn't die but it's still
interesting because here we have two
individuals both of whom the top of
their field both of whom are losing two
machines Automation threatens
programmers more than all the other
outsourcing sources ever could
Automation in many respects is what
allows people that have not been skilled
in a particular field or topic to be
able to do things that they would never
have been able to do before the fact
that we have all of these tools to be
able to consume Web API s and engage in
certain reactions
IFTTT zapier etc the fact that we have
all these tools that allow people to
drag-and-drop and develop things etc all
of these things are in some way shape or
form threatening to a lot of developers
now in some respects we wave it off when
we say oh yeah but seriously you have to
have a certain level of understanding in
order to be able to do this stuff I mean
after all it was back in like the mid
90s when Visual Basic 3.0 shipped and I
remember one of the tag lines was now
even managers could write code and do
you know what happened they did and it
really I mean if you've ever tried to
recover a vb3 project you you're
probably experiencing flashbacks right
now but the fact of the matter is this
isn't just a programming problem number
of years ago at a medical conference
there was a fascinating display
where's probably one of the first
exercises in machine learning and
artificial intelligence where they were
submitting x-rays into basically what
looked like a fax machine or a scanner
and after some analysis it was printing
out diagnoses and these people were
amazed because yeah I was actually
printing out some very very subtle
diagnoses you know this is dislocated or
partially dislocated things that
wouldn't have expected a machine to be
able to do and it wasn't until later
that they realized oh actually the
machine isn't doing the diagnosis the
machine is faxing it over to a team of
doctors in India who's doing the
diagnosis and then sending back the
results now some people might say ha
that that's clearly not machine learning
as long as the interface was well
encapsulated we don't really care about
the implementation right at least that's
what we always tell ourselves but this
is still I mean how many of you have
used WebMD to diagnose an illness how
many of you have seen legalzoom.com
right these are websites that
specifically geared to be able to do
some of the things that doctors and
lawyers did for a long time it was
common for you for you to have a family
lawyer if you needed to draw up the will
you needed to draw up a contract
whatever you would contact your family
lawyer they would write the document for
you blah blah blah today you want a
quickie divorce $99 an illegal zoom comm
subscription and you're on your way
happy divorce so question comes up
frequently well how do we stop this how
do we make this not happen and the
answer is we can't the machines are
slowly taking over so what do we do well
in keeping with the Battlestar Galactica
theme we evolve we grow we take a
different path rather than trying to
compete with the Machine on what it does
do you know this guy is not the guy by
name but this is the guy that works in
your company that had that one brilliant
idea years ago and now he's paid simply
to sit there and stare out the window to
hopefully come up with another brilliant
idea that will make millions and
millions and millions of dollars
anybody can in fact be him there's a
story at Intel how many of you have seen
in the Intel television commercial right
and you know if I do do do you guys know
that right that particular sequence of
tones that actually almost never came to
be my wife was working at Intel as a
matter of fact during the days when they
first rolled that out and that was
actually something of a lark there was a
marketing executive inside of Intel who
had this brilliant idea to play those
sequence of tones as a part of every
Intel commercial to establish it as kind
of an audio cue that yes this is an
Intel thing and most of the rest of the
marketing department thought it was the
dumbest idea ever had they actually
wanted to go with the theme that they
were rolling out for that year's
Superbowl commercial but back when they
were highlighting the Pentium chip which
was all those engineers in the brightly
colored dry suits that's right rabbit
bunny suits right the ones you work on
when you're in
clean room so they had a commercial
going where these people are all dancing
the disco music in this bright yellow
pink blue etc which one survived
the marketing exact that had the idea of
the tones which everybody said this is
the stupidest idea ever
that guy is made man at Intel he is
literally paid to do nothing other than
think and more importantly to our
discussion
he will never be fired he will never be
let go because he had that idea which is
now so deeply embedded into Intel's
marketing campaigns everywhere they even
play those five tones on other people's
commercials just to let you know that
it's an Intel chip inside there just to
bring the notion that Intel is what you
want back to your consciousness it's a
beautiful bit of brand marketing anybody
can do that
anybody can have that kind of an idea I
don't mean that you're gonna come up
with the next great marketing scheme but
anybody can do something which will be
the perfect solution that solves a
particular problem that we have right
now anybody can be an iconoclast person
who does something that others say
cannot be done iconoclasm actually
derives from the term given to leo the
third he was actually Holy Roman Emperor
and if you don't remember your history
remember that the Holy Roman Empire was
actually established in Constantinople
was actually the eastern Roman Empire
cuz you know Rome by this point it sort
of fallen into basically barbarian chaos
and in 725 ad leo was being crowned now
you got to understand that back in those
days the church was a very very powerful
figure in politics and as a matter of
fact it was not uncommon for kings and
emperors and so forth to be crowned by a
member of the church an archbishop or if
you were big enough right maybe the Pope
himself the implication being that the
church is giving you your secular power
the church therefore has the power to
take it away be a good boy and do as the
church
matter of fact this was reinforced when
you go to the man's throne room when you
look at his throne above him or all the
symbols of the church again the
symbolism here is pretty heavy you are
here by virtue of what the church gives
you therefore be a good boy do as the
church wants and Leo like many of his
contemporaries actually resented all of
this power that the church wielded in
terms of his political story so he
actually literally got up on his throne
and tore those icons off the throne and
thus he became known as the destroyer of
icons the first iconoclast there have
been a number of people that have
actually destroyed these icons these
notions that no you can't do that that's
that's simply not possible we're gonna
talk about a number of them now some of
these names you may recognize and some
of them you may recognize but not
necessarily from this particular context
and in many cases there are lots of
iconoclasts who have made the world
better those are the ones we're going to
focus on there are also a few
iconoclasts who have made the world
worse and no I will not be making Trump
jokes during this particular
presentation there's a couple of
iconoclasts from within our industry of
course one of the big ones would be
linus torvalds who have released an
operating system out into the public
back in a time when everybody thought
operating systems required millions of
man months and millions of dollars in
order to ship but Alan Kay created small
talk created the Dynabook the first
portable computer the mouse there's a
lot of things that came out of Xerox
PARC that Kay had his hands in Dave
Thomas of course Ruby Dave Ruby Dave was
one of the first persons to be talking
about naked objects later he really
socialized Ruby to the rest of the
industry and then of course he and Andy
Hunt decided to go off and make
themselves a publishing company which
gives us the pragmatic press Edward
Dykstra Robin Milne there are a bunch of
these folks have done things that people
said no you can't really make that
happen
now your goal very simply is to become
an iconic class because very bluntly if
you can do things that others say simply
can't be done that is a very rare rare
skill and if you can acquire that if you
can deliver on that the company will go
to great lengths to try to hold on to
you for as long as you choose to be
there because this is something that no
machine can accomplish I don't care how
many lines of code a compiler can
synthesize compiler is literally built
with ideas of what can and cannot be
done if you can come up with a way of
doing things from programmatic
perspective that a compiler can't well
then by definition we don't want to lose
you you're like useful the Econo class
sees three different things sorry three
different things go into becoming an
iconoclast number one you see the world
differently you've got a different
perspective a different view the second
is you overcome the fear that comes
along with being an iconoclast and third
you exercise what's known as social
intelligence okay great what does that
mean what are those things mean
well for starters let's talk about your
brain your brain is highly energy
constrained device look up seriously
look up you see the lights up there they
actually take more power than your brain
does brain operates on about 40 watts of
power
you my friend are literally the dimmest
bulb in the room seriously
the brain wants to be able to do all of
this processing but it's only got about
40 watts of power to work with so in
order to maximize the efficiency it
takes a large number of shortcuts for
example when I show you this picture
here what do you see how many of you see
three black circles okay how many of you
see like a triangle with a white border
on it how many of you see a gray
triangle there in the center yeah guess
what you're all wrong
that's three pack men and three htm'
Tagg symbols how do I know that because
I drew the silly thing and I can tell
you for certain that there were no
circles and triangles involved here
what's happening here is your brain is
taking shortcuts your brain is
specifically looking at patterns and
saying oh yeah
I know what this is it looks very very
similar to other forms of this that I've
seen in the past and therefore it's
interpreting it immediately as one of
those things that realization about
psychology it means that because the
brain is exercising all of this pattern
recognition and then feeding the results
to your brain it means that perception
what we perceive what we recognize when
we're looking at things is a matter of
the brain it's not a question of your
eyes lying to you it is absolutely
sending all the same visual information
each time your brain is taking these
shortcuts long before you ever
consciously realize it is but perception
is a matter of the brain not your eyes
how many of you have seen this optical
illusion before a fair number of you
right the optical illusion is of course
if I ask you which of these two
horizontal lines is longer your answer
is of course neither you know that
because you've seen this before you know
that both of these are in fact the exact
same length and as a matter of fact if
you do the finger thing you know from
the slide you can actually prove to
yourself that they are in fact the same
length the bigger question is why why do
you look at this photo and immediately
assume that the top one is longer than
the bottom one why does your brain kick
in to give you that erroneous perception
well many of us have stood in the center
of a railway watching the rail lines
converge off into the distance
many of us have stood at the base of a
tall building and watched the building
appear to slope to a point at some point
in the distance
and all of us that have witnessed that
understand that there is this concept of
perspective that where you sit where you
stand watching things as we go off into
the distance they appear to converge
even though they're actually parallel
because perspective that's just the way
the world works and I can prove to you
that this is the case because when I
show you this picture you have
absolutely no problem whatsoever seeing
that those two lines are in fact the
same length now your brain doesn't
really like this picture because it's
actually requiring a little bit more
energy to try to parse what's going on
here your brain looks at the first one
and says oh yeah I know exactly what
this is you bet these are two things
converging into the distance not a
problem
your brain looks at this and goes would
what what I mean you've never seen
railroad lines do that and and if you
see a building that does that something
really really bad has happened or you're
in Orlando there's actually an
upside-down building in Orlando it's a
science museum yeah a couple people have
been there they're nodding it's fun
place you should go but here because
your brain is taking those extra steps
using those extra precious watts of
power to perceive what's going on here
you get a more accurate perception these
two are in fact parallel and it's really
easy to spot it's all about your brain
the most likely way we perceive
something will be in a manner consistent
with your past experience make sense
what happens when you see this picture
immediately you recognize this exactly
for what it is this is a picture of the
old mainframe applications that we used
to build write dumb terminal talking to
a mainframe talking to a bunch of
comma-separated value or tab separated
by old flat files right some of you're
like no dude no no no no clearly this is
a client-server application where the
client is talking to the server which
talks to a relational database there's
others of you that are saying gulps come
on man that is the web browser talking
to a web server talking
to some form of data storage back there
and still others alike now come on
that's a mobile app talking to an API
talking to the server and there's a
couple of you that are thinking how did
he get a hold of our top secrets
architectural diagram this by the way is
the universal architectural diagram
which I call box arrow box arrow
cylinder it works for any project and if
you don't believe me the next time you
interview somewhere just tell them the
look this is the architecture that I
know you're working on and you draw
those out and they'll be like you're
hired because I don't know how you
guessed the answer this is the universal
software architecture diagram now the
beautiful part about this is it applies
everywhere regardless of details the bad
part of this is when somebody stands up
and draws this on a whiteboard your
reaction is oh I already recognized this
I know what you are doing you're working
on a project that was exactly the same
as the one I just got off of because the
brain looks at that says I already know
what's there and I don't need to look at
any of the other details I'm good
thank you you guys know who this is
he's a Seattle favorite maybe you don't
recognize him by sight
but you might recognize some of his work
this is Dale Chihuly and he is probably
the most successful artist not just in
terms of the glassblowing space but in
terms of art Dale Chihuly is a to say
he's rich is ridiculously understating
the case Chihuly is he's an icon now in
the decorative glass space the studio
has about a hundred some-odd people
churning out pieces if you go into fancy
buildings in some cases if you take a
cruise it's very likely if you see a lot
of curlicue style glass it's very likely
at your hooli studio piece he is one of
the few American artists in history to
have a show at the Louvre now think
about that for just a second we all know
what the French feel about
Americans and this is the Louvre right
this is this is the place where France
like shows off all of their stuff and
you know for them to actually not only
allow an American to show at the Louvre
but to actually give him a solo space
yeah that's a pretty big deal each one
of his glass pieces go anywhere from
25,000 to over a million dollars and all
of this because he lost an eye see
Chihuly he he was hanging out somewhere
in the California beaches surfing and he
got into an accident which actually I
think the surfboard hit him in the eye
or something which damaged this sight
out of that particular eye now if you've
never done decorative glass one of the
things to understand is basically you
get a long steel straw and you go into
the molten molten glass and you swirl it
and then you pull it out and then this
straw is actually hollow and you blow
into that and that creates a bubble and
then you cap it you work with it and so
forth I've done a little glassblowing
just for fun but because you're
constantly spinning it you're
essentially looking for symmetry because
trying to do something asymmetrical is
really really difficult
and prior to Chihuly all decorative
glass was assumed to be symmetrical just
that was kind of a given
well if you don't have both eyes it's
actually really hard to perceive depth
and depth is necessary in a 3d piece in
order to decide whether or not you've
achieved symmetry so Chihuly while he
was recovering from the fact that he
lost the use basically of one eye he
actually got into a car accident and
lost the use of one arm for a short
period of time as well so now the dudes
like clearly you know up the proverbial
estuary without the proper means of
locomotion so he's sitting around and
he's like you know what because you
really do need both hands you can't
one-armed this it's just it's not
possible so Julie said you know what
screw it I can't do perfectly
symmetrical glass it's just I simply
don't have the capability anymore so I'm
not even going to try
I'm actually gonna start doing
asymmetrical pieces and see where that
gets me and you know we go back for a
second here eh
those are gorgeous be that I mentioned
that he sells each one of those for
almost a million bucks a pop
I'd say it's worked out for him now had
he not lost that eye would he have ever
actually said screw it I'm not gonna go
for symmetry no do you know how this is
believe it or not you owe your life to
this woman her name is Florence
Nightingale and Florence Nightingale is
known for many things number one
starting the concept of Nursing back in
the day nurse you know of nurses were
really just women that assisted doctors
when they were doing things she actually
started the concept of Nursing being its
own medical profession but more
importantly in 1854 particularly
supposedly a lot of this was happening
while the British were engaged in a lot
of their colonial wars Nightingale
observed that more soldiers were dying
while in the surgery tents than they
were in battle as a matter of fact it
was very common for soldiers not to
report injuries because your survival
chances on the battlefield with an
injury were still better than your
survival chances of going into the
surgical tent and receiving medical care
and one of the things that Nightingale
noticed was that actually those soldiers
who were worked on by doctors who had
washed their hands first actually had a
much better survival rate than those
that didn't now bear in mind in the
1850s the doctor the surgeon who was
working on you to dig out the bullet
that had been shot into you was also
very likely the guy who cut your hair
because of familiarity with sharp things
meant you should be good for both
cutting hair and surgery so Florence
Nightingale basically went to the
various medical communities and said hey
if you guys wash your hands you'll
actually get a better survival rate and
the doctors all said Yeah right
you're just a woman what
you know okay sexism aside for just a
second because you know we were really
stupid back then she wasn't getting
anywhere convincing these doctors of her
facts so she went to Queen Victoria who
was something of an iconoclast in her
own right and she said look this is
what's happening and the Queen
supposedly said well yes but men die in
battle and Florence Nightingale as
legend holds sat down and drew a picture
specifically she drew a pie chart that
said this is the percentage of people
who are dying on the battlefield this is
the rest of them that are dying in the
surgical tent and Queen Victoria went oh
I get it now and established a
monarchical rule basically that yes if
you're going to be a doctor in the
British Army you must wash your hands
before you perform surgery and doctors
can't very well go against what the
Queen commands and discovered lo and
behold that yes their patients were
actually surviving she Florence
Nightingale brought this attention to a
basic medical fact and that in turn
started the medical industries
fascination obsession with making sure
that everything is clean before they cut
you open and start digging around
iconoclasts see the world differently
now as we've already established this is
not a question of what your eyes report
to your brain it's a question of what
your brain interprets it's a question of
how you perceive perception as a matter
of the brain which means anybody can
change your perception at any time if
you are open to it and there's all sorts
of different strategies to do this quite
frankly what what you choose to perceive
differently will be will depend in many
cases on what you're trying to perceive
so on and so forth but even assuming
assuming that you figure out the magic
secret to change your perception which I
haven't found by the way that's not
enough
it's not enough to just see things
differently you also have to act and
that action is what leads to the second
do you know who this is yes this is the
Dixie Chicks for those of you who are
not country-and-western fans this is
actually one of the more popular bands
back in 2000 2001 timeframe the Dixie
Chicks as a matter of fact they were so
popular that pretty much any album they
threw out there Mediate bestseller
platinum five times over kind of thing
the Dixie Chicks were out of concerts
specifically they were at a concert in
the UK and Natalie Maines who is the
lead singer she was during a break
between one of the two of their songs
she was you know calling out to this
group of UK fans that loved them and
said quote we are ashamed the President
of the United States George Bush at the
time is from Texas now got to remember
that this was during the early stages of
America's war with Iraq right we had
gone into Afghanistan we've gone into
Iraq we were supposedly pursuing those
that had flown the planes into the World
Trade Center and so on and so forth
which was not particularly popular over
here because we've gone basically
unilaterally we had gone without really
establishing just cause this is the
whole weapons of mass destruction you
know Colin Powell supposedly we have
evidence blah blah blah do a lot of
people this was not a controversial
statement but to a lot of people it
really was they received death threats
and these were not these were not death
threats that were of the sort of if I
ever see you in a bar in my hometown I'm
totally gonna kick your ass no these
were threats like you will be shot dead
at your show in Dallas those are the
kinds of death threats the police take
pretty seriously they set up
round-the-clock protection details as a
matter of fact there's a story of a
teller or a radio station van you know
they've got these vans that drive around
to various locations to offer you know
giveaways and all that good stuff
because it had the Dixie Chicks painted
on the side of the van one of these
radio station van drivers reported that
somebody pulled up next to him on the
freeway and pointed a shotgun
simply because they had the Dixie Chicks
on the side of the van because you do
not insult the President of the United
States this was a necessary war it was a
really really hot bed of political
discussion within the US but first thing
you don't do is you don't insult the
flag we're having similar kinds of
discussions today with NFL players
kneeling for the the national anthem and
so forth all of this because Natalie
Maines stood up and said we are ashamed
the President of the United States is
from Texas Maine's never recanted her
statement she never apologized and as a
results the next album that the Dixie
Chicks cut plummeted on the charts now
part of the thing to understand about
radios radio station charts is that they
are measured by the amounts of
popularity in terms of how many times
have these songs been played on the
radio if it doesn't get played doesn't
really count and the interesting thing
about this is their album was the number
one download on iTunes shortly after
came out 2006 so this is about three
years later so the radio stations are
afraid to play the music even though
lots and lots of people are downloading
it individually it wasn't that the Dixie
Chicks were a bad band it was that
everybody was skittish she literally
with that one statement
she literally risked everything that
they had built in terms of their band in
terms of their album sales in terms of
their following think about that with
one sentence you jeopardize everything
that you have spent years trying to
build in terms of your career
that's fear there's an interesting
psychological problem that helps
describe some of the fear that we might
feed imagine for a moment that I have
two urns two vases two jars etc and in
this one over here I put nine white
marbles and nine black marbles just
don't drop them in so it's pretty well
random over there I haven't earned
similarly mixed but with unknown
quantities we don't know how many white
and how many black marbles we know
there's eighteen but I'm not telling you
which one or what the preparations are
the proportions of the race you are
right so nine and nine unknown and
unknown mr.north please stand up for
just a second I'm going to pick on you
because I know you then I want you to
pick out a white marble which of these
urns do you use
so you're gonna go with this one to pull
out a white marble okay fair enough hold
on to that thought for a second now
same question except I want you to pull
out a black marble which urn do you
choose okay and mr. north you know I
love you right you're an idiot
but here's the rationale why if we
assume Dan said I know there's at least
some white marbles over here and he used
the same rationalization I know there
are some black marbles over here by
definition what he's saying is I believe
that there's going to be more white
marbles or a better chance of pulling
out a white marble from over here than
it is from over here therefore I believe
there are more black marbles than there
are white marbles in this one therefore
if this is the best urn from which to
pull a white marble this would be the
best one to pull out a black marble now
interestingly enough why you're not the
first person to come up with this
rationalization I know what's over here
I don't know what's over here and this
is at the heart of what psychologists
refer to hello I already did that this
is what's referred to as the Ellsberg
paradox thank you Dan yeah the Ellsberg
paradox basically what's happening here
is you are making this decision based on
your fear or the very root case of the
ambiguity of what you don't know dan
said it he said I know that there are a
certain proportion of marbles over here
so I'm gonna go with the known even
though the possibility may exist that
the unknown stands a better chance this
happens to us a lot how many of you will
choose to drive home the same way every
time from work even though with some
experimentation you might discover a
faster way have you ever been in a case
where you're driving down the road and
you see everybody getting off at an
off-ramp and you say gosh I wonder what
they know that I
don't it turns out that this is
basically some leftover herd mentality
if you walk up to the restaurant or you
walk up to the side of the building and
you see a whole bunch of people standing
in line at that restaurant and this one
is empty what did they know that I don't
what's what's going on over there what's
going on in this unknown space unknown
bad bad means go with the known even
though you may find out later that that
restaurant over there just open and it
turns out their food is worse and all of
those people are going to be sick and
this one over here well nobody likes
Indian food so nobody's eating there or
whatever right there could be all kinds
of reasons legitimate reasons for why
one versus the other
but when you're just standing there and
you're looking at what your brain is
telling you and no one versus unknown
yeah that feels weird we don't like
ambiguity we fight it how many of you
recognize this craft how about you know
what my name what's the name it's a
space shuttle yeah but it turns out that
we're about a half a dozen of them which
one is it how about if I show you this
photo now you know which one it is right
many of us do many of us Americans I was
actually sitting in ninth grade English
class when the Challenger went up and
this was one of those marked moments
there are certain moments in your life
when you know exactly where you were and
what you were doing when you received
really really like I popping bad news
the Challenger was destroyed because of
a failure of the o-rings that were
supposed to seal off the fuel tanks and
of course the o-rings as we now know
froze which meant they lost their
flexibility which meant a gap was opened
up allowing super superheated flame to
escape the side booster rocket and
ignite the central tank and blow up the
entire chow
now interestingly enough the subsequent
investigation headed by dr. richard
fineman
re was a part of not in charge of the
failure probably began with the faulty
design of its joint and increased as
both NASA and contractor management
first failed to recognize that as a
problem then failed to fix it
and finally treated it as an acceptable
flight risk think about this for just a
moment I tell you and you believe me
because I have some credibility in these
matters for whatever reason I tell you
that there is a flaw in your car's gas
tank and that under certain
circumstances like for example if it's
below zero Celsius as you drive your car
your car will explode how many of you
first of all say no uh no way it's not
there there's no such flaw no way and
then even when it's proving I there's
one guy in the back like I don't care I
don't care I will still drive that car
because I'm an idiot anyway the next
step is to say oh yes that flaw exists
but it would cost way too much money to
fix it and then you say but you know
what it's an acceptable driving risk
it's right up there with getting t-boned
at an intersection it's okay I know what
I'm doing and besides right I I'm I'm an
astronaut and we're expected to take
risks and how many of you will go
through this thought process versus say
what and that's immediately going to the
shop to be fixed replaced whatever sold
yeah how many of you think it's worth
your life to drive this car to and from
work every day but that's exactly what
happened with the Challenger these
extremely smart people sat around in a
room and convinced themselves first of
all that it it was in fact a problem no
no no there's no such problem here oh no
no I can't you know
we would never expect the shuttle to be
taking off in below zero temperatures
because in the early stages of the
program they all happen on the west
coast where it very rarely dips below
zero even in the middle of the
when they started moving to Florida
launches where it can drop below zero
that this even became a remote
possibility and then well we could fix
it but it would represent billions of
dollars of retooling and then said you
know what yes it could happen and yes it
will destroy the craft but that's just
part of the pain of going into space
this failure at NASA is a completely
repeatable one and your company is
probably doing it right now as we speak
if you've ever been part of a round of
planning poker where you look at a
feature and then all each of you writes
down a number the number of hours or the
number of widgets or the the complexity
score whatever you use to measure the
complexity of a particular feature let's
assume you're using the Fibonacci scale
there's six of you in the room and so
you say okay here's feature X and then
you say all right what did everybody
have for how long it would take two
hours three hours two hours three hours
two hours 17 hours and everyone
immediately turns to the 17 and the 17
goes no no no no no let's do this again
nope
no I was probably overthinking it I
probably was was not you know
considering let's just do another round
and now it's three hours four hours
three hours four hours three hours six
hours
okay reasonable shippin maybe you've
ever seen that this happen happens all
the time
because going against the herd is really
scary what do they know that I don't why
are they all coming up with estimates
that are two or three hours and I'm
seeing 17 why am I the only one that
holds this viewpoint why am I the only
one can see it I must be wrong
Solomon Asch by the way that guy is a
fascinating character really interesting
history and he has done some of the most
interesting psychological experiments
that we've ever seen in the science of
psychology
he had a great one where he would get
and tears to come in and sit in a room
there's like 12 people in the room
you're number 12 coming into this room
and you're seated in the very back left
corner the last seat in the room and he
shows you this picture and he says all
right which of these three lines a B or
C are the same length as this one over
here and the first person says a the
second person says a and the third
person says a fourth person says a fifth
a sixth a seventh a8 a9 a tenth a 11th a
12 a some of you even did it here why
why do you say a because everybody else
said a yes peer pressure and the
fascinating thing was when you interview
these people after the experiment in
many cases it was not just oh well
that's what everybody else said so I
figured they must have better
information or they must understand the
rules better than I did in some cases
they looked at it and said no this
really is the same length as this they
convinced themselves of this fact
now fascinating little tidbit to this
let's do the same experiment because of
course as you figured out the first 11
people are all plants they're supposed
to give the wrong answer for this
particular question but now first person
says a second person says a third person
says a fourth a fifth a sixth a seventh
a ninth C chooses the other wrong answer
10th a11 a12 now statistically speaking
you have a much better chance of
actually saying B because it's
fascinating when the entire herd agrees
it's actually very very hard to work
against that it's very very hard to step
away from that it's very hard to call
the entire herd wrong as soon as there
is some amount of dissension in the room
as soon as somebody disagrees even if
they do it for the wrong reasons even if
they disagree to the wrong answer as
soon as somebody disagrees suddenly you
feel freedom in
to do the same by the way when you do
this experiment 86% of the time if
everybody agrees on the wrong answer so
will you
86% especially if you don't realize it's
an experiment and what it's designed to
test next time you're sitting down to
planning poker next time you're sitting
around in a room and everybody's
agreeing on something disagree
deliberately and watch how many
additional disagreements come out of the
woodwork where before everybody was
willing to go yeah yeah no this make
total sense total sense as soon as you
say I'm not sure do we really really
want to host the data base inside of the
client application this really makes
sense to put a database on the phone and
then people will go well you know I had
my concerns but I figured we'd work them
out later oh yeah you're one of the A's
aren't you okay the law of large numbers
the average guess of a group of
individuals is better than anyone
individuals often better than the best
individuals guess this is actually what
we see when we start doing those marble
marbles in a jar count the number of
marbles in a jar if you look at
everybody's guesses and then average it
out the average of the guests is
actually better and closer to any one
person's guess happens remarkably often
it's incredibly incredibly common the
easily repeatable experiment it's wired
into us follow the herd breaking away
from the herd back when we were
uncivilized was literally the difference
between life and death because the herd
had figured out which water was clean
the herd had figured out where the food
was the heart there was a time when
banishment exile from the community was
literally the same as a death sentence
without having to actually hurt anybody
so the idea is to get emotions out of it
completely right just do what this guy
does now because it turns out you need
the emotions in which to make decisions
you need to there are experiments where
people who have had the emotional
centers of their brain damaged who
literally cannot make a decision even if
it's just
what time should you come in for your
next appointment this is well-documented
in psychological history we need
emotions in order to be able to make
those decisions the Econo class feels
fear like anyone else they simply
refused to allow fear to dominate their
actions or responses and this is hard
the last thing you need to do is you
need to be socially intelligent do you
know who this is
David Hannah Mayer Hanson DHH creator of
rails that particular slide came from a
presentation that he was giving where he
was talking about the next version of
rails at the time rails 3 where he was
actually talking about what features
rails were going to have and the
community had submitted all of these
suggestions and his response was that
literally I know better than you so get
off of my long rails will be what I want
it to be and will not be swayed one way
or the other now he's done a lot of good
things but one of the things we don't
see is we don't see DHH at a lot of
conferences why is that well because it
turns out a lot of people don't like him
they really don't similar story this guy
here he invented FM radio now how many
believe FM is better than am show of
hands yeah most people agree with that
right FM however at the time when it was
invented a.m. was the established
standard and when he went out and proved
it his buddy these guys were on speaking
terms his buddy was president of RCA
which was heavily invested in a.m. and
Sarnoff deliberately sent his engineers
out to write papers and to create
technical situations in which a.m. was
considered the technologically inferior
solution and Armstrong proved over and
over and over again that FM was better
and still this guy basically said you're
a crackpot you don't know what you're
doing and he died penniless and alone
because he never actually got to see FM
takeoff shortly after he died the other
media companies the other radio station
companies slowly converted over to FM
and
till today it is basically the dominant
radio technology but he could never get
anybody to believe him
you need people to understand what
you're seeing but more importantly you
need to exercise what's called social
intelligence to get them to buy into
your vision if you see it right and if
you're willing to face the fear it's all
for naught unless other people jump onto
the bandwagon with you two painters both
of them generally considered great
masters Picasso and Van Gogh Picasso
rich admired matter of fact Picasso was
one of those guys who always wanted to
have at your parties he was he was just
absolutely fascinating character
everybody loved him he was very
vivacious very interactive Van Gogh cut
off part of his ear and sent it to his
would-be girlfriend just the kind of guy
you want to have at your party right
both of these were considered master
painters one knew how to exercise social
intelligence the other did not social
intelligence consists of two basic
things one is familiarity and the other
is reputation familiarity is how well do
you immediately recognize that guy you
know who that is and if you say severus
snape you don't win alan rickman
absolutely for years Rickman up until
the harry potter trilogy Rickman was one
of those that guys set of actors that
you recognized but you never could
remember his name the brain likes
familiarity it likes seeing things that
it can recognize over and over and over
again which is why these actors are
frequently seen but you can never
remember them until they land that one
breakout role within the social
intelligence world there's this concept
of called shadow networks networks of
people networks of groups tribes if you
will that all know each other and can
communicate with one each other they
recognize one another this environment
is one such tribe there are people like
Dan that you see it a number of these
engagements you're like oh yeah
I know that guy I want to go to that
guy's talk because he's brilliant
probably because he agrees with
everything I think right because the
people who are smart are the ones that
agree with you you've all noticed that
before right right go like this see
you're also smart your reputation
particularly for that of offering up a
fair deal in these networks is
absolutely critical to being able to
leverage people to get people to agree
with what you're saying
the combination familiarity and
reputational it allows you to connect
with people and get them to eventually
believe in you and therefore believe in
your vision the iconoclast is somebody
that will never be replaced by any
particular technology or by any
particular tool if you can become an
iconoclast if you can see the world
differently if you can stare down your
fears and if you can leverage social
intelligence to get your message out you
will be one of those people that your
company would never even think to get
rid of the end
that was awesome thank you so much I
know I went a little long my apologies
but I know you did it stranding a lot of
material to try to cram into 50 minutes
I know that's and you did a great job so
thank you for that if you have any
questions for Ted
stick around he'll be able to answer
them right out there otherwise next talk
start in about 15 minutes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
