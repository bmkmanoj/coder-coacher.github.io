means that i work in mobile all day
which means i'm not very productive but
just bear with me so i know has taught
us the first rule of productivity and
that's to delegate i basically found out
about this yesterday so which also
brings me to my next point if you're
going to give a presentation don't drink
too much the night before so I've
basically broken every rule okay so the
other day should not really the other
day so last year I used to work for a
start-up and we were really productive
we got all kinds of stuff done and now i
work for adobe which doesn't mean that
I'm not productive but it's kind of
interesting so we we've got the really
large kind of layer of management and
management's always trying to be more
productive and they're always coming up
with different ways to like be more
effective in their jobs so they had this
long email thread about the tools they
use to manage all the tasks that they
have and some people have really
elaborate setup so I was blown away
there were guys that are using issue
trackers in order to manage your own
personal time and you know other people
were doing things like they had a
combination of a wiki and they were
using different types of to-do apps and
basically it looked like their whole
productivity was managing the tools to
manage themselves and some of them is
like what are you using Brian I use a
text file called to do and I keep it in
a private github repo that's what I do
so text files are kind of awesome it's a
useful productivity tool that's not
really what I wanted to talk to you guys
about so is anyone here heard of the
agile release train before nobody's
heard of the agile release train way one
guy says yet a couple people have heard
of it so we ship software on a regular
basis in the Apache Cordova project and
it's a little bit different than how
most software project ship and that's
kind of what I wanted to talk to you
guys about so in the Apache Cordova and
phonegap projects we ship we ship a
version every month and so versioning is
a tricky thing because version numbers
when you think about it the only
the version number actually exists is so
that you have an issue to look at in
your issue tracker phonegap when we
first released it we didn't build
something we weren't like hey let's go
build some software that fixes mobile no
we were like hey let's hack on mobile it
looks like it's pretty cool and we've
released it and we added a version
number because we thought that would be
cool too we didn't add it because we
thought we knew what we were doing and
we ended up on version point eight I
think in 2008 and we were still on
version point eight in 2009 and it
wasn't because we didn't want to ship
new stuff we were always shipping new
stuff on master but we just weren't
incrementing our releases and this
turned into version hell because someone
would be like I have a bug and we'd be
like what is it I can't reproduce it
what version are you Oh No so we
realized that you know version numbers
are really important for tracking issues
and in mobile it's especially important
because we're playing a game of cat and
mouse against all these different
vendors so we're working with software
that's being shipped by Apple but by
Google being shipped by Microsoft being
shipped by all these different vendors
and and when they ship well they usually
have long beta cycles like everyone here
got to enjoy android 4.0 beta right no
so they drop this software and they
basically break absolutely everything
and then all your users are super pissed
and it's your fault when Google drop
mountain lion we had a guy who logged an
issue in our issue tracker he's like
PhoneGap broken mountain lion amateur
hour and my response was it released
half an hour ago dude I think give us a
bit of time so a version number is
really important you need them to track
your issues and you need them basically
to organize your sprints the other thing
version numbers are good for of course
the bugs so we realized that not
shipping new versions was probably the
wrong thing to do and then we as all
software developers decide to do exactly
the opposite so we start shipping all
the time and we start shipping versions
as quickly as possible because we have
so many different platforms weren't able
to ship all these different versions
super fast so we we sort of settled on a
one-month release schedule so once a
month we ship minor version so we do
now I think we're on 2.1 and 2.2 will
come out at the end of October and then
if we have any bugs along the way we'll
ship patches as quickly as we can and
this is really work to our favor so in
iOS 5.1 Apple broke local storage in the
web browser they said that the spec was
ambiguous so local storage sometimes
will just delete the cache so that's
interesting that they said the spec was
ambiguous persistent storage that
sometimes isn't persistent whatever so
our users were pissed they were like
PhoneGap sucks you guys broke local
storage we're like well actually Apple
broke it that was in the middle of a
release cycle and when we landed on that
bug we immediately stopped all work on
features and we just shipped a patch and
we did that like in two days and Apple
actually incorporated that back into iOS
6 which is cool but even better we
didn't have this sort of obsession with
the features that we had for that
particular release instead we adapted to
the market forces that were around us
and we shipped to fix and we made our
users happy had we been focusing on just
the features for that release our users
would have been pissed because their
data wouldn't be saved on their their
users phones so having a fast cadence
and focusing on these bugs has actually
made our user community come to rely on
us they know that we're always going to
be working in their favor and not just
for our larger release cycle and this is
kind of like it's a great picture right
like what could possibly have happened
in that picture that was me last night
no so cadence so you're shipping all the
time and this is great we also decoupled
our marketing activity from when we
release software this is something that
Adobe still coming to grips with because
they're used to shipping physical media
but we're not we're shipping you know
bits and we're shipping open source code
we don't have we had a phonegap day us
on July twentieth where we shipped 2
point 0 and we had this big event we
talked all about all the features we
worked on and we shipped on that day we
shipped a minute that we wanted to ship
and the way that we did that is that we
picked that date to ship those features
and those features that didn't fit we
put it in 2.1
really simple and so this is like really
shocking to management they're like well
what are you going to talk about for two
point oh what we talked about all the
stuff we did between one and two and
that was a lot of stuff that was a whole
year we basically should be a point
release every month and so we get all
these different point releases out we
talked about the year we can still make
noise and we don't have a couple our
marketing activity our developers don't
have to work you know 20 hour days and
weekends get sick and then start
shipping shitty code so cadence is
really important because its momentum we
in our industry we always talk about
sprints and it kind of annoys me because
software development is not a sprint
it's a marathon your software is never
done you're always going to be working
on software as a professional and if
you're not then you're probably out of
business so I got</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
