was introduced before I work for solando
a previously work for Google from the
test engineering side one difference
that I saw when I removed with solando
is that we needed to change the whole
system of how we work together how we
make software and I'm going to discuss
that in details with you for many of you
don't know what the landowners that is
solando and we are placed in all these
countries and we moved from Germany
Austria Switzerland to Spain France
Netherlands Belgium Italy UK Poland and
the Nordics this is where we are placed
we have 15 countries so now a question
to the audience how many of you have
shopped on till and oh wow great at
least some hands there how many of you
have heard of solando great now you've
heard of it but previously okay have you
heard that we have a web page for UK
because mostly we are here and nobody
knows about us insolent of in UK
greatest sounds great great things
please go shop there also we have mobile
app everybody has we also have it please
shop there it's really amazing we need
some more traffic from UK going further
i'm going to show you drop some numbers
here just to bring some perspective 15
countries that that already three
fulfillment centers all in germany
there's a big thing that came up today
we are doing a single day delivery in
some parts of germany and we won't
expand it to other parts of the world
other things they are 16 million
customers active customers UK population
can double that number i guess more than
2.2 billion revenue visits per month and
employees it's surprising to see that we
have 8,000 employees and more because we
have a logistics center and a warehouse
where we have lots of employees out of
these are at least a nine hundred two
thousand tech employees and we all play
based in Berlin Dublin and Helsinki
please visit us this is how the shop
looks from let's say from a very
animated nice picture drawn by one of my
colleagues at zalando really happy our
customers are very happy we have the
satisfaction index really high I don't
have the numbers I know it's really high
UK page I won't have a general neutral
and then the only way I can put that is
kids up here so please visit this you
can find a lot of stuff for kids as well
and men and women back end doesn't look
that nice it's gray it's um something's
broken something fixed some things still
in progress and there's a picture that
that's probably a few years ago I also
want to show you that the the old
picture where our systems are connected
services connected in certain way we had
soap for basic messaging services we had
logistics center our own software
running on the Centers huge database yes
it was complicated some point in time
was not it was not something that we
could take further evolution every
company does it be started in 2008 we
evolved there's a funny picture here
that we put together we started with PHP
MySQL let's say like every other
open-source e-commerce company does we
started with Magento we moved on rebuilt
everything with Java used all sorts of
technologies to make sure that we are
one stack we moved on became Jedi
Knights because we had huge number of
technologies huge number of languages
and tools that we started using at one
point in time it was getting very
difficult to manage the next picture is
really funny we didn't want to be on the
dark side anymore we wanted to be on the
other side as obi-wan Kenobi says it
takes strength to resist the dark side
only the weak and braise it the thing
that we had before was probably week the
systems were not very efficient we want
to move further again an old picture
most of our stack looked like that but
business logic almost never
every place we had thousands of Java
classes we had undocumented features we
had stuff which was kind of colors
spaghetti code engineers were kind of
afraid to touch one part of it because
they don't know what's going to break
and who's going to complain which which
business unit is going to come and say
hey who touched that code who broke this
thing it was getting very complicated
one point in time single deployment
on-premise data centers everything
following one stack bad bad picture 2014
we were a fashion company and until then
we were also known to be selling shoes
so if somebody talk about zalando it's
all yeah shoes so if i if i go to my
family and say you know what or my
friends my family is not here but my
friends they say solando Oh shoes and
you have huge warehouse but then this
bin came now when we said we don't want
to be a fashion company oh yes we are
but I want to be a tech company that
provides fashion as a service the
paradigm shift had to happen because
we're all moving towards providing
services platform software sorry
platform software and fashion as a
service the whole thing needed to change
definitely because we wanted to create
an environment where everybody can work
on different systems independently in
autonomously moving on the goal that we
had in 2015 was to deliver amazing
products efficiently and to make sure
that we feel great about it every
engineer every product specialist
everybody in the company feels great
about it this was a theory that our vp
Eric Bowman have joined us in last year
in September came up with saying well
guys we need to ramp up everything we
need to move this faster how do we be
efficient with scale and feel great
about it these are three different
components there's one technical part of
it and there's one non technical part of
it that's when I come into picture we
want to change of course a change on the
organization level a change that
restructures the company completely
every change is difficult to handle
every change disrupts the organization
and this change was a disruption for the
whole organization this happened in
march this year
I'm going to use the word here but then
there's a big sliding generally those
are one of her buzz words it's called
radical agility we move systems faster
the the idea here is not to have teams
that are coupled in this way and work
together in small circles but to change
them into independent autonomous
entities that can work on independent
features that they pick from product we
want to reduce complexity you want to
make it fast we wanted to make sure that
alignment happens communication happens
and then removed from a structure which
was completely closed and controlled to
a very independent open design which
means we had to move from one on a tick
to microservice there's also calling for
a new leadership pattern and this is
what I was talking about before we
wanted to divide the whole leadership in
to deliver leadership and people
leadership we're talking about
efficiency we're talking about great
products we're talking about having fun
at work how do we combine that when
there's one tech lead who handles
everything there's a time when detected
would probably be overwhelmed with all
these things and will not people well
himself not be efficient in that role
that was broken down you see this little
circle this big circles here these are
teams and the small circles in the happy
faces are the engineers so when we had a
model where we said the delivery lead
and people need to take care of the
teams together the difference here is
that deliberately takes care of the team
to make sure the delivery happens to
make sure that you're able to pick the
right software right tools right
technologies to produce better software
people lead to make sure that the
individuals are able to work better have
fun at work learn something feel
important feel valued stay in the
organization keep moving inside the
organization there's a new structure
that came up you're not blue we are
really happy and nice it's not blue but
yeah to explain that in better picture
which I downloaded yesterday I think
this shows it all we were delivering
lead on the other side where who is
joined to the team's takes care of teams
delivery process there's a people eat
who takes care of individuals
takes care that there is learning
happening that people are happy working
in a place this is a term when I say
that in dilandau probably everybody
claps but yeah this is radical agility
we have been doing around here radical
agility since mass march and its really
really been a success it's only been six
seven months now we are implementing it
and I'm assuming that it will take at
least a year or two for us to entirely
restructure ourselves in the company
it's eight thousand plus technical
people in the organization imagine the
scale so radical agility happened what
happens with radical agility is an
architecture that changes we needed to
be innovative in either to be creative
we needed to have more autonomy given to
people so they can be creative now the
whole idea of being creative and
innovative it's it's it's a very hip
thing everybody talks about it but but
at zalando this whole thing came up with
hack week a concept called heck week
okay let me ask this how many of you
know about tech weeks at zalando nobody
how many of you know about hack weeks in
general yeah that's nice so your hectic
since the landowner are a whole week but
you don't do what you're doing you just
work on different things and make sure
that there's a product at the end of the
week you pick your colleagues you pick
the team you pick the tools you pick the
technology and produce something you
could see some of them at the booth and
there's a space shoe we send even a shoe
to space a golden shoe and we don't know
what was the aim there but then yes we
could see something really productive
happening something really fun happening
people really focusing on that we could
even see people coming in trap at nine
leaving at seven and working together in
teams imagine a workplace that gives you
hack week environment all through the
year that is something we want to do and
that's why we came up with this radical
agility so going by that we also need to
change the architecture moving from
monolithic one's tagged more than 70
deployment units running through we want
to change that to go to API first but
API first we mean that we want all all
the eps to be one format written mostly
in swagger you want to make sure that we
follow
predefined guidelines it's not mandatory
but at least it's good to know what
guidelines exist we also want to make
sure that different teams should work in
different ways but then they all should
have one certain format that it looks
like one person is written all the EP is
and that's why we go by swagger going to
next of course we needed rest because
the architecture scalable we can take it
further it's reliable and everything
looks similar when we go by restful api
software-as-a-service a services that's
autonomous that's decoupled its
independent you can deploy them
independently make sure that libraries
are not overlapped making sure that the
libraries can be made open source at
some point in time and avoid complexity
we also wanted to make sure that we that
we can offer software as a solution as a
service solution to third parties
microservice what can I say about it I
mean we have done a lot of talks with
micro service in many of the meetups but
yes we want to make sure that micro
services are not large they are small
going by some principle i think it's by
amazon that your team should not be too
large that you cannot feed them with two
pizzas and if that's the team that works
on a micro service you get better
results we want to make sure that we
have service layers keep complexity to
macro level move fast be agile cloud we
tried out our own cloud solution
sometime in the past it was working okay
because we wanted to build us everything
ourselves I think German is known for
that build everything yourself in house
so we tried that but our vp Eric Bowman
he came and said and there are some
solutions available why don't we try
then why do you want to build everything
yourself in house and that's when we
thought of AWS and we don't want to
register yourself at AWS we are open to
other other cloud solutions as well so
yes we want to have multiple datacenters
we have currently I think three or four
data centers I have them here too in
Germany Oh No 2 in Germany a 2 in Berlin
some in Dublin and so on yeah Berlin is
in Germany by the way okay so you wanted
to go to polygon multi-frame work
environment some of the technologies
that we are working on currently this is
like just a few of them we also follow
something called tech radar if you know
about Netflix and they have this tech
radar system available we have something
called adopt SS and hold for the
technologies and these are some of them
I'm not saying these are all of them and
I'm not saying these are the first 20 of
ours but these are the frameworks
technologies tools languages that we are
using it's just to show you the
complexity of how many tools languages
people are using and how do we scale
that I can show you some examples of
three different teams here we have
platform I am and Brandon analytics
where the platform team uses closure for
its microservices uses Java for editing
and reporting nodejs for front-end and
Python for scripting on the other hand I
am users go for microservice Java for
hacking and no Jesus body fronting we
have Brandon Olympics that uses Scala
both acha and play framework for their
micro service uses Java for hacking
sorry and use this big query for the SQL
dialect so this is one thing that I want
to bring forward that we have diversity
in multiple ways managing that gets
harder and harder at a at a higher level
because everybody wants to do something
that they are interested in and then it
gets really complicated at some point in
time again radical agility how did that
help us manage this whole system one
thing that radical agility came up with
our three principles autonomy mastery
and purpose there the other way around
but doesn't matter Purple's autonomy
mastery in the right order now by
definition you you know and I'm just
going to read out the definition from
Oxford purpose means an object towards
which one strives or for which something
exists so if I as an individual know
what's my prayer
this team in this organization in this
product I know what to do autonomy comes
when yourself organized an independent
have minimum to no dependencies you come
into work you know what which you have
to take you know how to work on it you
just work produced results feel happy
one thing that I want to stress more is
mastery okay I have everything available
I'm free to choose what I want to choose
I'm free to pick the feature I want to
work on i'm free to deploy the way i
want to do it do I have the skills to do
it I want to do it but do I have the
skills to do it should I start to look
for another job to learn Scala should i
should i look for doing some open source
projects at home so i can get better at
my job and we say no we say master is
one of our principles we can provide you
the environment to work to learn and to
implement that's a nice picture also
drawn by one of our colleagues is really
really good very artistic i'm going to
read some of the text over here because
it's may be difficult to read we move
from hierarchical structure to more
independent organized work unit the aim
for this radical agility was to make
sure that we become Europe's most agile
tech company that drives innovation and
business growth through world-class
technical products for the fashion
platform so there are some buzz words
that we use innovation agile fast
consumer-centric independent fun at work
combine these together and that's what
we call radical agility we won't have to
manifest the purpose which means i
understand admission and I know why I'm
here and what I have to do nobody tells
me there's no tech lead or somebody
tells me no you're going wrong you need
to do differently I'm allowed to make my
mistakes and learn from them and show
the people how you can improve and work
further people are given the room to
learn people are given the room to make
mistakes people are given more
responsibility and that way people get
more self-organized self-managed moving
towards coaching and developing
individuals that's where master comes in
place sometimes I know engineers and in
salon de have been there for four years
and five years who've been
doing the same java development again
and again and they used to it they are
happy with it but something is missing
and they know it it just takes a little
while to talk to people and to explain
and understand what is missing and they
say you know I feel stagnant I figure
I've done a lot I've contributed enough
I'm doing the same thing but I need to
do something more than that challenge me
that's why you see would you like to try
Scala would you like to do something
else do you want to move to the platform
team do you want to do something totally
different all that is possible when I
can provide an environment for somebody
to master a skill we wanted to move from
control and command to purpose and trust
we are in control but we're not moving
out of this room but control and command
to purpose and trust basics of radical
agility I'm going to talk to you about
mastery it's only been 20 minutes almost
20 minutes but I'm towards the end of my
slide so you have a lot of time to ask
questions how did we want to make
mastery as one of our key pillars and
how do we want to move ahead with that
the inspirations comes from come from
the book their lines and we had a chance
to talk to Ben and to understand how
this framework works one thing that he
says or it's also on the website you
could look it up it's stop thinking of
employees as family or free agents and
start thinking of them as allies on a
tour of duty now to love duty is a big
word and it's a military term used for
people in the Army to go in front have a
mission succeed and come back I don't
think we can use such a term for
engineers for technical people so we
wanted to make it a little nicer and
call it your of mastery which is not any
different but by tour of mastery of
course we need to have a purpose because
that's one thing that radical agility
forces us to look into the purpose for
turf mastery is to make sure that isn't
there is an objective that disc that
describes a win-win situation for the
land oh and the engineers and employees
we're not limiting to engineers but
we're talking about all employees there
the game here okay we understand what's
again for solando of course it's got
it's got great skill great talent
first-class citizens there everything
works fine but what's again for the
employee
um what can I say a learning environment
you learn you practice you see how
you're moving further you just scale
yourself and make yourself better that's
the benefit i'm going to add few things
to myself as a skill set that I've
acquired as being a part of solando one
thing that I is people lead to tell
people that are associated with me as if
you would like to leave the land oh let
me know let me know if I can do
something for you inside the
organization otherwise take this case
you have earned and go then and that's
fine we respect your decision and that's
that's a kind of mutual trust and
understanding we need to have so pretty
picture again drawn by one of our people
leads here as every process has faces we
also had face we had instigation
execution in preparation or the other
way around initiation preparation and
execution what we did in initiation
phase and I will go to the next slide
where I can show you some pictures that
the leads talk with individuals hear and
understand aspirations understand core
values what what do you want to do what
what are your core aspirations how do
you want to go ahead as an engineer and
we have a new term or new role call a
producer who is the link between the
product team and the engineering team so
producers engineers what do you want to
do what's your aim how do you want to
proceed further intel on those terms
what do you want to do so i don't want
to hear someone saying i want to be the
best skier in the world well sorry can't
provide that but will try my best on the
other hand if your aspiration that says
I want to be an expert in in in Java 8
or Scala or want to be a cloud engineer
or work with technologies with AWS and
not of course we can do that we can talk
about this we can see how we can
allocate some time from your daily job
that you can work and improve yourself
once the talk happens we define certain
checkpoints to say ok let's understand
how do you want to take this path
further you want to learn something
great we can provide you with
environment but we also need to
understand where the milestones you want
to have do you want to complete this
whole mission or your turf mastery in
three months in six months and ten
months what's your time period but the
Londos term we say
a tour of mastery last at least 18
months to 20 months but there are people
who are fast enough to finish that in
six to eight months and that's fine it's
absolutely perfectly all right for us
tour of duty on there are the other hand
from Alliance book says that the turf of
duty stays for 24 months at least
because then you grow people slowly and
linkedin has this approach of of a tour
of duty where you have an aspiration it
could be to become a CTO of the
organization and then you take five
years of your time invest your time
little by little and grow and get better
where we wanted to make it a joy and
make it faster so he said you pick the
technology a tool or whatever you want
to learn that makes you feel better one
of my aspirations is to be a speaker and
this is one of my trainings here I'm
practicing that here i go back to solano
and say here it was good good crowd
cheered me up was nice so you're
supposed to cheer me up now alright
going further path to execution so I'm
on the pad to execution I'm executing
why my speaker skills which are not so
good but I will see the ratings later so
then we have we have certain deadlines
or checkpoints and we have certain path
that you want to do it could be
prototyping it could be working on real
tickets it could be to trying out a new
product it could be moving from one team
to the other rotation is definitely
possible it could be I don't want to be
an engineer anymore i want to be a
product specialist why not if you want
if you're thinking in terms of solando
if you're thinking in terms of how you
can improve yourself and the company
everything is possible you don't have to
look for another job we have jobs inside
of cylinder that can suffice you let me
come back to a place where we see a goal
achieved which for me would be probably
a year or two from here after speaking
in 10 or 20 conferences but yeah once I
achieve my goal be really happy it
doesn't stop there it moves on you talk
again about in new aspirations because
once a goal is achieved you're not
complete you have new and new
aspirations and you work on that and
then you go up the ladder to your
mastery and you become completely
skilled in what you want to do
so some of the results of the whole
radical agility is that we have open
source code available everywhere please
check our repositories these are just a
sample I have some more written down
here we have placed Wagner witches which
provide swagger support for play
framework we have connection which is
the Python flask framework to
automagically handle REST API requests
based on swagger please write them out
there are at least 18 20 50 of them I
don't know I didn't count them one by
one by the eight pages includes 28 per
page please look at them share your
feedback let us know how you what you're
thinking and where we can improve I want
to conclude now with final thoughts
saying radical agility something that
helped us move faster something that
made us more responsible made every
engineer feel a part of the company we
also have things that I wanted to talk
about yeah this is not an a giant lean
scrum or Kanban mythology but a whole
organization structural change I got
that from from one of my recruiters to
say that so I'm going to say that now so
it's an organization change that
combines all these methods in some way
or the other we are gel in some way or
the other via lean I can't bucket eyes
them into saying this is strictly agile
or lean or rugged I don't know but we
are moving further to a complete
organization restructure that helps us
move faster award complexity make sure
that everybody is happy and is
delivering great software and check us
out on Twitter Instagram github tech
blog jobs also available and come to our
booth we don't have so much time after
this session today is the last day but
please feel free to come to our booth
and talk to us remember to rate this
session is very important for me because
my turn of mastery is to be a public
speaker thank you so much don't go
anywhere we have some questions I'm so
it's great so how do you manage so so so
there's that there's a sense I think of
a loss of control so the question is how
do you manage all of this project work
with so many autonomous teams how do you
know what's getting done how does the
right stuff get done well we have other
teams overarching teams that take care
of things that are project management
for specific things in which five starts
when and enzmann that's completely
couple with our engineering organization
autonomous seems in a way I responsible
for what they are delivering so they
know what they're doing there it's also
there's one ready to document what they
are delivering either by an open source
or by documenting internally somewhere
and to let the project management guys
that we are on the track so that's one
way we are able to manage the whole
autonomous teams fantastic rinky hmm and
the other question got here is howdy how
will our more questions come in at
Bryant so how will you know there's a
metrics question how will you know your
new organizational structure is
efficient so you still you sit at the
beginning we are trying to build a more
efficient organization more efficient
people how will you know whether it's
efficient in terms of the org structure
and also in terms of the architecture
the system's your building well I can
just say one thing look at our open
source repository and that says it for
itself because this is one thing that
the we did not have before last mid last
year and if we are able to produce such
great open software open source
repositories for n number of things that
we are working on that's one thing that
I can definitely say we are in the right
direction we've also seen that when we
decouple leadership from teams when the
leadership only guides the team and
people are able to work by themselves
they produce amazing results they make
mistakes definitely and that's allowed
you can make mistakes because you learn
nobody's holds your hand and see if you
falter here you're going to fall rather
people say try it out fall get up walk
and that's that's something that we're
working on and it's really nice it's
working really well fantastic i'm an odd
question um so what do you do when an
employee asks for a pay rise
we give it well why shouldn't we if you
think you are the right employee if you
think you have done great job and you
deserve a raise first of it's a mistake
that we did not recognize it so we take
it on ourselves on the leadership team
second if you feel that way we do it
there's no two ways about it so if you
think that there's an industry standard
and you're getting paid lesser than that
we should definitely talk about we
should we should make sure things are
moving further we also have process in
place where we want to restructure
everything that's what we are talking
about disrupting the whole structure we
will have new payrolls we will have new
systems in place we will have new job
titles we will have probably no job
titles and everybody's called an
engineer or a lead that's all or nothing
you just you can pick your job tails
yourself we are restructuring that part
of it in the organization phase we
expect that this comes in place by mid
next to your first quarter end of next
year Robles I'm sorry more questions
coming in on rightly so so this is about
legacy so if you're asking developers
what they want to do and they're all
saying we want to do cool cloud stuff
and we want to be out there and you've
got this big pile of legacy systems that
no one really wants to work on yeah how
do you manage that imbalance right same
situation that happened in solenoids the
same situation and I can talk about it
we had this whole shop front and coupled
with the back end which one runs on
legacy code and nobody wants to touch it
nobody wants to work on it but then
there are some people who have to
maintain it and it's really pain then
there's a 50 agile mechanism we put down
a team called task force that sits
together plans the new architecture
doesn't prototyping expands it and then
we completely erase the legacy code we
just have a new build code and
everything works fine that's one way
that we're handling and it's it's and
work in progress definitely nobody wants
to work on legacy stuff but then when
you're building something new you would
also want to know how was it before so
you're going to look at it and maybe
because out of curiosity are going work
and fix something that will help us
somehow fantastic okay one more question
I let go okay um so this is a
proficiency thing so how do you make
sure enough people
the company are proficient in all of
these many many technologies that are
all coming in now right great question
you can send more questions but yeah I
can answer this one rien people leads
team are now trying to create a skills
matrix we want to see who is killed in
what and what are you what are the
people picking as a tour of mastery so
once we have this large matrix of
masters in certain skills and people who
want to learn certain skills we can
couple them and create our own internet
working so you don't have to go to a
workshop I don't want to use the name
but some workshop and learning where you
can learn from your colleagues you can
do pair programming can learn so we are
creating this whole set of skills matrix
and that that will help us understand
where where do we stand on technologies
on on languages on who is doing what and
how are we moving further cool fantastic
thank you very much any other questions
and you will put the hand up now in
which case thanks very much I thank you
thank you so much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
