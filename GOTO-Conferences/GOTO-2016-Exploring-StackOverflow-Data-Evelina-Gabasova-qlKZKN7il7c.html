questions on the app and first
disclaimer I don't have anything to do
with Stack Overflow I'm not an employee
I'm not in no way connected to Stack
Overflow I am in fact an employee of the
University of Cambridge where I work in
bioinformatics and Cambridge is very
nice this is a photo and game which is
so beautiful that I actually work here
so and my data is usually about genomes
and about human genomes about mouse
genomes and I work in cancer research
but I'm not a biologist so sometimes the
data are a bit too like complex and to
biological for me because this is for
example of data that I actually work
with it's a lot about genomes and the
human genome has three billions of base
pairs and I actually work on the level
of individual base pairs sometimes so
it's a lot of information that it's very
hard to understand so I like to play
with other data so for example I
extracted a social network of Star Wars
but today I'll be talking about stack
overflow
and why stack overflow well because we
all do this right stick overflow is the
place where you go to if you have a
question and when it answered about
programming so what kind of data are
there actually about stack overflow well
you can use our API but that's more sort
of for integrating stack overflow into
your own applications but luckily for me
as a data scientist and machine learning
person stack overflow actually publishes
every three months a dump of the entire
data that are on stack overflow so you
can just go and download it so that's
amazing and that basically just
encourages people to play with the data
themselves and explore what's out there
so I actually downloaded this data this
is just you know come online when I
looking at how large data are and
overall it's about 135 gigabytes of data
is that big data well it doesn't fit
into memory on my laptop but it does fit
into memory on my desktop at work so I
wouldn't say it's really big data it's
big data enough so that you don't do
most of the analysis on all up top but
also another point is that if you have
large enough RAM a lot of problems that
you might have with big data just
disappear you don't have to use any like
cloud-based solutions you don't have to
use spark or in F sharp I would use
embrace etc you can just load everything
into the memory and that's it
so I wouldn't say this is B data but
what can we do with it and at work
sometimes colleague comes and they give
me like a no to hard drives 4 terabytes
saying ok here is data tell me something
about it and I'm like what should I do
with it and they're like well the page
that will tell us right the point is the
data won't tell you you need to start
with questions so it's true for genomic
data it's true for Stack Overflow as
well so the first question that I
thought of asking was so this is how
standard post on Stack Overflow looks
this is actually the first ever post on
Stack Overflow and it was eight years
ago and one of the great thing is that
each post on Stack Overflow or each
question has tags here so it's
immediately annotated with what the
people are interested in so I can look
at tags and I can look at for example so
which tags are most common on Stack
Overflow what are people asking
questions about well that's an
interesting question but not from really
like a data science point of view
because tech overflow already tells me
that so the most frequent ones are
JavaScript Java C sharp and PHP so let's
move on so this is not an interesting
question for me as a researcher so
another interesting question I'm asking
is each post is tagged with the tag and
also with the time when the previous the
question so I can for example think okay
so if I'm asking a question about are
when should I ask it on Stack Overflow
so that most people see it etc so I
decided to look at when are people
asking questions so the first question
is when and I have pre processed some of
the data I have them here in a CSV file
this is a go to format and I want to
show you something very cool in F sharp
called type providers so this is just a
very big CSV file with some pre process
data where I have information about each
post and when it was asked or answered
etc and it's over one gigabyte in size
so it would fit into memory on my laptop
but it would take some time to load
everything etc so I want to show you how
F sharp makes exactly this task much
easier I will use type providers as I
said so I will just create type because
F sharp is a statically typed language
and I will create a type that will be
called for example tag time and I will
use something called CSV provider and I
will just give it the file as a
parameter so now what it does under the
scenes or behind the scenes is that it
goes into the file looks at the
beginning and infers all types and the
structure of the file so now if I create
a variable called DT for example and do
tag time get sample this will actually
load the file and I can look at
rose and now this gives me a sequence of
rows in the CSV file and I can do C dot
map because F sharp is a functional
language and now I can do row dot yeah
now it loaded the file and it tells me
that in the file there are three
elements in each row the first one is
the day of the week it is string the
second one is the tag which is a string
as well and the third time is time which
is of type system dot date/time which is
a dotnet type used to represent time and
you can see for example just the day of
the week I haven't even looked at the
file and it's not loaded in memory so
what it does it's actually just looks at
the beginning and interest the entire
structure and I can write my code
knowing that this will be correct by the
time it runs actually on the file which
is a great help in exploring large data
sets so I ask the question when do
people ask or answer questions on Stack
Overflow and I plotted it for f-sharp
because I was doing it in F sharp so you
can see that people ask and answer most
questions from Monday to Friday and then
it drops on Saturday and Sunday and then
I looked at another language on the.net
platform c-sharp and it has very similar
pattern but something caught my
attention and that is that if you look
at the ratio between the weekend and the
weekday it's slightly different for C
sharp and F sharp you see that so more
people ask questions about F sharp on
weekends than on C sharp so what's that
well it's about side projects and
weekend projects and things like that
so this is my friend Chris who actually
does tooling for v/s code that I was
using for the demo for f-sharp and he's
working on it on a trip somewhere in the
countryside so a thing is people ask
questions on weekends about things that
they like to play with or they like to
explore in their free time so that
basically tells us like measure of how
people love a language or if the
language is not really used in
production how much people like to play
with it in their free time and that's an
awesome measure right so my hypothesis
is that normally people ask questions
about what I work with then people have
some evening projects and this might be
evenly distributed across weekdays and
weekends and then there is this group of
questions and answers that get posted on
weekends and it might be larger if it's
something that you don't use at work and
you just have to use it on weekends and
then you can't wait and play with it
or it can be very small if it's just
like a group of people who are sitting
at work on weekend and are miserable
asking questions on Stack Overflow
because something went horribly wrong
but this difference this ratio will tell
us how people actually like it or not so
if it's smaller than one it will be that
people use it much less over weekends
and if it's larger than one that means
people use it more on weekends than
during weekdays so this is the weekend
index of language
I promise out put it somewhere on the
web so that you can play with it
yourself and the most weekend things are
our minecraft which kind of makes sense
right it's the thing you play with over
the weekend then LW jdl I had to look it
up it's lightweight Java game library
then SF ml I couldn't remember this so I
wrote it down it's a simple and fast
multimedia library that people actually
use for writing games to interact with
hardware on your computer and then the
language and my game so it seems that
over weekends people mainly try to write
games in our free time so what are the
most enterprising things you wouldn't do
on a weekend well turns out it's sequel
server reporting services so these are
the things you wouldn't play with I
won't comment on it further and then I
was looking at some functional languages
so for example this is f sharp and it
has a coefficient of 0.6 no which is
quite a lot compared to other languages
people like to play a lot with Haskell
in their free time which kind of makes
sense
and everyone's hobby project right now
is writing things with elm so again this
has a coefficient above one that means
people ask more questions over weekend
than during weekdays
so this is kind of nice how does it look
for data science a thing well f sharp is
actually the most free time most loved
language out of these and the second one
is python and r is not very popular over
weekends and the most enterprising one
is SAS also kind of makes sense right
and then I looked at some other things
and one thing that again caught my
attention was continuous delivery
services you know continuous integration
and people are quite often asked
questions so should I use Jenkins on
Travis this is actually a question on
Stack Overflow precisely on that which
was closed because it's opinion based
and these had one of the biggest
differences between weekend and weekday
usage so this is actually the difference
so Travis is used for open source
projects and for fun projects etcetera
much more than Jenkins and I think the
main difference is that Travis is
actually a host
by Travis and it's free for open source
projects so people tends to use it
because it has minimal setup you can
just run it from github etc with Jenkins
you have to host it yourself and it's
just so much more work so people play
with Travis in their free time but they
don't do that with Jenkins in general so
if you are choosing like which way to go
like thing
who is your user and if you want people
to play with your products in their free
time or if you are targeting just the
enterprise so this was my first question
so now what what else can we do with the
data
another interesting information that's
there is location where people are based
actually and I thought well we would
fill in location like no one wants to
get tracked etc but I decided to it's
just like look at what people put there
actually there are five male over five
million users in my data set and almost
a million of them filled in their
location which is quite a lot so it's
definitely more than 1% so some of them
look like this that's not very helpful
some other people actually put in their
full address I'm not sure they realize
that it's a public information some
people put in their address down to
their office number some people put in
their address as just a country etc
actually 83% of people put in at least a
country that matched one of the
countries of the world which is a lot
and some people put in their full
address maybe because they hope that
people will like knock on their door and
thank them some people probably don't
think then people will come to think
them well some locations look like this
some locations looks like this I had to
look this place up and it's actually
here so people ask questions on Stack
Overflow from everywhere so I decided to
Oh what I did first was that I matched
all the locations to countries in the
world and then I took the rest of the
locations that couldn't be localized in
this way and decided well let's just
explore if I can like find them in some
other way so I looked at a lot of
different location services and I
decided to go with Bing search because
they had the largest amount of free
requests that I could make and I had to
make about 120 thousand so and again
did I mention type providers Oh
what else can I use for exploring data
like this this is a J this is a REST API
which returns a JSON and there is a type
provider for that as well so I can just
create type called say Bing search and
Jayson provider because it returns a
JSON and give it an example request and
this is really just the URL with the
example request that's all and now I can
do let's let's look up where Copenhagen
is so location will be Copenhagen and
now I need the query for the rest API so
I will just copy this and change my
example Prague I'm from Prague you
should go there it's an awesome city to
my query location so now I can do just
result equal bing search
and again I haven't run anything at all
right now this is all there is there is
no nothing happening anywhere no library
that I will use for this except a sharp
data which contains the Jason provider
and now I can do result dot and this is
all the content of the JSON file that I
receive as a response I'm not touching
anything so result and I think the
actual location is hidden within the
JSON document so I and this is some
resource and I will go to resource
resources again now another map inside
and now this is again the content of the
JSON file so I can just go to address
dot country region and this should tell
me the country where Copenhagen is
located so again I just need to run it
now and here in interactive is the
result so it's probably in Denmark but
there is some Copenhagen in the US as
well so this is all it took me to
basically create a wrapper around the
Bing search for location which is pretty
cool I think it's basically what I did
was it took me like four lines of actual
code so I ran that on all the locations
that I couldn't localize directly and it
gives me things like that like for
JavaScript I can just plot the result
and it tells me that most JavaScript
programmers are in the US etc so it
doesn't actually tell me that much
because I know that in the u.s. there
are a lot of people and then in
a lot of people there as well so I
decided to ask different questions so
where is it most likely that I will find
a programmer using my favorite
technology like f-sharp so this is my
very scientific equation and I realized
that I know how many users on Stack
Overflow can be located how many people
are registered and if I can get a
population of a country then I can see
like what's the probability of meeting a
person and the unit I will get out of
this is programmers per million
this is actually an almost valid unit
because environment from attics I work
with a unit called parts per million so
this is also ppm but programmers per
million so how many of you are
programmers per million of inhabitants
are in each country etc so so we're
really are people this is my next
question and I will again use F sharp
and did I mention type providers so
there is an arrow type provider called
the HTML type provider and what I gave
it here is just the URL of a Wikipedia
page containing lists of countries and
dependencies by population and don't go
on Wikipedia and try to change it right
now because I have stable URL so what I
now can do is type flood P equals
population sample and again in the same
way I could do it before I you just B
dot now I have the option of looking at
lists tables or the HTML in the document
so I will look at tables and now I have
a table called countries and
dependencies by population and I can
look at this very much depends on the
internet connection at the moment
so and I can look at throws and I can do
again C Rho F sharp is language where
fun is a keyword fun is not optional and
now in every row I have elements like
percent of world population country
population etc so I can for example
print like a country name and again it
should tell me that this is a string if
I just find it into some variable so now
countries are sequence of strings so
this is really cool because I don't have
to write parsers for HTML I don't have
to do anything I don't even have to look
at the web page I don't have to look up
where the table is that I'm trying to
parse because it will tell me so again I
won't even run this you can see that it
gives me all this information without
actually running the code so I can just
write it and then compile it and it will
just work so let's go back to my slides
so where are the most programmers per
million for each language so for F sharp
actually it's interesting Denmark is the
right place to be because in Denmark
they are almost 80 to F sharp
programmers per million people that's
amazing and Scandinavia seems to be very
high on f-sharp programmers as well in
general and then there are in China 28
per million what about our if you are
doing data science
turns out Iceland is the place to be
there are like 185 programmers per
million and China surprisingly so if you
want to meet our programmers go to these
countries and well there was one outlier
that always jumped up I was playing with
different languages looking at the
concentration everywhere
and turns out the dominican republic is
where most programmers are concentrated
in an above average rate
I think it's digital nomads probably or
maybe there is just a group of people
who like post on Stack Overflow all the
time from Dominican Republic but if you
want to move find any programmers go to
Dominican Republic well one disclaimer
there is a huge sampling bias and this
is what kills you if you are trying to
do it like for example election
predictions so for example brexit
predictions were like fifty-two first a
48 for leaves etc right before the vote
but it ended up the other way around and
the thing is it's very hard to sample
from a population in a way that
preserves the right ratio of different
people in the population so this is
basically I have a lot of sample
sampling biases in this data first one
of them is I'm looking at just people on
Stack Overflow I'm just looking at
people who put their location on Stack
Overflow which might be very country
dependent and I'm also looking at just
people who could be located with this so
this is so now we know when to post what
people like where do people live so
let's look at something with more
machine learning gay so I looked at tags
and I looked at users and when they post
and this actually gives me sort of like
a communities in Stack Overflow space so
if I look at the tags if I post with
tags like C sharp and F sharp and R etc
it tells something about me it tells
something about the technologies that I
use and I can then find people who post
about similar things so tags define
relations and I can look at tags that
are similar in terms of people who post
with them or who use them so as an
example me and my friend Chris we both
use
sharp I don't use C sharp he does
everyone is a JavaScript I use R he
doesn't and none of us uses COBOL and
this gives me a matrix and each row in
this matrix defines a user behavior and
each column in this matrix defines
basically how tags are similar in terms
of people that use them and when I have
a matrix I'm hiper data scientist
because once my data are in numeric form
I can do anything with them so I decided
to look at the whole data set but it was
a bit too baked to like process properly
because it's 44,000 tags and over five
million users so I just looked at people
who post on Stack Overflow
a lot and tags that are very common so
that I have some bit more denser data so
I hope that the users with more than one
thousand posts there is a lot of them
and the tags that have more than 5,000
other answers or questions or comments
etc and this gave me one thousand and
six hundred users and eight hundred tags
so this is always something I can work
with even on a laptop and the first
thing first rule if you are doing
anything with data that you can just
can't just look at is to create some
form of visualization because it always
tell you something about the data so I
decided to use my go-to tool right now
for high dimensional data which is
called tease me the distributed
stochastic neighborhood and bedding who
has heard about this method couple of
FIFO it sounds very very complicated but
the main idea is I try to explain with
my sketches imagine data in a very high
dimensional hyperspace let are
concentrated on a manifold there so this
is like a paper in 2d space but the tape
paper is one dimensional and if I look
at these two points located in different
sections of the paper they are very
close in the 2d space but in logic of
the data they are very far from each
other
so what this method of visualization
does it basically just looks at the
local neighborhood of each point and
tries to project that into 2d so that
things that are close to each other in
the very high dimensional space will
stay close to each other in the low
dimensional projection as well and the
things that are further away from each
other they can be like either close or
far from each other because the
projection into low dimensional space
for visualization it's very very it
reduces a lot of information but at
least this one gives me the sort of
guarantee that things that are very
close to each other in the high
dimensional space will be close to each
other in my projection as well so this
is how you would do it in our it's very
similar in Python you can just load that
library called Disney and just call it
on a matrix and give it some parameters
etc and then plot it well did I mention
type providers there is something called
our provider which gives me the same
experience that I had with my data with
our it gives me access to all functions
that are in our but from F sharp and I
can just call them by doing our dot I'm
not showing it here because it takes a
bit of time or it's not the fastest
language usually but this is how it
looks in F sharp it's very similar to
how it looks in R you can just see that
I had to call it slightly differently
with parameters but it's just our dot
Disney so I ran this remember this is
running the our library underneath it's
actually using quite a complex
mathematical model that I didn't want to
re-implement so this is what you get
nice right well the best thing about R
is that it was written by statisticians
and the worst thing about R is that it
was written by statisticians so this is
the point where you basically wants to
have a proper language that you can play
with and that you can do
like actual stuff with our is good for
some things for example if you don't
want to implement some complicated
mathematical model or method you can
just call it but then it's good to have
the data in a normal language that you
can use and create for example some
visualization so I decided to stay in a
sharp and use project called sable which
is a compiler from F sharp to JavaScript
and this is what I came up with because
once you are in something like
JavaScript you can for example optimize
placement of labels around points so
that they don't overlap and things like
that so I'll just look at the zoom into
this large graph so this is one very
tightly knit cluster of people doing
Android programming there is one for
JavaScript nodejs etc what surprised me
is that people doing JavaScript often
ask about Google Maps API for some
reason or at least my visualization
tells me that there is another cluster
of people being confused about object
oriented programming etc and I have
another version of the visualization
running here and because it's in
JavaScript I can like hover over a node
and it tells me like this is jar etc and
I can also search for nodes so let's
search for F sharp F sharp is right here
what's around F sharp for example this
is mono and that's cool because I'm
running everything on mono so let's look
at R is here and was around our you can
see that so what is around our it's data
frame that make sense ggplot matrix so
that's cool because just based on
looking at how people interact with
different technologies on Stack Overflow
it realized that R has something to do
with data frames and matrices
so that's very nice and again on the
technical side of things because I wrote
everything in F sharp I'm actually
running it in JavaScript but I can look
at sources here and because fable the F
sharp compiler produces source maps I
can actually even debug my code here in
JavaScript I can like set breakpoints
and then run it and they don't stop on
the breakpoint oh yeah thank you all
right it usually works but the point is
I can actually debug or look at my a
sharp code and how it corresponds to
this JavaScript code so our school but
sometimes you just want to move into
something else so and again this might
look a bit like toy example like why do
I visualize how tags were related to
each other in Stack Overflow but this is
an example from genomics where they
looked at human genomic variation and
you can use exactly the same algorithm
to visualize that even though it's much
more higher dimensional data set than
Stack Overflow and it's from an academic
paper so it's not so nice as much
visualization right but for example this
is like a Chinese population this is a
Japanese population this is African
population with the blue dots are from
us and it's tells you quite a lot of
things for example that Japanese
population is very homogeneous
genomically genetically and African
population is much more heterogeneous
it's actually the most heterogeneous
population out of all human
locations so and because I played with
it using my Stack Overflow data I know
how it will behave on a much more
complex data that I can't really
understand by just looking at it and I
think this is very cool and very useful
so I looked at tags I looked at users I
looked the technologies what else can I
do I can look at the actual questions
and answers right well that's the core
of Stack Overflow and because we are in
the deep learning track I decided to use
force to bike which is a very cool not
deep learning task but it's shallow
learning network that that's something
quite similar to the TC visualization
method that I was showing you before it
creates something called word embeddings
and the t's knee looked at points and
looked at their neighborhood and try to
project them into a lower dimensional
space and words to like that's something
quite similar because it looks at words
in sentences and their local context and
their local neighborhood and creates an
embedding into a vector space I don't
want to go into too many details but you
can just run it quite straightforwardly
just give it a lot of text and it will
create word embeddings into a vector
space and the very cool thing about
words too vague is that well first how
it works like rough idea is for example
if you have two sentences like f-sharp
is a functional language on the.net
platform and scala is a functional
language on the JVM it tells you that
they are related and they are all
surrounded by functional but they are on
different platforms so this defines like
a sort of local neighborhood around each
word and you can encode this put it into
a shallow neural network and then after
you get vectors out of this you can do
arithmetic with vectors which is very
cool you can do scala - jbm plus dotnet
and you get C sharp and F sharp so this
is pretty impressive and it just looked
at how people use these words instead
Cobra flow in there are questions and
answers and for example if you look at f
sharp - not well you get SML and Oh
camel which are ML languages which are
our ml and family of languages and then
you had Haskell and Idris so these are
all functional programming languages so
this is I think very cool it again tells
you something about these words that you
can for example just transform F sharp
from the dotnet environment into some
other context and this tells you that
and again this is a lot of fun like you
can play with things you can add and
subtract technologies and see what comes
out of that but this is actually quite
an important task even in academic
research because I work in
bioinformatics and there is a lot of
literature on like genes and pathways
etc and it's beyond like the attention
span of a single human to actually
absorb all this so there is a lot of
research going on on data mining in
paper databases looking for genes etc
and to summarize the information in some
nice form and people are actually trying
to use words to work for this type of
thing as well because we don't it'd be
great to just look at a gene and
transform it from one environment like I
don't know breast cancer and transform
it so how what does it do in pancreatic
cancer etc and well we are not there yet
but we are getting closer and this is
just one tool in the toolbox so in the
end I decided to ask one crucial
question so these were all like very
tiny nice examples but like what
actually about Stack Overflow that's
important
well it stack overflow and meritocracy
that means if you see a question and
decide to answer it well the score you
get for that question depend on your
reputation if you are famous or not does
it depend on that or do people evaluate
quality of answers just based on their
usefulness
well first I looked at how score
actually relates to author reputation
well this is standard plots you can't
really see anything from this this is on
a log scale and this tells you that for
example if your reputation is around 100
then you will probably never get more
than 10 for your answer if your
reputation is 1000 you probably won't
get more than 100 points for your answer
so this is this seems to be quite a
strong rule in the Stack Overflow
dataset but I decided to try some prefer
machine learning and do some regression
modeling using various input data like
if a question was accepted what was the
score of the question how many tags the
question had how many answers there were
how many comments there were under the
question how many people favorite idle
question etc and try to predict the
score of an answer based on that and I
tried a lot of different models like
linear nonlinear iterations random
forests SVM's
neural networks etc and turns out the
most predictive things about your score
are how many people like the question
how many people looked at the question
and if your answer was accepted or not
so this seems nice right this is it
really depends just on your answer well
not so much well I depends on the person
then I was looking at some diagnostic
plots in R and it's not that important
like how the spot is created but on the
y-axis it's the residuals that means
like the error in your prediction and on
the x-axis is something called leverage
and leverage is this thing basically the
higher your leverage the more strength
you have in the predictions or in the
model and it seems that here like this
group of points
very high leverage compared to the rest
so that's kind of weird right so I
decided to investigate yeah this is
another illustration of the leverage the
point in the upper right corner has the
highest leverage out of all the points
because it couldn't shift the regression
into any direction and turns out this
person has the highest leverage and if
you have done anything with c-sharp you
know that this person John skeet answers
everything and he has the highest
reputation on Stack Overflow everywhere
he is like the like the hero of c-sharp
people on Stack Overflow and so the
thing is also my predictions were not
very good actually they could explain
only about 40% of the score you get for
your answer so I guess the quality
really matters in the post on Stack
Overflow which is a good thing
unless you are John skeet because then
everyone uploads you just buy just
because you answered so Stack Overflow
your quality of your answers is only
about the score of your answers it's
only about the quality of answer you
give which is great so just to wrap up
so hopefully I showed you that type
providers are a very cool tool for
exploring data and also data science is
just about selecting the right tool for
the part of the job you are doing
so in data science you can't really use
just one language for everything you
have to mix and match you can just well
I showed you that you can use quite a
lot of things just from f-sharp directly
but play with things and use anything
that works for your data and on the data
science side of things well I think I
went through quite other things but the
main thing is try to ask questions and I
hope I showed you at least in the first
part that you don't need a PhD in
mathematics or machine learning to
actually play with the data and in for
some very cool things about it
and maybe move to Dominican Republic
thank you okay there's some questions
okay
how come you use mono instead of the
visual studio it's one question how come
I use yes well I use mono because I'm
working on a Mac and at work I'm working
on the Linux so why would I use Visual
Studio Visual Studio runs only on
Windows and there is very good stooling
for f-sharp on mono and I'm sure it will
be oh you saw that in my TC
visualization F sharp was right next to
mono so you can see that the two link
was very good and it was working fine on
a Mac okay has one relating to the
weekend index I think could it be that
the reason for many questions on a
specific language is just that it's more
difficult so for instance that job is
more difficult than Python well I think
that people ask questions all the time
and it may not be only about difficulty
well it might be about difficulty but
then I would suppose that the ratio
would be roughly similar over week a
weekdays and weekends and if people ask
questions more in general I think that
would require some very heavy
normalization because I would have to
normalize it by the number of users who
actually eyes ask questions etc but I am
just expecting that the rate ratio of
people asking questions is like it might
depend on the difficulty of the question
or difficulty of the language but it
will be roughly similar over weekdays
and weekends this might be rough very
simplifying but it tells me at least how
people interact with the language in
their free time or in their weekday work
what are you currently working on
what am I currently working on well
depends at work I actually work on
exploring patterns of variations in
pancreatic cancer outside of work I'm
playing with cool data and you should
too
I'll be here so if you want to see some
more type providers in action or some
more f-sharp or R or anything come and
find me thank you remember to vote and
that's thank Alena</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
