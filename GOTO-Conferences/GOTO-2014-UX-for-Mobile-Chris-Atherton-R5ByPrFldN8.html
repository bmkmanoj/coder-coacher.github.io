coffee so if I talk too fast or I'm not
making any sense can you just kind of
wave let me know something is not okay
it's after lunch so I'm sort of hoping
that you all had coffee as well
otherwise my job for the next 45 minutes
is going to be very hard wake up okay
cool so this is all I'm going to talk
about attention which is really hard to
do after lunch
so bear with me and I want to start by
making a little bit of a disclaimer if
that's okay this is a bit cheeky
actually to give this glamor before I
even start talking but my background is
in sort of brain science and I'm gonna
talk a little bit about brains and I'm
sort of taking a risk there a little bit
because I want what I have to say - it's
a matter to you but a problem that we
have with brain images let me explain
this so this is a frequent occurrence in
my world which is to say that there's
some story in the news and it has a
vague bearing on psychology or on brains
in some way but like they never
explicitly explain why it has to do with
the brain they just go blah blah blah
blah brain and then they kind of do so
in summary brain and there is no
connection between the brain part and
the story part and what we know from
psychology is that people are actually
much more likely to believe that story
if you mention the brain or if you show
a picture of a brain and so that's a bit
of a problem for me because quite often
I do talk about the brain and I don't
want you to be persuaded because I
showed you a picture or I said a fancy
word and this has been referred to as
the seductive allure of neuroscience
explanations so there's this kind of
compelling thing that makes people more
likely to believe you if you show
pictures of the brain or if you talk
about neuroscience in as part of your
story and I don't want you to be seduced
what what makes this you know I don't
want to be the the guy in the white coat
going bah bah bah bah bah brain and
you've got oh yeah brilliant
um if you if you think today is
brilliant then yeah please vote no
if you think today's brilliant then
that's good but I don't want to do it
because of the brain thing the the
logical extension of that is that we we
get images like this which is just about
my favorite thing on the internet ever
but there's another problem which is
that actually the idea that pictures of
the brain compelling is in itself
compelling the idea that you are more
persuaded if I show you a picture of the
brain is it turns out more persuasive
than the alternative
so there's the seductive allure of
seductive allure so I no longer know
what planet I'm on and I might be upside
down at this point who knows but that's
really the end of the disclaimer be
critical evaluate everything that I say
critically and anyone else waving
pictures of the brain around you should
evaluate them very critically as well so
let's talk about vision a little bit
having said that so basic vision recap
for anyone who doesn't really know or
think very much about this stuff light
comes into the eye it hits the retina
which is this amazingly complicated kind
of part of the body and that that
information travels down the optic nerve
it's already have a little bit of
processing right we haven't really seen
anything yet but it's already done some
processing the information from each eye
is encoded by different cells the
information about where stuff is that
you're looking at you know where you all
are in comparison to me is different
from what I'm looking at so that's a
chair but that's a person and things
like hue and contrast are also encoded
down different pathways so we haven't
actually processed any of this
information yet we don't know what it
means but already there's some kind of
segregation of function and this is
happening and you know like milliseconds
tens of milliseconds is so fast and
eventually it gets to the end and then
it just kind of explodes all over the
back of your brain so what's happening
when we see a thing like a mobile phone
but could be anything is that there's
this range of areas of the brain that
all deal with slightly different
information and help you process that
visual information in slightly different
ways there's a very fast pathway called
the where pathway it's called the dorsal
pathway it doesn't matter
and that basically figures out where
stuff is in relation to you it's very
very fast it's very useful that it's
fast right because then you want to know
if things are near you were further away
from you it helps you guide your
movements you know to grab things it
helps you run away from things that are
dangerous and the parts of this part
that the parts of this pathway include
things like area v3 which encodes motion
so it can tell if stuff is kind of
moving an area of v5 which encodes
motion and directions so you can kind of
the neurons in that pathway kind of
encode what a thing is and where it is
and they work out you know what is this
thing I'm looking at based on its
movements what are all the bits there's
also a part of the brain called the
parietal cortex which is a big part of
the dorsal pathway and that really
governs attention management that means
that's all about like what am I looking
at right now what do I need to be
looking at and it's kind of a focus from
managing your attention and so when
you're sort of following a thing around
your brain is in part part of that is
reflexive part of that it's just very
fast hey something's moving I should
orient towards that and part of it is go
well actually maybe I should keep
looking at this because it might be
important so attention kind of has two
parts in that in that regard when that
part of the brain is damaged you get
situations like this where this was
drawn by somebody here was damage to the
parietal lobe of the brain and this is
they've been asked to draw a clock and
they have what's called hemispatial
neglect so they do not really notice
anything on their left-hand side the
part of the brain that's damaged is on
the right and instead that's their
drawing of the clock is everything is on
the right and you can imagine that this
is very damaging for them right because
you know imagine trying to cross the
road you know looking for traffic when
you don't really notice anything when
your attention can't grasp anything on
your left side
similarly in Alzheimer's disease there
is a problem with the attentional part
of the brain I say that like it's one
part the attention is all over the brain
but this specifically the parietal area
of the brain this is a found view of the
brain here so at the top of the screen
is the front of the brain the bottom of
the screen is the back of the brain and
these bits here on the left you see the
normal brain and all the red
I hope anyone's not colorblind all the
kind of strongly colored bits that do
all that those are the kind of bits are
really active they're metabolically
active they're burning through more
glucose and this is the brain of
somebody else Alzheimer's easy excuse me
disease and you can see that these areas
are not the same they're not as active
they're they're kind of green color and
this is because the brain of someone
with Alzheimer's dementia and we think
of it as a forgetting disease and it
kind of is but it's also a disease of
attention management or attention
failure really people with Alzheimer's
disease will sort of stop in the middle
of a task they can't manage their
attention to finish the task or
sometimes they will repeat the same
thing of the same thing because they
can't manage their attention to move on
from that so it's also partly the
disease of attention so we can see that
these parts of the brain are really
important for attention and from
managing it and focusing it on the
useful tasks so that's the where pathway
it's very fast it's very useful it
governs our attention and our ability to
focus on things that are moving or
things that might be important the other
pathway is much slower it's the what
pathway so once we've oriented our
attention to something then we got to
think about well what is it what am I
looking at and so the areas of the brain
involved in this or many and all
different differently specialized and
this includes area v1 which kind of
takes these little line fragments and it
recognizes individual fragments and says
okay this is at this orientation then
maybe that other part over there is of
that orientation maybe they form some
kind of edge or feature and this is kind
of compounded in area v2 where we
recognize edges here are some edges so
does everyone see the triangles yep okay
now I'm just look again that there are
no triangles sorry you made that up
right so if you actually look what is
here there are three V shapes and three
little pac-man shapes but there are no
triangles so your brain makes stuff up
all the time there are no edges of those
triangles they're not complete right
we just sort of infer that be complete
that's right like drops out when I turn
around my head
try not to do that very much training
slowly so the we make stuff up based on
our experiences so this illusion of
triangles is a really good example
because it basically says okay it when
we don't see something like when I go
behind this table oh no Chris doesn't
have a middle it's okay I have a middle
but when we don't see that part we don't
go wow there's a part missing we there
is a part behind another thing so
there's this table in them behind that
is Chris and that's the assumption that
we're making here is that okay well
something rational must have happened we
know how the world works we know that
when a thing is missing it's often just
or part of a thing is missing it's often
just behind another thing and visual
illusions are like that they relate to
our our experiences our practical
experiences everyday other things that
happen in v4 is that we encode color and
we also include not in v4 but in a
separate area we encode faith well this
is dropping out a lot should I use the
other mic okay excuse me a moment I have
to change my hair thank you perfect okay
everybody good yep
excellent right where were we okay so
there are parts of the brain in this
whole what pathway that encode things
like color and faces and so on and this
is all about understanding okay now but
I have my attention on this thing what
is it what is it made of what am I
looking at and so we've got this
situation where first of all you're like
okay where is stuff happening and then
you're like okay what is happening there
and if I show you a kind of abstraction
of this this is if this is just some
stuff right some data you don't really
know what it is yet first of all you're
going to group it because that's the
where this is all this stuff fits
together and we group that on the basis
of similarity basically we're like well
all these things are near each other so
they're obviously related in some way
and then later on we might go huh
actually it's more complicated so of all
these things summer purple summer kind
of blue-green Oh or some of them are
triangles
some of them are squares but those kinds
of decisions happen much more slowly
because the wat pathway is much more
slow here's a kind of fun thing for you
this is vaguely related I'll explain why
in a moment who sees Albert Einstein
anyone see anything else oh man
okay this is about the size of room yep
Beethoven Marilyn Monroe okay who thinks
the person who sees Marilyn Monroe is a
little bit crazy because there's no
Marilyn there okay most of you right
you are not alone sir okay so if I
shrink that now what do you see okay
right now I have not played a trick this
is the same image I want to prove it to
you okay this is my slide deck when I
was making this slide right everyone can
see Albert over here right
and then here's Marilyn and thumbnail
that is the same image so what is
happening so the big image basically you
can see all the kind of the
low-frequency noise stuff so excuse me
the high noise so the the the very fine
lines when that shrunk all you see is
the big low frequency stuff and this is
a very clever image that's designed to
show you a different thing depending on
how near you are how small or big the
images and how far away the different
lines appear and how far apart those are
on your retina right and typically what
happens is that we move from the kind of
global picture and then we process the
kind of smaller finer details so we
start with the kind of the where and the
general picture and then we kind of zoom
in and look at those specific details
but what does that mean for mobile
usability well so for starters when we
look at a phone and we process the
information on the phone we're gonna
start at a very global level and then
we're gonna get more specific and more
specific and more specific and that has
a consequence for what we put on the
phone on the screen so this is our page
from a government service that I've been
working on in the UK
and if we think about how we process
this initially when someone looks at
this page what's actually happening is
that we kind of get a general sense of
some stuff on the page and then we
process a little bit more so maybe we
get some color we get a bit more detail
and then finally we get the real thing
but it's that kind of that stage then
it's interesting to me here right
because well is it that sticks out the
button right the green button that the
sensor rates a really really strong
call-to-action and that's really
important because that like if you can
make it that easy for people then that's
helpful for them to know what to do next
and because it's a government service
and anybody needs to be able to use it
it has to be really really simple and
clear to use so a lot of the time I
spend thinking about how can we make
calls to action really clear on the page
and I'm sorry to say that size does
matter a little bit location is also
very important so like if state agents
tell us you know when you're buying a
house it is all about both of these
things in fact everything is a fight for
the users attention this is kind of my
my thing right it's that everything I
look at is it's kind of I'm thinking
about attention and how your attention
is being managed and your attention is
constantly being hijacked by things that
are happening around you it likes things
that are novel so anything that's kind
of new or hasn't happened recently and
when I say recently I mean like in the
last second that's recently suits me I
can't keep a thread of conversation so
this is great for me it's like this is
my level one second so if you look at
something like this if it's quite
compelling cuz it just keeps changing
and it keeps changing I'm going to stop
that because some of your starter hey
there's also stuff like this where like
we've we've created mobile interfaces
that kind of just stay talked to
themselves it's kind of nice but they're
also attracting our attention
so we're compelled by things because
they move and I guess you notice that
when you're looking at this screen as
soon as something moves you're kind of
your eye is drawn to it a little bit and
that's your attention just orienting to
things that are new because it might be
important for you you don't know yet
until your attention has put your vision
there has made you focus on that thing
you don't know yet and attention also
likes things that are salient it's so bi
salient I mean just anything there's
kind of them could be important or
meaningful to you so I was in this was
in Stockholm recently actually in I was
walking around this park with my husband
and I went
hey it's the Twitter logo this is just
some old farm machinery right and my
husband's like what I said no look it's
the Twitter logo and he is like you are
a freak but this is what attention does
attention points us to things it's like
a small child right just tugging on your
sleeve the whole time going hey look hey
look hey look hey look and a lot of the
time the things that it's telling you to
look out are actually really useful if
not important um I love this I don't
know how well you can read this I'm
sorry it was really dark in the lift
when I take this so your options are a
top-floor 17th floor which you can only
get to with a special key lobby basement
alarm what is the salient call-to-action
in this lift panel every time I got into
that lift I'm like no Ross Olson said
something really cool today in his
keynote like the entire keynote was cool
actually but he said if I ancient
machine couldn't really do both things
at the same time so it crashed I thought
what a great metaphor for attention
attention is really like limited so at
any given moment you're probably really
only keeping your attention on one thing
and the multitasking for example has it
coughed like if you want to be looking
at your email and there's something else
in your email and something else
every time you contacts which that has a
cost cognitively and you have to kind of
reorient and start over a little bit but
I thought this was a great metaphor for
really how we manage our attention um
the more things there are to concentrate
on the more your attention is split and
that comes to the cost right so um this
came to me recently I love this this is
just this is a beautiful thing it's um
the thing is for the people who use this
this is probably great because they
spent like the last two years like
learning what this means and how to use
it but for anybody else can you imagine
day one on your your new job right and
they're like okay off you go what and
then someone asked me about like how can
we kind of evaluate you know how can I
make these kind of what's the most
salient
feature thing and I actually realized
that um sorry I'm getting ahead of
myself we'll come back to that um here's
another example this is the Bloomberg
terminal which is used for financial
news and trading and so on and this is
pretty complex the people who use this
are proud of how complicated it is
because it's taken them a long time to
understand and then I do actually try to
rework it I'm sorry this is not the best
picture perhaps it's not very detailed
you can still see there's a lot of
information on that screen it's a little
bit cleaner a little bit more modern
doesn't look like a kind of dose window
anymore
but to be honest if I redid the
blueberry terminal it would look like
that because that's about as much
information as I think anyone can
reasonably take in and of course
actually if you're an expert you're used
to all these things but still I think
that like the most useful things on this
would be like if you have two or three
things and they just go hey this has
changed or like this value has gone
below a particular threshold you should
sell that stock or whatever so this kind
of information not like absolutely
everything all the time and if you are
learning if this is your first day on
the job everything that is novel is a
legitimate target for you right like you
do not know because you haven't
internalized yet what are the important
things and so literally anything could
be really important um I love websites
like this I've kind of taken the banner
off at the top because I don't embarrass
anybody but three characteristics and
great website designer and you're like
okay where is it where is it oh my
goodness and you actually have to scroll
down past all the advertising to find
those three characteristics of great
website design and then yeah I know
right
but web advertising is you know probably
keeping this guy in business maybe um
the flip side of this is where like
people take advantage of the fact that
you can't concentrate and everything
this is Ryanair who you'd like to try
and sell everything they particularly
like hiding things like this is the
don't insure me option in this
alphabetized list of countries of where
you live who is gonna find that right
that's I mean that's what they want they
would not find that so that they can
then sell you insurance and make a
little bit
your money on your flight and this is
what we call a dark pattern this is
where people are really exploiting how
attention works - to get some commercial
benefit but in a nasty way um I googled
dark patterns from mobile because I
thought it would be interesting to see
if anyone had kind of catalog these and
I actually just found this so um yeah be
careful what you wish for
so like Einstein said very smart guy an
Stein he said everything should be made
as simple as possible but no simpler um
and that is actually very difficult to
do so this is my idea of a great UI it's
perfect it does absolutely everything
you need it to do and probably more than
I would want it to do because I don't
really care about logging in um you know
I just I just want to do my google
search and this is lovely
but of course Google can have a really
simple UI because they spent a long time
getting the functionality right it took
a long time really for them to get an
algorithm that was better than all of
the other search options out there and
they're still continuously collecting
data and trying to refine it personally
I think they're not doing a great job at
the moment I think my Google searches
are not as not as helpful as they used
to be but you know they've got a lot of
big a lot of material to work with and
since about 10 years ago when everyone
kind of went oh hey the web is a thing
now there's more stuff so it's harder
for them to organize but this is the
perfect UI if all of your engineering
underneath works really well this is the
perfect UI right just type type in what
you want it'll it'll get it it's like
the equivalent of the Star Trek
replicator basically you just tell it
what you want stuff comes it's amazing
um on the other hand sometimes it needs
to be complicated like this is a piece
of medical equipment for the iPhone I
think it's for the iPhone I forget the
platform and it's not beautiful and have
to be beautiful it would be nice but
it's not you know it doesn't have to be
but it's functional right this is for
medical professionals and maybe it needs
to be this complicated like if we took
it away if we just turned it into the
Google UI maybe that would be too simple
and it wouldn't help it wouldn't remind
people about what they need to do so we
need to think about simple but not so
simple that it's harder for somebody to
do their job and I came to this
conclusion pretty late after thinking
about this for a long time
which is that failures of UI are
basically failures of attention
management if you were to if your UI is
failing people part of the reason that's
probably happening is because it's not
managing their attention it's not
directing them to the right thing at the
right time which is what a UI needs to
be able to do and I've seen there's so
many times we've been designing this
visa and immigration forum for the
government in the UK so people can come
and work or study or live in the UK and
this is an early prototype and now we
just getting people to put in you know
their passport information and stuff
like that and that people would miss a
lot of fields so they would often leave
out like the year or the month that they
were born and they wouldn't realise and
then the message you know though they
would go to the server and it would come
back with an error message and they
would have to do it again and then it's
too much basically like we're asking
people to do too much exactly the same
here this is kind of what's happening
right stare at the green dot no I'm not
hitting the sizing you actually just
just look at the green dot for a minute
I don't know how well this is gonna work
because they don't know if it's quite
big enough for everybody
what do you see if you keep staring at
the green dot only there's a what about
the other dots they disappear right now
stop staring at notes stop stop staring
at the green dot okay for a minute thank
you and look at the other dots there
there there the whole time right they
never disappear but when you start
looking just at the green flashing dot
sometimes they look like they disappear
and this is exactly what is happening
with your attention okay is that when
you focus exclusively on one thing and
particularly if it's animated or
removing or whatever you can completely
miss all the other stuff I didn't show
that gorilla video because I think most
people have seen it now but you've seen
that right where there's like people
playing basketball and you're gonna
count the number of times they bounced
the ball and while you're looking at
that someone in a gorilla suit walks on
and waves and walks off and lots of
people don't notice the first time
because they're so busy counting the
number of times the players pass the
ball exactly the same thing here okay
I'm gonna stop that now you're so glad
right
and this is a thing called inattentional
blindness it just basically means that
when you are concentrating very hard on
one thing specifically all your
attention is there and you don't really
have a lot of attention for all of the
other stuff around the outside you are
managing your attention and you're
keeping it focused on that one thing
which is good but sometimes you can miss
some other things which is not always a
good thing and so we ended up with this
visa form asking fewer questions per
page because we realized that it was
annoying for people that sometimes put
you know miss one thing I'm gonna have
to look at the whole page again nobody
misses stuff there are so few options on
the page that nobody really misses
anything so it's working much better and
you're gonna think about all of this in
the context of which people actually use
their phones right so people are walking
around they're looking at the phones
they kind of look away they cross the
road they look at the phone they do
something they tap a few buttons they
look around they you know constantly our
attention that's moving from the phone
to what's around us to what's happening
what we're listening to what we're
looking at and that's pretty complicated
so I'm going to show you a thing that
demonstrates that why is a problem well
now why it's a problem but why it's kind
of interesting that mobile attention is
brief so there's something happening
every time this picture hiccups there's
something happening what is it the bag
anything else
oh the bike seat yeah everyone see that
just watch it a couple more times if we
can do that yeah see the bike seat right
you didn't notice that right it's like
it's big and it's yellow and you didn't
notice it and this is a thing called
change blindness so it's a little bit
similar to inattentional blindness
before like I talked about before where
you know you're looking so harder the
thing that you don't see the other
things change blindness is when I think
when I think flickers like when this is
discontinuity in your vision then you
kind of you keep the sense of what is
going on like there's a woman there's a
lot of bicycles she's got a bike she's
got a bag but you lose the specifics
it's almost like you
brain is a piece of videotape and you
kind of over writer each time it
flickers you overwrite it a little bit
so because you are you know kind of a
cognizant functioning human being you
can remember the gist of what was
happening so you can remember roughly
what's happening but those specifics get
lost when that happens and that's
potentially a problem for user
interfaces right so here's an example
that I mocked up I did some work at
Skype a few years ago and we were
testing this this idea I'm sorry I don't
have screenshots I still kick myself
that I didn't take screenshots at the
time so here's your here's my all of my
contacts and Skype and I click on one of
those and here's all their information
and we were testing this idea that you
might want to add tags you know the way
that you can add people to Google
Circles now right on Google+ the same
idea you might want to greet people like
their work or friends or whatever family
so if someone clicked on the add tags
thing it would bring up this modal and
they would type in some tags and then
say okay right I'm done add these tags
and then they would click on that and it
would go away and they'd be like did it
work and they hadn't seen it they
couldn't see where the changes happened
because the entire screen has changed
right between here and here like what
they're doing hasn't changed the task is
still that they're trying to add some
tags but there's this discontinuity
there's this kind of global change the
modal has gone away and now they're
totally lost and actually the tags were
right up there but they didn't you know
they didn't see them because this was
all new and that discontinuity just
threw them completely they had no idea
what just happened
and so think about when you're walking
around and you're looking at everything
all the time so what does that mean for
your mobile interface right because if
someone is constantly looking up and
looking at other things and switching
between apps how are they going to
notice all the changes however big in
the notice the things that you want them
to notice the good news for attention
because attention is you know small and
thin and easily distracted very much so
is that on a mobile you only have so
much space right like you've got so
little room to actually say anything
that you can't say you almost can't say
too many things
and mobile-first is a great great way of
designing and I really really do believe
this having been doing it for the last
18 months or so is that it forces you to
focus you because you cannot say
everything at once if you think about
designing for a desktop you've got so
much space that you can completely ruin
it right time by just you know
destroying it by putting stuff
everywhere and then no one knows what
they're supposed to do next and again
that's fine for experts that's maybe not
so good for a beginners
so when we're wire framing and when
we're talking about what we're gonna do
you can only fit a tiny amount in each
of these this is my crappy wireframes
from a couple of weeks ago you can only
put a very little information so it
makes you think really hard about what's
the call to action what is the next
thing that this person has to do and how
do I get them there sometimes we do have
to give them a lot of information and
we're really struggling with this so one
one of the things that you have to do
when you're applying online for a visa
to come to the UK is that when you pay
like normally online it's it's not the
end right well sorry excuse me it is
normally the end when you pay in your
online transaction boom payment done you
get an email finito here no you're not
done you have to go to an appointment
you have to get your photograph and your
fingerprints taken and you have to do
all this other stuff and so we don't
want people to switch off at the end of
the transaction when they've paid we
want to tell them more stuff but in
their brains they're like I hope and I'm
done already right but they're not done
and so there's all this information that
we have to give people and it's really
hard to convey that and we see that when
people have to deal with all of this
information they just kind of you know
they just go like basically if you don't
want to reads nobody wants to read a lot
of stuff they just scroll until they're
done and so in the real world it's nice
to say oh you only got to have one call
to action but actually sometimes there
are like two three four legitimate calls
to action about what someone might want
to do next and it's really really hard
to design for that and not overwhelm
people because you're also trying to
give them a bit of information about
where they are as well right like you've
got your navigation and you've got
what's happening the context right now
and then you've got here are some more
things you could do and this is a nice
you know in many ways is a really really
nice UI it's just a do-it-yourself a
kind of home construction type company
in the UK and so we're sort of trying to
think about that for ourselves like
these are some things you've got to
download well there are two things that
you need to download when you're done
with your visa application and one thing
that you could if you want to download
and then there's a kind of old but we're
not done yet
please go to the next section it's
really really hard to do this and to
manage people's attention because at any
point if someone clicks the download
option then maybe that's what they'll go
to and they'll forget that they were in
the middle of a transaction or maybe you
know they they open any of these as a
PDF and then like you've lost their
attention how are you even gonna get it
back it's really hard if anyone like has
a brilliant solution to this that works
across all platforms for the web then
please come and see me afterwards I'll
buy you a drink
several drinks so I suppose that kind of
leads me to the thing that I wanted to
finish on because we hear a lot about
what's happening to people's attention
in the context of social media and the
internet generally and there's stuff
like this Facebook enhances intelligence
but Twitter diminishes it claims
psychologist it's bad news for me I've
spent a lot of time on them on Twitter
and zero time on Facebook it bothers me
a bit Facebook and the Internet can
rewire your brain and shorten your
attention span ok the things about this
would bother me more than anything else
are that you know this is a person from
Oxford University which is pretty old
and distinguish them and this is almost
important as climate change really ok um
and this is my favorite absolutely so
Nicholas Carr talking about what is
happening to our brains in the internet
agent says our habits are a thought but
it can it can do certain actual physical
influence on the neurons and synapses in
our brains just let that sink in for a
minute
right if that is not happening to you
you are dead ok everything that you do
everything that you experience changes
your brain in some fundamental way
so this kind of thing you know don't
please don't take this too seriously
don't you know when you read this
critically evaluate it just look at it
and go wait a minute what is he actually
saying he is saying that new experiences
and perceptions and memories change our
brains goods they're supposed to and I
actually think that mobiles who helped
us a lot like my mobile is basically my
phone is my outboard brain it's this
kind of extra piece of thing that does a
lot of thinking for me it does a lot of
the heavy lifting for me which is good
because I need help with the lifting I'm
not very good at paying attention and
remembering a lot of things so what it
does is it stores my contacts I cannot
remember all that information I to try
but I can't it stores things that I'm
learning I'm learning Swedish right now
so it helps me remember those things it
stores my diary pointment sit reminds me
when I need to go to something which is
amazing it stores all the things I will
never remember like my logins and my
secure passwords and things like that
you know if it's secure and you've all
seen the xkcd cartoon about secure
passwords right so you know there's a
whole bunch of stuff that I want to read
later what this is doing is it's
basically I'm its managing my attention
for me it's managing my memory for me
it's it's going right here is a place to
put all the things that you need to know
later and then when you need to know
them you can come and get them and
before you need to know them you don't
have to spend a lot of attention a lot
of cycles worrying about them worrying
about forgetting them or just trying to
maintain them in memory so that you
don't forget them this is a way of
parking all of that information so that
I can get on with doing my job and
living my life and that to me is an
amazing thing do I think it's damaging
my ability to remember things no
honestly no before I parked all my stuff
in in a phone I would have to remember
so many different things and the
remembering of those things would stop
me from remembering other things you
know you only have so much capacity in
your your brain really to well you have
infinite capacity but in practice in
your kind of in your attention in your
short-term memory you can only hold so
much and it's a very leaky
kind of bucket you know stuff falls out
all the time so I think it's quite
healthy to be able to say I'm offloading
all this stuff to my device and when I
need it I know where to find it and I
will go and look for it and in the
meantime I'm gonna think 100% about the
thing that I'm doing right now which is
addressing all of you I'm not trying to
remember some phone number or email
address or thing that I have to do
tomorrow so in summary I you know please
don't listen to the crazy people but if
you decide that I am wrong and that they
are not crazy that's totally okay as
well I want you to make that decision
for yourself and not just listen to me
so to summarize think about the order in
which people perceive information
because that has implications for how
they engage with your user interface
think about the context in which people
are using your stuff and what notices
and what help they might need to retain
a sense of where they are and what they
are doing particularly if you make big
changes don't be afraid to try mobile
first design even if you were designing
a desktop application and it will never
be used on mobile have a go I think it's
really instructive it really makes you
focus and don't make it more simple than
it has to be you know it should only be
as simple as it needs to be and no more
so and above all please be really
critical when you hear people talking
about neuroscience to do with absolutely
anything but especially around kind of
cognition and thinking and attention and
so on and that does include me as well
that's it I'm done
yes for anyone who didn't hear the
question it was is there a difference
between male and female attention or
adults versus children male and female
not really I know that there is as far
as I know there is a popular idea that
men can't multitask and women can
multitask I'm not aware of any data
about that and I think it's very this is
a really it's a very popular question
always to ask our men and women the same
or are they different and I like to
think of it as a continuum like you all
know about the normal distribution like
the idea that so if we think about shoe
size for men and women right so if if
this is a graph and this is big shoes
and small shoes if women have those
shoes sort of in that distribution right
so there's an average women's shoe size
but some women have bigger shoes and
some women have smaller shoes and it's
kind of normal distribution and then men
have a distribution of shoe sizes well
there's some overlap right the two
curves overlap and that's the case for
almost everything ever so it may be that
there is in the absolute that there
might be a slight difference in the
means sometimes that is you know a tiny
difference sometimes it's a big
difference but a lot of the time when we
talk about sex differences people are
like oh yeah men are this and women are
this and you know they're totally
different and actually often there's
this huge overlap so I I get a bit
uncomfortable talking about sex
differences because people then take it
away and say oh men are totally
different and so as far as I know
there's no difference in attention
between men and women
in terms of adults and children that's a
really interesting question I'm gonna
give you an informal answer because I'm
not sure about the kind of the the
formal research on this topic my
understanding is that adults have
greater capacity to attend some more
things children's capacity is very low
part of the reason I know this is that I
used to teach
martial arts to children and adults and
you could say to an adult don't do it
like this do it like that and the adult
would do you know not like that but like
this they would do it right and you
would say the kids don't do it like that
do it like this and the kids just stop
it they don't do it like that and all
they see is that bit and then they're
off right and they're doing exactly the
thing that you don't want them to do
it's like they could only hold a smaller
amount of information so like whatever
you tell them first is the thing that
they focus on that's the kind of
informal anecdote though formally I'm
pretty sure that until they're about now
that's a good question let's say 12 to
15 kind of I mean even after that
people's brains are still forming and
refining the connections and so on but
like under let's say twelve or so
children's brains are still really
developing quite a lot sorry that was a
very long answer anymore toggle buttons
thirty words about toggle buttons oh my
god exactly thirty words or can I do it
in 29 okay I think toggle buttons are
really difficult I'm often unsure
whether they are showing me the action
or the state so am I seeing a triangle
because I should press play or am I
seeing a triangle because it is playing
and I have not yet answered this
question very well in my head I don't
know how we solve that problem so about
that's probably 40 words it's a good
question
other senses like sound and touch and
things like that what to say about those
sound operates a lot of the same
attentional rules as vision they birth
you know they're very different but they
follow a lot of similar rules touch is a
bit different touch it's very like I
don't know very immediate smell is
really in
interesting by the way so little fact
for you
most of the areas of the sorry most of
the senses that we have like touch and
seeing and hearing they go through a lot
of filtering before you actually really
perceive them properly smell doesn't
smell is much less filtered it just kind
of goes boom and it just kind of hits
you which is one of the reasons why when
we smell something it can remind us you
know it can take us back in time to when
we were children or whatever because
there's less sort of conscious filtering
happening in the brain sorry again that
seems like a inadequate answer anymore
anymore from you know any anyone else oh
yes please that's a good question I
didn't show you one there so I can go
back so this is a question about the
tagging is on pool this is where you
find out how many slides I have it's a
ridiculous number yeah okay okay oh here
we go
so what I would have done is from that
from here I would have added an
animation on those new tags I would have
kind of made it blink or flash or do
something to indicate hey this is where
your attention should go right now and
you can see now the tags so that's using
a kind of cheap attentional trick of
making something flash or a blow or do
something interesting so that people
orient their attention towards it and
then they see what you want them to see
yes yes
good question though the question was is
from mobile only are there any is there
anything too complex to be shown on a
small screen surgery um I don't know I
haven't I haven't come across a problem
where I thought we cannot do this on
mobile but I'm pretty sure there are
people working in medicine and aerospace
and things like that where there's just
so much that you need it depends like if
there's a path that you're following
through it why not break it down into
small screen small screen small screen
small screen but if you simultaneously
need to monitor a million things you
know air traffic control would be
another one I guess then you know maybe
you're just gonna have to work on a big
screen thank you is that it
yep okay great thank you all very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
