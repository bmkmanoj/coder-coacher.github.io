questions there are a few in here that
I'm gonna filter through that you've
already submitted through speaker brain
or through the go to app rather I'm
seeing in speaker brain but hopefully
you started to see some of the reasons
why screen people want to add value so
in a ways security can add value and
that securities traditionally than a
cost inhibitor and friction but perhaps
the rugged kind of concept is more
palatable to you and to your teammates
for the face you might not recognize yet
this is Nick galbreath who is also
speaking on rugged in deployment and
operational security on Friday so he's
crashing his hackers hack I guess one of
the questions that I did see in some of
these with was this is brand-new for
people there's a lot of material to
cover so which one of the questions for
you for example but we'll give it to
everybody is which if you're
interviewing people are trying to
promote people into a rugged DevOps role
whether they're starting an development
or they're starting insecurity which
attributes and skill sets are most
important if you're just getting started
yeah so when I'm looking for folks to
add to my team we hire developers into
my team and that has been a deliberate
choice because we found that like i said
earlier on average a developer can learn
to be a security person five times
faster than anyone else and in this
environment that's so critical so
development skills actually get you in
the door with my type of a team and i
would tell you the next piece is really
we run a specific type of interview we
actually basically pull somebody in and
give them a pen and basically have them
whiteboard and walk through a scenario
and that really does tell you how
somebody thinks around the problem space
and gives you a good opportunity to see
how they might apply things like what
you know different types of tools are
available how they might approach the
problem are they going to ask
basically write something down or are
they thinking more about how they'd
write something in code and so I think
that's that's kind of how we apply
finding skills for a dev psych ops
environment and really trying to push
the needle there so security is actually
the last thing I look for in somebody to
join my team and that's just
specifically that it's easier to get
developers to speak developer ease if
you will to the rest of the organization
one hundred percent I've built
operations security teams and now it's
looking for developers who want to do
something different want to learn new
skills maybe want to expand over into
management later learn how to start
doing team building and stuff like that
like everything is programming now and
security folks moving in development are
typically not the greatest developers
and I've at this stage like everything
we're doing is programming so I'm
looking for for developers no it
actually no security experience is
actually probably better yeah come in
with that the folks that come in with
baggage actually take longer to learn
how to do this and so it's absolutely
true the other one all that is is I get
to work with a lot of the great teams of
empathy and bridge building are big
components that you don't succeed in
DevOps if you can't bridge functions and
when you add security it adds even more
complication number people that you need
to talk to and if you if you can't have
a risk conversation with an executive
and a technical aversive developer and
have the ability to have empathy with
both those people it's very hard to
succeed well security people haven't
really worked on large teams security as
it is now is frequently a very sort of
solitary environment and everything now
is teams and cross-functional so someone
who's worked on teams is also central
we're in a slightly more unusual
position we have access to quite a lot
of people with a huge amount of security
knowledge and so we have found good
technical people there we work with with
all kinds of people who have security
background to have written software have
operated real services have spent a long
time doing that but we still find when
hiring new people it's much easier for
us to hire somebody who has a software
development background a technical
architecture background and teach them
security because we have a massive
security people the one place I'd be
wary of that is if you don't have any
security people in your organization
already actually that's where you
probably do want to hire somebody who
has a security background to kick start
that process I think the other thing is
people who are willing to bang down your
door to do this job are the first people
you should hire they absolutely are so
I'm gonna shift gears a little bit we
should talk political things like
Snowden what and I'm just kidding
actually one of the questions for you is
can we get some technical details of the
tools you use and I said probably not
all right you just have to buy them a
pint first James question for you it
sounds like gauntlet can call lots of
security tools and you lots of security
use cases what are some of the really
basic first ones if you don't know what
sequel injection is and what not like oh
and what other tools are in this kind of
emerging tool chain yeah it's a good
question um yeah the gauntlet in that
gauntlet demo we have a bunch of
different examples that you can put in
inside there I think it's helpful to
pick one of the robic problems with with
kind of implementing security testing
inside of your build pipeline is you
could really slow the bill down and if
you take a security tool like like a
rack knee or something like that it's a
it's a scanner first it like spiders the
whole site and it tries to like tries to
exercise the whole site and try to like
pin test it and then you know after like
five hours like he crashes or whatever
but that's because that's because you
know it's like gets stuck in a loop or
something like that and and so the way
that you really have to
work on implementing gauntlet and a lot
of these other type of tools into your
infrastructure is you have to be very
very specific about what you're what
you're actually going to attack and yeah
so I think some of the tools like like
just taking Arachne and just looking for
like cross-site scripting on a single
page like I think that's a really
helpful thing you can take mozilla has a
they have a tool a python script called
gar mer and you can run garber which is
an opinionated way that they view a web
application security and you can just
say yeah if it does doesn't pass all
these garner techs or you know fifty
percent of them or whatever then I'm
going to call it call it a failure so
plugging in some of those those things
are useful so we heard today quite a few
times and I was asked on the break but
not online what the heck is a blue team
or red team or are all hackers the same
so who wants to take a stab at Blue Team
Red Team purple team good and then also
maybe profile breaker build or fix right
up like yeah absolutely so a blue team
is basically a team of folks that pull
in instrumentation logging details about
how something might be abused and the
behavior you might see that's anti to
how a workload has been created and so a
blue team is really important trying to
figure out how to operate and so you'll
see things like security operations they
do activities around forensics Incident
Response detection and containment you
could imagine a scenario where your
instrumentation alerts at one thirty in
the morning because an attacker is going
after your website and so that might
come in and you as a blue team member
will be the first person to take that
alert and go and triage it on your
website so it's a good way of thinking
about it a red team member is someone
who actually actively hacks and exploits
and specifically exploits in production
so they're going out and looking at your
web application and be
basically or your other tools that might
be out there you might have web services
and they're looking for opportunities to
act like an attacker and see how far
they can get with their their testing oh
I'll just follow up an unread team the
fact that you're here hopefully means
you're not really exposed to this but
red team she's in a very like
progressive environment red team
typically means in order to affect
security change we need to self hack
ourselves because the other party will
not do basic upgrades I'm not upgrading
my windows XP system I'm on deadline so
the red team has to come in break
something okay now I'm forced to upgrade
that's actually how broken large
companies typically are and that's what
Red Team typically means is it coming
that's brought in to go affect change we
just serve a sad slow and ineffective
way of doing it now builder breaker
fixer what was the question they're
afraid selves a builder breaker fixer I
don't know who wants to grab this one
one thing I'll say about red teaming is
what I think modern SAS providers and
DevOps shops are far more likely to
avail themselves a red teaming to
traditionally the idea attacking your
ecommerce site during production is like
enough to give people heart attacks fire
into it what it'll typically we don't
pay a lot of money does have someone Red
Team you and you'll say you're only
allowed to ski in these IP addresses and
only do these things because if you look
cross-eyed at that server it might crash
and real attackers don't care yeah so
it's a it's an emerging thing with the
attitude of be mean to your code is
making this a more common behavior and
I'd say it goes beyond being mean to
your code an attacker is not going to
call you and schedule an appointment to
break into your site they're not usually
and and it takes a little bit of time
and effort to get management to think
like this the one rule we do have that
we've put in places as a red team member
you are not allowed to take anything
down so that's the major rule for us and
really careful about how we think about
things if we could take something down
we actually put that down in our
findings and we operate that every day
so you're going to find that this is a
really interesting and unusual style but
to their point where Lee we're leading
in this area in space and we're bleeding
edge so we're banging our head a lot
yeah I mean so those are you who from an
Operations background do you do game
days around disaster recovery anybody
doing game days at the moment one the
background so game days a fairly common
in in well fairly common they're
becoming more common in in operations
and it's it's the time when you say to
the operations team we're going to get
like somebody's going to going to make
something fail in production and we're
going to see how you respond you get to
test out all of your all of your
automated response processes and a red
team is the same thing it's it's a
security team doing that same process
they're saying we're going to make stuff
fail and we're not gonna tell you what
we're going to make fail we're going to
find out do you detect it how quickly
can you respond and do you fix the right
thing one of the critical things that we
have with red team's is that we
generally have to make sure some
reasonably senior people know they're
going on because the first time we've
tried it somebody tried to you know
raise up quite high to the security
services that we were being hacked and
we had to say no no don't tell them
because because we don't really want
them to come in guns blazing to the
other side of the office because it'll
really upset people so you do have to
have some exective buy-in and we alert
like people like cert and so forth we're
doing this if you get information coming
from somewhere or you notice something
that we didn't it's okay we know it's
happening and they know how to call us
and we can coordinate with other
agencies and other organizations to make
them behave the same way so we can say
what happens if we get red teamed bar
you call certain they don't respond
because you know the emergency cyber
emergency response team they may not
respond in a real thing there might be
something else going on does the team
know what to do if they don't respond do
they know how to handle that so doing
that cross organizational stuff is an
important part of that as well so you
have to build it up one step at a time
and I want to encourage anybody that
really honest it does want to ask a
question that did not do so here please
think of that and raise your hand one
last thought on blue team if you have
folks that are actively attacking your
Apple
occasions and nothing's being detected
and there are no alerts and there isn't
any activity happening to contain you
likely don't have an effective blue team
that's it said tightly we I think it
takes it takes a lot of exercise to get
there we are we actually bring in yeah
so I will so when we're bringing in
large amounts of data how do you
determine it attack in large amounts of
data versus when you have no data at all
and it's actually a really very good
question this has to do with how red
team and blue team play together a red
team member is helping you to figure out
how to sift data and actually how to get
really good at writing the rules to
transform large data sets and actually
find anomalies and behavioral
differences between how something should
be operating and how something actually
does operate hey most cases and security
it's noise to signal not single the
noise yeah that's and anyway some of
that obviously one you know what you
need to look at every log in to see
which one's fail or which ones could be
unique yeah that that iOS process and
automation is I'll even go one step
further which is to give you an example
of you know we see a lot of noise with
break-ins these days because attackers
are moving over to cloud-based services
and we've taken our minds and actually
wrapped ourselves around the problem
space to find out that we shouldn't be
worried about where things are coming
from but where they're actually
traveling to so which application server
which IP address is in play what kinds
of anomalies are we seeing and just
changing how we think about the problem
is a way to detect things in a different
way I'm going to shift a little bit
based on some questions here and over
breaks how many raise your hands if you
think docker or something like docker is
kind of awesome
okay razor keep your hand up if you
think the supply chain principles this
morning might be pretty valuable okay
now Nick pointed out that you can't
necessarily have both when you're
grabbing a container from the intertubes
or from a hub it's Providence origin
quality and hygiene of the open source
that went into it is opaque to you in
current state so would you like to say a
few things what's that that's what
content just for you and crystal you're
talking about wrecking stuff on on a
friday as well love you want to frame
that oh yes sir based on talk i did a
few februari wow it's now half a year
ago the beauty of containers and vm
shipping is first awesome so don't make
me think I'm disparaging anything the
problem was so like VMS and containers
is that the tools most security and
operation people have are sort of
neutered by them what i mean is let's
say you want to scan all your machines
40 latest openssl version for instance
that's fairly trivial in server
traditional you know you can do
distributed shell and log in and do you
know d packaged a shell or whatever
version control system you have for your
operating system what package lists you
have for things that are shipped
opaquely such as containers or perhaps
some other examples we're not able to
log in there's no way of quickly
building a manifest of what's on that
box that's not the end of the world that
just means security has to sort of
engage itself into the release
engineering process and that's just new
it's not bad it's not good it's it's
something we have to sort of keep in
mind yeah in fact I think you exploded
John Melissa's brain from docker so
we're doing a talk at the DevOps
Enterprise summit on immutable delivery
meets supply chain transparency and
there's ways to solve it right now and
is Chris alluded to and probably lose
adding a slide right now people are
trying to address this after the banyan
report of all the known vulnerabilities
in docker hub
but it's something that is proof point
of why rugged and DevOps need to work
together so we you know we did some red
teaming on docker as well and one of the
things we determined is doctors a great
technology for us to deploy Red Team
tools to the actual instances and we
also did a profiler agent that gets
deployed out to the workloads so it's
really cool technology and we've learned
how to not only do those things but also
intercept traffic and really take
advantage of it so it does actually have
a lot of benefits as well as from a
security perspective we're learning a
lot in this environment I would say the
jury's still out but it's a it's a
unique capability for a security person
to develop a docker container and
actually ship it out to the same set of
systems and be able to leverage it as
though it's part of the environment I
mean why one of the Dockers the crypto
frameworks are very unclear to date and
how you you know how you apply grip
Sharon and docker is still something
that has a lot of work to do you can
encrypt under containers so you can
encrypt files in containers but the
strategy for them is interesting what
goes along with some of them provenance
until as you pick up now one of the
objections I believe to my talk was it
sounded like I was maybe bashing open
source and I would be very clear I think
the software supply chain opportunity is
for closed source open source back some
of the worst offenders are the COTS
vendors themselves I was simply using a
lot of open source statistics because
that's ninety percent or more of the of
the attacks last year just because
that's the most economy depended upon
stuff and similarly we're not bashing
docker we love this stuff it's more the
opportunity to do better so I think one
one last question I'll ask everybody is
most of what you've heard today is the
security community trying to adapt its
traditional thinking to a DevOps context
today but when i talked to adrian we
talked about you know with lambda server
instances only exist for seconds or less
than a second so therefore maybe you
know attacker can't maintain persistence
so there's ways to use some of this
content
his delivery ephemeral computing
immutable delivery software-defined
everything to maybe do some things we've
never been able to do with security
before like father so I want to ask you
to you what's what's most exciting if
you project out a year from now how
could if we have this loving embrace
between the rugged community and the
DevOps community what might really get
sexy anybody wanna go first um the thing
I'm looking for to which is the dullest
thing in the world but security tools at
the moment are almost always designed to
be run by a human one at a time in a
year's time I'm hoping they'll all have
api's they'll all be automatable and it
will make too much everything better I
think the sexiest thing is actually
having a contribute back model where
everybody wants to participate and make
security better for all of the
applications that are out there what I
would I aspire to most is to be able to
basically provide that forum for the
three thousand developers we have it
into it and have that sort of leak
outside of our company to start to
become the practice that gets engaged in
across the industry most excited most
excited actually for more people and
development to move into security and
this is sort of not quite the question
but we said before like this is a huge
opportunity and a huge shift and people
like yourselves have a role to play and
that's that's the really exciting part
and let me tell you any one of you says
like hey you know what that's cool i'm
going to do Devin security I can't do
the dollar pound conversion but you're
adding on a substantial amount like the
skills for development and security are
like on fire hot right now like it is
unbelievable and I'm really looking
forward to sort of taking your knowledge
of served like how to build things well
into security cuz I was like this huge
gap right now it's if you enter security
you'll be like wow that some of its
great but a lot of is like wow this is
really primitive stuff like this is
really this is it like this is the magic
it's like wow I could have done this a
long time ago and made a lot more money
right like so I'm really looking
mmm looking forward to you development
gained a much more engaged in security
and operations and just making it much
more interesting sort of workplace yeah
I think we we saw a big shift you know
even like two years ago you still having
a lot of conversations of like why
should we do DevOps like really isn't
that stupid or you know stuff like that
and then now it's like you don't have to
have that conversation anymore it's like
it's already happened and I think the
same thing is happening with security i
can already kind of see like like you
know imprints of that and so I'm excited
to see that unfold you know of course
I'm excited about you know to lean and
all that kind of stuff that's come
around but I think that's the bigger
push I want to see some existing
security tools died that year so one of
the one of the premises and security is
like you know people say you'll never
turn off the security tool because then
an adversarial just revert to that old
attack but which by i think is parsley a
valid argument but doesn't there's a lot
of tools it doesn't apply to a lot of
what we do in security is dealing with
the fact that we choose you know we buy
things based on you know cost we build
them as fast as we can and we don't
actually build you know secure rugged
things and I think that if we if we got
that right if we you know if we chose
components that that had you know strong
attributes we we had your even a a mild
discipline i wrote a 12 got a 12-step
check for a secure code in like nineteen
ninety-seven and i bet eight ninety
percent of things would fail it today
just simple stuff forks will be
controlled you know the basic things
that that would fail i think if we got
those things right what what security
does would be completely different that
we could focus on the signal to noise
problem we could focus on you know
creating speed in the organization that
today a lot of it is is dealing with
technical debt and sins elsewhere the
organization and I think we solve that
and make security more fun it makes
everyone's job more fun and it makes us
faster so I want to kill some security
tools
all right I think we have only about one
minute left are there any other burning
issues or questions have people found
this mildly valuable okay cool well the
good news is you're going to have a
significant amount of additional rugged
content on friday starting off i believe
with you Nick Chris Juan some privacy
talks so thank you for your time today
we are eager to team with you and make
more awesomeness together than we could
apart so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
