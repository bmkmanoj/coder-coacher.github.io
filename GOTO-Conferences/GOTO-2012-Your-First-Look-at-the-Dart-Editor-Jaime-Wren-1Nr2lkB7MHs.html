dart project specifically on the dart
editor and so dart is a new language it
was released a year ago at this
conference very cool language I'm not
going to be talking about the language
too much although walls actually see
some code most of this talk is going to
be a demo will actually go in and
actually look at the tool so the project
that work on is the dart editor and it
was a pretty cool opportunity to work on
a new tooling new source code editor for
a new language lets you start from
scratch and say okay what do we you know
what do developers need for language for
a new language right specifically
because everybody coming to the language
is going to be new and so it's pretty
unique and I'm going to just show what
kind of walk through some of the some of
the things that we've had to emphasize
and do in a language and and yeah so
that's that's we're going to talk about
so the first thing since everybody's new
to dart is to make sure that it's easy
for new people right so make sure that
it's very quick to get bootstrapped and
actually see a dart application running
in dartium and i'll show you what
dartium is here shortly to understand
the different integration points between
the different pieces of dart and
different tools and since it is a new
tool itself an easy way to send feedback
that turned out to be one of the best
features that we put into our tool and
hopefully after a few hours or days
users are going to demand other things
and they're going to demand things like
you know code completion and search and
errors and warnings and quick fixes and
things that they're already familiar
with being that they're going to be
developing and such a new language it's
going to be you know important that
they've got kind of tooling that they're
used to and kind of look familiar and so
let's see in the slides I have a few
screenshots but we're just going to go
straight to a demo and show all this so
demo so this is the dart editor and if
you're familiar at all with eclipse and
you probably have recognized that this
is an RCP it's a set of plugins that
we've run we actually
do have a plug-in story but it's not
what we emphasize we emphasize the dart
editor the the RCP and if you are
curious about why we made that decision
feel free to come find me I'll be around
so right off the bat like I said send
feedback right there so we can send
feedback we can you know append Logs
with extra information and anything that
goes in here goes to the entire dart
editor's inbox so it's very quick way to
iterate on the tool especially for new
users we also have the Preferences right
on the top toolbar and if you can if you
see up in the top right-hand corner
there's a little icon saying that
there's actually a new version to be
downloaded and that's right here so
download updates automatically and this
just like in chrome how you can say okay
I would like to update now and it shuts
down the application and the reboots it
similar kind of experience very kind of
streamlined especially compared to
eclipse if you're familiar with the
clips and then one of the other things
that we wanted unlike clips and unlike
other tools is really we had the goal
the very beginning and stayed that way
for a while is no preferences whatsoever
there should be very few preferences
simply because titted to minimize the
surface area of the UI and to really get
the user experience right and if you
have too many preferences especially at
the beginning then you can't can't do
that as easily so one of the first
things I mentioned was it should be easy
to get bootstrapped with simple some
dart code and so with two clicks we can
do that and so this is what you see when
you launch the dart editor and if I
click on the clock sample it loads in
the clock sample puts it over here and
shows me the dart class so sorry the the
dart file and with another click I can
launch it and it launches dartium
dartium is what we call chromium with
the dart VM built into it and it is
running and it shows me the frames per
second down here and it happened quickly
so
let me go ahead and just close this down
let's say that we want another sample to
go start exploiting let's go I
particularly like this one it's the
solar and we can launch it and again the
dart VM starts up quickly dartium
chromium starts up quickly and the user
is running dart code to cliques turned
out to be pretty important especially
for trying to get to learn dart code
quickly that was a hard requirement so
that's dartium that's the dart VM can
run your dart code in the browser in the
vm but one of the cool features of dart
is that we have the dart2js compiler so
compiles dart code down to javascript
for you and you can do all of this on
the command line you can also do it
inside of the editor so from the solar
sorry Leslie jumped o'clock so you can
simply go to tools generate JavaScript
and it'll go through and generate
JavaScript but if we want an even easier
experience and this is a little more
complicated but still relatively simple
is let's say that we want a new
JavaScript launch JavaScript clock and
we're going to let's say we want Firefox
launching our JavaScript generate
version of this application so when you
hit run it launches dart to J's in the
background thread it's going to print
out the output and it puts the generate
generated JavaScript right next to our
dart file and then it's going to fire up
Firefox and here we go so as simple as
that so you've got dart editor you have
dart going on dart to J's call all kind
of seamlessly integrated so I'm going to
quit Firefox here now those are all
samples it's also important to have a
you know some new content generate it be
relatively simple so a few clicks we can
do that so hello
go to generates new content and we're up
and running and this is the hello world
sample and users are now developing dart
code so there you have it so that's the
how to get bootstrapped inside of the
dart editor for the first time so now I
want to show some of the actual so more
advanced features so as you move on so
search so a search experience instead of
other editors whatnot can be cumbersome
with lots of dialogues I don't know if
you're familiar with the Eclipse
dialogues you can specify you know I
would like to search for a particular
field named this with this particular
scope very powerful God we took a
slightly different approach which was to
have just a search box at the top to say
okay I'm searching for something and I'm
just gonna start typing it in and so
from here we can say okay this is using
the information we know about the
language and all the analysis we've run
over the code this is going to be a
particular you know class or they may
want to search for the text inside of
all the files they have opened in this
case I start to type in planetary body
and the class pops up and that's
actually what I'm searching for so let's
go to that so these are each of these
objects are the things whizzing around
the Sun around the planets and so inside
of the dart editor not only do we have
in a different commands for quickly
editing code cut copy paste all the
kinds of standard things we also have
run a lot of analysis over to do things
like the searching to do things like
call hierarchy so let's say okay let me
fine I'm trying to figure out this code
let me find figure out who calls this
class who constructs this class to
figure out where this planets are all
coming from and here's a method called
start and it's called 11 times from
inside this and if we zoom zoom through
here we can see you know we've got our
deferred planets
so one of the unique things about the
dart language is that it's obsolete iped
so in this particular code I can specify
that Jupiter is going to be a planetary
body I can also specify that it's just a
variable in runtime we ignore types it
runs faster again I'm not going to get
into the language too much but inside of
the tool here what we can do is we can
infer the type if we don't know it so in
this case jupiter has been declared as a
variable but when we come down here we
can say okay jupiter and i'm going to
show this little bit of code completion
Jupiter dot add up now a new planetary
body around Jupiter now in source code
it's declared as a variable but we've
actually done some type inference here
so some pretty interesting a little bit
more powerful tooling inside of the
editor so here we can say new planetary
body new planetary body and we'll get
standard nice simple things that
developers are kind of used to code
completion so now we can go through fill
in our very arguments and and we're good
to go so one of the cool benefits of
programming and dart it is a web
language is the quick turnaround and
when javascript or any web developer is
working on the web one of the coolest
features is that you can say okay reload
the page I just made a text change
reload the page again I just made
another text change and so I want to
show that off a little bit so I said
earlier that the vm is pretty fast and
so we actually have this story in here
so let's say so let's run the solar
example again and I'm going to leave
dartium up right behind me so I'm at
around 46 47
frames per second let me do a little bit
testing stress testing perhaps on my
application let's say that I want to see
how it performs with a few more
asteroids in the asteroid belt so I'm
going to save I'm going to come over
here and hit reload and now we're down
to about 13 frames per second and you
can see all the extra asteroids around
so the quick turnaround of being able to
cook it say okay modify a piece of code
refresh my browser is something that
developers don't lose even though
they're working in a more strongly typed
language than uh than other languages on
the web and so again I mean we can do it
again so we can say okay well if he does
have one asteroid asteroid belt refresh
and and no surprise we're running at
higher frames per second so this is a
quick turnaround is something I watched
show off and finally since it is a vm
and we are you know calling out to it we
have a debugger so i'm going to show off
debugging support and then i'm going to
be out of time so here is clock we go
ahead and launch it and it's generating
the javascript for me let's go ahead and
make sure that we launched the correct
clock and there's a loop going through
in my clock sample that's making sure
everything's drawn and every second it's
called so if i set a breakpoint debugger
is going to pop up saying you just hit a
break point and from here I can explore
the top level objects fields everything
in the current object and then local
variables things like hover are also
supported and with that my 15 minutes is
about up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
