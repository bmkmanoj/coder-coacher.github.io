going on and get a goodie if you r 8 12
them so today could be your day there we
go a little more interesting slide is at
the top of st. Peter's I haven't been to
London about 15 years and I'm really
really enjoying it my name is Nick
Galbraith founder and CTO of a company
in Los Angeles called signal sciences
hey there's me and we're talking today
about like rugged software engineering
which is a bit vague and recently I've
previously have been sort of the poster
child for continuous deployment and I'm
going to talk a little bit more about
that and why I think my previous talks
have failed and how we can use this to
actually make much more robust software
but yes los angeles i put that in is to
be a jerk the offices are literally like
three blocks away from here it's quite
amazing and my background is software
engineering it is development it's not
concept you know I'm programmer every
day I saw this in think Washington DC
I'll know this is like your career
development path or whatever but I
thought web developer to alcohol and
drug counseling was somewhat of an
interesting interesting transition for
someone anyway software engineering like
I love software engineer and I love
programming I love building things you
do too right so I was in before this I
was in Rome for a week and you're going
to see a lot of family photos forced on
you in this in this talk okay so what is
software engineering I'm using that word
very intentionally versus developer
programming coding all that other stuff
and really you know the definition
really trite intro to any word is
technology
concern with the design building and use
of software like oh good it's kind of
dull right it's it's not computer
science and it's not day-to-day coding
right and really it's all of us and what
I mean by that is this is a very dev
centric talk I mean a conference but
really everyone is doing software
engineering the QA guys the operations
people even the product people could
fall into that definition like the QA
and operations people and the security
people are writing code you know it's
everyone is writing code now so instead
of developer software development
lifecycle I'm really trending toward the
word software engineering because I
really like is there's no stigma
attached like hey you're doing frontline
dev hey maybe you want to go manage the
QA team for a while why not its software
engineering but right now that's a
little weird people don't do that and
professional programmers such as
yourself could really add a lot of value
sort of jumping around to different
teams okay so Josh mentioned this
previously this came out 2011 software's
eating the world and you know all of us
have done amazing things in the last
five years like software is eating the
world we are building incredible
incredible things right the world the
software hey right back at ya we've
leveled up so much we are in so much
critical stuff we are a huge target now
and literally doing this talk every day
in the paper you'll see it I'm finding
stuff about how software and how choices
are made about how you develop made by
non definitely not programmers so you're
seeing the introduction of crime
absolutely politics or something today
about the UK data privacy bill
regulation liability ethics and money of
course and every one of those
right and so this is Jeff Moss he
started I believe Def Con and black hat
black hats like the big security hacker
conference and Jeff interests and I have
seen us talked twice in Japan and less
recently in Las Vegas mr. black hat mr.
punk rock of software is going you know
what I don't think can be fixed without
software liability like he's saying that
I don't know what the right physical
analogy is but for the guy to be doing
that thing's got to be really bad really
bad I forgot to cut in a picture of her
but what a software liability mean you
know we're going to do a really crappy
job with software liability for a long
time and the people who will suffer will
be the innovators startups not the
established companies that is like an
arrow to my heart like that is what I do
and making things go slower is like
that's the antithesis of what we are all
here today lean agile secure rugged it's
going to we'll get to that in a second
okay united states treasury handles
finance i'm not sure what the equivalent
is in the UK but pretty sure the
treasury should not be involved with how
software's made it's just it's bizarre
but what's really interesting sorry I'm
trust and the camera I'm normally much
more animated about two billion dollars
worth of premiums have be sold sold most
of the United States but the market is
growing substantially like a bad idea
from the US broadcast all over the world
it's coming here and what's important
about that is that's two billion dollars
away from stuff that actually does
something I'm not saying software's
insurance isn't important or whatever
but that's like a lot of money and I'm
pretty sure the Treasury official isn't
the best person to be making these types
of decisions on what's good for cyber
security it's it gets more interesting
recently I'm not quite sure of the the
ratio here this was in the United States
automakers to establish real-time
monitoring to immediately detect report
and stop hacking attempts in their cars
well I'm principle that's not a horrible
idea but I don't think car manufacturers
are really capable of doing that who's
building that where is that data go and
there's all sorts of stuff around it but
it's just a it's I don't think these
guys actually know what's enough to do a
law that's actually going to make sense
that's going to affect everything it's
going to be some bizarre solution that's
not going to do anything why not do this
do this for everything right like why
not just mandate more gunk in everything
it doesn't do anything it's ridiculous
and I'd be all right with the government
making decisions if they had a little
better track record do as I say not as I
do USA government I met some lovely
people from UK digital service at this
conference I don't know how you guys are
doing United States is crap at building
software right three-quarters of all
government websites mobile applications
fail their initial security reviews and
the Buried lead is after eat after a
year only twenty-seven percent are fixed
like it's it's mind-boggling right and
the integrity of our profession this
came out in the Financial Times a guess
about a week ago and what's fascinating
about this is one is governments are
subverting your work they're paying
people to break your code what's also
interesting about this is this is a
planted article is content free no news
happen in this articles on page two
nothing new happened but its United
States and UK officials say oh yes China
and Russia doing these horrible things
to our stuff I mean do you think the
United States UK aren't doing this as
well absolutely they are there's no news
china and russia's the bad guy this is a
planted article for propaganda purposes
which is like doubly bad whether you
agree with it or not it's irrelevant
it's a it's not a news story
and again it's so government's not
really going to save us and Security's
not security software industry is not
going to save us this came out recently
Mudge is sort of a famous you know
legendary hacker guy but who he is
irrelevant he's definitely connecting
the United States government this popped
out a nice tweet feed its unsourced
unfortunately it looks like it came out
about a couple years ago but if you read
the small print approved for public
release distribution unlimited on
average one third of vulnerabilities in
government systems is in the security
software and that is because here's
here's the current security industry and
is where I burn myself big-time security
Esther has been mostly founded by
security people hackers right hackers
know how to break things they are not so
good at building things so relying on
software security software companies to
like save you is it's tough it hasn't
really grown up yet anyway so the and
this was from 2013 and like just in the
last week you know security software
still a rich source of bugs kaprisky who
did patch and push in a day so props to
them for doing it but it was a remote
zero interaction system exploit in the
default config like literally his tweed
is like poetry like that is about as bad
as it gets like shockingly bad right and
again you know fireEye's in the news a
lot I came and keep up with it but I
don't know if you guys have seen what a
zero-day looks like so this guy came out
and said hey fire eye this box he put in
front of your universe it's going to
protect you from bad stuff remote root
filesystem access 0 de fire I is a
publicly traded company it's a mature
organization they do a lot of revenue
and here's your zero day dot dot slash
dot dot slash etsy password and the
entire file since
as exposed that's from a security
company right this is you know and also
runs as rude and it's PHP and it just
goes on and on on on it's it's it's just
ridiculous right and you know last week
I think it's last week and losing track
of days at 44 con which if I knew exist
I would have shown up I didn't cut and
paste the guys tweet he you know exposed
more stuff and the answer was injunction
was an American company to you know a UK
conference injunction saying do not
present like bad really bad and you know
and again we're seeing the effects of
legislation and liability creep into our
industry you know this is in Japan HP
pulled out because they're a little
concerned of a new law called Wes and
that's not new law it's an old law it
prevents trade of like guns and weapons
to enemy countries and and whatnot and
they're trying to like push and software
again into it and you're seeing HP they
pulled out of the conference million
bucks it's been a min sorry they spent a
million bucks researching if they should
go to the conference I'm pretty sure the
conference didn't cost a million dollars
to do but they just drop the million
dollars Phil meet legal team it's like
the two billion going for insurance you
know so again through this and doesn't
really fit in the deck but whatever it's
not like this stuff is super hard like I
don't know what your background is on
security it's not ridiculously hard to
do then Guido if I know in New York with
trail bits he had an intern from the
summer and you can read it for yourself
you know he I don't even think new see
learn to use a fun zur learn to use gdb
pop 20 day in VLC player I mean it's not
the most you know whatever but it's like
he went from nothing to basically as
complicated as it gets in terms of
exploit development it this is stuff we
can't do it is not magic black box a
six-year-old can do it you guys can do
it
this is a little sort of artificial
example but goes the point of like dot
dot slash slash does it so my point is
like what's happening is in the outside
world to the software industry are sort
of like frequently bad solutions that
are going to force us to go slower and
junk we don't want spending money away
from us two billion dollars is coming
out of someone's pocket it's called our
salaries and probably not as functional
and so this is actually outside my house
as cat is here every day like it wants
to jump out of the window like every day
and it you can't do it cuz on the second
floor like it's a real problem and it's
it's mostly because of our are not
pointing fingers but it's like our
inability to do really basic stuff and
software we're doing great things but
we've been so focused on you know
functions we haven't really focused that
much and gain it right and this is stuff
we absolutely can do unless our talk
about some tricks and some stuff I've
done previously and currently that sort
of helped the flow okay so what went
wrong lovely view of the roman forum
right so the number one thing is
security is really invisible to your
organization it just most people have no
interaction with it most executives have
really they have a very binary view and
it is everything's fine oh now we're
breached we're on Wall Street Journal
right like or Financial Times or
whatever your favorite business
publication is it's a very binary event
and those types of things people really
don't care for executives actually do
not care for surprises and someone
surprises happen it actually just
discounts the industry even more it's
like these people don't know what
they're doing just it's really bad it's
very toxic to the whole set set up the
other thing we've been doing is security
is a specialized thing that only super
specialists can do and we've pretty much
higher you know 110 1 ratio James
mentioned at LAN
yesterday it's a roughly correct
everywhere I was just thinking of my
previous companies i've been at 100 devs
10 ops one security person and what's so
difficult not moving what's interesting
about that one what's their
responsibility okay most of them got a
lot of compliance and legal gunk that
they have to do and that's just part of
the world that's just a cost you got to
do and that that's fine but then they're
also supposed to check everyone's code
make sure the networks secure the move
it breaches all this other stuff if
you're that one guy and you got 110
people pushing on you to go faster how
pleasant do you think your job is what's
your immediate reaction right no no way
cuz that's all that's pretty much the
only tool you got the other thing is it
and because of that there's no way one
person can insert themselves in this one
hundred and ten other people so it's
really the waterfall model it like is
this blocker right everything comes
through and you can sort of see the
solution I'm sort of getting that here's
well it's 110 1 ratio and you cannot
hire out of it there's not enough money
in the world for you to buy people to
boost that number they just don't exist
softwares only better what web software
what 20 years max maybe a few hundred
people are doing it more than 10 years
not that many people out there I've
never even thought of it that way okay
no wonder wise name though so many
people right you can't hire out of it so
you sort of see the solution is well
some of these people better start
stepping up and doing other things right
we'll get to that in just a sec I think
we've done is like as an industry we've
done this very strange job and our
software development lifecycle and
there's tons of stuff in here that's
great and if your organization is
actually doing this that's great but i
guarantee you almost no one is doing
this and the way it's structured is
pretty much designed to disenfranchise
us developers
it starts off with go sends the devs to
security camp once a year once a year
that's what actually says if you go to
it's like Oh make sure the developers go
to security training once a year I'm
pretty sure that's exactly not how
people learn that's like hey we're going
to we're going to learn you know Italian
we're going to go to one day class on
Italian and I expect you to be
completely fluent with all our Italian
customers like that's just not how stuff
works right and it it it's just anyway
so it has all sort of stuff like up
front design and use static analysis
gray use threat modeling perform fuzz
testing super weird only very
specialized conduct final security
review certify release and archive
followed by execute incident response
plan basically push it then wait for it
to get broken what an awesome message
like that's just like completely not
secure right it's not secure it's not
interesting it's actually horrible and
ridiculous right and the other thing is
in the news you see all this stuff like
just enormous gobs of stuff on oh you
know this is a state sponsor really
sophisticated tack there is absolutely
no way this could have been done by a
complete we just saw a zero-day
right what was that dot dot slash betsy
password most of the breaches are not
targeted they're not like Stuxnet where
they're doing like embedded firmware to
go in the nuclear reactor and do stuff
it's really basic stuff why is it really
basic stuff because that's all you need
to do you don't need to develop advanced
stuff you got really basic fundamental
flaunting going on yeah it's failing at
the easy stuff we're building great
stuff but we're just like what what is
this I just threw it in here it's I read
this i'm just like i have no
idea what's going on here like we are
failing at easy stuff like sashimi like
that's like sliced fish pizza like
that's pretty so like what is going on
here I can't even know what a micro mix
isn't I've never heard of a reed onion
you know I I don't know what's happening
it's just it's just we do great things
and we're just forgetting some basics
and that's okay we'll figure it out so
josh has been he was in the back there
he's been doing this thing I am the
cavalry which uh Josh you will not like
this summary but it's a plea to safety
critical industries please do something
about security and actually done some
really fantastic work involving medical
devices is working with auto industry so
it's not that government can't be doing
good but I mean really it's it's do
something websites are little different
but websites are also now collecting
vast troves of personal information it
we all are in the same boat right and so
actually it's not I am the Calvary Josh
you love this we are the cavalry how do
you like that that's from yesterday
maybe you're in there it based on the
points it's not for security people to
fix security it's it's our job to fix
security well pretty much the source of
the bugs to begin with right that's
that's fine but we really have to own up
to it and it means doing things a little
differently and and really I understand
that it's great talking about this but
you really need management buy-in
someone's I say hey we've got to make
things better and you can talk to your
boss push it but it's really action it
does that makes the change okay rugged
what is it how am I do it for time that
20 minutes got a lot of stuff why rugged
we haven't really discussed why that
word is I don't think it's that common
place and the reason is security what's
what type of what type of emotion are
they playing on here this is just a
random one I just pulled off some
Twitter feed a while ago it's fear right
has nothing to do with development at
all it's designed like hey
cover your ass and you get breached
that's what it says to me I mean it's
just really bad hey it's I'll explain
this later so maybe in unfair
comparisons there are a lot of great
security guys and actually want to point
out that security guys actually have
really hard problems to solve except
they're not really allowed to do them
because they're stuck battling 110
people trying to push out stuff
compliance like endpoint security is
actually pretty tough like securing
laptops on 7 it's it's tough so which
which side would you rather be on
dynamic risk-based continuous cross-team
hopefully appealing versus static list
based discrete single team kind of a
tainted word for your fear based and my
former boss at Etsy really he just he
just left recently on to new things but
you know the whole point of what we've
been seeing here an sdlc and sort of
like development is hey once it's in
Prague it's done it's not my problem and
really and that's how product cycles are
and everything it's the whole industry
goes this but really it's a cycle and we
don't view it as such we viewed as like
this discrete event and its really it's
a great article I ask you to read it
some really interesting stuff and the
other thing a search for correctness
like software is not perfect it's
valuable flexible and so should our
processes and the other thing software
engineering is a team sport now I'm
contrary to what you might think I'm
more introverted and you know I need for
our blocks of time to do stuff I'm not
the lone seagull seen on our office you
know at the end of the day your code has
to interact with other people other
components other systems internal or
external and really it's about building
things together this is our office which
has a unusual outdoor space um it's
really about building things together
like it is not a nice laid thing it's
not about how clever you are it's not
how great of a programmer you are it's
really about how
your stuff be integrated and consumed by
others easily but what's great team
right team sport I used that word really
intentionally but you also have an
adversary that's something that's sort
of maybe you don't know that but you do
I have mentioned some examples of some
are even state-sponsored adversaries
this is a great things at the Getty
Center in Los Angeles these guys
actually had like metal weights in their
hand like that guys like bleeding that's
great mosaic and they do not play by
rules right so what are we going to do
cleaning up and really my view of the
world is their stuff in production and
their stuff not in production and
there's a sort of weird limbo zone
called deployment and I'm just going to
sort of walk through each one of these
to sort of present a different way of
thinking about software that's maybe a
little more resilient and a little more
friendly to others and hopefully give
you some ideas and improving your own
development process okay style matters
this guy is uh oh I can't quite noise
tile you run he runs security more or
less at freebsd and he runs a very
secure backup project hang exist like
expect complaints about white space
bubble on e sort of followed this up i
firmly believe that consistent clean
code makes it much easier finding fixed
bugs and that style conformance worsens
monotonically and you're like wow died
just pay a thousand pounds and nick just
spent 12 hours say like i need to indent
my source code actually yeah and i'll
tell you why first of all I talked to
this guy it's like oh you like that coil
you should really read my thing you
should read this from 2012 it's a
blockbuster and now his stuffs open
source but all your code is open source
inside your organization and he makes a
very strong case for men
he bugs are found by drive-bys people
got to go edit something and they're
looking at code in your organization
inside outside whatever but what's it
fascinating about this and if someone's
doing a PhD thesis here you go the
Buried lead somewhere in the middle
there muchas you did a study chopped up
freebsd source code and fifty percent
were styled fifty percent weren't styled
and the security bugs and non stylish
prep i mean you can read it for yourself
right that's shocking ugly code has more
bugs but gets less attention and what
does this mean it's really like writing
code so it can be read by others it's I
mean it's like it's not like a earth
mind-blowing thing to say but it makes a
difference that's huge I mean
religiously I feel it's a good thing to
do but this is actual you know fact
people will look at code that's prettier
okay that's not it do you guys use this
thing the United Kingdom you ever even
seen this book before okay well if
anything it helps americans learn how to
write correctly I spotter for my wife
who's fluent in English but you know
it's not our first language and as
Arrhenius like wow this is like just
like software be clear be if you need to
be obscure be obscure clearly don't take
shortcuts the cost of clarity avoid
foreign languages use the existing
libraries you have existing tooling you
have if you have to prefer the standard
to the offbeat this one's especially
important I'll talk about later young
writers will be drawn at every turn
toward eccentricities in the language
keep it simple just because the language
has a feature doesn't mean you got to
use it will get that in a second so this
isn't this is sort of the canonical
example why it matters okay here's a
function PHP see probably Java too and
here's your diff okay that looks pretty
good right except
it's not right this is not like many of
you have seen as before and aware of it
you know the one line dipped at a log
function just blew out something now
you're writing your critical function
every time I'll do it again it's not
like a magic trick yeah here's your diff
yeah it looks good please please deploy
that wonderful debug messages go do it
except it's missing braces so what
happens is it does that disaster right
same thing this isn't as bad but here's
your diff now oh I have to think about
what's going on here we placed one line
added three let's just add debug
statement like little details actually
matter and friendliness now this isn't
Italy it's like hey just because it
exists doesn't mean you have to use it
every language has exotic features weird
stuff don't wear them into church your
code as leads I think most people here
are it's your job to like Wolof sort of
weird stuff and the goal is not prevent
people from being brilliant the goal is
to enable everyone to read the code
again like security people QA people ops
people might be reading your code and
this sort of goes to the broken window
theory I'll know if it really applies
but it's like it when you see code that
looks well maintained guess what you cut
and paste no hey software's a lot of cut
and paste I do it all the time it's it's
when it's well-maintained people
continue to maintain it there's lots of
problems with this theory for crime but
in principle it's a good idea anyway
this is going through this and just like
having these sort of goals really makes
a big effect now okay truth and speaker
how am i doing we use mostly go that's
great because it has sort of a default
syntax awesome we use a ton of bash it's
a complete disaster everywhere we front
end is not my strength I haven't really
touched the javascript stuff we need to
start doing some of this
it's its work I mean it sounds really
easy butts like hey I'm mr. CTO of a
security company I'm not a hundred
percent doing it yet it takes work
sounds easy it takes work and it's
doubly hard for old projects but I was
going to jump ahead openssl heartbleed
this was I'm absolutely convinced you
ever saw the source code for this it
looked like someone just threw up in an
editor every file was different every
naming convention was different it was
incredibly unfriendly to anyone else
reading it right so anyway I'll just
jump back yeah yeah every language is
static analysis get that in clear out
those bugs as close as you can't if you
can run it in the editor even better
there's a product called break man I
probably the tool called break man for
Ruby devs it's awesome you type in
something that's completely crazy and
Ruby it's going to email you and say
like whoa you just committed something
that's completely ridiculous like it is
a phenomenal tool that actually most
editors should really try and edit
security testing yeah you can add it in
but I'll get back to that in a sec some
sort of running low on time here hendrik
theory the goal is wipe away all the
dumb stuff as soon as possible because
there's this theory only really applies
to certain cases there's a lot of
problems with this theory keeping the
floor queen clean doesn't necessarily
imply you know you're not going to hit
by lightning but for things like
software makes absolute sense because
the errors that cause security problems
are simple they really are okay what I
mean by this all of us this isn't just
for the software team configuration now
is software right QA guys are writing
software there's a ton of bash and glue
and stuff like that all these things
cause operational problems ok I'm going
to quickly do some continuous deployment
stuff and this is sort of the securities
view of continuous deployment right like
oh god please not the alien egg bonus
like that's what they feel about
continuous deployment like please don't
let that go out right Las Vegas is great
this is how we like to eat right yes I
just ate this down the street it was
great fully baked complete the problem
is what is a horrible physical
comparison what happens a good food
poisoning it all comes up right and
that's that's sort of the problem you do
this huge release there's any problem
it's very difficult finding the issue
you got to roll back the whole thing and
what you really want is smaller chunks
more often right this is from a couple
days ago and the word continuous really
means fluid and flexible doesn't mean
all the time does it mean hey Grape off
it goes it really means having some
flexibility in to what's going on and
this is a whole other talk and probably
something I should do a training on
because actually for people trying to do
continuous employment it's actually
unnatural to them because what you're
doing is let's say this is the commit
that comes in you're going to push this
out it's great one I can what can I tell
from this it's not used anywhere that's
the entire diff that functions so it's
safe not only that it's going to go
through all my style ending my static
analysis and my security checks right
away the developer is going to get
feedback now even with this this is the
diff what's wrong with this oh hey
developer don't see doc oh I don't know
what this function does please do hey I
didn't see a test go out with that with
even that small the change you can get
constructive feedback the 20-page diff
thing is it's a disaster no one reads it
and what then pick on what do they pick
on in really large code reviews style
that's the number one thing that happens
in really big code reviews I don't like
how this looks please do this make it
look like that not meet because it's so
overwhelming to people ok we'll we'll
get to this later the goal is for catia
point is
not updating software you're adding new
software pushing that into production
then deleting the old software it's a
little unnatural how we think of things
but it really works anyway here's
deployment the other thing is well
chasing the leaders right 30,000
employees at Amazon 60 per day at sea
ignore that that's their business Etsy's
mostly content right it's only a tiny
little part that's transaction and
that's handled really differently last
company is that we could do deploy once
every three days because that's how much
change our customers could handle it
took a long time for the feedback loop
to go through even to detect things
whatever is right for your business but
hey deployment shouldn't be an Italian
wedding it should be a regular thing
it's if you need to go out code can go
out without a whole lot of work and a
lot of fuss because people or fussing
over the deployment that's not actual
work like that that's like the actual
time it takes deploy is a waste of
everyone's time if your deployment was
one second that'd be great but people
don't do it and we'll get back to this
in two sec um you know this is jeremiah
from white hat you know average time to
fix a vulnerability is 150 days after
being reported the same with a
government thing we saw twenty-seven
percent only fixed you know this isn't
due to a technical problem and i
guarantee you those fixes are probably
one line changes but they're not going
out because it's sort of stuck in this
like constipated life cycle so this
doesn't just apply to websites and stuff
like this is reading the paper it's like
here's the UK government reminding
people to update their smartphone right
great continuous deployment also applies
to os's fact is you probably don't know
in fact i don't know i'm totally
guilty of this right now say Nick are
you up to date a patch level mmm have to
go ask someone it's not really visible
to me right now that's a problem I go
back and work on but they say like 50
most surprisingly update security patch
is 50% like that's super weird yep super
weird okay and you know security folks
have been really reluctant to continuous
deployment the love 40 acid love it for
patches but maybe not the full thing it
says because the chunks are too big this
the size is too big they don't have any
tools to help them and there are some
other stuff this is actually I just
thought of this actually last night I
was like I gotta think about this and
why let's go through here so why is
security really like negative on this
and especially because they have very
little control over what's going on
their only tool is no so far and we have
gotten really good at monitoring all
sorts of different things at real time
and there's whole talks about this on
every one of these right stats d you
know a number of things but what we
don't have is good security monitoring
that's done in real time what are the
attacks what are they attacking are they
being successful and making this visible
no one knows you push out something has
a sequel injection you don't know you
don't have any feedback on what so ever
and when the security guy does come it's
super annoying because he probably wrote
at six months ago and then it's going to
take another two months to get out now
you're going to be late for your
existing product it makes everyone nuts
right so how can we serve an able all
this and close the Leo the feedback loop
to to developers right and let's see
here so really it's instrumenting and
showing in real time of what's going on
right so this is probably something so
this is a little glimpse what my company
does you know we put this stuff in front
of customers and like what do you mean
that we're getting a sequel or email
regain attack from China like of course
you are everyone is constantly trying to
insert your favorite bad guy I don't
care Iceland
you know Brazil whatever it makes no
difference but even just having this
sort of basic stuff like okay here's
actually a cloud-based scanner it's
interesting because it caps out at about
you know 20 requests a minute it's very
gentle right what happens when mr.
hacker from I didn't put it here I think
it's Brazil come at the next slide
launches attack tooling which by the way
is off the shelf it's as fast as get
pull it's not secret it's not magic the
economics of attacks are really good
fifty cents an hour to go pound on
someone's website to find a
vulnerability or they make you know
fifty cents an hour good deal you should
hire them and you can by leveraging
their tax to find out what's going on
right so you dig into the detail you
make this stuff available it's like oh
huh using sequel map on this URL focused
on the guest parameter maybe I should
take a look at that let me tie my they
get the dev see that they're like what
the hell is that then you have an
opportunity inject security into the
developer it's really quite interesting
once you know you start getting real
data it becomes a lot more interesting I
see a lot more people actually looking
at the screen now like they're even just
with this okay it's not just it's not
just security stuff you know the thing
you know 500 errors why are 500 errors
you know actually failed sequel I attack
start with bio 500 errors goes in the
database explodes and causes a 500 error
these types of things you know why is
your you know tor traffic it's fine you
got some kooky site but you know on your
check out on your check out where you're
typing in payment stuff that's a little
weird no I want to know about that
because you didn't check out you gotta
type your address in anyway so why are
they using an anonymizer these types of
things you can start digging into and
security is empowered do I have time for
just about out a really quick story this
is a year ago me and my partner Zane we
were actually at a conference and we got
an alert and it was hey there's this
huge spike in
one you around one parameter cross-site
scripting got an alert on it we pulled
up the things like yeah I think they
actually found something and you know as
usual these things it's a it's a
one-line change you know it's like oh
they forgot to escape something okay we
pushed the fix out and the guy next day
on reddit posted something I didn't I
couldn't find it today unfortunately
just like you know I thought I found
something actually wrote in to us like I
thought I found something last night and
that was fixed like please don't ban me
from the site i'm actually a good guide
and then let you know it was like it was
just like what happened it was like
fixed before you gave a report it and
that's what security people want right
it's not the big stack and alice list
it's like being able to be nimble and a
lot of that still do like it starts with
the style codes easy for a security guy
to read to you know we're able to push
out Patch's really fast oh and then the
next day the best part about this is
developers like whoa what happened I saw
you change my code you know is this
amazing interaction that's completely
different you know and mall security
people probably could fix the security
bugs if they're in the pipeline so in
summary you know write code to be read
as if it were in a diff I was like as if
it were to be read actually if it be
read in a diff like if you can figure
out what's going on two diff that's
awesome filter out the dumb stuff you
know with this cycle you can actually
layer in much more complicated security
tools frequently they're a little slow
so I actually put them out of band of
deploy because you can they find
something you can fix it you got I got a
couple hours to figure out this stuff
this point deployed small chunks
regularly make security visible watch
what happens and that sounds like wow
that's pretty basic but this was also at
a restaurant this is great because the
easier cooking seems the more it needs
to be watched as the margin of error is
bound to increases like there's an
earnest that's like kind of perfect it
sounds easy but each one of those
is a lot of work each one of these is a
lot of work you know developers learning
to write code meant to be read in a diff
is difficult for them they like perfect
it's hard work making security visible
it takes work there's lots of tools out
there like you know yes my company does
stuff to help this part but that you
have maybe log stash done twice logging
splunk a lot of this can be done just
threw that like I don't really care what
tool you use my tool other people's
tools whatever as long as you start
making security visible and start
closing that feedback loop if we don't
start actually closing this ourselves
where other people will tell us how to
do it and that's really the main goal we
really don't want a world of liability
Oh using PHP great less an extra 500 ka
year you know that's what actual tables
are like you can pick out whatever car
you want to buy insurance come you'll
tell you what it's worth them what the
odds of accidents are that's like a
maybe a needed but also a scary world to
be in right then we have to start doing
a better job of integrating security and
doing it's super interesting and any you
see any security posting like junior
security intern and one of you guys
apply to that job they'll be like oh my
god like whatever the salary you want
they'll take it they're looking for a
junior guy they'll take the senior
person they just don't think they're
going to find them like it is a really
great opportunity for everyone to really
level up and do some really interesting
stuff and that happy note hey please
remember to rate this session I'm here
for a few hours I got a ton of business
cards please take one please let you let
me know what you think good bad that's
fine have questions thing love
to hear it so thanked everyone
