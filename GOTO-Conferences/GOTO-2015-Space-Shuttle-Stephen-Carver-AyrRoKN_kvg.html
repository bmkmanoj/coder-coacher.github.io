the only guy here in a suit okay so
thank you the biggest issue that all of
us face and this is in particular with
IT projects is of course what what is
the most difficult thing when you're
trying to get together a system it's not
the technology it's the people and I'm
an engineer most of you have probably
got a technical background too
we think it's gonna be so easy it should
be like downloading a USB 3 I've got an
idea in my head I can plug it into your
head and you get it and there's no
corruption but of course we know that
we're organic beings and I'm afraid it
does not work like that
communication is difficult I saw this in
London the other day and it sums up what
happens on most projects data is being
transferred between the parties but
absolutely no communication is taking
place in any way whatsoever so let's go
back to the February the first 2003 and
let's look at an organization that got
communication completely wrong that was
no accident they knew it was gonna
happen they knew was gonna happen ten
days before but they went ahead with it
anyway knowing that the astronauts would
die because in the end it was easier to
send emails rather than actually talk to
each other unfortunately this wasn't the
first time that NASA had made similar
decisions they'd done it before 17 years
before in 1986 is there anybody here old
enough to remember the space shuttle
Challenger one or two hands go up the
grey backs well done okay
certainly it was one of those moments in
my life that I'll never forget at the
time I was designing and building oil
platforms out in Gulf of Mexico and I
haven't you back in the Houston main
office and I walked into a lift and
there was a guy an engineer in tears and
I said what's happened and he said it's
blown up
it's just blown up and I said what the
oil platform because we were
commissioning an oil
at the time and he said no the Space
Shuttle and I still remember the shock
I thought NASA don't have explosions
like that it can't be the Space Shuttle
but it was again they knew four hours
before they launched that morning that
everyone on board will be dead within 80
seconds of launch but again the
engineers and the technical people
decided it would be much easier not to
have a meeting and if they had a meeting
well it's very difficult to talk to
other human beings
look at my specification look at my data
and as a result seven people died so
let's look at this flight and see what
did actually happen of all the space
shuttle flights that nASA has had up to
that point this is the one that they did
not want to have an accident on does
anyone know the reason there was a
teacher on board an ordinary civilian
not a trained astronaut first time ever
her name was Christa McAuliffe
all-american girl teacher teaching kids
in our local high school married two
kids what on earth was an untrained
astronaut doing on board one of the most
complex machines mankind has ever
conceived
the answer is politics Ronald Reagan at
the time wanted to show that he was very
Pro education so he came up this crazy
idea of putting a civilian school
teacher in space NASA said no way Ronald
Reagan then explained excuse me who pays
your salaries and they went great idea
sir so we now have a project which is
corrupted by politics this is the way of
the world NASA then thought about this
and how can how could we spin this how
can we make it positive and actually
they found a way because when the
shuttle program was first started
Congress didn't really believe in it and
they said we will give you enough
funding for 25 flights if you can prove
that this thing works reliably and
safely for 25 flights then we will
reconsider all of the financing and
we'll take it from there
this was the 25th flight everything had
been good up to that point so hey why
not put an ordinary civilian into space
and NASA said look we can prove that
safe I will put a high school teacher up
and they actually called the mission the
bus into space mission and so of all the
missions that they did not want to have
an accident this was the one and they
did have an accident find out how we
need to go back we need to go back into
the culture of the organization of NASA
before we only further our NASA a bunch
of psychopaths that like killing their
astronauts know they are really decent
honest people I've interviewed many
people in NASA about these two accidents
and they still get emotional
some of them cry and you think you're
good people you didn't intend for this
to happen are they stupid no they have
the highest IQ per square meter of any
other organization on planet Earth
present company excepted of course they
have the best procedures the best
governance the best software the best
everything the best comms they have the
best of everything in technology so how
come it went so wrong first moon landing
and what was the most important
deliverable what was the one thing that
they really had to bring back the
astronauts now that's what we call a so
what deliverable it's really difficult
and it's the most costly and dangerous
part of the entire mission but if you
get it right the responses so what you
did your job what was the one work
package that they had to deliver that
made this project a success photo good
now we're getting there a photo of what
Zoey the flag which am now hang on he
said he did it for mankind
so presumably it's the United Nations
flag and of course this mission had
nothing to do with science or technology
had everything to do with politics
because that's the picture that they
wanted that proved that they'd won the
race the space race because up to that
point the United States of America were
losing and losing badly if you look at
the space race the Communists won hands
down initially the first object in space
was Sputnik built by communists the
first living object sent by mankind
into space was like her the dog a
communist dog the first man in space of
course was Yuri Gagarin okay
first woman in space oh come on
valentina marvelous lady still alive she
was in London lecturing four weeks ago
awesome lady awesome first spacewalk was
done by Alexey Leonov and so that the
Russians were doing everything first the
Communists were beating capitalism led
by the USA and the imagine JFK one night
after a couple of Jack Daniels saying
dammit we're gonna beat those communists
to the moon by the end of the Cinch end
of the decade and he then told NASA and
they said because NASA did not want
to go to the moon NASA were charged with
a scientific unmanned exploration of
space suddenly all of their programs for
the next 15 years were cancelled and
they had to concentrate on one thing and
one thing only getting an American flag
on the moon and they did it and it was
fantastic and on the first mission of
course it was named the astronauts first
mission Neil Armstrong Buzz Aldrin and
well done Michael Collins that forgotten
astronaut who went on Apollo 12 probably
the most important mission of all of the
missions that they did we're giving a
prize of $100 to the answer
no one googling it yet okay it was
Conrad beam and Gordon no one knows
their names because the first time you
do something incredible everyone goes
well done the second time you do it
everyone says bowling we all remember
Apollo 13 why because Tom Hanks was on
board and we had to get him back the
last moon landing was Apollo 17 there
should have been an Apollo 18 but by now
the American people were bored bored
bored bored bored bored bored bored and
that's the sad thing about
high-technology instantaneously Wow and
then the second time third time so what
can't it do more now they had a problem
at this stage because by then they had
400,000 people working on the American
space program and if they canceled it
then that's 400,000 people degree
qualified or above looking for job so
what they needed was a new mission they
came up this idea of going to Mars but
there are problems if you try and build
a spaceship especially with that type of
technology big enough to go to Mars it
won't take off from the surface of
planet Earth it's too heavy
so the only way you can do it is to
actually build it in space you could
need a space station now to actually
build the space station to build the
rocket to go to Mars you're going to
need this space shuttle it wasn't
originally called the space shuttle it
was called the space truck and it gives
you an idea of what a small part it was
that neo reul Mars program it was a
truck that delivered many materials to
build the space station to build a
rocket to go to Mars it went in front of
Congress Congress said that's far too
expensive the engineers said we can't do
it for less this is when the accountants
moved in now sadly and I speak as an
engineer I'm afraid the world is run by
accountants not by engineers and if you
find that upsetting then simply if
you're an engineer or technical person
go away and get an accountancy degree
then you can run the world
unfortunately what happened was the
accountants who moved in on this one
said yes Congress we can do up to half
the cost the engineers said no you can't
and they said excuse me who runs the
world now what we're going to do is
we're going to use a very sophisticated
technique called net present value some
of you might know something about it
you actually move capital expenditure
into the future are you discounted to
the risk-adjusted rate of about 3.7 and
actually if then becomes half the cost
most engineers and technologists say no
you still have to spend the same amount
of money yes you do but you're spending
it over a longer period of time so on an
MPV basis it becomes cheaper if you
didn't understand a word of what I've
just said don't worry about it the nasa
engineers didn't understand either but
basically what was going to happen was a
lot of this stuff was going to be done
in the in the future but they were going
to do the truck now one of the NASA
engineers it's one of those questions
you
Steve asked it and everyone would have
gone because he said what is the point
of building a space truck that's got
nowhere to go and nothing to do for 10
years - damn good question the answer of
course it keeps 400,000 people employed
and therefore keeps virtually all the
like congressmen in power at the Senate
but hey we can't say that to the
American people so now we have to post
justified they said what else could we
do this truck if we're not building
space stations for 10 years well I
suppose you could launch satellites the
engineer said nope you can launch
satellites on unmanned vehicles for less
risk and less money it's about a third
of the cost the captain said well that's
easy all you have to do then is make the
shuttle a capable of putting up three
satellites Engineers said you can't just
triple the payload like that they said
well that's an engineering problem deal
with it
now how many are you going to launch per
year and they said well it's the most
complex machine mankind has ever
conceived we reckon five times a year
max the accountant said no it doesn't
make money make it ten the engineer said
you can't just double the launch rate
just like that just for your spreadsheet
let excuse us but who runs the world
thank you no it doesn't work on ten no
it doesn't work on eight eleven fifteen
it still doesn't work on fifteen this is
bad 20 doesn't work on 20 25 breaks even
at 25 like we want a minimum of 25
launches every single year for five
years
either carrying a huge satellite or
three small satellites and according to
our calculations this thing makes money
the engineers just scratch their heads
and said you're all mad and they said
yes but who runs the world so by the
time they'd finished up rating the space
truck
it weighs three times the weight of the
Statue of Liberty now can you imagine
that what they asked the engineers to do
was to take three full-size full-weight
Statue of Liberty's and build an engine
big enough to throw them 150 kilometers
straight up against Earth's gravity and
accelerate them from zero to 30 thousand
kilometers per hour and do that in 11
minutes is that a big engine it's a sort
of top gear gone mad
type engine so they went to the clever
people in NASA now NASA is a huge
organization I've been to lots and lots
of the center's but I want to talk about
four here and you probably know them by
their place names the first place you
might
but NASA will be the Cape what do they
do at the Cape they do takeoffs they
also do landings of the shuttles the
astronauts don't like landing back in
Florida because the runway is quite
short they soon in the land at Edwards
Air Force Base in California but of
course if you do that it has a nice long
runway
you then have to fly the shuttle back on
a 747 back to Florida for the next
flight and that takes money
so the accountants encourage the
astronauts to land in Florida now the
other thing you do is assemble space
rockets of Florida they have this big
white building called the VAB another
place that you might have heard of is
Houston have you heard of Houston why is
Mission Control in Houston any ideas
politics are well done ok there's
someone here that understands the nature
of the world it's called the Johnson
Space Flight Center President Johnson
came from Houston and if you build a big
Space Center it means lots and lots of
jobs and jobs equals votes and votes
equals power so where you have your head
office well it's where the power is
Washington so these are the three main
centers but there's one more that I want
to talk about and it's where the rocket
scientists are some literary the rocket
scientists of NASA does anyone know
where they are based
well done over there Huntsville and the
rest of you thinking what I've never
heard of Huntsville yeah the Marshall
Space Flight Center in Huntsville
Alabama I'd never heard of it and I'm an
engineer now the history behind this and
the reason why you don't know much about
it is that it's a little embarrassing
nASA has a little bit of an embarrassing
history who was the father of the
American space program well it was
certainly not JFK although most of us
think it was because he made that speech
the real father of the American space
program is this guy meeting Walt Disney
and Walt Disney was about to make a
family movie about his life which you
can still get it's called we aim for the
stars who or what is this guy Verner von
Braun and who are what was Verner von
Braun well he was the world's greatest
ever rocket scientist and engineer
there's no doubt about it
unfortunately he worked for an
unpleasant individual and built vetoes
now I'm a Londoner these v2s used to
fall on London they actually killed some
of my relatives my grandfather's
actually killed by our veto from the
time they launched these from France or
Belgium or the Netherlands to the time
they hit London guess what the flight
time of a v2 was slightly less than five
minutes it was four minutes this was
incredible this was at least fifteen
years one five years ahead of any
technology available anywhere else in
the world it was unbelievable the way it
worked and I'm not going to bore you
with too much technical detail but it
matters for the rest of the story
let me just build you a space shuttle
liquid fueled engine because these
vetoes use the same thing you use a
liquid fuel only it is liquid in this
case liquid fuel he used earth oh gosh
now that by the way is half the problem
now have we got a valve Oh excellent
lovely now ah that's good now that's
much better and actually that ties up
proper weld for the rest of the story
because now we have a valve on it and it
doesn't leak so much okay but the nice
thing about valves is that you can open
them and close them it's a controllable
source you have liquid alcohol as
terrible waste and liquid oxygen and
then you have a burner burner and off it
goes that's the way it works
remember the valves you can either open
them or close them and in that case I
wish I'd managed to close it quicker
than I did but there you go okay now in
1944 the Americans were arriving
obviously a mainland Europe and they
wanted to find Verner von Braun Verner
von Braun was a very clever and very
arrogant man and he actually went to
find the Americans he said I am Verner
von Braun and they said goddamn Verner
von Braun we have a message here from
the American president Vertov von Braun
you are an SS ranking major thousands of
died at peenemünde a building your v2
rockets we're going to take you to
Nuremberg find you guilty of war crimes
and
you buy in there continue did that's
option number one Vernor option number
two welcome to America Verna
unsurprisingly Verna went for option
number two but to give you an idea of
the power and the elegance of this man
he said now I am NOT going to work for
you you are gonna work for me and my
team and they said well where's your
team Verna he said they were on the
train so 118 Nazi rocket engineers were
now given full American citizenship big
cars big salaries are transported over
to America you're the American president
are you proudly going to tell the
American people about this deal no
you're not where the hell can you hide
118 raving Nazi rocket engineers well
Alabama is a good choice okay so forgive
me if you come from Alabama
okay so Verna von Braun and his German
team and make no mistake about it it was
a German project to get men to the moon
it was quite an amazing piece of German
technology and they'd built and designed
the famous Saturn fives that got been to
the moon now as Verna got older he had
to worry about who's going to pass his
power over to by the way do you think
that was a happy building full of happy
people who sang at every lunchtime no it
was an extremely unhappy place to be
Verna von Braun was one of those guys I
am a genius I am always right if anyone
argues with me they're obviously wrong
because I'm always right and they must
be stupid to argue with me and I don't
want stupid people on my team so the
classic psychopath behaviour as he got
older he had to hand over to an American
he chose a guy called Bill Lucas
American born and bred but unfortunately
trained Bill up in the same leadership
style as he had which is I'm right
you're wrong
you disagree you're out so bill Lucas
took over after Verna went and I just
like to show you a facts some of you
might remember that faxes this was sent
one or two weeks after the shuttle
disaster by a senior manager of at
Huntsville and Marshall to the head of
NASA
the Marshall Space Flight Center is run
by one man Bill Lucas a center director
he's established a personal Empire where
the only criteria for advancement is
total loyalty to this man loyalty to
country NASA the space program means
nothing
many highly-skilled Manchus scientist to
engineer has been buried in the
organization because they under estimate
reaction to descent nice man or nasty
man well unfortunately he got the job
done and so NASA left him to his own
culture and as a result Marshall became
effectively isolated from the rest of
NASA and I don't know if he can believe
this but in some organizations
departments don't talk to each other
have you ever come across this and of
course Marshall hated the boys from the
Cape because they were no more than
engineers they hated the boys from
Houston because they always got the
glory Houston come back houston we have
a problem Houston tranquility base and
they hated the boys from Washington
because they were accountants and
lawyers and of course everyone in
Washington Houston and cave hated the
boys in Marshall this is not good this
is not teamwork and communication breaks
down the boys actually did come up with
a rocket engine for the space truck it
was going to be a liquid-fueled engine
it went in front of Congress they said
too much and the NASA people said good
can we stop this now and can we go back
to what we should be doing which is
scientific exploration of space
unmanned they said don't be silly we've
got 400,000 people we have to actually
give jobs to and so that's when a
congressman said there is an alternative
way of throwing things into space yes
you can use liquid fueled engines but
there is another type called solid fuel
solid fuel engines what you do there is
you get yourself a thin metal tube and
you pack it full of a high explosive
called P ban it's five times more potent
than TNT you then put your monkey or
your satellite on top of this tube of
high explosive like the fuse god Bless
America and hide about three kilometers
away because one in 20 of these things
used to blow up on the launch pad now
why did they blow up when you ignite
them it's like a controlled bomb if
there's any weakness anywhere in the
tube it'll burst the tube and then it
all goes off in a sing
explosion sounds very dangerous and
indeed they were banned for all manned
flights but the nice thing about solid
fuel booster rockets is that they were
cheap so who won cheap or best so now as
a NASA went through a huge cultural
change the first time ever it became
apparent that cost would need the same
considerations they'd never had to worry
about a budget in their lives and that's
how they came up with this appalling
compromise called the space shuttle the
space shuttle well there's the space
shuttle itself the black stuff of course
is heat shield because once this gets up
to 30,000 kilometers per hour it has no
fuel left and the only way to get it
back down to zero kilometers per hour is
to use the Earth's atmosphere on
re-entry as a break it creates a lot of
heat and if there's any damage to those
tiles of course everyone dies the
engines at the back there's one two
three of them are liquid fuel engines so
no American will ever be asked to go on
a vehicle that is not powered by liquid
fueled engines because the nice thing
about liquid fuel engines is that they
have valves okay this is the tank
it contains six million liters of liquid
oxygen and liquid hydrogen that's stuff
14 stories high the fuel that gets
pumped from the engines unfortunately
too heavy to take off too then what they
do is strapped on in the nicest possible
way the world's largest solid fuel
booster rockets containing tens of
thousands of kilograms of a high
explosive five times more powerful than
TNT you put those two huge unstable
forms onto the tank containing the six
million litres
oxygen nitrogen then you look for seven
volunteers okay the way it goes five ten
nine eight seven six now five they open
up those valves put in the liquid fuel
set fire to it get lots of white smoke
but the thing is going nowhere it hasn't
got enough power four three two one and
if everything is looking good at that
point then they ignite the explosive
charges in the two white tubes and then
it goes now as soon as it takes off it
stops going vertically and it goes over
at a slight angle this is so that the
astronauts can see where they're going
to crash the next thing is you'll hear
it on the video they actually say
throttle back the main engines and you
think throttle back come on Jeremy
Clarkson throttle up you need to get up
to 30,000 km/h
no they go relatively slowly three times
the speed of sound until they get up to
about 20,000 meters why basically its
jet streams fast movements of air in the
upper atmosphere they found that the
control of the space shuttle was very
difficult if you went very fast so what
they do is they go relatively slowly
until they get quite high and at that
point they say to the the guy in the
shuttle throttle up and when he
throttles up those big liquid fuel
engines kick up to what they call a
hundred and four percent and you get max
Q maximum aerodynamic and g-force on the
craft and as a result these white tubes
flex with the stress I'd remember what I
said if there's any weakness and those
white tubes it's all gonna blow up come
back to that later as you go up after
about two minutes the SRBs run out of
fuel they're thrown off you then carry
on burning the liquid oxygen and
hydrogen until you get up to about 150
kilometers you then dump the orange tank
which is now empty and hopefully it
burns up in the atmosphere otherwise it
lands on India okay so that's how it
works
what does this represent to aerospace
companies of course it represents huge
amounts of money and they all piled in
they all wanted a slice of the pie NASA
got worried about these solid fuel
booster rockets the white tubes they
said we want to have these built by
Aerojet why well Aerojet are very good
at building them
but most importantly they have a factory
next to the Mississippi River you think
what this got to do with space quite a
lot it meant that they could manufacture
these white tubes in single piece units
under perfect factory conditions and
then they could put them on the
Mississippi River on barges and barge
them around to the Cape this is when the
Mormons got involved have you heard of
the Mormons very powerful religious
group in America with an excellent choir
and a very good genealogical database
view into those sorts of things they had
a company called Morton Thiokol that
could build these solid fuel booster
rockets and they lobbied Congress and
said Utah should get this work that's
democracy for you and so it's decided
that Morton Thiokol would get the job
and so Morton Thiokol from Utah these
Mormons were now going to be
subcontractors to the guys from Marshall
how well do you think these Mormons from
Utah got all the guys from Huntsville
Alabama now straight away as a project
manager I'd say that is going to be a
huge problem on the project that is
where communication is going to break
down and that's where we have to do some
work get them together let them have a
few beers so they can't have beers
they're Mormons well to get people
together and have a barbecue talk to
each other as human beings
naso course didn't want Morton Thiokol
and so the relationship was sour
right from the start people next problem
there's Morton Thiokol that's where
you're going to build them how the hell
you gonna get them to the Cape there is
no river or sea connection between the
two points there was a mountain range in
between these tubes 14 stories long are
so long they can't go on rail cars they
can't go on trucks so the only way they
could do it I'm afraid is not to fly
them that would be even more dangerous
but what they decided to do is to break
them up into pieces deliver them across
America in pieces and then reassemble
them at the Cape this is a bit like you
can have your BMW straight from the BMW
factory and perfect factory conditions
or if you want a 10% discount we'll send
all the parts over to your local garage
and Fred the local engineer can have a
go at putting your BMW together in his
garage and I'm sorry to be so crude
about it but you can never get
perfect factory conditions when you do
field assemblies so this is one of the
the tubes full of high explosive this is
the pathetic attempt by NASA at the Cape
to create a factory condition as you can
see basically it's tape and cardboard
and scaffolding and plastic just to
create a cleanroom environment your next
problem is how you get a stack these
things together and stick them together
well welding is not recommended so the
only way you can do it is to have what
we call a clevis joint which is a joint
a bit like that and of course those
joints are gonna need an o-ring and
anybody here that knows anything about
mechanical engineering would tell you
that Oh rings are extremely dangerous
things because they move they started
testing these out in the desert and it
did not go well the chief designer watch
a Beaujolais you saw him in the video at
the beginning almost in tears he
designed the o-ring system and they
realized that they had blow by an
erosion now what does that mean it means
that the o-rings are actually taking
damage from the propellant and if the
o-rings burn right through then of
course it's gonna have a case burst and
then the whole white tube will explode
like a bomb he went to his boss and said
we need extra money in extra time the
boss said we have no extra money we have
no extra time to fix it so they came up
with the most amazing compromise these
o-rings are unreliable we don't know how
they're working and they shouldn't
behave in the way that they are the boss
said yes but they're working and they
said that's not good enough we need to
have a backup so they decided to have a
second owing to backup the first one
this is a bit like you buying a car
because you you want your kids to be
safe and you're about to take it out of
the showroom and it's got a five-star
end cap and it's really safe and the
showroom guy says before you drive very
safe car we've had a few incidents
recently and it's really interesting
people have reported they're driving
along the Autobahn and the steering
wheel just comes away in their hands and
we can't figure out why but so what you
do is you put it to one side and then
you say hey kids past dad the spared and
we've thought this one through there's a
spare one on the backseat they pass it
over and then you put it back on you
be fine so the double o-ring system
insane it became what's known as
criticality 1r if it failed you'd have
last mission Rick include the metal
origin burn from proper case buzz result
in fire and flee get a deflagration have
a nice day wall what does that mean in
English
boom and everybody dies please use
direct language not anyone Crippen and
young got on board this thing press the
button and it worked we now know that
they were just incredibly lucky
it's amazing how lucky you can be they
launched the second one and that worked
as well so now we've got skilled
judgment and experience no you haven't
you just been lucky twice you get the
bits of morton-thiokol you put on the
main tank you put on the orbiter you
take off you go into space you do
largely pointless things you then land
it verse you have to rebuild it the
interesting thing are the two white
tubes to make it look environmental
which it is not after 120 seconds they
come away from the space shuttle they
came up with this crazy idea of little
parachutes would open and they'll fall
back gently into the North Atlantic
Ocean
they will then be retrieved by Navy
divers washed out with Perrier water and
used again there's no way you should use
anything like that again
retrieve it check it find out how it
worked but don't use again but they
decided to use them again Rajamouli saw
him in the video the chief designer of
the o-rings when he looked at the
o-rings when they came back he could not
believe his eyes
there was blow-by there was erosion
every single oring behaved differently
even the same position owing on
different flights behaved differently
now if you had a program that ran like
that no one is going to touch it it is
full of bugs basically this thing was
full of bugs but they've been lucky up
to now he got really scared and after a
few flights he said look we're playing
Russian roulette one day this is all
gonna go wrong and people would die he
looked for correlator
what was the common factor why is it was
every single flight was different
the only thing he could come up with was
the weather in Florida it should have
had no effect on this o-ring design at
all but it was the
temperature in Florida the weather the
day the shuttle flew and it was not a
perfect correlation these things are
never perfect if you're interested in it
basically they had two effects one was
actually the stress of the the joint the
other one was what we call rotation the
tube actually rotates very marginally
and so the seal joint gets unequal
pressure and it moves around don't worry
about the details but these things are
never clean and clear cut but it looks
as if the cold of the temperature in
Florida the greater the expectation that
both Oh rings would fail and the whole
thing would explode he took that to his
boss and his boss said this is serious
you better go and see dr. Lucas remember
dr. Lucas these are his own words when
people go in front of dr. Lucas they
know for whatever use words like think
or feel or judgment try and explain
something they will be shot down in
flames prove to me that it's gonna blow
up well we can't sir but we think
there's a correlation I don't pay you
for thinking I pay you for data sir in
our judgment with the lower temperature
I don't pay you for judgment I pay you
for data look sir I really do feel stop
right there
I don't do feelings I'm an engineer
you're an engineer no feelings where's
your data can you prove it's got to blow
up and the answer is of course you can't
because you haven't gone off data so
where you gonna get your data from more
flights we're now into catch-22 thinking
the flights continued all the way
through the next couple of years and the
data started to pile up
but of course statistically because
they'd had more flights and they were
safe this thing was becoming safer and
safer no it wasn't they were just being
luckier and luckier Lucas made it clear
that under no circumstances was the
Marshall Center or its subcontractors
because for delaying a launch this is
insane the 15th flight one year before
Challenger was a winter flight they now
know that it was about one second away
from blowing up but they were lucky and
then they got luckier because after
winter comes spring and summer and of
course we're now moving down the curve
and so there's less likelihood of an
explosion and of course it's getting
safer and safer but after summer comes
fall and then you move back to winter
all the way through that
in 1985 they were launching and the
engineers were crossing their fingers
hoping to god that the thing did not
explode but now it was gonna be a winter
launch and of all launches it was me the
Christa McAuliffe launched the one that
they could not afford to have a problem
with they had problems they wheeled it
out press the button it didn't work
software problem have you ever come
across those so then they had to
reprogram the computer onboard the
shuttle what they should have done is
bring it back and put it in the VAB but
they didn't because it takes time and
money so they left it out in the launch
site and people had to repair it at 90
degrees to its normal service position
and you can imagine people just make
mistakes the orientation is wrong it's
like gravity suddenly goes sideways in
this room you can imagine they had a
second launch attempt and that went
wrong it wouldn't work software problems
by now the press the public was saying
come on NASA you're useless the pressure
was now on and that's when their luck
ran out a weather front came across
America it created the coldest weather
in Florida ever recorded it rained it
got cold flow it is normally quite
pleasant even in winter but this time he
got really cold these are pictures of
challenger taken just before the
spacecraft took off the whole thing was
covered in sheet ice from top to bottom
in terms of degrees Fahrenheit guess how
much lower it was than the January
before it wasn't five wasn't ten it
wasn't 15 or 16 or 17 or 18 degrees or
19 or 20 degrees lower than the year
before
or 21 or 22 or 23 or 24 it was 25
degrees Fahrenheit lower the engineers
who designed the o-rings went crazy and
said this is absolute insanity you
cannot launch the next morning it will
blow up in fact they even predicted
exactly how the o-rings would fail and
which Owings would fail they went to
their bosses their bosses said we've got
to stop this and so the night before
they contacted NASA Houston and
Huntsville and said stop the launch NASA
went ballistic how can you stop the
Christa McAuliffe flight we've already
had two launch failures you cannot have
another
and it's really important it takes off
on time the engineers were really
arguing their case but like most
engineers and I'm an engineer
unfortunately they didn't put it into
management speak they just went too much
into the technical side it was now late
at night people wanted to go home they'd
had enough of all this they just wanted
the launch the next morning so the
pressure was intense I'm now gonna show
you a video of what happened but let me
add a little extra free song to the mix
that Sunday President Reagan was going
to do the State of the Union address and
everyone knew that he wanted to talk
about Christa McAuliffe and if they
didn't launch the next morning that
meant that Ronald Reagan would have to
change his speech the president would
have to change his speech the other
thing was that the renewal contract for
the solid fuel booster rockets was
coming up in a few months time and of
course it shouldn't obviously affect
anything that took place that evening
but of course now their suppliers
morton-thiokol were giving them bad news
and that's bad if you're we bidding for
billions and billions of dollars of
extra work here's the video now this is
what you bowl a there's the double O
ring system holding in his hands this is
him taken five or six years ago but of
course when all this happened he was a
much younger man okay obviously in a
great deal of stress of that meeting and
his managers just not listening to him
they passed it back to NASA NASA now had
the answer that they wanted which was
it's good to launch the entity has
predicted that it'd be the right hand
booster that would fail that morning why
cuz the Sun comes up in Florida on that
side in the morning so it would actually
saw it be the left hand booster cuz on
the right hand side it will be warmed by
the Sun if with a lower eye ring that's
normally the one that took most damage
the primary oring would fail as soon as
they ignited it on the launch pad if
they were lucky the secondary o-ring
would hold it if they were unlucky the
whole thing would blow up on the launch
pad as it turned out they were lucky the
primary o-ring did fail on a take off
and then the secondary ring just about
held it but when they went for throttle
up do you remember Fatih lop as soon as
they put dynamic force onto their owing
it blew open and the whole spacecraft
exploded okay no one died all the
astronauts survived this was
by NASA understandably for the sake of
the families for several years that is
the crew compartment coming out of the
shuttle it broke away no one was dead at
that point they were all alive they know
at least four of them were fully alive
and conscious and moving around within
the spacecraft because they found every
single person all seven of them with
emergency oxygen masks on which must
have involved at least four people
moving around the cabin what killed them
of course this had no ejector seats no
parachutes no nothing was actually
hitting the North Atlantic and having
their necks broken that took four
minutes you could imagine what was going
through their minds potential report on
Challenger was absolutely damning NASA
were brilliant engineers but there was
too much management and too little
leadership and too little respect there
was low empowerment of individuals low
integrity appalling communication people
just relying on emails vague ownership
of what the tasks and risks were fear of
escalation
don't tell your boss bad news no one
vision I'm looking after my own
department I don't care about NASA low
trust levels why should I trust anyone
in this organization silo mentality my
division is okay complacency we've
always been okay in the past
so NASA fixed the problems and they fix
them in the wrong way by the way for
those of you taking pictures I will give
you copies of these slides they fix the
problem by basically bringing in more
procedures and more governance does that
really help no it doesn't it has its
role but it's not enough and so they
started flying again and by the way they
fixed the problem
technically they didn't have 200 rings
anymore that was stupid they now had
three so they started launching them and
everything seemed to be okay and over
several years they launched 87 shuttles
and of course everyone got complacent
and that's the problem if you have
success you become complacent disasters
happen when decisions are made by
leaders who cannot remember what the
consequences were last time that's why I
think there'd be another huge financial
banking collapse within the next 36
months I work with banks nothing has
changed
they have more governance they have more
paperwork but their mindset has not
changed at all
it wasn't helped by the new CEO called
Daniel Goldin quite an energetic man
faster cheaper better when I asked for
budget to be cut not told it's got
impact on safety I think that is a bunch
of crap now you can imagine if you
worried about safety in your CEO make
speeches like that you leave and that's
basically what started to happen in NASA
what happened with space shuttle
Columbia this was actually gonna be
another teacher and space mission you
would have thought a single alarm would
go somewhere in a building there was a
lady from India there was a guy from
Israel every color creed sexuality they
were going to go up to some experiments
in space NASA weren't really that
interested in this mission what they
wanted was the next mission the next
mission was a big boys mission it was a
mission to take up some components for
the International Space Station and they
were way behind schedule so there's no
way they wanted Columbia to actually go
over on schedule because the next
mission was so important what happened
well is a different technical fault but
basically the same management response
bits had started coming off the main
orange tank for the last few missions it
shouldn't have happened but NASA said
well it shouldn't have happened but it
nothing bad happened this what we call
deviation and normalization of deviance
on Columbia a big piece of orange foam
came off the tank and hit the spacecraft
itself here's an animation of what
happened you'll see it comes off from at
this point here called the bipod is
about the size of a laptop and it hits
the left wing with a speed of 730 km/h
now if I threw my laptop at you at 730
km/h would you catch it no it'll go
straight through and straight through
all the people behind you and probably
go through the wall at the back it's a
lot of kinetic energy at mass times
velocity squared they saw it from the
ground they had photographs and video
footage of it the engineers on the
ground started cranking up the Cray
computers and started calculating how
much damage would have been done to the
tiles Boeing ran their craze and they
reckoned seventeen tiles had been
smashed off the craft even one tile
slightly damaged
died on re-entry they went to the
management and said stop the reentry we
need to find out how much damage has
been done to the wing now it's up in
space
unfortunately can't see the wings from
the actual cabin itself the only way you
can find out if there's damage is to do
a spacewalk and trust me it is not like
mr. Clooney clambering into his
spacesuit and doing brave things a
spacewalk is an incredibly complex thing
to put together they had the equipment
to do it but it would take 2 or 3 days
of planning to get it right and
unfortunate that meant that the Columbia
will be late landing which were meant
that the next mission the important
mission the International Space Station
will be severely delayed so the
engineers said get out have a look the
manager said but if we go out and have a
look we might find that there's a
problem and the engineer said exactly
and the manager said exactly one did
more under extreme stress he's a good
guy but under stressed people do bizarre
things we didn't believe that pictures
would be useful to us we felt there was
nothing we could have done anyway so we
decided not even to take them there is
no problem if you don't look for it this
went on for 10 days not four hours late
at night 10 days people going home
coming back in the morning
talking about it talking about it
meetings after meetings after meetings
these are two of the emails out of the
Columbia disaster report any reports on
the tile damage are we just crossing our
fingers and hoping for the best it kinda
says it'll probably be all right I'm
just about to go to the airport to go
back to UK could imagine if I'm on the
end of the runway and another plane
crashes into our plane and bits fall off
it and the captain says well I'm I'm
gonna promise tonight so basically yep
the plane is damaged I'm not going to go
and inspect it I'm gonna cross my
fingers and hope for the best at the
co-pilot kind of thinks that we're
probably not going to die again you'd be
piling out of that plane thinking these
people are insane this is NASA ten days
later they brought it in and everything
that the engineer's predicted would
happen did happen the whole wing would
fold up what that was about was the when
they did the chair
accident they found that half the data
was missing what had happened to half
the data basically NASA employees
because they were so scared of their own
managers had destroyed the data and so
the investigation took much longer than
it should
now they sealed the doors catch the data
the investigation board was absolutely
damning now I believed this at the time
that they stood no chance in fact a
rescue mission was challenging but
entirely feasible if they'd done that
spacewalk they would have found
literally a hole straight through the
wing they would have left them in orbit
for 30 days it would have not have been
like Apollo 13 they had plenty of food
drink movies to watch it would have been
quite a nice holiday and in that time
they would have bought another shuttle
up they would have rescued them shuttle
to shuttle transfer they had all the
equipment to do it and the training to
do it they would have brought them back
to earth and now it would be a Hollywood
blockbuster with George Clooney and
Schwarzenegger giving it wide the
Columbia accident investigation board
said that NASA had good technical skills
but too much management too little
leadership integrity does this remind
you of anything and in fact there's a
whole chapter saying this is the same
accident
yes different technology doesn't matter
it's the same people response NASA had
not learned in 17 years it's the same
accident NASA had to completely reform
themselves and when he go there now it
is unbelievable sadly it's a much much
smaller organization and it would never
be the great NASA it was in the glory
days because you can make a have about
bad accident once you have the same
accident twice
quite honestly people don't believe in
you anymore a most space exploration now
in America is done privately one vision
one empowered team big picture strategy
confidence more leadership less
management faster adaptive processes
agile excellence rotation of people
between departments a mentoring of
people don't let the old people go they
have tacit knowledge partnership with
suppliers not where the boss you're the
supplier more listening more
communication skills all the engineers
have to go on listening skills courses
fierce conversations political
correctness was flown out of NASA fierce
conversations engage challenged more
stories stories our brilliant way of
getting minds in the right way
that's why Apple did better than
Microsoft they had a better story
lunches get people together and let them
talk whilst they're fueling their own
bodies that the scientific explanation
of this is absolutely 100% you have
better conversations people are more
relaxed and fun
NASA was a miserable place to work and
as you know your industries are normally
fun that's why talented people want to
join them and of course if you've got
talented people having fun then you have
the one thing you want and as Albert
Einstein said creativity is easy just
get intelligent people together and let
them have fun so I trust you're having
fun on this conference yes okay now all
hang on a minute hang on right let me
finish it off are you okay for two
minutes still with me okay we got coffee
and cake for you outside NASA and now
after 2005 were given a license to fly
again it's been up there many times
doing the most amazing missions and
bringing about the most incredible
pictures of us and on earth and of
course working with the Russians as well
quite fantastic oh by the way where
their armies at Berlin yes that's Berlin
over there okay 2011 July sad day for
mankind because that's the last shuttle
flight and quite right too it was
getting seriously old they couldn't get
the software anymore let alone the
motherboards to actually run this thing
it was getting old and so that was the
last flight and now if you want to see
our beautiful Earth from space you will
have to fly with the Russians so who won
the space race okay my last two
questions and I'll let you go first
thing who decides from the time of the
first accident right way through to the
last flight and 2011 who is the one
person that decided whether or not the
shuttle should fly please don't say the
president can imagine George Bush with a
red button okay who's got most skin in
the game the crew and I did this talk in
London many years ago six or seven years
ago and a guy came up to me afterwards I
said well Stevie which I didn't like
well Stevie that was one hell of a talk
wasn't it I said look I can hear you
American please this is not
anti-american
please it's not you know if this had
been a British piece of engineering it
would never have taken off and we'd
still be discussing the paint color and
he said no I I don't take it as an
American but did you make some technical
errors in your presentation and I put
them right I think I'm not a space
engineer perhaps some of them are still
there but it would tiny things I said
you seem to know a lot about NASA
he said sure as hell or two son work for
them for the last 15 years I thought
whoa now I'm gonna get a lawsuit or
something I can see this and I said what
did you do in NASA by the way this guy
was about my size my shape and lack of
hair
guess what he'd been shuttle pilot you
imagine from the movies the god damn
kick-ass they are really boring
middle-aged slap heads like me this guy
was possibly one of those boring people
I've ever interviewed in my entire life
I asked him I said I understand he can
stop the shuttle flight he said yes we
can and he had a very dry sense of humor
so I don't know this is right but it's a
great story I said what's the last thing
you do to actually make it go he said we
have a red push button in front of me
says launch commit I said no no no I I
hear it all done by a computer he said
listen up Stevie unless that button is
pressed from within the vehicle doesn't
matter what the computer says the SRBs
do not ignite I said it's a red button
he said yeah
most people think before they press a
big red button mark launch commit
well I said oh what's the procedure the
protocol for pressing that button he
said it's a 47 point checklist and if I
can remember it from memory which I
believe I can at 47 what we're looking
at the main and bypass hydraulic circuit
so there's more than 0.3 bar
differential we would go back to
checklist item number 162 and clarin
assuming that we had cleared checklist
item 47 we move on to 46 now what's
going through your mind it was going
through mine I thought I could die
listening to this explanation and I want
some coffee and I said could we just
take you down to the last to meet
everybody gonna miss a lot of day this
TV and I said in another life what are
the last two when he could see me I
don't know okay second to last thing we
take the cover off the push button now
like you I laughed and he said what's
funny about that so my skin he said
seriously Stevie you're getting ingress
to the vehicle at 9 degrees the normal
orientation then you're wearing quite a
bulky suit so there's possibility if not
a probability you could actually
accidentally press that button when you
did not want to it's quite interesting
because the button the contact itself is
two millimeter of linear travel
obviously normally latched close open
and then it goes two millimeters into
normally latch close this is the way he
was speaking it was unbelievable and I
said well assuming you've got the cover
off the button when do you press the
button he said what apply a positive
digit pressure
I said well most of us call it pressing
a button he said I asked a question I
said now this could be good I can use
this my lecture what's the question and
who do you ask he said I was quite
simple I look around at the other six
smiling faces in the vehicle with me and
I say hey I'm feeling lucky today are
you feeling lucky and if they're all
feeling lucky we go my final
thought and I'll let you go if I could
take you back to 2011 if we could go
back into time to the last space shuttle
flight and I could negotiate with NASA
and get you a spare ride on the space
shuttle if we could organize it hands up
in this room who take me up and who
would fly the space shuttle hands up
Wow there's a lot of mad people in this
room and hey I do it I do it one way
which is even more insane but hey we are
all driven by different things we are
all diverse we see the world in a
different way we see risks in a
different way and that's brilliant
that's what makes us so brilliant as a
species we are diverse as Darwin said it
is not survival of the fittest
it is not survival of the most
intelligent it is survival of those most
adaptable and willing to change and
that's what I love about agile and
everything that you're doing at this
conference it's all about fast-moving
change so you will survive Joby's if you
don't risk anything you risk even more
now she was talking about sex but sex
and leadership are very similar so
ladies and gentlemen I hope you've
enjoyed the talk it's been a great
pleasure carry on doing what you're
doing thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
