manager we build a product called go
which is a CI M release management
server and thought works the attitude is
pretty much where you're reasonably
smart we need some to do this go and do
this and so I knew nothing about product
management whatsoever and I kind of read
a bit of stuff and at that time I was
kind of naive so I thought well I don't
know anything about this let's see what
scrum has to say about it
and so this is more or less what I
learnt from what scrum has to say about
product management that you're going to
build something so you need to work out
what you going to build then there's
this whole kind of prioritization and
estimation thing you've got to make a
big backlog and prioritize an estimate
that stuff and then there's going to be
showcases you need to give feedback and
off you go and you know there's a bunch
of other stuff you have to sit on sales
calls I discovered you're expected to do
competitive analysis that's very
important and pricing turns out to be a
big deal there's a great video that son
brought out about product management
where basically you know someone goes
and works out a very complicated pricing
model and then they sit down at the
meeting and the VP walks in with the
roulette wheel with a bunch of prices
printed on it and spins the wheel and
says it's going to be $500 there was VP
very well done very well done VP $500 it
turns out actually it's pretty much how
it works in real life and so what what I
should say is that I'm no longer the
product manager for go if this is an
opportune time to mention this I haven't
been for over a year nothing I say today
reflects on the current product and so
having said that that this obviously is
based on some of my experience trying to
come to terms out see this job and so it
turns out is super easy once you've got
an idea about what you want to build we
were going to build a CRM release
management server once you've got an
idea it's super easy to come up with
stories I came up with so many stories I
came up with hundreds of those little
guys like loads loads of stories and we
prioritize and estimates the hell out of
those and that was really fun and then
we had to actually build it so that that
kind of that wasn't really problematic
you know we had this idea of a
deployment pipeline and we were going to
make the CI server do a deployment
pipeline and so we were like right let's
build this let's get something in two
months that we can start using and we
found a customer internally within Thor
works and we built it and gave it to
them and they hated it and regretted the
choice to use it and gave us loads and
loads of feedback and we built all that
stuff really really fast and that was
great and we came up with a product in
about six months and I was really happy
about that I thought that was excellent
six months yay
and and you know the next two years were
kind of a blur to be honest it's you
know it's it's very hard work doing
project management and I should say some
people talk about product owner and a
product manager and there's this scaled
agile framework where they kind of look
at you know how many product owners you
need for every project manager and all
this kind of thing I'm going to assume
that you know that there's someone who's
in charge of the products I only call
that person the product manager and not
worry too much about all this stuff if
you're in charge of a product you have
this problem you've got to work out what
to build and all this stuff so after
finishing this job I kind of stopped and
I reflected a bit on you know what was
involved in this role and the thing that
I kind of reflected on was the first
principle of the agile manifesto which
is this so apart from the subliminal
advertising continuous delivery of
valuable software so valuable software
what's valuable software what is value
no and I kind of 5and that you can't
really answer that question and I'd been
proposed to actually answer it today so
it's a bit of a bait-and-switch so sorry
about that but I do propose to kind of
think about it and think about what what
it means and I haven't got a
satisfactory answer to this apart from
to say well it's not a problem that you
can solve by saying we're going to have
a product owner and the product owner
will decide what's valuable the one
thing you can say with absolute
certainty about the product owner is
that they will be wrong about what's
valuable its guarantees so this idea
that the product owner is going to
decide what's valuable and prioritize I
mean yes that's kind of what happens in
reality they're going to be wrong about
value is something that a product owner
product manager is going to be wrong
about so that that was kind of my first
realization which is kind of humbling so
I kind of started to think about you
know what do we mean by value what is
value and in corporate America today
there's a very clear definition of value
which is shareholder value and these
dudes were their names gone here
somewhere Jensen and mecklen came up
with this thing called the theory of the
firm couple of academics and they
basically said the GT of public
corporations is to maximize profits and
that's what value means and this is
actually true in corporate America today
and it's been they've been lawsuits
about it the directors of a public
corporation have a fiduciary duty to
maximize profits that means if you're a
shareholder and the directors aren't
doing this you can sue them for it and
people have done this and they have won
which is kind of nuts however it turns
out to be a really bad idea people
who've done Studies on this have shown
that companies that put their highest
priority on profit are universally less
profitable than the firm that did not
firms that did not so even as a way of
maximizing profits focusing on
maximizing profits turns out to be a bad
way to maximize profits which is a bit
of a bummer and there's this book by
Roger Martin called fixing the game says
the shareholder value model has presided
over a decade a decline in the rate of
return both on equity investment and
capital and company by guess what an
Eightfold increase in CEO compensation
from 1980 to 2000 so what's happened as
a result of this decreasing rate of
return on investment CEO compensation
goes up so it's quite clear who the
winners and the losers are here so this
is kind of not very enlightening as an
approach to value so I was talking in
that price last night and night net
price says well yes this is later crap
let's look at what Elon Musk does now
who's heard of Elon Musk okay a few of
you say Elon Musk was the founder of
PayPal and he made a load of money out
of PayPal and he had all his money
thought what am I going to do well
Elon Musk is now doing
two things and I think basically in my
mind he's the foremost entrepreneur of
modern times so number one thing he
founded a company called SpaceX and this
is this is a the Dragon capsule it's
just recently in the last couple of
months became the first private vehicle
to dock with the International Space
Station so he basically came out of
PayPal said I've got a load of money I
know I'm going to build a rocket and I'm
going to make it fly cargo to the space
station and so that's pretty amazing
frankly in less than ten years he's done
this and I thought well let's let's see
what his vision is so SpaceX is mission
statement is this Elon Musk he and this
is this is not quite as specific as Elon
Musk is about this Elon Musk says I want
to put people on Mars so you know
Rehberg optimized shareholder value like
I need to put people on Mars that's why
in a day how cool is that that's awesome
so you know if we're talking about what
is value that that's a pretty cool
things do in terms of value he also on
the side set up a company called Tesla
Tesla Motors mission statement Tesla
Motors was founded in 2003 by a group of
intrepid Silicon Valley engineers who
set out to prove that electric vehicles
could be awesome
which is just another fantastic mission
statement so you know what is value yeah
this guy I think has a pretty clear
handle on what is value it's going to go
to Mars and build electric vehicles
hooray so that's pretty cool now you
know Elon Musk is a multi-hundred
millionaire as a result of having
founded PayPal and so you know we can't
all be Elon Musk you know it's sad but
yeah on the other hand he's just split
with his second wife and things are
clear on going well from that front so
you know there's advantages too um so
it's kind of busy I guess you know but I
kind of want you to meet this this other
person who I read about recently called
Jack andraka now he was the winner of
the 2012 Intel Science Fair
this guy's 15 years old he won the Intel
science fair for building a diagnostic
tool for pancreatic cancer which detects
a protein commonly used as a biomarker
using carbon nanotubes coated with
antibodies his sensor is a hundred times
more selective than existing diagnostic
diagnostic tests it's 168 times faster
26,000 times less expensive and 400
times more sensitive than the existing
test so you know 15 year old
messing around with some carbon
nanotubes as you do you know bit board
carbon nanotubes give that a go create
some new diagnostic tests for pancreatic
cancer that cost like a few cents and
he's a hundred times more selective than
the existing existing tests and you know
he's just a dude who lives in the middle
America he was just really interested in
this stuff so that that's kind of pretty
inspiring and if you go and read what he
says about how it was that he came to do
this he says this
so I think this is fascinating you know
I'm a parent I've got two kids and I'm
constantly worrying about how I can
bring them up to be you know the next
president and generally just brilliant
and better than me and I kind of think
that maybe I need to teach some load of
stuff and his parents basically didn't
bother they like okay go and work out
yourself I'm not telling you anything
it's an interesting approach to child
rearing but you know I think this is
this is brilliant and and he says
something which is just fascinating I
got really into the scientific method of
developing a hypothesis and testing it
and getting result and getting a result
and going back to do it again so hold
that thought this turns out to be a very
important tool when it comes to working
out what's valuable so one of the people
who is probably the best exponent of
this idea of shareholder value is a guy
called Jack Welch who is chairman of CEO
and in 2009 Jack Welch said said this
about shareholder value after 20 years
of you know trying out so this I think
is actually very insightful your main
constituencies are your employees your
customers and your products and you know
shareholder value as a result of doing
that really really well so let's start
with customers how do we create value
for customers so I was reading a book by
my cousin Anne in Bell called lean IT
and they've got this really nice quote
what a customer's one
and you know anyone in who's actually a
product manager or a product owner in
this room anyone okay TV and any anyone
who's built stuff for people
you know nice that this is essentially
true what do you want I wanna want a row
and you thought I'll go and build a
tower and you build it and then you
shake them out that's not why I wanted a
source rubbish
I own that go and do this other thing is
said yeah and this is the in my mind one
of the biggest problems is scrum is you
have these kind of you know you have a
sprint and you build something and then
you go look at my beautiful child and
instantly someone's like well that's
crap go and do something else is that so
any part of the problem is your
customers don't even know what's
possible most of us don't even know
what's possible I'm going in seeing
things I mean there's a net price and
Steve omen talking about building stuff
with our dream no boards no sorry
Raspberry Pi that new stuff is happening
all the time
you know I come to this conference I
come to this College the last three
years every time I've seen multiple
things that have totally blown my mind
so you know we in the industry don't
know as possible and our customers often
if they're not in the tech world
certainly don't know what they want and
so you can't just ask them what they
want
you have to use anthropological
techniques use fieldwork gather the
buildings see what people are doing
think about what you're going to build
try bunch of things out I mean we're
building complex systems here you can't
plan this stuff in advance you're going
to discover a bunch of stuff in the
course of building it that will
radically change what it is that you
built that's the fundamental truth of
building technological products and they
ain't me and it means that the whole
kind of we're going to come up with
something prioritizing estimating build
is is in my mind fundamentally flawed
and that's been my major learning from
the last three years and so along comes
a guy called Eric Ries with this Lean
Startup idea so he's heard a very sore
the Lean Startup okay I'm about a third
of you and Josh Kerry have skis going to
talk after me and he's going to be
talking a lot more about that but I just
want to basically present what he says
so he says yeah you have a vision for
your products so this is university true
everyone says you have to have a vision
for your products and it is important
you need to use have a dream about what
you're going to do vision kind of sounds
like something you have after taking
drugs which I don't recommend it's not
really great
but you have to have a goal a dream
about what you want to achieve and then
you have to have a business model to try
and actually make money out of it and
the goal is not to make money but money
is the currency through which you pay
for innovation fundamentally so you have
to make money I mean unless you're I
mean even if you're a non-profit you
serve to make money then you have to
write funding proposals which who's
written funding proposals that's
miserable you know but you still have to
demonstrate the value of what you're
building to someone who's going to give
you money so it's fundamentally the same
problem once you have a business model
you need to the first thing you should
do is test that business model and this
I think is one of the fundamental things
that's new in the Lean Startup this idea
that okay the most expensive way to test
your hypothesis about how you're going
to make something valuable the most
expensive way to do that is to actually
build it that's a really expensive way
to test your hypothesis because to build
anything substantial is going to take
you at least six months and maybe a year
or two that's a really expensive way to
test your business model so what Eric
Ries says is don't do that
his story tangentially is that he built
this 3d avatar chat thing called in view
and they spent six months building it
and he was really worried about the
quality he thought there's loads of bugs
in this we're gonna release it it's
going to crash all the time and that's
not going to be good but they released
it because he thought well you need six
months got to release it and it wasn't a
problem and it wasn't a problem because
nobody downloaded it they went to the
page which was advertising it and nobody
clicked on the download link and so he
could have achieved the same results by
producing a static HTML page with the
download link which went to a 404 page
which would have taken him approximately
an hour if he was really focusing on
like nice kind of semantic HTML and some
pretty CSS so that was kind of a massive
waste of time and so what he says is
well you know don't start by building
the thing well how about the smallest
possible amount of work you can do is
test your hypothesis is and then build
that and then iterate and you know this
should be familiar this is the
scientific method you have
pollicis you work out test the
hypothesis you gather data and then you
iterate and that basically is what he's
saying and it's not it's not actually
that new and idea but I think you know
to Eric Ries his credit he's packaged it
and synthesized a load of stuff and told
a load of people and being fantastically
successful and I think that's really
important because one thing to hear this
but I challenge all of you to go away
and actually try and do this it's really
hard I certainly don't feel like I
succeeded and it's really hard to
actually put your money where your mouth
is with this stuff and then you know you
have television you're going to build
stuff you're going to test and iterate
when you do that you're going to reach
the local maximum and I'll talk a bit
more about that later and what that
means is that you're you know you're
going to you're going to get the most
throughput you can through your system
the most people signing up the most
people paying you money but it's not
going to be actually the best way to
achieve your vision and you're going to
have to change your business model and
come up with a new one
that's part of the process of building
great products and building a great
business frankly and then when you do
when you reach that local maximum you
have to think again about how you're
going to approach to achieving your goal
so in terms of the process there's this
thing called the build measure learn
loop and what you want to do is optimize
your process for lead time the time to
go through this leap and that is
fundamentally a different approach to
process than the normal project
management approach because normal
project management approach you optimize
normally for utilization you're going
around looking to see if people are busy
you busy you busy go to you busy good
you're not busy why you busy what are
you doing
you know people project managers worry
if people aren't busy now it's actually
quite easy to demonstrate using queueing
theory that if you optimize for
utilization for people being busy you
create the most inefficient process you
possibly can in terms of throughput in
terms of lead time because what happens
is imagine you're going to an airport
and you're checking in and there's all
these desks and there's only one person
there that person is fully utilized and
it's going to take you a really long
time to get checked inks there's going
to be a massive queue of people in front
of you if there's loads of people
the check-in desk you're going to get
through check-in much more quickly but a
lot of the time those people aren't
going to be fully utilized so just
intuitively you can see from that if you
want to get people if you want to get
work done as quickly as possible you
need a bunch of people who aren't fully
utilized in order to optimize for
throughput so this is a way in which the
standard project management processes is
fundamentally flawed in my opinion
so the easiest way to get really fast
lead time is to reduce utilization put
slack into our systems reduce batch size
reduce work in process so we're doing
less stuff and working on getting that
finished so you have less people queuing
up at the desk and working
cross-functional teams so all sitting
together so you don't have to get
something done and then send it to the
next group of people and have them send
it back as what we did was useless and
I'm not going to spend a lot of time on
this and but it deserves a lot of time
because it fundamentally challenges a
lot of the preconceptions that we have
about how you should run projects
there's a great book I'll have later on
a slide by Don rynason called principles
of product development flow which talks
about this in more detail it's a
brilliant book so you know all very well
maybe you accept this but there is a
problem with it and the problem I
generally find if I talk to people who
are more traditional in their process
and especially people who think that
engineering is what software development
should aspire to you kind of say this
and they nod and they kind of go well
that sounds like a load of crap and if
you compare it to engineering I mean
engineering is held up like proper
building engineering is held up as what
we should be aspiring to you because you
know software breaks all the time and is
buggy whereas building stand-up and they
don't fall down very often don't kill
people and that's much better
and should we all do that and I went to
who's been Caesar Sagrada Familia in
Barcelona okay so what an awesome
building I mean it's nuts
but it's amazing and not just is it
amazing aesthetically but it's also
amazing from architectural point of view
Gaudi was a kind of an awkward trial I
guess and he's
and a lot of time in nature looking at
flowers and plants and seeing how these
things were put together and so you know
there's the typical style of building at
the time he was building was kind of
very you know straight edges corners you
know you had pillars and they were
straight and you had things balancing on
them and they were straight and they
would they were big on straight in
building at that time and Gaudi
basically said well that I'm not doing
any of that that's that's actually not a
good idea and he came up with a
parabolic forms you know were arches the
that was actually an invention of the
what was the predecessor to the Turkish
Empire I thought it was it was it was
the Arabs in the Dark Ages came up with
this idea but he took it one step
further and he actually built these
hyperbolic structures so if you look
inside the building a lot of the support
is hyperbolic structures and this is
really radical and obviously when you're
building large things like this and
you're using completely new engineering
techniques people worry about that
because it you know what if it falls
down that would be bad and so it turns
out that you know this was not a
waterfall process building this if you
go down into the crypts of the Sagrada
família you can see that he had a
workshop and he was constantly building
all these scale models and trying out
all these experiments and there's this
great picture in the museum where he
basically constructed an inverse model
of the church and hung weights to
simulate the loads on the structures to
prove that the thing would actually hold
up which is a brilliant idea I mean what
a genius to come up with that it's
really exciting so he was constantly
having ideas and constantly testing and
experimenting and he built another
hyperbolic church another church using
the hyperbolic architectural style
before he started work on the Sagrada
família to prove that it could actually
be done so it turns out you know even in
engineering work if you're building a
truss bridge you don't need to do any of
this you just pop the numbers into a
model out comes your truss bridge off
you go and build it and it's probably
not going to fall down building
something that's unusual you are going
to do a lot of experimentation and there
is a lot of iteration and you have to
actually do a lot of iterative thinking
about how to build things and again you
want to optimize for getting these
experiments done really really fast and
getting as much learning and information
out as you can one of the other examples
is often given about people who don't
don't behave in this
you know I'll just get right to it
you know the fondle slab the fondle slab
no one new is coming out until it came
out and it was top secret for a number
of years and you know it was not a
public kind of agile iterative process
people don't normally associate Apple
with with agile in any way but if you
look at where Apple came from who knows
what Apple's first product was anyone so
the Apple one the Apple one was built in
Steve Wozniak's shed and it went out in
76 or 77 I think and it looks like this
a bee a bee say talking about minimum
viable products it's kind of a Minimum
Viable products for the time it was
highly advanced I had a keyboard hand
read-only memory and a video interface
so it's pretty advanced but you know
consumers were not lining up to buy this
let's say you know they sell this at the
homebrew Computer Club in Silicon Valley
in Palo Alto and you know Miss Steve
Jobs as a visionary but this is this is
pretty minimum
although viable and if you look at the
Macintosh their history the Macintosh
the Macintosh was the computer that
really changed Apple and made it you
know real player in the industry well
actually that that's not straight you -
the Apple - is the one that made it a
big player in the industry the Macintosh
was arguably arguably kind of a real
consumer product and the dudes who made
it have actually put a lot of stuff
online at folklore dorg and there's a
book that came out of that as well that
I can't remember the name of and they
talked about how they built it and this
is a quote for one of the people who
built it Andy Hertzfeld I think and
here's what you said about how they
built it
so you can see it's a highly iterative
process they were experimenting and
trying out new type new ideas all the
time and one of the interesting things
that the hardware board was designed by
a guy called Burrell Smith and he
develops this unique hardware design
style based on the programmable array
logic chip Pal chips and what that
allowed him to do is just basically
treat the hardware the firmware as if it
was software you would reprogram it burn
a new pal stick into the box boot it up
see what happened I'm not quite sure
about that change the codes burnin you
pal put it in boot it up again so they
could even be highly experimental about
the way the firmware behaves and the ROM
behaves so they actually design the
hardware in such a way that it was
possible to be highly iterative about
the way that they evolved that as well
so very highly iterative experimental
process now we were originally talking
about what is value value to the
customer and the customer hasn't really
figured here I mean get gaudí gaudi's
Church still isn't finished it's quite a
long way over budget and over time and
gaudi's famous comment about this is he
said my customer is not in a hurry
most of us don't have that luxury so I
think the interesting thing about the
Apple stuff certainly the early stuff is
that they built it for themselves it was
really easy for them to work out who
their customer was it was them and and
so you know they didn't have to I mean
it was specifically Steve Jobs because
you had to show Steve Jobs and Steve
Jobs would you know tear you a new one
and tell you to go away and work all
night and come back with something that
was actually good you know it's probably
a bit unpleasant if you were working for
him although the people who actually
happen to develop this crazy Stockholm
Syndrome where they say it was the best
experience ever and so Steve Jobs was
the the customer and you know the rest
of the team were inculcated in the way
of Steve and they learned to see the way
that Steve did about it and so they
built it for themselves more or less I
mean most of us don't have that luxury
and so we have to think we have to we
have to develop empathy empathy for our
customers empathy for our users I was a
talk last week by a guy called Richard
Sheridan who works for he's the founder
of this company Menlo innovation and
they've got this nice exercise they do
when they're building software for
people and what they do is they draw one
of these on the table and they come up
with personas so he's familiar with
personas the concept of personas ok so
I'm not going to explain that yeah well
maybe a little bit you you know you get
a bunch of people who you think use your
product and you can have cut pictures
out of them and talk about their lives
and flesh them out in some detail so you
can empathize with them and what he does
is he says ok in the middle of this
target you can put one person and that's
the primary consumer of your product and
then in that next loop round you can put
two people and then the next week you
can put three people but you have to
start by choosing the one persona who is
the consumer for your products and and
he says that they're the people they're
working with their customers find this
really really problematic they never
want to pick one they say things like
well we want to dominate the sector you
know nobody wants to pick one person and
eventually you know they they do it and
he says they deliberately build this
really big saver you know they put the
persona
on it they glue the personas on and then
they make it really big so that the
customer can't just put it in a drawer
they actually have to put it up on the
wall where they can see it and so they
can be reminded of it all the time which
I can think is nice and one of his
customers probably the product owner of
the product that was being built read
the persona in the middle and says well
I can't relate to this person and
Richard says to them well how many of
these widgets are you buying and the guy
says none and Richard says well why the
hell why the hell should I care what you
think and the guy says you know that's
the area of your process I'm still
having trouble with naturally we want to
build things for ourselves naturally we
do and and actually if you're building a
product that's not just for you
you have to empathize and have to think
about other people and what they want
and what's what's valuable to those
people and that's hard and I think that
the core part of this the one nugget
that you want to take away from this is
that you have to find a way to measure
that value for those people because
otherwise you can't you're not going to
be able to build the right thing you're
not going to be able to sign as valuable
to them unless you work out how to
measure the value that you're going to
live with them and so that this is
really where we we apply the scientific
methods to product development in
measuring value and there's a bunch of
different ways to do this a B testing is
very popular it came from marketing you
know you all that crap junk mail you get
in the mail and you know they don't send
everyone the same thing they send
different people different things and
they measure the response rate and
they're constantly iterating the junk
mail they send out to you to find the
very few people who will actually reply
to it and you know email it's the same
thing I mean one of the interesting
things about that is you know the
Nigerian 401 emails that you get you
will have noticed in the last few years
that they've become dramatically worse
and more obviously nonsense and they've
done that on purpose through a purp
through a process of a B testing because
what they discovered is that they want
to weed out false positives they only
want the people they only want people to
reply who are so gullible that they will
actually be taken in
by this and so they make it deliberately
less grammatical to ensure that only
truly gullible people will actually
reply so don't get a bunch of people who
are then going to you know in later
rounds actually realize that it's a
stupid idea you know which is an
unfortunate reflection on humanity I
think in many ways but it's a very kind
of compelling demonstration of a be
testing but you know it's very easy to
do a/b testing in software Google
Analytics provides it out-of-the-box now
you can Google Analytics is free you can
install it you can put it on your
website it'll track everyone coming to
your site and you can run a/b tests
totally free out of the box so that's a
great way to measure if something is
valuable to someone you know if you
don't if you don't a release to the
world which is very common you know if
your Apple you're not going to release
the world you're going to get a bunch of
real people you're going to make them
sign iron cast NDA's and then you're
going to show them the fondle slap and
kind of get them to use it and people
film people using their products you
know gal the building go and film people
using your products and interacting with
them and giving giving you real feedback
well see once people have got something
they can give you very rich information
on what's wrong with it but you have to
get it and give it to them and get real
feedback another technique which is
useful especially in software as a
service when you're building websites
for people is measuring real best
business metrics so one of the things
the people at Etsy do is the ops folk
Etsy focus on two things one one is
provisioning the capacity and all the
usual thing that operations people worry
about they also spend a lot of time
building metrics frameworks but the
application can hook into so they can
measure user behavior and measure things
like how many people actually buy what
the conversion rate is all these kind of
metrics on people spending money and
when they put features out they can
measure the effects of those features on
user conversion rates
so measuring real business real you know
how much money people pay real business
metrics and noticing when you put new
features out what the effects of those
is that's another really compelling way
to to actually measure real value and in
fact this for me is so compelling that
the next projects I work on for me it
has to be a web-based
system where you can actually measure
this stuff because it's so powerful as a
technique if I was given a choice
between building something as a user
installed product and building it as a
website I would always go for the
website because it means you can do this
and it's so powerful as a way of
actually getting real-time feedback on
the features that you're building
whether they're really valuable to
people and then you know there's surveys
social media all of this kind of stuff
for me the seconds and all right before
I move on for me this is part of the
core of what products managers and
product owners should be doing it's
working out how you're going to measure
value and working with your team to work
out how you're going to do that that for
me you know once you've you know you've
got some funding you've got an idea this
is one of the first things you should be
doing is working out how to measure the
value of what you're delivering whether
people actually care about it and want
to use it and this feeds into the way we
analyze the work we're going to build
and I often talk about done and done
done done is def complete done done is
released into production and one of the
other nuggets that I got out of the Lean
Startup is a kind of redefinition of the
concepts of done and grok it say this
about being done so you're not done when
you're released into production
you're only done when you work out if
the story you completed was a good idea
to have done in the first place so step
beyond released into production
it's we actually learned whether what we
built was a good idea to have done in
the first place and that should be part
of your story part of the acceptance
criteria for your story should be how do
we measure if this is actually a good
idea or not I think that's tremendously
powerful idea so let's look at a case
study of this startup lessoned learned
conf last year in San Francisco company
called voters in came along this guy
Dave Vanessa did a presentation and he
had this nice graph and you know this
kind of thing is gold dust when people
actually tell you about their conversion
rates for their products so they built
version 1.0 of their products and put it
live took them six weeks cost them
twelve hundred and six dollars and they
acquired five
percent of the people who came to the
site and you know 17% of those people
the 5% actually activated their account
and so did a bunch of a/b testing and
through a/b testing they got to the
stage where they got 4% referrals and
five percent retention people who
actually came back and used it again and
they couldn't get any better than that
by using a/b testing they reached a
local maximum a be testing couldn't get
it any better and so what they did is
they did what's called a pivot they
thought well this isn't going to work
we're going to have to change our
business model and come up with
something else and you know we're not
going to go into exactly what they were
you can get the talk online this is the
URL but they change their their business
idea and two-point version too you know
that this is the important number it
turns out because you know without this
number you can't actually carry on as a
business they actually got to the stage
where 1% of people got revenue but
actually paid good money and then they
fell one percent you know it's alright
but it's not going to get us where we
need to in terms of creating a
sustainable business and so they pivoted
again came up with a new idea and
everything else was looking better until
they got down here and no one was
actually spending any money and so they
went to the back to the drawing board
and they thought about it again came up
with something completely new and then
they reached you know 11% revenue and
that was a big enough number that they
could create a sustainable business and
work on it so you know what the thing to
take away from this is that a be testing
and measurement is not going to get you
all the way there some point you're
going to reach a local maximum you want
to have to think again about what it is
you're building and come up with a new
business model a new idea and try that
it's very important that's why you need
a vision you need to have a vision about
how you want to change the world and
then you're going to have to try a bunch
of different ways to actually do that
and you can't pivot too often because in
the end it just becomes you get
cognitive dissonance over time and it
just becomes too much work so that's not
but at least with the data you can
realize whether you're there or not and
make rational decisions based on real
data are am i there or not which is
really important and I think also really
the true measure of value is is this are
people actually going to use
stuff this this is a article about
writing about writing novels and the
subtitle of the novel is no one wants to
read your and he has this
fundamental realization about the nature
of what he's doing and he says this you
know writing a book is what he says but
the same thing applies to products
and I think this is something that it's
worth bearing in mind all the time when
we're building stuff all of us whether
we're developers or testers or
operations product owners whatever we do
you have to be thinking about this the
people who are going to use your stuff
that they're giving you their time and
probably their money as well
and you always want to think about you
know you need to respect that people are
giving you time and money and you have
to think about how you're going to how
going to create something amazing for
them so they do that for you because you
know the point you need to get money out
of this bout of building stuff as a say
your business but the point is not money
the point is achieving your vision if no
one's going to pay for it or use it it
doesn't matter if someone buys it in
management but the users don't use it
doesn't matter and if users I mean the
classic example this is the time and
expenses apps if uses a man data to use
it it doesn't matter because you know if
someone's forcing you to use something
then you kind of have to use it and so
all your measures all your measurements
are kind of going to be off so I kind of
want to return to thinking about the
product manager role we're kind of
getting close to time so what is the
role of a product manager a product
owner well what are we trying to do I
think firstly you have to not just
create a shared vision but communicate
it to everyone on your team everyone on
your team needs to be excited about what
it is you're doing sales people
marketing developers and everyone has to
feel like they're contributing to that
vision as well in order to be excited
about it if you've read Drive it talks
about the importance of actually people
feeling they're contributing to what it
is they're doing the second thing you
have to do is work with the team to
define how you measure the value of what
it is you're delivering and then run
experiments use the scientific methods
you have a hypothesis what's the
smallest amount of work you can do is
test the hypothesis run that test get
feedback build measure learn and that
involves making sure that your process
is optimized for cycle time and then
something that Deming once said is build
quality into your process and I think
this is kind of tangential to
why I've said but it's essential for the
role of the product manager is that
quality is everyone's responsibility we
all need to be thinking about what we're
building and that it's valuable to
people so in terms of product
development here's the lifecycle that I
think is the one that I've come away
with is a good one to use inception is
where everyone on the team gets together
and works out the vision and the
business model and comes up with a
Minimum Viable Product
what are we going to build test our
business idea and then you start
building it and then you get data and
then you keep running building new stuff
testing it getting feedback building new
stuff so start with the dividing vision
defining the vision and the MVP get
feedback keep delivering in small
increments and notice what's not on here
creating an enormous prioritized
estimated backlog is not on this list I
think fundamentally it's completely
wasteful especially estimation
estimation I think fundamentally is a
wasteful activity because there's a book
called how to measure anything and what
it says is that when you look at
products over their lifecycle cost
actually has a very low information
value in terms of what you should what
you should build the high information
value is value the value it delivers
over its lifecycle and if you've done a
good job the cost will be
infinitesimally small or we know very
small compared to the return you get on
the investment over the lifecycle of
that thing so estimation as a way to do
high-level planning and come up with
cost measures we spend a lot of time on
that and the reason we spend a lot of
time on that is because it's easy to do
it's substitution we've taken a
difficult question what's the return on
our investment what's the value we're
going to deliver and substitute it with
a question is easier to answer which is
how much is it going to cost but
fundamentally how much it costs is not
actually that important especially if
you're only building a Minimum Viable
Product a much more important thing to
do is say well we're going to time box
the Minimum Viable Product and make sure
that we're going to deliver something in
a few weeks and certainly not more than
three months and that for me is the most
important thing you can do is say we're
going to win
going to take more than we're going to
set a rigid time time box for this thing
few weeks not one three months and build
something and get real feedback how can
I get feedback more quickly so that's
kind of the main takeaway from me over
the last three years of doing product
development is that this is actually a
much superior way to to build products
but I want to think for a little bit
about individual productivity because
this is something as a manager you have
to worry about is you know how do you
measure the value of your people and how
do I as someone working the organization
know what value that I'm giving to the
organization and we've had a series of
really poor measures of this and people
used to measure lines of code right you
know and people would have to fill in
lines of code on timesheets as a measure
of their productivity and you know for
developers and this is fundamentally
flawed because lines of code are a
liability not an asset now I went into a
large company and they proudly told me
they had ten and a half million lines of
C++ and which is a which is horrible
because you have to maintain that stuff
and the cost of maintaining lines of
code is extremely high what you want to
do is always be working out how to
reduce the size of your code base lines
of code reliability and lots of
accounting lots of CFOs start thinking
about accounting in terms of measuring
lines of code I once Mike Nygaard went
to a company where the the auditors
asked them to put in a subversion hook
to measure the number of lines of code
so they could count it as a line item on
the balance sheet as an asset lines of
code reliability hours worked well hours
worked is the throne with hours worked
is that encourages people to work at an
unsustainable pace and encourages heroic
behavior know the people who work crazy
hours to get the system up and running
in my experience those people are the
same people who screwed up in the first
place so that it was under pliable just
saying and you know if you work for four
minutes okay and you know if you work a
crazy long time often that just makes
you stupid
so this is a really insightful statement
for me
people focus on cost because it's so
hard to measure Valley how do we measure
value of people well my last kind of
comment is this
I went to a talk by this guy Mike rather
last week and he studied Toyota and
Toyota obviously well known for being
the Acne of lean and he asked the
managers how how do you learn how to be
great managers they said oh no they said
what do you go on training courses no
does anyone teach you no so how do you
do what you do don't know and basically
what he worked out is that there's an
inbuilt coaching process you are you're
taught without knowing it basically
because the primary job of leaders in
the organization is to teach people and
whether they teach them they teach them
how to run experiments really really
fast how to always be trying new things
and running experiments and learning
from them and that's how you get better
as as a person that's how we get better
at what we do jobs and I think said
that's what you want to measure in terms
of personal productivity and
organizational productivity you want to
build organizations that learn fast and
measure the money value delivered so I
don't have time to go into this into a
lot of detail but I think it's a very
interesting I'm going to leave the last
word to Jack andraka our friend from
before I think you know from a 15 year
old this is one of them I mean this
generally is kind of the most insightful
statement about building anything I
think and that really for me is key to
everything that we do
value is what gives your life meaning so
find out what you care about what do you
care about all of you what do you care
about if you could guarantee that you
wouldn't fail what is it that you would
do if you could walk out today and do
anything you wanted and guarantee that
you wouldn't fail what is it that you
would do
thanks very much what questions do you
have yeah like a couple minutes or one
minute or something Tunis yes thanks
very much so this lady for the recording
is saying that her experiences that
people focus on costs and estimation and
the probably estimates is that they're
they're wrong especially as predictions
they're they're terrible and they set up
the wrong expectations and that that's
absolutely right that's something I
didn't address but this is another
reason why estimation is not just
valueless it actually has negative value
because it sets up the wrong
expectations people experiments to be
right and again the one thing I can tell
you about your estimates as they will be
wrong and those are bad expectations
what estimation does do is estimation
helps create a shared vision of what
you're going to build that for me is the
biggest value of estimation is there at
the end of it after days of grueling
breaking down of features and arguing
over implementation and coming up with
numbers and variances you know he deals
with days and it's exhausting everything
you come out with is going to be wrong
but what you have done which is useful
is is come up with a shared vision of
how to build a product and that's great
but there's a way to achieve that that
doesn't involve coming up with all these
meaningless numbers and you're right you
know focusing on value instead I think
your item is it's a game-changer
so thanks thanks for showing your
experience yeah one more so the question
is you know managers say that they want
estimates because they have an idea and
they say well great you can build that
how long is it going to take or how much
is it going to cost them now how do you
answer that question well I think that
the problem is you don't know what
you're going to build
anytime you're building anything
innovative but I mean if you're building
an Accounts Payable system you know what
you're going to build but then you
shouldn't be building custom software
you should buy an off-the-shelf package
don't customize it customise your
process to meet the way the package
behavior building you're building cost
custom software's cuz you wanna do
something innovative and sorry if you're
doing something and obviously you don't
know what you're going to build and so
fundamentally you know you have to say
we don't know what we're going to build
and so you can't estimate it what we can
do is work out how to test the business
idea and we want to do that in a short
amount of time so we can cut our losses
if it turns out to not to be a good idea
let's work out how we can test that idea
in a couple of months so that we can cut
a lot as if it turns out not to be a
good idea and just reframe the problem
we friend the problem is we've got an
idea for we want to build
we don't always going to look like if we
do get to details we're going to be
wrong let's work out how we can test
that hypothesis you have to reframe the
discussion yeah and some people aren't
going to get it and you know then
there's not very much you can do but I
think you know hopefully people have had
enough experiences of it going horribly
wrong that they want to try something
different
it's only been the case for me that's it
right okay well I'll be around feel free
to get in touch with me thanks thanks
