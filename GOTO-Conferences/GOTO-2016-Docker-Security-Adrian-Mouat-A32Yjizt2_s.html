yeah before we get started how many of
you are using docker the minute you put
your hand up
okay so quite a few how many of you are
using docker in production for your hand
up you got introduction okay that's not
bad that's quite a high ratio you brief
you just joking um so yeah I'm gonna be
talking about docker security the boring
bit about me my official title is choice
general she's scientists at container
solutions but I wrote the book using
docker for O'Reilly publishing if you
want discount you can use the cord off
dealer le site there's also the free
 security mini book you can get
from O'Reilly and that will cover a lot
of what I'm going to talk about today
and I'm also a dream more on Twitter
okay ticket for you yeah so I'm going to
talk about docker security I'll start by
talking about the benefits of security
why security is important
I'll then talk about some specific
specific container attack vectors and
security philosophy what you should be
thinking about when you design a secure
system
well then every short demo so there's
potential for things to go horribly
wrong like just now and the final part
of the talk I'll be going through some
specific tips and techniques for
securing a docker a micro service based
system okay so one of the funny things
about security is you don't really get
anything for right nobody comes and
gives you a gold star if you have a
secure system sometimes it's no
different from an insecure system
there's just a bunch of things that
don't happen right so what doesn't
happen is if site doesn't go down
because there's some trivial trivial do
s exploit your front page doesn't look
like this because some script kiddies
managed to break in hack it
you don't start selling viagra on this
idea at least they assumed
team-playing Kings from UK didn't mean
to start selling viagra on the site you
don't lose your customers credit card
details clearly that's quite a bad one
potentially put our company at business
you definitely don't lose the records
for like since the military intelligence
personnel and this includes their
families as well so these these were
people that could be directly targeted
by foreign governments or criminal
elements um okay so that's why security
is important the next thing I want to
talk about is what some important
container attack attack vectors are so
things that are perhaps particularly
important and container or micro-service
say it's the first one in flux the most
obvious one it's caring what attacks so
I should probably aware in a docker
based system the containers shared the
kernel with the hosts and the other
containers that are running what that
means is if for example a kernel panic
was to occur we think they're not just
like container but the host and all
containers on it so that's certainly
something to bear in mind related to
that if one container starts using a lot
more resources for example memory it can
potentially starve out other containers
on the host and the independent nail
service continue breakouts
we'll talk about this a lot and this is
just the worry that perhaps an attacker
can break out of a container and onto
the host machine itself or into other
containers and poisoned images so this
is just how do you know of what's in
your images you're running especially
images he downloads from docker hub are
you sure they are what you think they
are
are you sure nobody's tampered with some
in transit or at rest and are you sure
they're not very old or in durable
versions of software secrets so we've
dealt with you know API passwords
database passwords and API tokens for a
long time but it becomes I'm going to
keep problem with micro services you've
got all these containers coming up and
going down living for only a few seconds
so we have to be able to automate how we
get our secrets into our containers etc
security paradigms so what I want you to
think about here is how should you think
about security when you design the
system and there's two main paradigms I
want you to bear in mind the first one
is defense and depth so don't just rely
on anyone they are for security don't
just rely in like a firewall to Freud
you secure system as well as a firewall
you need other levels like encryption
and monitoring and so on and the analogy
is with a castle where you don't you
have the moat you've got thick battement
walls you've got the fenders and the
inside shooting out you got part colors
etc and also to be multiple keeps inside
so there's a lot of levels to get to
before you can get to the crown jewels
as it were and also the concept of least
privilege this is a very old paradigm
goes back to I think 70s by Jerome
Seltzer someone and it basically says
that a process or container if you only
have access to the data and resources
that are essential to its function yeah
so for example if your container does
need access to a database
I shouldn't be even on the same network
necessarily if a database and certainly
shemail to connect to it it's a great
talk by this McCauley and dealer Monica
who are security engineers at docker and
they did the talk called least
privileged micro services at docker coin
last year so I encourage you to look at
that if you want to hear more about this
all the demo do I have a yeah so I've
only done this thing once or twice I
could go horribly wrong what I've done
if they've run this container called
Noatak
what should give you a I clue that
perhaps things are gonna go wrong I know
is it's a simple service that allows me
to upload a Yama file so I'll show you
an example oh I see the yellow file
first so we've got simply Yama file like
that we're going to upload it
I know this is highlighted it's a very
simple service but it turns out the
youngin library were using is vulnerable
and so if we upload this dll file and
should already see something not quite
right there so some JavaScript code in
there we upload this what we get is this
so you can see something's not quite
right I'm gonna go back to the main page
our main page has been overwritten so
clearly that's not a good situation to
be in and if this doesn't happen to you
ideally you'll have or you suspect your
systems in compromised in some way
ideally you'll have like guidelines in
place that you can refer back to and
deal with situations like that but you
first what you want to do is to isolate
the container I'm probably the horse
that's run around as well and then you
want you don't want to delete the
container because you want to like look
at it and analyze it and figure out how
it was hacked so you can prevent it in
the future and preferably you don't even
want to stop it because they may also
want to look at a processors when I'm
inside but you do need to isolate it
immediately I'm just a few tools we can
do use so the easiest way to isolate a
container is let's even get this command
correct yeah so that should connect
disconnect the running container from
the docker Network so I'm assuming if I
reload yeah so that's no one accessible
and then it's still running and also
even though it wasn't when he was only
stopped I can still analyze the
filesystem so I can win docker death and
that's tell me which files have changed
for the image was created on so I can
see that somebody's modified their index
dot HTML from just running docker diff
so there's already some tools of docker
gives you for helping to analyze tax etc
okay yeah but occasionally there's also
a bunch of ways we can mitigate attacks
like this using sort of simple docker
tools and I quickly want to show you one
of these called them read-only so if
you've only said we'd only flag what
happens is the container file system is
set read-only so we can see what happens
if we rerun so we stop remove this
container and I'll rerun it but was a
video on the file system
hopefully that's up again
yep so I try and upload the same Yama
file I get an exception and this semi
front page is fine I'd ask because
docker a hi stopped the in the
JavaScript from him to write to file so
I can't offer right the main page so
it's very important to point out that
that's not a solution
it's a mitigation it's it's cut thing
what the attacker is able to do but
they're still of a more exploit their
you know attacker is still executing
JavaScript on the our computer so the
real solution is actually to remove the
vulnerable young alive we got swelling
inside that container and ideally we'd
be able to do this automatically right
we could in our build process we could
automatically scan our images for
vulnerabilities such as this and that
such is when I was really starting to
take off in the docker community so
there's a bunch of utilities now that I
do image Karen there's not list which is
doctor Inc solution they've talked about
it a bit already but it's not actually
gone lie for the public quite yet I
believe that's literally half the night
of this week and next week though as
other solutions is clear from core OS
which is a free and open source solution
the speaker from skylock which I played
with a bit ago image in a minute twist
lock and it's also atomic scale
converter dld roughly the same thing so
all they do is you're giving your image
yup Floyd
I'll send it to the server however and
it tells you what Vernon bills has fines
based on CVEs so this is what I got when
I uploaded that image interestingly
pretty much all of the vulnerabilities
that fines are from the underlying
Debian image and this is like a latest
Debian image and the docker hub so
apparently is 113 Havener abilities in
this case I can clearly that's not good
and you will find at the minute if you
even have Debian image that they have
there was firm abilities it's generally
in things like lib ping as one of the
big ones and stuff that you possibly
don't care about but it's still not a
great situation the but this isn't a
fault containers right even for Debian
VM er and when to do VM you still have
those same vulnerabilities just they're
not patched by default of the minute you
can't very like a more minimal thing and
we'll get to that in a minute but at
least it's highlighted that issue and we
can move on to fix things from there and
yeah that's the next part let me talk so
just looking at some specific tips and
techniques for securing systems so a lot
of people ask our containers more secure
than virtual machines and then some
interest on the bait to have but it's
also a bit of a false dichotomy because
you generally be using virtual machines
and containers together
most commonly you'll be running your
containers and site virtual machines and
what you can do is use virtual machines
to segregate groups of containers at
level of confidentiality so you can do a
level of users but you can also do a
level of systems so you may have a one
group of containers that's doing your
processing for credit-card details on
the other set of containers that's
handling and OGS front end and you can
keep those and set with VMs in that way
if an attacker breaks into the OGS
front-end they still got a lot of work
to do before we can get to the credit
card processing containers this is more
something just to be aware of if any of
somebody has access to start your
containers they basically have root
access on the host right they could for
example
mount the root directory and play with
things so
he gives me doctor access you've given
him root access to that machine and
because of that you get to be very
careful he give access to if you're
using the remote API make sure you
control who has keys and only allow
access via the internal networks or VPN
when the interestings like containers is
that not everything
it's namespace right so one thing that's
not namespace is time so the tangs the
same in a container on the host the
kernel keyring isn't named spaced and
also users aren't quite namespace at the
minute what that means it's a UID in a
container it's usually the same CID in
the host so if I'm running as root in a
container
I'll just contain a break out an attack
reminder to break out the container they
will then be root on the host which is
clearly a bad situation there is some
work in addressing this the docker level
so there is like usernames Basin
appeared in doctor 110 but there are
some and what that does is it
automatically mapped root to a high
numbered user in the host but there are
some issues for example you can't use it
with video in the file systems currently
you can't use a - just Nicol the host or
- - PID equal to host and there's also
some issues around volumes so you may
have trouble using that the user name
spacing and for that reason is very
important to set users for your
container so you will be in your
containers we will set user for the
process to run us and this is very
simple to do you can just add I actually
took this example from the Redis docker
file so you can see all we're doing is
running the route group pod commanding
or docker file that creates this user
and then we can use the user statement
to switch that user and that will take
effect for all following lines in the
docker file and when you start the
container in some cases you may want to
do something as route when your
container starts up for example I change
the pointer ship for missions and files
and in that case you'll want to create
an entry point script that does what you
do is route and then switches to the
lesser privileged user we've seen this
already but it is a very very effective
way of control of limiting access that
attackers
after a system just setting a bead on
the file system it's also very simple to
do and a lot of cases applications won't
be happy when I read only right because
they'll have some one or two temporary
files they want to write to what you can
do is you can explicitly mount those of
the volume so you sort of put calls in
the view on the file system you can also
use temp is for such things which is
quite nice and that's a you know when
the container comes down that we wiped
as well so that can be quite an
interesting technique very similarly we
can make volumes as read-only so the
attacker can't overwrite things drop
capability so Linux kernel defines a
whole set of capabilities like 30 or 40
different sets of capabilities which we
map on two sets of system calls the
kernel system caused by default a dock
container gets a reasonably large subset
of these but by no means all you can get
most of the capabilities by adding the -
- privilege flag or you can either
remove specific privileges by using cap
drop and kappahd so in this first
example it's a pointer what does how
doesn't work so we can in the first
example were dropping the ability to set
the set UID bit on binaries and the set
G idea and binaries and in the second
example we're dropping the all
capabilities and just adding back just
like once we need there's a couple of
problems this technique the first one
being how do you know which capabilities
your container needs it's not really
trivially it's kind of a you know trial
and experiment case a minute and the
second one is there's some capabilities
I think it's sysadmin and net admin that
map to a whole bunch of kernel cause
there's just too much in them are not
granular enough that's been addressed
the minute by sit comp so there is fit
comp support a newer Linux kernels and
new versions of docker but you'll need
to be running like a Linux kernel
written for and that allows you to
specifically define which kernel calls
are allowed to be made
CPU share so I actually recommend my
default you don't play with the CPU
shares because by default containers
will get equal access to the CPU in
event of contention but in some cases
you may want to say give one set of
containers higher taxes than others so
like you know you might have more
important batch processing and/or less
important batch processing and more
important interactive notes or something
and what you can do then is pass a sea
flag but you have to remember that this
is the docker uses weightings here and
this is a relative weight not 1 or 2 4
so in this example the first docker
container gets the default weight in the
one or two for then next you are given a
weight in 5 1 2 so what that means is
the first container can access up the
half the CPU and a next 2 can access up
to a quarter each so you have to
understand that this default weighting
one or two four and how it's worked out
which perhaps isn't necessarily obvious
you know for example you do like - c1
thinking that'll say a CPU shares but
I'll actually up an event of contention
if there's some like default container
and they'll get all the C for you and
it's actually once we get none so you
have to be a bit careful about that
their memory limits this is much more
important because by default a document
thinner can use as much memory as it
likes but you can constrain the memory
by pastner's - m 512 megabytes in this
case this also swap memory against my
defaults with default that will also
give it 5 min 12 megabytes of swap
memory or a total of a gigabyte and you
can control that separately set C ID and
sit UID binaries so the default like
Debian and Ubuntu images come with some
binaries that run with elevated
privileges an issue of these is that
Mitaka
gets into your system you may be able to
exploit them these binaries to elevate
the privileges the thing is you probably
don't need them in your containers so
you can actually just take them out if
you want
and if you run this fine command in a
container in the default Debian
container you'll find a bunch of
programs like this and so for example
who knows what CH offenders one or two
people so most of you don't you know
what CH offenders which means you can't
really be using it and it is arguably a
security risk I mean it's old and
well-maintained programs so I'm assuming
they figured it you know it's not gotten
your security risk potentially acute
ah've and you don't need it so it may as
well take it out yeah by the way it
stands for change filming I believe so
it's it's the thingy password is used by
finger and Simpson but it's simple to
turn off we can just take a remove to
set UID bit with a command such as this
so we're doing chmod a - yes and all the
files both missions are plus 6,000 and
he do that and then the command again
there's not such very minimal images
so this largely comes back to that
earlier picture we saw a peeker and the
hundred and thirteen was a high
vulnerabilities you can use minimal
images like Alpine's that have much less
in them niether less software there's
just less things that can be exploited
and I actually on the same thing that
I'll play and it finds zero for
nobility's I'm picker you know is to
analyze and based on binary level so it
should find the same vulnerabilities if
they are there so basically if you're
very less software you've listed TAC
surface yeah so look at our paint
container but you can go even further
and just create a static binary that
even in the container and have no
operating system at all so you just got
the kernel and your binary there you can
do it with gold I guess you can also do
if you compile it like a static C binary
I'm not obviously really cuts down your
attack surface it does mean that you may
have more problems like debugging and
stuff because you won't be even able to
get bash shell for example in your
container Linux security modules so
delays kernel lets you plug in security
modules there's two famous ones SELinux
and a palmer SELinux was originally
developed by the NSA it's
mainly iris irate at product it gives us
policy based access control this idea of
man 3xs control that can't be changed as
opposed to discretionary access control
and basically applied labels and types
and it compares those to the labels and
pipes that processes like to access and
it covers file access sockets interfaces
really is quite powerful but it's quite
detailed and can be a bit of a pinata
character-defining on policy it's what
you really like to be able to do is say
ok I've got my like web server policy
for my nginx containers go and run those
containers with that policy and you
can't do that but I find it very hard to
figure out exactly how to write the
policy and if you do use it and I say
have to use the Vice mappers here I
think that's not quite true anymore I
think you can use better FS but the
thing is using su links are basically
run in the Reta ecosystem most likely so
you're probably using device mapper and
running on like one of the r8 arts rails
or sent to us for example or atomic and
the first thing you notice is that it's
extra work to work for volumes so for
example he turned selinux you just write
a file on fight amount that's a volume
you're going to get permission denied
the reasoning a permission denied is
simply because the the file is not
labeled for being accessed by a
container we can change that fairly
simply with a CH conch command but you
kind of gotta know that you got to do
something like that I'm not being
entirely fair here you don't have to run
the CH conch command you can just append
a call and 0 no to enter the - V
argument and that all sort of running to
see its current command in the
background but you still have to be like
to do that up armor so that's very
similar to see Linux but a bit similar
possibly not as powerful it's used for
giving a bun - I'm interestingly you'll
find this on by default so you're
running containers on top of debuting at
the minute you are using a farmer and
again at limits container access to
files and kernel capabilities and you
can define your own policies as process
based
I'm generally not as fine grained as
SELinux it's also something to pin the
iris but
jessie Frizzell he was a engineer at
docker know at mesosphere wrote a tool
called beam and that's quite a nice
little way of creating your own policies
and just simple for simplifies doing
things so I've checked out if you're
interested you can also run a security
Hardin kernel so this is just a particle
very security out enhancements that the
main ones gr security and the main thing
they have is from God packs and it's
basically a set of memory little
protection so I'll do things that
randomize things in memory and it also I
get not certain areas of memory as a
read-only and so it can be executed
cetera there is a couple of issues they
tend to lag behind the latest kernel
versions we may have features that you
want to use the latest kernel version
that aren't available in to your
security and it also be a minor
performance degradation um verify images
so this comes back to the poison damages
idea you want to be sure that the images
that you're running are what you think
they are and you know where they come
from so if you get images from a docker
hub at a minute I would say trying using
the official image if you can and you
can't use an official image make sure
you only use an automated bill don't go
and use like some random image because
you don't know what's in there right at
least when automated bail-in go and
check docker file I can go and find the
github sources that it was built from
and verify what's going on there even
going further and just download the
source and build it yourself and that
gives you an extra level of security to
be sure what you're pulling is what you
think is as in there hasn't been
tampered with either rest or in transit
and you really want to either pull by a
digest which is long like sha hashes or
turn on docker content trust and that
basically allows a scene of images etc
I'm auditing so one of the nice things
right docker is this idea of immutable
infrastructure so generally with docker
when you're running containers you don't
change those running containers right
it's not like the old VM days when we
had puppet or chef or something running
i knee up dated the packages on the fly
generally what you do is containers or
you should be trying to do with
containers that's we need to update
something you change the docker file you
update the image that you create a new
container and then you remove the old
container so that's the way you update
things you don't change things over time
in the container only the nice things
about that is that means you can audit
the offline images and so once you've
audited the offline images Ayumi all at
one image and that'll cover like a
hundred containers and you can then
verify those containers have not drifted
from the image you're built from using
tools like dr. death and also there's a
bunch of scaring tools that I talk to
the area like the pker and skeleton
twister that you can use to check your
images for vulnerabilities obviously if
a vulnerability and even ability is
found you have to scan not just the
images in production before the belt and
pushed but the vellum images as well
secrets so this is a quite an
interesting topic I've got this cut off
here so this cat was cut in London and
its owner the cat coming home from with
all these keys and things stuck through
its magnetic collar and at first the
owner felt quite sorry for it we've
always been flagged I know he's keys and
stuff but it turned out the cat was
actually going hunting out the
neighbours keys and the back garden and
stuff intentionally and dragging them
home but guess Kostyra shiny I know yeah
the neighbors got a little bit upset
when their spare keys went missing so
the civil ways you can share secrets
with containers and as I said before
this is quite a you have to be you have
to really think about this one like
server setup cuz it has to be automatic
and the first the most obvious way is
just to write your secrets into the
image right so you just put in your
docker file as a variable your API token
or whatever hopefully you all thinking
that's a very bad idea
because it is anybody was actus the
image is going to access to your secrets
so don't do that
the next way and this is quite popular
it's not terrible but it's not my
favorite way and you can sit environment
variables for secret so in this case we
can see you say an epi talking with
environment variable andrey smart people
use this is because it's suggested by 12
factor ops user we are thrill factor
apps
what's you cool yeah so I'm not knocking
fill factor up so toll I really like
that manifesto but environment variables
are probably better in VMs and their own
containers and the reason is they can
just be seen in too many places right so
if you used - - link to network
containers the link container gets
access to all the variables in user
container if you run docker inspect you
see the variables here on PS you can see
the variables you can't change them once
or set so it's not like you can just
overwrite them oh and so you get issues
like for example if somebody supporting
you on the ass fur type of doctor
inspect or the article type env and you
say into them without thinking and
suddenly you've like shared all your
secrets through API tokens with the
support people by accident so that's the
reason I don't like environment
variables yeah so if you're not using
environment labels what can you do well
the only other easy option is to use
volumes so you put your secrets into the
volume and make that you can't just make
the whole configuration file with a
secret inside it so nothing just the
secret itself and that's fairly simple
and it works is a little bit icky I
guess the main issue is a file so a
tendency to get shared and checked into
version control Barkston and the future
I believe belongs to secure key value
stores there's two main ones for these
administers and is this is just the same
idea it's like a Redis key value store
but it's specially set up to store
sensitive information such as API tokens
and TLS certificates and there's two
main solutions vault and key ways and
they tend to have a bunch of nice
features like leases so you can see how
long secrets good for from take care
surroundings encrypted properly
and this is I believe four things are
going but the feel a bit of work to get
there and you're probably asking well
how did you get access to the key value
store doesn't that require a secret and
the kind of does right so you still need
like to use an environment variable or
something to get access to the key value
store but it's a few things you can do
you could use like a one-time password
so after your container accesses the key
value store the talking that was used to
access that the key value store is
invalidated and can't be used again so
even if it's given away or leaked or Ana
targets it is useless to them uh I think
vault has his idea of a PI d 4 by it
generates a token based on some
information it already has like a MAC
address there's also very nice idea the
volume plugins so by using a volume
plug-in you can you use a volume plugin
you can set of the authentication to the
key value store outside the container
and inside the container you find a file
that's meant to vollis secrets you have
access to inside it so I definitely
that's a feature but it's maybe not
quite there yet
yeah in conclusion a main point I want
to make it's like containers and
security they're just identical
isolation to existent system so here
Vernon with VMs in a minute I mean
either in containers you're not going to
get less secure unless you do something
very stupid right you only add in more
tools or more isolation and you have
extra tools to work with for it restrict
and attackers if you are concerned about
container security do use from VMs and
keep in mind principles of defense and
depth and at least privilege and that's
it thank you
okay so we have a couple of questions so
the first question I guess you already
just answered really it do you think
that containers are inherently more
insecure or do you think that the
security issues are simply different and
unfamiliar to people and that's why that
people have problems with it so yeah
they are different I mean people do
sometimes compare like DM securing
container security and they make the
point that hypervisor is hired could be
more secure than like the the kernel but
I'm not always convinced with the
argument that perhaps it is but yes so
if you're worried about it use VM some
containers together and you just do give
you all these extra tools of security so
in the long run I think it's it's great
for security okay is there any
situations where you wouldn't use
containers because of a security risk
well no that's what I would say as he do
have a specific worry you end up running
your containers in VMs to address the
risk so when when you guys create
containers do you run do you have a
continuous a build system that validates
them against one of these checking tools
for things playing with that but I'm
doing things any but this this is very
new technology hmm and I mean I'm gonna
workshop yesterday and I had troubles
getting it working for that workshop and
it just there's bleeding edge stuff so I
think you'll see that coming it over the
next year or so I'm at the minute
literally next week docker I think next
week or next week or two docker roll
like a launch Nautilus and that will
automatically scan your images I'm not
sure you have to pay for whatever maybe
it'll be for public images not private
images I'm not sure yeah because I could
imagine that even being part of the
darker CLI itself right just checking if
I default yeah I mean what you really
want it's like Jenkins whatever to check
it I'm not like appreciate there's no
bullet
okay is there a way to so you showed
some security flags right that you want
to use in general when you're doing
different kinds of operations is there a
way to enable these flags by default so
you don't really have to consider these
things when developing that's a good
question and the answer it's not really
at the minute but I think there's
something doc are looking at if this
idea of security profiles so you'll have
a profile that tells me a container or
your image rather I know it says which
permissions it needs so you know even
that read-only file system probably
needs a read-only file system etc so I
think the future's bright but know what
the minute you need to you just need to
know other different options okay Thank
You Adrian thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
