about myth but Miss busting project
management and management in general
when it come to software and I have a
personal view I guess I should put my
nail my colours to the mast I'm a bit of
an agile estoy love leading software I'd
love to think of myself as a systems
thinker I think many of the things that
we do around the building of software
even in the agile and lean world still
have a certain a certain aspect of cargo
cult is amor ceremony around them that
isn't particularly valuable so yes I
might be a little bit contentious I
guess that's where that's all going so
the things I thought I'd put our try and
cover today are some basic assumptions
that I think many of us either work to
all the organizations in which we work
apply and they're here i'm not going to
read through them all but they kind of
range from let's start off with a dead
simple one we can estimate in fact we
can estimate in a way that is good
enough to make good business decisions
will take a quick look at that through
to some of these other these are the
aspects too so we'll try and kind of
prove or disprove some of these myths or
four facts based on some of the data in
the evidence that's available and then
maybe at the end of this time we'll have
a quick note on contracts as well
because there's all very well to to look
at these as myths and say is it good is
it bad is it this right is it wrong but
there's a kind of so wat so if some of
this stuff is difficult and is actually
a myth what do we do about it and i'll
talk about contracts too if this time so
number one the premise is we can
estimate well enough to be able to make
good business decisions so what i'm
going to do is just run through a
particular study so you know lies damn
lies and statistics this is only one
study among civil but i really like it
so this is a this is a study was done i
think in norway simular institute and
basically there was four hundred
practitioners so there was a couple
undred students and a couple of hundred
of professionals that were asked to do
some estimation challenges we don't know
how much time the work would have
actually taken had the guys and girls
being able to actually do the work all
we
is how people responded when asked to
estimated piece of work that's for these
little mini studies they did the first
one was looking at the impact of
specification size so they split the 400
into two groups of two hundred and gave
one group a specification on one piece
of paper and six point font with no
margins and just said how long is that
going to take to do and the second team
or second set of people they gave and I
think it's put on 27 pages big font big
wide margins and the numbers came out
that the team that were given a more
weighty specification seemed to think
that it was going to take about fifty
percent again to do the work compared to
the team that was given a small piece of
paper kind of interesting really so okay
right small if you want your suppliers
to give you small estimates may be okay
and number two they then didn't have
another experiment where they gave a
whole load of completely irrelevant
information so here's a lovely network
diagram here was some user interface
style guidelines a load of other
applications that may be relevant so you
may never have to integrate with and
again did the same kind of how long is
it going to take how much is going to
cost estimate and they found in this
case that with this even more paper that
the estimate was actually the estimates
that came out were around about double
for the group that were given the
irrelevant stuff cool so the third
experiment this was try and work out how
good we are we're managing complexity as
humans and so they're glazed they split
the team here in two three so the first
team they said like hero his list of
four requirements just tell us how long
you think that's going to be and what
she's going to cost and then second team
they said well his five requirements not
for just how long is that going to cost
well that's going to take and what's
going to cost and then the third team
they said okay here are five
requirements big nor the fifth one just
to have to make the first four please
and incredibly what we've come up with
is that we're not very good at handling
complexity either so then the next one
so the last one I think is one of my
favorites this one so someone somewhere
have got a budget so there's a cause a
customer someone has a number in mind
when they're trying to kick off a piece
of software to be built or what we
purchased this time all three groups
were given the same instructions just
estimate this piece of work except group
2 was told the head of marketing she
doesn't know anything about software or
technology at all but she thinks it's
about 50 days worth of work and then the
third group head of marketing she
doesn't know anything about software but
she thinks it's about thousand days
worth of work to get all this stuff done
and the numbers came back and I think
this group the kind of a the control
group thought it was about 400 days the
group that was told that the anchor was
around about 50 they thought it was
about a hundred so bigger than the what
the boss thought but it's still quite
considerably less than the control group
did and then I think the other group
came out was kind of 600 something like
that 500 but again you know just a
massive massive range of estimates based
on somebody so we're working software I
think because we enjoy it and we want to
get better at it we spend many hours of
our lives trying to do this stuff but
somebody who is very honest about not
knowing anything about the business can
influence us massively presumably
because of some kind of Lowell or
seniority so as people then then we're
not very good at being able to sort the
wheat from the chaff in terms of the
size of the specification the size of
the work we're being asked to do we put
off by a relevant information don't get
us near complexity because I don't know
quite what goes on then and certainly
don't give us a clue about how long
things might take to do because we'll
come up with the answers that are just
wrong in most of the time so this is
only one study right so it might be
wrong but I think it illustrates some
interesting points and should at least
makers question whether we can duress
them its most of us in software we're
doing estimates all time is always
somebody wants a date and this starts to
make us question
is it really correct for us to think
that we have the ability to do what we
tend to do every day now clearly what we
have to do in the real world so we are
better doing relative estimates if I
have a bottle of water how you can't see
the label there but but how much water
is in there well it's about third we're
really good at being able to work out
relative sizes you know that's about
third full you don't have to measure how
big it is at the bottom and the top and
how tall it is we can just kind of do
that stuff and so that's our the basis
of much as a t-shirt estimation and
planning poker stuff that we do in in a
gr world but but then we also need to
get projects kicked off and so you know
maybe we might not be able to do
relative estimates we might not have a
library of assets that we can use to
compare the size of the work that were
about to do and so we quite often
hopefully this is a bit familiar and
this is was a piece of work done as part
of a Kokomo and proposed by Barry bloom
in the 80s Coco has a cost estimation
model in maintenance dates and it tries
to indicate how precise we can be based
on what we know so probably can't read
the writing but you know at the feet of
project feasibility stage or having
plans in the acquirement stage then our
estimates going to have a pretty wide
range on it so if this is X then we
offer kind of this is a log scale so X
for X if you've got the feasible
feasibility study down to a quarter X or
double X down to half X in these early
stages and so you know it's quite a nice
model in fact I like it a lot of you to
shed loads in my consulting career some
of these other blobs trying to show you
how bearing the team tried to calibrate
it trouble is when I started looking
when preparing for this presentation for
more evidence that says that this chart
is right I really couldn't find any I'm
going to keep on looking because I like
this so much and it really helps in the
consulting business to say why it is
that you can't give an accurate time and
cost right up front but unfortunately I
think there's not really enough data to
say that this is actually true to none
less we use relative estimates they try
and help us through this minefield a bit
we try not to give too much early
estimate precision using a model
something like this
even if it's a metaphor and then we have
to ask ourselves is that good enough so
let's imagine we're about to kick off a
project and our estimates coming in but
we know that it could be two three or
four times as big or divide by two three
or four on the low end is that good
enough to make a really good business
decision that we can trust the future of
our firm on it seems to me that it
probably isn't it's my contention that
essentially most estimation is ceremony
we can do pollito stuff we can get 10
people to estimate we can do all sorts
of statistics on this on these numbers
to try and convince ourselves that there
is more precision and more data in there
than we really seeing and therefore I'm
saying that this myth is busted which is
kind of kind of cool I think that's kind
of a contentious thing to say but how
does it actually help so if the business
that we're in we can't actually estimate
and do the work that we we think we can
what might we do instead well I think
these kind of five things other things
which I've come up with and I use as
routinely as I can in the way I deliver
stuff all the teams i work with the
liver stuff even a darlene well
fundamentally just works hopefully the
arguments been pretty well without
anyone you know keeping a tiny cycle
time releasing software as quickly as
you possibly can automating everything
that can only help in this kind of
environment and second point is honesty
now people don't want to hear some of
these truths most of the time it is much
more convenient to be able to have a
fixed price in a fixed time every single
time whether you're dealing externally
or internally with suppliers or with
internal folks however I think we really
should as an industry be a bit more
honest with our stakeholders about how
hard some of this stuff is and so being
able to have conversations about the
estimation funnel all the estimation
trumpet being able to talk about how
hard it is to come up with decent
estimates for early in a software
process is it dead important
um another thing which which really
helps me out is being able to talk about
try to achieve business objectives so
jess was talking in another stream about
delivering business value and what is
value you know the more that we can
focus on what is it the business
actually needs to be successful rather
than an arbitrary set of features ethics
stories or whatever all specs or
whatever it is that traditional project
management would track against and then
one that that we've been able to
implement quite well I think the our
Maps exchange is to be able to convince
our business to commit when stuff is
finished so we have a product team it
has a run rate and a cost that's already
committed and we used to run our
iteration and planning cycles so that we
try to forecast what was coming up in a
fortnight in a month in six weeks we
will list every two weeks and we tied
ourselves in knots frankly you know we
were quite good at delivery but you know
somethings made it some new things got
in when we don't weren't expecting them
to and we managed to convince our
business to be able to say don't commit
any dates to anybody ever and then we'll
just tell you when we finished so we set
some big business objectives we we have
a direction with a vision we work hard
we kind of track how well we're going in
terms of you know the usual kind of
velocity and speed stuff but actually in
terms of date to the outside world to
the sales guys nothing how did we get in
to do it um he's a big apple fat you
hasn't know people like so he's a big
apple fan and when Apple do their
quarterly briefings then they stand up
and say oh you can buy it next week you
don't know what's coming there's a whole
load of a whole lot of marketing and PR
that goes what about what might be
coming but by the time they announced it
you can have it pretty much okay it's
taken a few more weeks to get my iphone
5 than I would like but hate you know
that's the way it goes well as you
compare that to blackberry blackberry
stock price went down the toilet when
they failed to launch yet another tablet
device or something like that they plan
out to the market and so having map you
know the two companies massive
difference in terms of approaches
and frankly it wasn't much what well
it's quite visionary thing to for him to
have let us do that all it really meant
was that we didn't make any
announcements for a quarter so you know
we had a an empty quarter when we
weren't saying what we're going to get
and then suddenly the flow started again
there's lots of new things that people
go out and sell and added to our product
and at the same time add velocity we
think has gone up it's a bit subjective
but we think have a lot you've gone up
and we'd living more stuff because we're
not trying to tie ourselves in knots
doing patch releases or you know a
release a week out step or whatever it
is to try and get something in for a
particular large customer that we're
trying to bring on board so that's one
might that's my particular favorite at
the moment which is why I've put it up
here and the last point we will talk
about contacts again at the end if I
have time but you know I think the first
stage in accepting you the first time
didn't if you've got a problem is
accepting you've got a problem and I
think recognizing how hard it is to
estimate even if you assume you can have
to make a little bit is to be really
careful with contracts because contract
try and bacon very very early a whole
heap of things about sometimes process
sometimes they're not the dates and
certainly the money so point one I think
I'd like to bust the myth that we can
estimate actually enough to do to make
good business decisions okay now um
excuse me a second I'm going to move on
and talk about Adams size and
productivity so if you bear with me just
for a slide or so so so this is the
premise here is can software size be
measured and I don't expect there'll be
folks here that particularly disagree
that this is really difficult to do in
fact probably impossible so if you say
size is how much have you got by how
complex is it not bad definition how are
you going to measure either of those
things on the complexity side there's
some kind of cyclomatic complexity
measures which basically try and count
branching and suchlike and then how much
you're gonna measure lines of code
object bugs you may be some relative
stuff really hard and it becomes even
more difficult when you try and move
you the making changes to software which
most of us are very few pieces of
software built a completely green field
then trying to evaluate the effect of
changes on on software sizes is really
tough same same time we know that some
of the best code that we write is it's
tiny and small and readable and so less
is certainly more so software size
really tough to to measure when most
people end up just with resorting to how
much work has it taken how many people
times how much time is it taken do stuff
so I think hopefully you with me when I
say that software size is an impossible
thing to measure that has an implication
to which is the productivity which is a
measure of kind of output besides by
input 11 view of productivity is sized
by work can't measure size and we can't
measure productivity and so where does
that leave us I think it should leave us
very very suspicious against claims that
certain tools or certain processes can
impact our productivity in a positive or
negative way if we I think it's a bit
i'm stretching this a lot a little bit
but if if you take a look at the
outsourcing in sourcing kind of
reorganization announcements you
sometimes see that say they're saving a
certain amount of money i think really
saving that amount of money or are you
measuring different things you know so i
used to work for a big outsourcing abing
outsourcing firm and we used to
routinely walk into almost any
organization say we can save twenty
percent out of the gate if you give us
three year contract the maintenance or
forty percent if we can do most bit
offshore and it was great i I believed
rhetoric that it was all to do with CMM
and process for some time until I was
given the accounts and with running a
big engagement or a couple of big
engagement and I can see that actually
all that was happening was that
discretion we spend was being moved
and the question we spend with being
moved to so you do very low-cost support
and then you'd have very high cost
discretionary spend for project work and
enhancement and so this company was
seeing seeing an enormous great
improvement in their apparent spend when
you actually looked at how much money
was going out of the whole business it
was actually more than they were
spending before so I'm kind of pushing
the point a bit some kind of code size
22 cost-saving here but maybe you get
the point and then the one that's
particularly relevant particularly the
folks that are building software
properly using what agile and lean
techniques if you do measure your your
velocity whether you measure velocity by
story points or by cards or whatever you
choose whatever your access is to
measure velocity then I hear a lot of
people sort but oh yeah velocities
improved productivity has gone up we
must have been able to deliver some
what's been able to you know work harder
or smart or some some some reason that's
caused us to increase velocity over time
well maybe and or it could just be that
the work is a bit different so I've got
a team that delivers usually about so
we've got bigger we break into teams you
know if I get two or three cards per
iteration we count velocity in cards two
or three cards per iteration that's
pretty good I've got one team that
delivers six or seven cards per
iteration and that one team isn't our
usual kind of eighth person agile team
that can do what they want it's one
person on his own but he's an expert in
our UI and the business love making
little tweaks to our UI for particular
customers or to make it simpler and
easier and well they're just measuring
apples and pears you know you little UI
changes that don't go too far into the
back end are very different from massive
changes to the way we match trades in
our exchange and so velocity increasing
by an amount over time maybe maybe
people somehow working quicker and
faster and better or maybe the work just
a little bit different and so you need
to be very suspicious I think of metrics
in general and certainly claims of
improvements
what does that mean um I can't destroy
everything and then say well we haven't
got any basis on which to to work I'm
actually I'm actually a bit of a metrics
nut although that previous section
probably wouldn't have given you that
impression I think that measuring trying
to measure everything you can about
software and the build process and
software creation process it's a really
cool thing to do whether it's velocity
whether it's defect density you know
burn apps burn downs whatever your
favorite view of the data weird you know
defect defect in production and the
coverage in automated tests you know all
this stuff is really interesting
information but I think you can still do
the review debate an action cycle but
recognize that actually some of the data
and some of the latest flawed and in
fact much of the data it is bad proxy
for underlying value if you like so I
would certainly encourage people to
continue to grab metrics and really to
look at them and debate them and try to
take action based on them but at the
same time recognize that actually their
underlying value might be somewhat
flawed okay next one oh I like this one
so this one is looking at the premise
that paling is expensive and why I like
this one is it because it typifies the
discussion between more traditional
folks building software and people in
the agile and lean community and the
argument is reasonably straightforward
if you if you have a software build
project and you're going to be doing
some pairing it'll cost you twice as
much to build it because you'll have two
people sitting at one computer so it's a
very easy cost to calculate its there up
front it's obvious to the accountants
and the folks that kind of pay the wages
if you like and you compare that with
this kind of cycle time and cost to fix
chart so in Adalind lean world then we
try and release software quickly we try
to automate everything we try to get
immediate feedback in about about our
code we do continuous integration
continuous testing
continuous deployment the whole
continuous delivery lifecycle everything
we do is to try and get incredibly fast
feedback to be able to fix things when
they're cheap to fix and to stop things
heading out here outsource system
testing with massive teams of people
that push buttons for months you know
that that's a long cycle time let alone
getting letting defects leak into
production then having to fix them there
so the argument for why paling an
argument for why pairing can be cheaper
is that you avoid this top right side
here of expensive costs which tends to
happen at the end of projects it tends
never to be planned for where you yes
you you wouldn't plan trick should
probably get the sack and if you
planning for it that way and it's
certainly very hidden until it happens
and so it really does exemplify the kind
of agile versus a traditional debate I
think and if we're trying to be if we
want to be good with data and references
and all that kind of stuff then this is
this is excellent we have a meta studied
somewhat so meta study is a study of
studies so there's been a whole load of
folks have done research into how
effective paling is and rather than
having to read all 18 or 20 of the
studies you can just take a look at the
meta study and they they try to look for
bias and what they the bigger resultset
might be trying to tell us excellent and
the answer for this study is that para
pairing is faster it is better local a
low number of defects but it is also
more expensive I guess that sounds like
we are heading towards the two times
side of the argument over here there's
some there's an additional data that
says that complex tasks it works best
for we tend to use at the exchange we
tend to use pairing most foremost
activities when you're dealing with
people's money in a regulated
environment and you're doing stuff
that's a very latency and performance
sensitive most of the stuff that we do
and my personal experience is in that
environment pairing is faster than the
one we don't but this evidence seems to
say that generally
you wouldn't probably choose to do it
however I'm not going to give up that
easily because I then looked at some of
these other more detailed studies of the
18 studies in this meta study 14 of them
have been done in university so you can
imagine how can you get data about
paling how can you do experiments about
this stuff 14 of the 18 were not
professional or kind of software that
actually went live in kind of true sent
to the world there were kind of
exercises that was set in the classroom
and so that means that they don't really
capture many of these other things we're
pairing could potentially have biz have
business value so for example things
like if you want a paling system where
you're rotating every few days you don't
really have business continuity problems
because if someone wins the lottery or
gets hit by a bus and doesn't turn up at
work the next day there's plenty of
people who already know what they know
and you know the machine just continues
to to work with paling you don't you
don't tend to write so much down you
don't need big piles of documentation
because the soft the information is much
in a much more useful place which is the
heads of the people that actually have
to use that information so you don't
have to write so much down you avoid
waste two heads better than one in terms
of writing cleaner codes that's more
maintainable and you will you don't get
these late defects from any of these
studies then this software didn't go
live and so some of the impacts of these
really expensive late defects didn't
really count so um even though there's a
meta study that says that pairing is
better and faster put more expensive i
think i'm going to go when it depends on
this one so i think there's still hope
for pairing and I've seen it work
experientially so many times really well
but I think it still needs a bit of
thought so that's our third myth of
hearing it expensive now this one is not
really about busting a myth it's
probably more of a personal vant I would
have thought so
the premise here is the individual
incentives work most of us work in
organizations but I'm Finn the finance
section at the moment so most of us
working organizations where bonuses are
an important part of the way that you
work and those bonuses are issued on an
individual basis but at the same time
there's a whole lot of dissonance sweet
so we work as a team everything we do is
a team we rotate we do paling we rotate
that pairing certainly in the
organization lime in then we do we do
have an idea of collective code
ownership and eager list programming and
unfocus a work work really well as a
team everything we do is as a team and
some organization as organizations even
invest masses of company money in
psychometric testing Bell being and
myers briggs and sending people to make
boats and tie knots and all that kind of
stuff to build teams and then it comes
to the end of the year and somehow we
the review process happens and tries to
seek differences in people and how weak
they can be Ward rewarded slightly
differently in fact many of the many of
the banks and the consulting firms still
look for the top 5% of performers and
put them onto a fast track and look for
the bottom five percent and get rid of
them well when you're trying to do
software and everything you're trying to
do is all about the team and working
better the team then that really to me
doesn't make any sense whatsoever so I
would contend that that really isn't
about a myth but it's just a it's a bit
of a mistake a mistake unfortunately
that's baked into particularly large
organizations pretty pretty strongly
yeah I haven't really lost so what about
how to get around this one I mean I've
been in the lucky position in my last
two or three jobs I've been able to
dismantle many processes that are like
that and I've had I hate doing things by
Authority not you know usually you bring
people with you and convince and control
rather than having to use a title but in
some cases I have been forced to use the
organizational hierarchy to be able to
make to dismantle some of the things
that along oh yeah so there was a little
aside on this one as well I found
another lovely piece of research it was
very relevant because I said we're in
the trading business there was a broker
in the states that tried doing some
commitment commitment based incentives
so they were working in an agile fashion
they were releasing every two weeks they
had good data about defects and pace and
velocity all that kind of good stuff but
then suddenly that something new
happened they had to deliver it within a
fortnight and so they went to the team
and they said look we really need you
just to put in whatever lefort you need
to to get this stuff done and they did
the team works other they measured it
lay measured everything the team worked
twice as many hours and they got this
stuff delivered and the date was met
everyone believed a fantastic sigh of
relief I think they've got a bonus some
commitment based incentive and then they
looked at productivity and defect levels
over the next four four weeks or two
iterations and they made virtually no
progress so it essentially simply fixing
the bugs that they created by rushing to
get stuff done so so even these kind of
team based incentives that are trying to
go through a commitment to deliver that
extra bit of value in it in a usually an
unrealistic time can usually backfire as
well so a big argument for sustainable
pace I think they're too okay yeah so
this one's all about risk so excuse me
so last week week before last and I did
do a presentation that a trading
conference so trading architectures
europe i think it was in london and i
was talking about the way
max built built software the way that we
rotated the way that we didn't have
project managers that generally got in
the way of conversations between
business folks and technicians that we
released every two weeks that we
automated everything that could possibly
be automated and i just presented this
is quite a different way building
software in the finance space and you
know l max has some fairly some fairly
demanding requirements so it's a new
business and so we have to innovate
quickly otherwise the business won't
continue to exist so we have a
requirement to be able to deliver new
stuff the same time we're regulated by
the FSA and we deal with people's money
so we you know the whole thing about
it's got to be it's got to be fast
delivery and it's got to be perfect you
can't afford to make mistakes with
people's money otherwise they won't come
back to you and you'll lose your license
to trade and Adele max we have
requirements huge non-functional
requirements you know 10,000 trades a
second one hundred percent availability
for five and a half days a week every
trade needs to execute within a milli
milli second or two so you know with it
you blinked your eye and you've missed
two hundred chances to hit us la it's
that kind of nonsense so so releasing
every two weeks huger non-functional
requirements and so how we manage that
stuff and I gave this some of the ways
that we've done that at Almack's and we
still got our FSA regulation and it was
all kind of cool and the audience was
pretty polarized and one of the guys
asked a question one earth you do about
risk how does your risk officer how does
he live how does he hardly manage to
sleep with the with this kind of
environment going on and so I gave what
I thought with the reasonable answer but
I thought I have a second go and give a
better answer to this group so I think
it's here is that a Darlene is high risk
than more traditional approaches to
building software so the premise is that
quality gates reviews print to kind of
escalation process with you know roles
responsibilities and it reports having
keep the project managers that do staff
having lots of process to segregate
those people that build software from
those tested it from those that deploy
it
that that kind of ecosystem is a safer
one then what ad on a lean approach with
automated everything continuous delivery
all that kind of stuff and I think I
gave like three of these where I think
there were seven key areas where ad on
lean is is lower risk and I've expanded
that list out for this for this audience
so in each case what I've done is say
okay let's see what let's think about
what risks could possibly be affecting
each different way of working number one
you know the quality now virtually no
the quality in a few weeks when you've
had a few people click buttons on your
application and be able to work out
whether they think it works or not so
then immediacy thing which says actually
in the agile and lean world then we have
we have reduced risk we'll have an
increased risk separation of duties well
you know you can automate all of that
stuff you can let any a certain subset
of people be able to release software
will change the production environment
in a far more controlled in granular way
than simply having people with different
skills and different passwords being
able to do this stuff so actually
automated security the lean and agile
dev ops II kind of ways far lower risk
directly immediate business control
versus proxies people to get in the way
and try and owned the relationship
between business and technology well if
the business have been more and more
control they can make better decisions
so I had to be lower is to and you can
probably see where I'm going right so
live tracking and planning know exactly
where you are at any one time compared
to having a report that was written off
the event and then having that somehow
reviewed by some amorphous layers of
management to some later point in time
well you can see that life tracking and
planning is probably better having
knowledge in people's heads which is
where it needs to be if you need to
problem solve or troubleshoot that's
kind of a better place for the knowledge
rather than having information written
in on paper or on a file server
somewhere or having knowledge condensed
into single people's heads which is very
dangerous the improvement you do is
partly retrospectives is your standard
at all
lean process well you just do that as
you go rather than maybe learning at the
end and fundamentally you trust people
to get stuff done and I'd always trust
10 capable and intelligent people to
make better decisions than I would on my
own so even just in terms of weight of
numbers then I'd always go for
self-organization over some kind of
command and control project manager and
I think you know when you start thinking
those kind of terms it's dead easy to be
able to back back the whole argument
that that the business is taking more
risk so I'm saying that's busted however
it doesn't really help us because it
might not look like agile and lean
methods really work as well as they do
so i think the churchill that talked
about democracy not being perfect but
it's the best that we've got and i think
it's the same sort of argument applies
to add on the lean software development
the democracy that you get the
self-organization that you get with
agile and lean projects it appears
chaotic its peers noisy there's groups
of people chatting and trying to make
decisions and it looks it looks chaotic
to an outsider at the same time
everything we do is visible to the
business so I mean that visibility and
transparency is one of the things I
really love about putting the business
in control of agile and lean project but
every single mistake that we make and
we're people so we make lots of mistakes
every single mistake that you make is
completely visible to the business and
so it can feel awful and that there are
lots of things that are going wrong
there's nowhere to hide you know okay
they know to hide for techies but at the
same time I think Fred Brooks in
mythical man month through 30 n years
ago said that the most difficult problem
in software is choosing what to build
and that's a tree today as it was then
our poor business teams that we're
empowering and suddenly can make
decisions about what we start building
tomorrow is going to be released in a
fortnight well they got it should make
the right choices too and there's
nowhere for them to hide either so it's
very uncomfortable for our business
participants business owners in our
projects to to work to life planning and
working to be thus objectives
this is this is really tough so know if
we're trying to create a product that
allows us to trade on the internet then
that's very different from trying to
manage a microsoft project file with 200
lines in it where you can just tick and
cross whether they're done and it almost
becomes a mechanical certainly less
creative activity and so switching from
that managing tasks or managing story
cards and when I've got 50 these toy
cars I've got a system to being able to
work to deliver value and if you can
find a level in a simpler way of doing
stuff then take it then that is a really
tough mental switch for folks that have
been used to working in the previous way
and ultimately this whole transparency
thing makes it ever so important that we
we actually know why it is that we work
in the way that we do so I've been
interviewing a whole load of program
managers to come and join the firm in
the last few months and I got fed up of
folks saying when I asked well why do
you work that way why why cycle time
important you know why is automation
important I kept getting answers that
scrum tells me to and and that is just
an absolute cop-out and frankly the
agile and lean lean methods will fail if
we get too many people with those kind
of attitudes there's plenty of evidence
about why all this stuff works and we
need to think and communicate far better
I think as an industry about why and not
just what so so I think that's a busted
premise I think agile is far lower risk
however we really need to help our
business participant to be able to
understand the impact on them as well
okay so I think so I mean in terms of
the myths and miss busting I've I try to
have a go at the kind of four key key
points there I've got another couple of
slides which M about contracts are put
into the little the precis for this
session that I would talk about contract
it's not so much myth-busting it's more
the impact that some of the myths we've
just talked about have on contracting as
a whole and so I'll just spend a minute
or two talking about about contract so
um contracts are really just a proxy for
first you know some some countries some
cultures a handshake is all the kind of
contract you'll ever get all need and
Trust is absolutely paramount however we
tend to write things down on bits of
paper and when we do that then it tends
to have a few side effects traditional
traditional contracts tend to enforce
things about the software life cycle
they try and set decision too early in
terms of cost and time and really become
an inhibitor doing the right thing so so
my career I probably I probably
negotiated 50-100 contract something
like that and as a lovely story actually
one of the biggest one of the biggest
contracts I i negotiated was for a large
UK firm who had a very very
sophisticated purchasing department and
they handed me this document and it was
thick it must have been a hundred pages
thick of what they considered the best
practices when they were trying to
outsource and buy software services and
we were going through it and it had a
list of 16 deliverables and those
deliverables included test plans test
records handover plans Sam's cost system
specifications it was quite a quite a
functional kind of view of a set of
artifacts and so we could have gone and
argued about you know what was the
object-oriented version of those and
what are more useful versions of some of
those artifacts but part way through the
discussion I noticed that there was one
thing that was slightly missing and that
was that there was no mention of us
building software if I'd have defied
have taken that contract and I'd have
just decided to play the game I could
just give the pile of documents we could
have delivered it in word no system and
this inch thick document would have been
absolutely valueless there was
absolutely nothing in there about about
the thing we really try to do which was
deliver sit on the work and so in fact
in that in that situation where did that
would we go in the end I think we
ultimately we have two choices we can
either play the game or we can try and
make things a bit better fundamentally
they depend on how much trust you've got
between your internal stakeholders and
you or your outsourced supplier and you
if you've got a lot of trust you can try
this stuff if not then you're going to
have to do some of this stuff I'm afraid
but what we did in the end with that
with that particular contract rather
than going for quite so many
deliverables and all that kind of stuff
is that we took all of the company's
profit I was the outsourcer at that
point all the company profit and we put
all of it at risk so what that meant was
that if we messed up then at least our
mortgages will be paid as a firm if you
like and we could cover our costs but
any semblance of profit we basically put
on the line and say well we can we're
willing to to give that up if we haven't
done a good job and in fact we went
through a whole load of different models
for how we could do it the way we looked
at you know achievement of a certain
number of points a certain velocity
across the team and in the end we
thought that all the different
mechanisms we could think of could be
gamed to such an extent that we went
with this top one we left it completely
down to the discretion of the customer
and they decided whether they paid us
our profit based on whether they thought
we'd done a good job during the during
the course of the work and we got paid
it but you could argue that's because we
had a good relationship and good trust
to start off with but you know we have
to think pretty carefully about that how
how can we create useful contracts that
actually in sent the right kind of
behaviors so no in that situation pay if
the customers happy well that's kind of
easy you use every time you deliver
something where you communicate you
think what's the impact that's going to
have on my customers happen is is that
going to be make it better or worse and
actually that's far more useful than
trying to hit a little arbitrary line in
the velocity chart or burn up child
another another on another situation
I've seen this work quite well is that
every project acts as if it's going to
be canned every fortnight and so the
customer will the internal stakeholder
get a chance to basically say don't
really like the way this is going and
stop it and that keeps everybody at a
certain state of readiness and a certain
state that you've got to be able to
deliver something of value and that's
useful every fortnight and ensures that
the customer ultimately have control of
the spend that they're making and then
you get on to you know even more create
stuff where you know if you through
outsourcing a software project you
actually get the software supplier to
pay for the software to be built and
then lease it back or give them a set of
the value that that software is going to
actually deliver and I think really that
the industry as a whole has to think
along these lines far more what am I one
of my good chums used to be a competitor
runs a I used to run a little agile
software consulting and development team
and he ran a little one that's now big
one so we used to be competitors and he
will recently become a supplier his
lovely guy he understands agile as well
as anybody else it was one of these kind
of thought works spin-offs fantastic
firm but he's getting fed up with it to
such an extent that he's starting to do
this stuff simply to be able to win work
win work he's starting to be able to set
fixed prices and basically don't even
try and have the conversation about how
difficult it is to estimate up front
he's settings to fix prices which is
which is Miss setting expectation
completely with his with his customers
but simply so that he can compete in the
marketplace which is a shame really and
I try to encourage him not to but at the
end of the day he has to feed his family
and the families for the tens of people
that work in his organization other
things over here I mean a doll is better
than more traditional mechanisms you can
break stuff down into small lumps you
can get acceptance as you go that's all
great that all helps you when trying to
get contracts right but ultimately
you're not going to get as much success
if you do this stuff over here as you
will if you try and do some of the more
creative stuff over here so I think I
hope at least I've been able to at least
make you think about some of these
topics and whether we really can do the
things that we do do routinely in a
software lives yeah that's all really I
have to say so if there were any
questions then talk about me
okay so so as this gentleman was part of
the study that I presented at the
beginning where there was an experiment
to do a whole heap of estimation topics
and the comment was really that there's
a whole heap of different things that
can affect anchoring from contract to
what people say and yeah a lot of other
things that can affect the anchor rather
than simply organizational pleasure if
you like yeah
yeah it's really tough the art I've kind
of come to the conclusion that I prefer
not to play that game because there's
just too much there's too much of a
clash of cultures I've seen some people
try and put print two rappers around
agile to do development unless those can
work quite well in those kind of
environments but what I tend to find you
always get back to is the original
estimate has to come from somewhere and
if the original estimate is wrong which
it almost inevitably is then you'll come
you're broken no matter what no matter
what you do we got asked a few years ago
I was running a small firm we got asked
to compete and put a very heavy weight
proposal together and in the end I found
them up and said look this is going to
take me 20 days to do this 20 days work
for the team to put this proposal
together couldn't we couldn't be give
you those 20 days and then just start
the project tomorrow and they was like
no there's a competitive process there
were six other firms and all of that but
actually he did understand that what he
was asking for was quite unrealistic and
our requirement to respond so it took us
four days to respond not 20 and in the
end that conversation helped us to win
the work so you have to think really
creatively to be able to kind of get
around some of that stuff that there
were no there are no easy answers if if
they were real if they're real
purchasing rules that you have to stick
within but you know in that example I
gave about being paid based on customer
being happy that was still within the
rules of this one-inch document it said
that in the one-inch document so you
know you can find wiggle them sometimes
okay I probably should have said that
the cousin was Martin as well but there
was
yeah yeah all right and thank you all
very much Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
