some plans for what I was going to work
on during this between during the summer
said I decided not to take another job
and on the day I left Google I ran
across some interesting crypto related
technology that got me all excited and
not according to my plans I've spent the
whole time between then and now working
on privacy in cryptography and secrecy
and identity and so on and I've been
having so much fun and now you know
summer is over I'm starting to think
about getting another job so I'm trying
to find somebody who will pay me for
doing this stuff I'm going to talk to
you about so last week in Copenhagen was
the first time I ever talked about this
stuff I've been working on so you're
getting a slightly you're getting the
version after one rehearsal so probably
it'll be a little bit more polished and
this includes code that was checked in
last week so this is you know fresh news
here ok I'm going to be visiting a few
pages as the talk goes on I've got a
couple of links there and I'm giving
them a PDF of the talk as soon as it's
over and if you want to write this down
you can come and get it from me after
the talk or if you're right really fast
you can get it now so we are software
developers which means that by
definition we write code that stores and
manages other people's information and
I'd say that those people are relying on
us to you know take good care of it that
is more so than it used to be for a long
time it didn't occur to most people to
worry about you know people sneaking
sneaking around and looking at their
data that they didn't want but over the
last few years well we've had you know
endless sequence of privacy problems and
credit card hacks and social media
leakage and various bad things happening
to the extent that people have started
to become aware of this problem and then
of course we've had mr. Snowden and to
be honest you know there are a lot of
conversations we are having now that we
would not be having if mr. Snowden had
not been courageous and decided to go
one-on-one against the government of the
USA so my claim is that a whole lot of
or
ordinary people have realized that the
Internet is a dangerous place and their
information is hanging around in a bad
neighborhood used to be security was
something that nobody ever thought about
until you screwed up of course then you
got fired sort of like your basic
sysadmin work right when you do your job
perfectly nobody notices but the times
have changed I mean we've always had an
ethical imperative to take good care of
other people's information but I think
we're actually starting to have a
business imperative people are actually
seeing you know good security and
privacy practices as a business level
marketing win in this example of that
i'll give you the newest two weeks ago
that apple announced that they can no
longer open up other people's phones and
they trumpeted that to the skies and
there's been big positive and negative
reactions all over the industry and you
know whatever you think about Apple
Apple really knows a lot about marketing
so you know if Apple thinks this is a
good thing to be highlighting in their
marketing I think that we should
probably have some respect for that
opinion so it's now if we agree that
it's a business imperative to to protect
people's information against those who
would scoop it up and use it for
purposes we don't approve of well who
are those people well to start with of
course there are the crooks the
criminals the really bad people and I
love the you know the cheerful
illegality of this page they they have
an English version too but the right and
somehow it looks more evil in Russian
what they do is they sell accounts fake
accounts and you know they give you the
numbers that are for sale from all these
different operators and where the pixels
ever big and fat on that slide well the
numbers that are for sale and the price
per thousand and of course you can judge
the relative quality of security
organizations by looking at this and
seeing how many stolen accounts are for
sale and what the price is you know the
fewer the better the higher the better
respectively and I encourage you to do
that it's fun so but of course a lot of
the people who are trying to steal your
information and the information of your
customers are not necessarily bad people
they're just misguided shall we say
overeager you know they are mostly
honest people that are
they're protecting their citizens from
all those horrible terrorists that are
out there now probably a majority of the
people in this room and at this
conference live in places where the
government is reasonably civilized and
you don't really have to worry that they
will come to your place and the night
and knock the door down and take you
away to a camp but whereas that's
probably through at this conference it
is not true in the world at large a very
high proportion of people live in a
places where if you have you know the
wrong opinions keeping them private can
be a matter of life or death and by
definition since the internet is a
offered on a global scale some
proportion of the people who use your
software are living in places for
government is not the friend and you
know it's important to realize that it's
not really useful it's not it's a waste
of time to worry about why people are
trying to get at your users data whether
it's the crook crooks or whether it's
the government agents that's not really
your business and it's not your job to
understand them and any how you count
because they never say anything about
what they're doing and so your job is
just to protect the information so let's
just ignore firm why the people are
after the information and worry about
protecting it but actually maybe we
don't have to worry because maybe if
you're not doing anything wrong why do
you need privacy as Eric Schmidt
famously said in 2009 now you know to be
fair to Eric I bet you if you asked him
about that today he might fine-tune his
answer a little bit given some of the
issues that Google's been having so but
I find that when I'm actually talking
about privacy and security among
ordinary people who aren't geeks I get
this all the time why do you need super
easy for you have secrets and that's
just it's a really stupid
argument but sometimes in the middle of
the discussion it's hard to remember why
that's that's a bad argument so I'm
going to run through five reasons why
that's a really stupid thing to say so
first of all the number the people who
are working for the national security
agencies are just people which means
most of them are ordinary honorable
decent underpaid people who are working
hard and trying to you know protect you
on the other hand a small proportion of
any group of people are psycho
Pass or crooked or stupid or just mean
mean people I mean in the United States
security establishment we know don't
know for sure but there's estimated
there's maybe 100,000 people 200,000
people so even if only like five percent
of them are bad people it's a pretty
scary number you get and those people
with the power of the state behind them
have are in a position to like really
screw up your life so we need to respect
our public employees who are doing this
kind of stuff but we also need to
control them and make sure that if they
have silly ideas that they should scoop
up all the information we should not
facilitate that second problem is that
unfortunately it is true that law
enforcement people always it seems
develop a sort of a tribal culture of us
and them I'm sure some of you know
policemen and they're perfectly nice
people but you know they have this
attitude there's the tribe of us and
there's the tribe of the bad people out
there and this can easily get out of
control and especially you know the esta
against them mentality can get to the
situation where it they suddenly do
something like in Thailand and the
police force in the Army is suddenly the
government okay that's probably not
going to happen in Denmark or in Canada
but there I guarantee you have some
customers in places where that could
happen and for those people the things
that they could say today could become
fatal tomorrow if they do not have
privacy applied appropriately so we have
to you know just watch out for this
tribal tendency the other problem
another problem right around three is
that the government organizations want
to put back doors and our Reuters and in
our data centers and in our trunks and
in our Wi-Fi networks and so on and at
the end of the day there is no such
thing as a one way back door and the bad
guys the really bad guys know that the
government's are trying to put back
doors in and they're looking for those
gut back doors and they're finding them
so it's just really bad and
unprofessional to be doing that and they
are doing it and it's infuriating and
they should stop the other the fourth
big problem with the national security
establishment is the amount of money
going into it which is totally absurd
if you look at the you know actual
number of bad things and deaths that are
caused by terrorism and compare it to
things like texting while driving or
problems with early childhood education
and compare the amount of money being
spent on that and the amount spent on
this it's ludicrous it's a ludicrous
waste of money it's non cost effective
even if it were well intended which in
many cases it's not finally the most
important point this is really the most
important point about privacy that's a
picture of somebody's front door which
is closed we are fortunate people we
have the gift of being members of a
civilization which we and our ancestors
have built and being in a civilization
means you don't have to go and get water
from the creek you don't have to go and
 in a ditch you live in a house with
thick walls and a front door that you
can close and once the door is closed
you can do whatever you want behind it
privacy is not good because it enables
certain things privacy is good privacy
lets us sleep better at night it makes
us happier people it is a basic reward
of being a member of a civilization and
any organization that is trying to take
that basic benefit of civilization away
from you you should be proud to be
fighting back it's part of what we've
earned by building civilizations and we
should protect it well that's what I
think anyhow so so there there are some
some arguments to push back against when
you hear this crap about well if you're
not doing anything wrong why do you need
privacy fortunately i'm not entirely
alone in May of this year the internet
Engineering Task Force which is the
organization that builds the internet
builds all the Internet protocols
adopted this document and it's this
message is very clear and it's right
there in the abstract which says that
all these people trying to spy on the
internet from an engineering point of
view should be considered as attackers
we don't care why they're trying to do
it their attackers that's all they are
and they now have a principal in the
IETF that no new internet protocols can
be designed if they do not include
countermeasures for this kind of attack
now one of the interesting things about
that this is that even though the
Snowden story broke in June of 2013 this
was only adopted in May of 2014 it they
thought about this and argued about it
and
worked it over for 11 months and if you
read the document it's got a very
balanced consideration of the issues so
this was not a hasty rush statement this
is a careful statement by the people who
are building the internet of the future
and I think we should salute them and I
think we should help them and be on
their side so let's assume we all agree
that all right so let's assume that we
all agree we'd like to increase privacy
increase security and that kind of thing
so unfortunately a lot of software
developers don't want to go near this
stuff because it has two big problems
two things we really don't like to deal
with one is really hard math and the
second is politics okay so I have some
good news and some bad news the good
news is that you don't have to deal with
the really hard mask that's all in
libraries the libraries are pretty high
quality you can just use them and
they'll do the right thing the politics
unfortunately politics is part of
reality you can't go away and very many
software people don't politics it's a
key step I you know I don't want to do
that stuff well I'm sorry you know if
you walk away and decline to do politics
you have abandoned the right to complain
when the politics to your note in a way
you don't like once again as a
consequence of being in the civilization
we have the right to show that our
lawmakers when they're going to adopt
stupid privacy policies and tell them no
that's wrong and if we are not
sufficiently persuasive we can try and
get rid of them and get better lawmakers
so you know I encourage everybody to to
do that unpleasant though many of us
find it and actually you know politics
many people find it kind of fun once you
get into it so let's agree that we're
going to try and increase the privacy
level let's give us some let me start by
giving us some some terms to talk in
terms and here's how I think of privacy
of these days so basic privacy means
that you know I can use a my laptop in a
cafe or in my office and I don't have to
worry that somebody is you know have to
Wi-Fi and I don't have to worry too much
and somebody's hacked the router and I
don't have to worry that the site's I'm
talking to our using plain text so
anybody can can just buy on it now this
is the kind of thing you get with a
competent deployment and using HTTPS so
that's basically this is the kind of
thing that if we're not offering our
users we're failing in our professional
responsibilities
common privacy is what we sort of think
of that we have in civilized societies
which is that information that is known
to be ours cannot be shown to other
people without our consent well unless
there are certain judicial processes you
know if if the police become convinced
that i am smuggling bombs or child
pornography or plotting to kill my boss
or something like that then yeah they
will go get to judge the i'll get a
search warrant they'll come to my house
and searched my house they will open
they'll go to google and say here's a
search warrant show us the mail they'll
get the mail and I think most of us are
sort of okay with that in civilized
societies you know you have to have
judicial processes for investigating and
preventing crimes however there are two
problems one is as I pointed out a
substantial proportion of humanity do
not live in countries where they have
that kind of you know so you know
civilized process and the police just go
and look wherever they want without
asking permission and secondly as ed
Snowden proved the government
organizations have gone off the rails
and have adopted the position that we
have the right to have everybody's
information about everything just trust
us no I don't so maybe common privacy
which should be good enough in a
civilized society isn't good enough so
strong privacy is a higher level strong
privacy is where you know you can be
really sure that nobody ever sees your
information not your government not your
email provider not your ESP just you
where everything's encrypted all the
time and let's talk about how we might
get there to start with we have some
best practices that we can start to
include and I feel embarrassed almost in
2014 that I still have to come to
conferences and say use HTTPS you know I
used to ask for a show of hands how many
people are using HTTPS all the time and
how many aren't but I didn't believe
them I think people were lying you know
there was hands going up so if you're
not using HTTPS go back after you get
home to the conference go to your office
and make an appointment with your legal
people with the company lawyers and you
go to the company lawyers you say oh by
the way we're operating in a mode where
anybody can spy on what our users are
doing I just wanted to get legal
approval that it's okay for us to do
that you might get a surprise
there's a you know I'm horrified I go to
big university websites and I put HTTPS
in front of the URL and it breaks you
know the website breaks I go I go to my
kids schools and go into the computer
lab and they're running all these
educational applications in plain text
some bad guy could be sitting in his car
in the parking lot outside the school
running a Wi-Fi sniffer and he's going
to find out all sorts of things about
all the kids in that school I'm
beginning to think that there are going
to be some huge catastrophic legal cases
where ordinary app builders get in
trouble because they were falling down
on their basic responsibility to run an
encrypted mode but you know I hear
people saying well you know my stuff is
just public brochure where why would I
want to encrypt it or you know I people
should have choices why should I impose
encryption on people or caustic money to
write to get a certain you know turn
HTTPS on well I mean that's
just that that's just not an acceptable
argument in 2014 and failure modes are
asymmetric you know providing secrecy
when you didn't need it meanwhile I
spent a little extra money not providing
secrecy when they needed it maybe I just
I mean Wikipedia these days Wikipedia is
offered by default in HTTPS is that
insane no of course it's not insane
suppose you're you know a gay man in
Uganda who is worried about capture only
a sexually transmitted disease you know
if somebody catches you on Wikipedia
looking that up you could find yourself
with your life ruined wikipedia should
be offer off operating only in HTTPS and
it's really hard to make the decision
when is privacy appropriate it's
incredibly contextual you know somebody
in a cafe and order us you know looking
up information about sexually
transmitted diseases is not taking any
risks so you know whether or not privacy
approach is appropriate is a very
complex and difficult decision based on
where you are who you are what you're
doing when you're doing it who's around
you and it's easy to get the decision
wrong so just don't take the decision
why should you ask people to make these
complex high import life decisions when
the chances of getting it right aren't
so good just run everything in a private
mode encrypted all the time and you've
done away with
this problems why wouldn't you do that
and you know don't complain to me about
the cost of HTTPS you can get a single
domain cert for less than ten dollars a
year you can get a wildcard cert for
under a hundred dollars a year if you
have enough money to get a domain name
and spin up an ec2 instance you bloody
well have enough money to get a certain
start running HTTPS so so just start
doing that ok I'm sorry I get a little
upset about that because there's still
too many people not doing that there's
one push back against this that i hear
it's actually a little bit subtle and
dangerous and this one is actually from
people who are real actual real security
experts you actually understand HTTPS
and and how easy it is to get it wrong
and things like that and they're
familiar with the shortcomings now in
fact there's some truth in what they say
HTTPS is flawed in the sense that there
are a lot of different ways you can
screw up the deployment so even though
you have it you know there's easy trap
doors and people can get around it they
are also right that the certificate
authority business is totally screwed up
an awful and corrupt and disorganized
and just generally bad they're wrong
about the NSA the NSA has not actually
cracked HTTPS a sched Snowden had
Snowden you know made it very clear that
ya know they can't crack the crypto that
cracked the endpoint so you know we're
worried about the endpoints and then the
last point is actually pretty good what
he says that you know shouldn't promise
people absolute security because you're
not really offering absolute security
you know they're there there's no such
thing as absolute privacy somebody can
always get through if you want to really
be comprehensively educated about how
easy it is to break security there's
this great disguise from New Zealand and
it's like a huge slide presentation
about all the many many many different
ways you can screw up your security and
leave the gate open for bad guys to get
in and actually I encourage you to read
it because it's educational and it's
depressing but it's also kind of funny
but you know all the different ways you
can screw up your crypto another good
one is this guy from Microsoft who I
love his column he writes a call and
regularly I think he finally stopped
it's a pity and he points out that when
you're thinking about privacy you also
think about the the adversary and
use the israeli mossad as an example and
he says you know if the Mossad thinks
you're plotting to blow up Jerusalem
crypto isn't going to help you right
there that you know if everything else
they will sneak into your office and put
a camera where I can watch your keyboard
and your screen all the time and then
you know all the crypto in the world
isn't going to help you and so you come
back to the question well we can't
actually you know be provide real safe
safety so should we be claiming to be
safe at all and I think this is a
symptom of a the wrong way of thinking
about it at the end of the day privacy
is a matter of economics you know we
have a saying in in English don't let
the perfect be the enemy of the good and
it's really wrong to think of security
as a switch on and off security is it
dial and every time you turn the dial up
you every time you increase the
proportion of the traffic that is
encrypted every time you know you adopt
two-factor authentication every time you
reduce the attack surface you change the
security economics the only reason that
the NSA can scan everything is because
it's been being transmitted in plain
text and the cost of processing each
unit is essentially zero the only way
those guys at x axis and get all those
email addresses is because all the stuff
going back and forth in plain text
there's so much stuff on the internet
that if you can increase the cost of
processing one little bit of intercepted
to any nonzero amount nobody can afford
it nobody can afford any amount times
the amount of stuff on the internet so
every time you deploy privacy
technologies you increase the cost of
certain kinds of criminal activity and
certain kinds of government surveillance
activity and they become economic and
people stop doing them and we improve
the internet so what we should be doing
is you know for those of us who work in
system optimization trying to make
applications run faster you learn that
all you can ever do is move the
bottleneck around right you find what's
going slow you fix that and then
everything runs faster you find what
else is going slow it's the same way
with privacy you find out where and my
in my system is privacy leaking let's
fix that and then what else is my next
week spot so let's go and fix that
incrementally so let's do that let's
just systematically go about increasing
the privacy of the word
so if you're going to use HTTPS I have a
couple of good practices that are
starting to become apparent that you
should think about applying one is
everybody should stop using sha-1 this
is what actually comes by default with
many of the certs that you get and it's
not been broken but there are
mathematical attacks no one so that you
can crack this using an amount of
resources on amazon ec2 that would cost
about two to four million dollars so if
it costs to 24 million this year it's
going to be one to two million next year
and you know work it out now fortunately
this is not so hard you've moved to shot
to it's easy this particular blog piece
has instructions on how to do it
virtually all the infrastructure and
hosting providers and so on are set up
it just work so you just go ahead and do
it anyhow you have to do that you don't
have any choice because starting next
year Google to start going to put little
question marks beside the lock in your
HTTPS if you're in your browser if
you're still using sha-1 so you really
need to get on this one the other one
that I'm starting to hear a lot of noise
about it's a little subtler is the
notion of pinning certs and here's an
example source code that I wrote not too
long ago to retrieve some stuff from key
base and it's very classic HTTP stuff so
I open a connection to HTTP HTTPS
key-based I oh and I make a query and I
go and do some restful stuff against it
that's from an Android app I'm sure that
a very high proportion of the people in
the room have android apps I'm sure that
nearly nearly one hundred percent of
your Android apps have code just like
that inside them so the clue if you look
at that is that the actual host name is
wired directly into the source code and
that's annex thats a good example it's a
good reason to think wait a second
there's there's an obvious weakness
there so to actually execute that
statement what it's going to do is it's
going to go to the dns to find a key
based at i/o and then it's going to go
and get the cert and check it against a
bunch of basically all the cert
authorities in the world you know it see
what the suit says it'll go and ask that
serious already and will decide to
believe it or not and first of all the
dns isn't 100-percent bulletproof and
secondly the cert business is totally
not 100% bulletproof and there's a way
you can get around that which is to say
that the search that ki bhi o offers are
well known and they're based on a
private key that
ki bo has and rather than do it this way
you can actually say no no don't bother
checking the DNS don't bother checking
the suit I I know the public key that
they use so I'm just going to hardwire
my my application code directly to that
and here's a terrific blog entry by
Moxie Marlinspike who is one of the best
security researchers giving you exact
details for how to do that and in
particular in your mobile apps where
your people aren't typing in URLs the
URL is wired right into the app why
would you go through i haven't actually
researched this but my intuition is that
this might also improve performance
right because you're not doing the cert
chaining trick and that kind of sticky
you're just checking against a
particular hardwired public key hello at
all I haven't checked that now there's
you can go all the way and link directly
to the public key if the person who's
offering it maybe that's a little too
extreme for you the other thing you can
do is you can go and most most sites
will say okay our cert comes from this
particular certificate authority and you
can also set up your app so that you
only accept their certificate authority
or one or two others both of these
things are better than the current way
of doing it and check them out also if
you are offering a API is that is
addressed somewhat in the style you
should consider publishing your cert and
your public key so that people can do
this and pin their clients to your
server so so think about that it's a
good idea okay speaking of removing
classes of problems I'm going to say a
few words about to factor most people
who are in this room I hope are already
using two-factor for your google and
microsoft and steam and so on accounts
you you guys are like the doctors in the
Ebola hospital you need to be really
especially careful you don't get it
because if you get it you're actively
passing it on to two innocent people so
please everybody in the business start
using two-factor right now now if you
haven't used to factor the way it works
is sometimes when you login along with
your password it will send you an SMS
and say you know type in this code but
don't do that if you're actually using
two-factor it's a much better practice
to go
using google for example get the google
authenticator app and it just it's on
your mobile and gives you the number and
your type in the number and you get in
that way it doesn't depend on SMS
connectivity and it doesn't give money
to the evil telephone companies for you
know handling millions of smss and also
it turns out that the this thing its
interfaces are documented and if you
might want to consider offering
two-factor authentication for your own
app and you can actually do that using
google authenticator it's not trivial
but it's not rocket science rather it's
not so hard to figure it runs on iPhone
and iOS and Windows Phone right now
today so so so think about doing that
the other thing is is that Google
Authenticator is also a open source app
so you could make you you know if you
are you know a truck company or
something like that you can make your
own branded private branded
authenticator app and give it to people
who want to authenticate to you and it
would work just fine and you know you
may have noticed that no matter how
great your password is any bank in the
world will give you money for a piece of
plastic and four digits you know the
basic security model around two-factor
authentication is just better than for
any single factor so this is something
that that's really worth a good
attention oh sorry I'm there's the
actual google authenticator code right
so another model of two factor
authentication you might want to think
about is something like this which is a
Yubikey thing and it's an interesting
device it's got a USB and an NFC on it
so it will do it will actually create
key pairs it'll do what's the name of
that protocol T 0 th something like that
for for assisted login so it's another
effective two-factor saying this one
model action has a pin you type in you
can get another model it's it's
permanently in the USB slot and you just
tap it to say yeah I'm a real human and
I'm here and they both and also it can
be used with mobile devices you pull it
to the back of your mobile device and
you can do things like with LastPass you
can get in through your to the password
manager through it's actually a nice
model oops I'm getting behind in my
slides there's that product but there's
actually an organization called Fido
that is trying to develop a standard for
these things at the moment these are
little expensive
this thing is 50 bucks and that's quite
expensive but if you were using it for a
wide range of apps that might be you
know an acceptable cost and furthermore
as we get into industrial production I'm
sure the cost will will come down on
these things okay so there are some very
what's my time what time do I supposed
to stop 30 minutes you're kidding okay
in him well we're gonna have time to
talk I've been going too fast okay so i
should have said since this audience is
small you know we can make this
interactive and does anybody want to
tell me about to shift gears and talk
about something else does anybody want
to ask questions or object or disagree
with anything I've said so far no yeah
yeah practices around key rotation
especially like well I see the problem
yeah that's the thing is that you know
cert pinning that the real risk is if
you if you bind it to a private key the
risk is the private key gets compromised
and so heartbleed everybody thought that
was a very low risk and it's obviously a
non zero risk now if that happened then
that means you need to update all the
mobile apps which is I was talking about
my keynote can be a little bit painful
having said that you know you have to do
your own security are you more worried
about breakage in the cert in a CA
system or are you more worried about
having your private key compromised I
think you know people who are running
you know well done web facing things I
would probably be more worried about see
a breakage sin about you know having my
private key is stolen but you know
you're gonna have to do that analysis
for yourself that's why Moxie
Marlinspike said well if this scares you
which it does scare some people instead
of that just go and restrict the number
of search you'll accept you know say
that I know that key based on Io cert
comes from this one particular say and
I'm just not going to take their certain
let's come unless it comes from that CA
and that's a useful intermediate step
there was a handedly yeah so I don't
have a question but I want you to go
back to https for a second i felt like
you were not strong enough about your
encouragement and the reason for that is
not only about protecting the
information that is being sent it's also
been revealed that it's very very easy
to attack people using injection attacks
if you don't use HTTPS so https not it's
not only about the security of
communication but also about the
integrity of the communication and
that's one of the ways that the NSA and
other agencies are using for wide-scale
automated matter in valence and mass
attack when it's possible to get zero
dollar so so it's quite easily you know
what actually I don't believe that I id0
dollar certs first of all some of them
just don't work ok and also you know
it's like with buying songs for 99 cents
you know convenience beats free you know
if you go I I / i personally use a site
called SS LS calm and I don't have any
commercial affiliation with them but
their user interfaces is really nice and
it's really easy and they offer for less
than ten dollars a year and they say oh
you as well what's what server are you
running you know I'm running Apache x
dot y that gives you you know
screenshots do this then do this then do
this then do this you can't possibly get
it wrong you know so yeah okay maybe I
could save some ten bucks a year but I
think for most people did you know it's
probably cheaper in the long run to pay
for it yeah yeah well so I have good
news which is that a lot of people are
quite interested in HTTP to you know the
next version of HTTP that's coming along
and it's quite a bit faster lower
latency lower latency and higher
throughput and both chrome and firefox
have stated that if you want to use HTTP
to you have to use TLS they're not going
to support plaintext HTTP to now Safari
and ie are saying oh I don't know about
that some of our enterprise customers
you know want to man in the middle of
their employees so it's it's quite an
interesting discussion so at least i
think the break I I agree that it is
kind of unfortunate that the what you
described but at least i think the
browser's are moving in a better
direction okay so let's return to this
slide where I talked about the privacy
levels and the stuff I was just talking
about now about HTTPS and to factor and
sir pinning and that kind of stuff is
basically designed to give you common
privacy because don't forget your data
is still sitting unencrypted at
Microsoft Yahoo at Google Facebook you
know linkedin and you know the the
crooks might crack those guys and the
government might hacks those guys or
come in with a National Security Letter
and maybe we want more maybe we actually
want strong privacy what that means is
the data has to be encrypted when it's
going over the wire it has to be
encrypted when it's at the rest on the
server and it's only unencrypted when
you're actually interacting with it on
your screen on your device okay is that
possible absolutely is it tricky yeah
but it's actually not that hard and I'll
talk about it but it does carry some
costs think of it from the point of view
of Google if they ran gmail and to end
unencrypted so it was actually encrypted
at rest in the server first of all they
wouldn't know what the mail was about so
they couldn't show you the best ads for
you know what the meals is well I could
live us that but it also means they
would have a lot harder time fighting
spam you know cuz team a lot of spam is
actually pretty good and it depends on
being able to look at the message and
seeing if it's a guy from Nigeria
offering you 50 million dollars in gold
and if it's all encrypted then you know
they can't do that so there are real
cost to that so I think you know would
be safe to conclude that Google would
never consider doing a thing like that
except for they are so Google is pushing
this thing called end-to-end which is
going to be a chrome plugin that uses
very solid public key encryption
technology to actually do just exactly
what I was talking about so it's all
encrypted whenever it's in motion
whenever it's in rest the only time it's
not encrypted is when it's on your
screen now the fact that this B is being
done with JavaScript creates another
whole complex nest of issues that I
could easily spend another 45 minutes
talking about but but still this is a
very interesting and and positive
direction and clearly
you know this is the kind of thing that
Apple was talking about to you know if
Apple and Google are saying this you
know do you care about your customers
less it's an apple and google care about
their customers if you're doing anything
that really has a very high impact on
people's lives shouldn't you be
considering offering in this level of
privacy shouldn't you be considering
offering encryption at rest all the time
so suppose you want to do that what do
you have to do well the first thing you
need to do is learn about something
called openpgp which is the basis of
almost all the popular widely deployed
public key encryption described by RFC
4880 which actually is not bad you can
actually read it if you're a computer
programmer and make sensitive it
describes how openpgp works and it
assumes that you understand public key
private key encryption I assume that
seventy five percent of the people in
this room actually understand the public
key concept so I'm going to ask your
forgiveness while I explain the basics
to the other twenty five percent of the
people in the room because it's actually
not that complicated the notion of
public key private key encryption is
that you have two mathematical objects
just bits you know two chunks of bits
and they are linked together and they
are there to call the private key and a
public key and there are an infinite
number available and your computer can
make them your cell phone can make them
actually that little Yubikey I held up
can actually make them it's not not not
it's it's it's it can be done so anybody
can have a public key private key pair
and due to some really terrific
mathematical magic they have this strong
relationship where you know you from
knowing the public you can't find out
the private and they encrypt and decrypt
inversely you encrypt this one it
decrypts what's the other private to
public or public to private and the idea
is you know you share the public key
with the world and you keep the private
key very safely locked up and never
never shared with anybody and what that
means is you can do these things if I
encrypt if I find your public key and
who do I know here is the Adrian there
so if I encrypt something with adrian's
public key and send it to Adrian over
ordinary email facebook chat whatever
then I know that only he can read it
because only he has the private key okay
furthermore if I send something to
Adrian I can also encrypt it with
I private key and then Adrian can
decrypt it with my public key so can
anybody else who has my public key which
is everybody but they know that only I
could have sent it and you can do both
you can encrypt it first with my private
key then with his public key and then
only adrian can read it and only an i
could have sent it it's pure
mathematical magic it's one of our
finest intellectual achievement team
every time I look at it I'm just in awe
as to the cleverness of it I'm not going
to and by the way it that's what HTTPS
does HTTPS is based on this technology
I'm not going to take the time to do a
deep dive and how this actually works
but there's this great website you can
find it by typing the first few
milliseconds of an HTTPS connection and
he actually goes into detail but exactly
what happens in what messages go back
and forth and what the mass is and how
it all works and anybody who's even
slightly geeky I think we'll find this
really cool finding what really actually
truly happens when HTTPS gets going so
the whole notion is we have private keys
in public keys and we have encrypted
messages now i notice that computer
programmers are not that crazy about
abstractions so i would thought i'd show
you one there's what a public key looks
like there's a native binary format but
that's really awkward to transmit over
the internet so almost alloys do they
get transmitted around in this ascii
format and if you actually use one to
encrypt a message there's what the
message looks like and so you say whoa k
maybe i want to do this what software do
i need so it turns out there's actually
quite a bit of software out there and
and most of it is pretty good probably
sort of the software the basic software
that came first and everything else has
referenced to is identified right there
in that comment which is a new PG the
new privacy guardian and this is a very
big substantial comprehensive suite of
crypto software it's a great big glob of
c++ and it's been around for a long time
and it works it's very reliable very
widely trusted in the industry and on
Mac and
windows and linux flavored systems it
has a very decent command-line tool if
you like command lines it's you know gpg
and crypt gbg decrypt gpg lists things
like that of course civilians ordinary
people who aren't geeks will never use a
command line tool it also has a GUI in
both in all those cases which is ok you
know not bad but still really not not
suitable for civilians I wouldn't say
but you know that's not their fault it's
bloody Apple and Microsoft and the you
know debian and ubuntu and so on core
team should just be putting nice gooeys
on this and putting it right into the
system it's these guys have provided
good low-level libraries their job is
done but you know even if you're not
running at that low level if you're
building apps in rails for example there
is an open PGP up Jim you know a nice
simple calls like here's a message
here's a key encrypt it easy to
understand if you're in Python now I'm
not actually a connoisseur of the Python
ecosystem but I typed you know python
ooh PG and that was the first result
that came up I assume it's probably good
in the node ecosystem there's a good
implementation seems to be quite well
regarded if you're in go the Google
language there's a nice clean
implementation of openpgp so in most of
the ecosystems where you want to live
it's actually pretty straightforward to
do this the api's are there and they
work and then we come to java and in
java we have this thing called bouncy
castle which is a very huge very large
old suite of software which does
everything you could ever possibly want
to do with cryptography and its api is
written by Nazis from hell you know it's
it's it's the worst kind of Java factory
factory factory factory stuff that you
can possibly imagine and there would
never be such a thing as a simple call
here's a message here's the key please
and please decrypt it no they couldn't
do that you know first you how I'll have
to factory to make the factory then the
thing to call this thing to open the
stream and the other thing to observe
the stream and the and and in this
particular project i'm working on that
i'll show you there's like this chunk of
java code with 34 classes in 10,000
lines it provides a layer on top of
bouncy castle so that you actually have
an API you can use
so you know we've got probably got some
pretty good Java hackers in the crowd
here you know if somebody wanted to do a
real public service it would be to make
a sort of a standardized layer on top of
bouncy castles so that you know ordinary
mere mortal programmers could actually
use it the other bad news is that bouncy
castle is apparently near as I can tell
the best option in.net as well so anyhow
so let's assume you've bought into this
you're going to have your data encrypted
at rest you're going to offer strong
privacy to your users so what do you
have to do for this to work you have to
do all these steps now getting keys and
storing them is actually not so hard you
know there's there's reasonably good the
code is there it's been there for years
it's really easy it's like one system
call base 11 API call make a key and you
have to collect a few pieces of
information from the user but I've seen
lots of good user interfaces for this so
that's actually not hard and then moving
them around people people who are
privacy bigots who thought privacy was a
0 or 1 switch used to be totally
paranoid about private keys all you must
never send your private key over the
network and always must be on a quantum
crypto device with titanium Wells three
feet sick and so on well you know one
thing about private cages they're always
protected by a pass pass phrase and the
consequences of somebody's actually
having your private key r you know not
that terrible actually it's hard you
know it's pretty safe I personally move
my my my public private p key pairs
around by putting them in dropbox yeah I
suppose Dropbox could be hacked but you
know so what it doesn't seem like that
bigger risk profile to me of course then
you need good tools to encrypt and sign
the message and to decrypt them and
actually show you one of those in a
little bit it's not actually terrible at
all that's not a real huge graphical
user interface challenge which leaves
this one and weirdly enough this is sort
of been the big stumbling block the
single biggest stumbling block that has
prevented the widespread adoption of
strong crypto you know I want to send
something to Adrian how do i find
Adrian's public key I mean we had
Snowden first surfaced he sent an email
to the Glenn Greenwald saying you know
what's your public key and Glenn
Greenwald said what what's one of those
and so the original theory of the people
who built this software was that the way
we would learn to find public keys was a
thing called the web of trust
so you could actually get together
physically with somebody and they would
do a thing on their on their keypad that
would sign your public key and you know
if you knew me and I get together with
Adrian and Adrian shows me his key and i
believe it's adrian i sign his key and
then somebody who wants to Adrienne's
key can get this thing they see it's
signed by me they don't know Adrian but
they know me and they say okay well you
know it's signed so I'll trust it this
is called the web of trust in the ideas
we would have key signing parties and we
would all get get together and drink
beer and sign each other's keys I don't
know it you know it didn't work okay you
know the web of trust was a
superficially plausible idea maybe but
anyhow it didn't work it has signally
failed and key discovery by this process
doesn't work the beer-drinking were
pretty well right so what actually got
me is slipping down the slippery slope
of Krypton privacy is I ran across this
thing called Kiva's I owe the day I was
leaving google and I'm not sure the key
base io is as the site is the right
solution but there's high type of
technology that they are building is so
you can go to a place called key based
on 0 / Tim Bray and it tells you there's
a public key there you can retrieve and
it's got you know this hex fingerprint
and it doesn't say who it's for it says
it's named Tim Bray but it also says
there is proof that this public key is
it the private key corresponding to this
public key is controlled by the person
who is Tim Bray on Twitter and Tim Bray
on github and controls the domain name
keep reorg and I could also you know
make a reddit identity and a hacker news
identity and so on and so forth and you
don't have to trust key base for this to
work you can actually go receive the
tree the tweet run the decryption and
check and make sure that it really was
signed with the public key corresponding
to that private key so it's a
evidence-based public key directory you
don't have to trust to use plus it as an
extremely sane and well thought through
jason HTTP profi I and an open source
licensed command-line client built
written in node that you can download
and look at and I think it's a very
powerful idea and frankly the guys who
are building this to the guys who've
made a whole bunch of money on their
previous startups
they're just doing it because they think
the world needs something like this they
don't have any business model they think
there might be a business model in
signing software releases but they're
just doing it because I think it needs
to be done and I'm working I've been
helping them a little bit too because I
think it needs to be done so we're
getting pretty close to the position in
history where we can actually put strong
crypto in the hands of mere humans who
don't ever want to see a hex digit don't
ever want to know what up what a subkey
is never want to know what a signature
is and have it more or less just work
there's this one particular Android app
which I don't think is the be-all in the
end all but it's the one I've been
working on called open keychain and if I
could broadcast my android screen I'd
show it to you but let me just actually
I have a screencast here that shows how
it works now this might be a little loud
so whoever is watching the audio might
want to turn it down okay let's look at
some cryptography on Android will use
the open keychain app which keeps a
crypto keys and at the moment it's only
got one in it for this fake account I've
made the go to Denmark demo bunny and if
we're going to use that to send an
encrypted message to me Tim Bray we're
going to need to find my key so let's
add a key and search the cloud for Tim
right now you'll notice that sense it's
hooked up to my android contacts it's
pretty easy to find things you don't
have to do too much typing so it'll go
out in parallel and search q be a CEO
and the open PGP servers and it finds
three keys for Tim Bray ones for
somebody else down there at the bottom
one's been revoked and one is current
public key for me so let's import that
and that worked now that's part of my
keychain okay so let's send a message
let's switch over to google keep where
I've got a little message crypto love
from Denmark and I will encrypt that
using standard Android share mechanisms
sharing it to encrypt with open keychain
I don't want to know who to encrypt it
for and that will be me and who signs
it's will sign that with the go-to doma
bunny account and we're ready to go to
encrypt and share
now of course this is the problem to
share it properly we're going to have to
use a pass phrase which is horrible on
any mobile device and as a result I pick
something absurdly easy which is sort of
defeating the purpose okay so I typed in
the passphrase it extracts the key and
encrypts it and it says okay you've got
an encrypted message who do you want how
do you want to share or share with Gmail
it gets the two line correct so we'll
just type in a subject and send that
message off on its way okay now
fortunately there is a solution to that
password for the key phrase for the
passphrase for these private key problem
all right here we are in gmail and here
is the secret message the demo bunny
sent over to me now that there's an
irritating short coming in Gmail which
is you can't just click on a message and
say share that message so I've actually
selected the body of the message and
let's be fair there's also a bug in open
kitchen at the moment we're in this
particular set of circumstances I just
can't shared it to crypt but let's copy
the message let's switch over to open
keychain and let's say decrypt so we can
just needy crypt from the clipboard now
remember when we sent this message we
had to use private demo bunnies private
key to sign it and that meant typing
demo bunnies passphrase into the noble
which was tremendously painful and
similarly to decrypt it using my private
key we would have to use my passphrase
to do that and my passphrase since it's
a real private key is long complicated
cryptographically strong and would be in
send it difficult to type in so let's
not do that we've got to set up here so
let's say decryption clipboard and it
says hold your key against the back of
the device and there you go get work d
decrypted it it told you that it was
signed by demo bunny and there's a
message for dolo from Denmark okay so at
the end of the keynote I closed with it
with a picture of a for
and people seem to like that so let's go
back to the forest here here's a
different picture of a different forest
and it's beautiful i know i'm canadian I
like this stuff I spend as much time as
I can in the forest but you know forest
is kind of a dangerous place
particularly you know 50 degrees of
north latitude where we are and you know
you wouldn't go out there without being
prepared with appropriate clothing in
the footwear and things to eat and all
the appropriate preparation for being
out in the wilderness the Internet's a
dangerous place to you know why on earth
would you send your customers data out
on the internet for storage and
transmission without the appropriate
protection and preparation and
increasingly that means good practices
for basic TLS everywhere HTTPS and if
you're really taking these things
seriously and why wouldn't you take it
seriously encryption everywhere and
we're getting pretty close to the point
where that can be done smoothly usually
and start getting ready for it now
because I kind of suspect in a small
number of years this isn't going to be
an optional choice it's something you're
going to have to do to be taken
seriously so why don't you go and be
leaders instead of followers and start
working on it now so thank you that's
