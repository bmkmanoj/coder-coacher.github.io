welcome good morning the connected
worlds track so yeah my name is Lorna
Gordon and as you heard I'm coming more
from the creative side so my story today
is going to be about the Internet of
Things innovation and one of my favorite
topics disruption but very much from the
human perspective so I like to quote
eric schmidt from google that there's
something about humans that
technologists always forget that humans
are creative and unpredictable so the
Internet of Things it's been hyping now
for a couple years and I think most
people are familiar with the big numbers
that we're hearing about the amount of
things that are going to be connected to
the Internet 50 billion 75 billion lots
of discussion but what does that
actually mean now one thing it does mean
is enormous amounts of data predictions
again a tenfold increase in data we're
seeing 35 billion petabytes of data an
exponential increase but again I ask so
what does that actually mean one thing I
think it means in terms of the Internet
of Things is a world we talk about the
things we're actually seeing a lot of
value coming from this data that's being
gathered that's being stored that's
being analyzed it's giving us insights
are we talking about value creation I
like to simplify this in three different
types of value the first one in a way
this is the one that people find the
easiest to understand the easiest to
implement because it's looking at what
we currently do at the moment and it's
looking at what we're familiar with
making that better making it faster
making it less risky more flexible and
faster but really if we want sustainable
innovation I think everyone will agree
we need to also look at developing
completely new products and services so
we can actually incremental e increase
our revenue growth rather than just
cutting costs but one of the areas where
I think the Internet of Things is going
to really help
have some interesting innovation growth
isn't improving users experience so
generating insights it can actually help
people to be more empowered in the
systems that they're using more deeper
levels of personalization and of course
the real value creation is going to be
when you can combine all of these three
different types together and from my
perspective well we have the things and
we have the data I think it's
particularly important to also start
looking at the role of people within
these systems and also about the value
that we're creating for people with the
Internet of Things with data and with
control because i have a feeling when
we're innovating with internet of things
that we do need to start to think
differently and we need to actually
start thinking about creating
differently if we're going to be
creating an Internet of Things in a
future that people actually want people
actually feel comfortable in so to give
a little of an idea of what I'm talking
about I'd like to share with you a tool
that I use to try and get a picture of
what's happening in the world at the
moment more generally in the world of
the Internet of Things and connected
digitalization and I sometimes like to
say this is giving a little bit of a
glimpse inside the creative person's
mind because it's what we do all the
time we're looking what's going on in
the world and putting things together
and creating patterns and what we're
doing with this is actually getting a
sense a model of what's happening in a
particular domain now here I'm looking
at the Internet of Things now on the one
side we have this sensing ability the
ability to gather data gather
information but from the human
perspective what this is actually giving
us as people is insight insight into our
bodies into our environment our cities
and our planet on the other side of
course we also have the ability to
control automatically switching
controlling remotely or manually but
from a human perspective well this is
enabling us to do is to actually
influence
our environment and so by looking all of
these hundreds of different examples and
actually having to update this very
rapidly because things are moving
incredibly fast it's interesting to
start to see the impact at different
developments may be having in particular
how people's behavior might be changing
whether that's users stakeholders but
also companies and brands and start to
see where value new value is being
created but also very importantly where
potentially value might be being
destroyed one of most important
questions instead of what and how it's
particularly important to ask why so
what I'm going to result are going to
dive into a couple of areas on this
match its give it a little bit of a
sense of how I see the interaction
between technology and people in the way
that we develop these systems now one of
my favorite areas i said earlier
disruption what we're talking here about
really is about the introduction of new
products new services business models
things that are really challenging the
status quo and i really like this quote
from colin angle from iRobot was talking
about the vacuum cleaner and this image
that we had of this humanoid pushing the
robot which actually created potentially
an expectation that may have set back
the industry as everybody was trying to
create this perfect humanoid robot
rather than looking at actually what the
goal was were trying to achieve and I
like this as an example to raise the
question is what is you know our mindset
or our image or expectation of the world
that we're living in at the moment and
how might this be coloring how we're
developing our technological systems to
help build this world or improve on this
world so let's have a look at some of
the more famous disrupters at the moment
so we have Airbnb uber Alibaba and I
think many people are probably now
familiar with the story that's going
around about you know uber for example
founded in 2008 now considered one of
the largest taxi companies in the world
without actually owning a
taxis Facebook not owning any of its own
content Alibaba also not owning any of
its inventory and we can go on and of
course one of the things that's really
important with their business is the
data the information they're gathering
the insights they're generating and how
this is enabling in a way to battle for
the customer interface one of the things
I like to point out about these we call
hyperscale companies thinking of Google
and Amazon as well is there no longer
sticking with in one industry domain so
Google's course moving into the home
connecting up to the car amazon also
moving into the home we've got Alibaba
moving into the smart home in the city
Apple moving into the car so it's
interesting for the established
organizations who do remain in one
industry as to how can they actually
prevent themselves from being
potentially ubered out of existence one
of the ways is to actually rethink the
way that innovation is done rather than
doing everything internally to actually
start connecting and using things are
already being made available such as
api's and I like this is an example in
the connection with the Internet of
Things and I kind of simplistically look
at these as being the bridge between the
things on the one hand and the amazing
capabilities of the cloud and the
analytics could actually create the
value and insight from that information
but again it's something that's only
really possible now because of this
once-in-a-generation convergence of mega
trends with the Internet of Things with
cloud and with mobile and what we have
with these databases of thousands
available AP is is there turning these
rather limited little things into
powerful networks of possibilities now
cause got enormous amounts of data
that's also being gathered a lot of it
being made open a lot of it from the
sensors very much quantitative data but
of course took another source of data
that's coming from people social media
data and a couple of years ago
I was in London for a workshop looking
at sentiment mapping could this
information real-time insight into how
people were feeling in London be
actually used to developer an app where
people could plan their travel to be
much more positive avoiding areas where
people were getting frustrated they're
currently running a pilot and have no
idea at the moment how that's developing
but it's an interesting idea I was
particularly inspired also by this
development in the u.s. using Twitter as
a source of information for earthquake
warning one of the most notable things
about this is that there's a possibility
that the messages can actually reach
areas where there are no sensors so one
of the most important parts of this
system is actually the people the
critical mass of people creating the
messages and also having the mobile
devices at another example in a similar
way with the fire chat app in
Philippines and then looking at this as
being a potential resilient
communication network particularly in
times of a major national disaster with
traditional communication networks go
down this sort of mesh communication
network again requiring a critical mass
of people or they actually have these
Bluetooth devices to fill the gaps can
actually be a free communication network
to keep things running whilst the
traditional network goes down but again
a couple of examples where we're seeing
the value of people within the system
and not just the system for the people
but I think it's also then something
important to touch upon when we're
talking particularly about this data
that's being created by people or about
people the issue of privacy on the terms
of the data but also on the ethics of
the terms of the people using this data
and this research by trustee that was
carried out a couple years ago in the US
and the UK looking at how who people
trust with the data that's being
generated from their smart devices and
there's no surprises i think that at the
closest trust circle is going to be your
spouse or your your close family members
and on the far outside we have
advertising companies and we also have
the government but we see at the moment
I think there's a general consensus of
opinion could be changing but generally
speaking this data is an enormous gold
mine it's an asset but there is an
alternative point of view that rather
than being an asset it can actually be a
liability particularly if your business
model is advertising where every time
your users are having a transaction with
you they're giving away a little bit of
privacy what you're actually doing is
potentially breaking down the trust
relationship the trust relationship in
the end may be more sustainable
sustainably important than the
advertising business model is the
question and we do see that there is
actually a gradual not quite exponential
rise but definitely increasing in ad
blocking so it's becoming technically
possible now for people to have a say in
what's happening with the systems and
information being presented to them so
it's raising questions about that
business model and of course I think
here in Europe we're all aware do I
think that data privacy so 11 ban we're
all aware about privacy but I think
there's again a general feeling that
most people don't care if you look at
people the information people are
putting online putting on social media
and i would like to argue that rather
than not caring that it's maybe a case
of people not being fully aware so just
like to show this short video it is a
serious issue it's not like on the front
of my mind i think we are pretty secure
I honestly I don't feel too friend I'm
just like allow allow I agree to let
this app change my devices call log
including incoming and outgoing calls
data
so why would they want to change my call
law do you have any idea they allowed
this app to record audio at any time
without my confirmation that's pretty
terrible this may allow the atmosphere
or save my calendar data regardless of
confidentiality or sensitivity it's
offensive I give this a permission to
modify calendar events and send emails
without my knowledge I give the app
permission to read my text messages read
my text messages read my text messages I
love this app to modify my contacts the
morning by mike laan modify my contacts
that's scary I give this app permission
to read my personal profile information
Oh give the a permission use my precise
location it's not something I think
anybody else need snow I agree to look
at at the automatic card off airplane
mode turned off airplane mode that real
that's insane I give this app permission
to read all data about calls on my
device why would they do that Thatta
magic of surprise enough and these are
real is that true oh my oh thank you for
alerting me to off this beauty I feel
like I'm giving over my life to a nap
I should probably start to read these
things so I think it's good to think
twice about the assumption that many
people don't care about their privacy
but of course here in Europe we're going
to see some big changes now I think
everybody's familiar with the countdown
to GDP are and the big impact that's
potentially going to have data privacy
by design by default the right to be
forgotten breach notification within 72
hours enormous fines for not complying
with many of different regulations it's
going to be extremely interesting to see
the impact that this is going to have
but it's also interesting to see it from
the point of view of a global
perspective it's a very culturally Laden
aspect privacy and ethics so if we look
over at China there's a very different
viewpoint so I don't know if any of you
familiar with the the social credit
system that is being implemented at the
moment is due to be I think up running
in 2020 every citizen being tracked and
everything that they do similar to the
financial credit but it's more a social
credit are you actually fitting the mold
of the perfect citizen and it's been
very very much welcomed apparently and
then if we look the other side we see
the larger American organizations have a
feeling that this protection in Europe
is actually going to really hinder
innovation I think it's a very valuable
discussion to have what the impact is
going to be I would like to think that
it could actually inspire innovation so
for example we see this year Phillips
has launched their blockchain laboratory
where they're partnering with people who
are interested in developing blockchain
technology with medical healthcare
information so i see this is actually
inspiring a new type of innovation and I
for one have to say I'm actually rather
glad that I live in Europe so i'm going
to move away now from the
ever seen ethics and just zoom into a
couple of areas of more specific domains
of Internet of Things wearables how many
people has got a SmartWatch on quite a
few how many people have got an activity
tracker is there anybody here who's had
an activity tracker and kind of stopped
using it after a few months I more of
those okay so I think you'll probably
know where I'm going here so 2014 was
absolutely it was hailed as the year of
the wearable we saw a massive increase
in startups and companies pebble did
incredibly well with their Kickstarter I
actually got the pebble because I had
this kind of certain cynicism about what
is the real value and as a design i
think well let's just try it out and I
can see whether it's valuable or not it
works really well as a presentation
timer but of course as time went by they
started to see a pattern people were
losing interest after a few months and I
think it's important to then ask what
why because this is the quantification
was actually starting to get better we
have all these different apps we have
possibilities of sharing your activity
data the google glass i mean it was just
so cool but somehow it didn't manage to
maintain interest in a sustainable way
this might be one of the reasons why i
think it's a very interesting recent
study where well the quantification can
actually encourage people to do more
activity if you're actually quantifying
an activity a leisure activity you enjoy
you may actually take away the enjoyment
and it start to become a chore it feels
like work and in the end people may even
actually stop doing that activity so if
you're a leisure runner jogger walker I
think the advice here is don't track it
enjoy it and for me the message that
jumps out here is you know people are
much more than quantification of
movements and activities the things that
people value a lot of time are very
qualitative
so how can the Internet of Things play a
role in actually connecting up to that
aspect of people move to the smart home
and we see a similar ish pattern
emerging here who saw a presentation
last year by Scott Jensen who's leading
the physical web project at Google and
he has his kind of favorite smart home
scenario where you have your alarm clock
connects to your calendar and it knows
it can wake you up half an hour later
and as you get downstairs the coffee
machine is already bubbling with the
fresh coffee and as he says I hate this
scenario with the heat of a thousand
suns is this all we're going to be
bringing with this technology saving me
five minutes in my day ignoring the fact
that I may have a natural rhythm every
morning which wakes me up without an
alarm clock I like to talk about the
smart fridge is anybody here got a smart
fridge I've been asking this question
now probably about five or six years and
I've had so far one person put their
hand up but i'm not sure if they're
telling the truth because they ran away
afterward so i couldn't actually asked
them about it and this is the scenario
that i hate with the heat of a thousand
suns but it fascinates me that it's one
of the ones that's very often quoted by
journalists when they're trying to
explain to the general public what the
internet things is going to bring it to
us and it seems I'm not the only one who
looks at this with a certain amount of
cynicism I mean are you going to pay
five thousand dollars for a fridge that
has a full size screen on the door so
you don't have to open the door anymore
to see what's in it does a lot of other
things as well and maybe being a little
bit too cynical but yeah I think my
reservations are shared but again why
you know why is this not really grabbing
people's attention recent research in
the Netherlands for example discovered
that there are now about 300,000 people
that have a robot vacuum cleaner and I
think they barely reached about four
percent of people who ever had or were
interested in having a connected
appliance
why is this if we see a lot of the
visions of the smart home it comes back
I think to those value creation three
different value equations I talked about
earlier what we're doing at the moment
is we're looking at what we have
predominantly things that are connected
to the electricity and say well let's
connect that to the internet as well
we'll make it smart and then we'll work
out what to do with it instead of maybe
looking the other way round and saying
well what is the home what do we have
particularly looking in the context of
the home and I like this example the
samsung TV where after they launched it
they then had to warn people you might
not want to have personal conversations
in front of your TV because that might
be taken and shared with unknowns third
parties so don't put the TV in your
bedroom but that's not to say that
speech is not an interesting interaction
interface I think we're probably all now
very aware of the I think rather
surprising hit the Amazon echo
unfortunately not available yet in
Europe although you can actually
download the instructions to build it on
raspberry pi but the thing that struck
me here is that when you see the reviews
which are predominantly positive these
are also reviews of people that have had
it for about six months so unlike the
wearable wherever we go everyone got
excited and then sort of it drifted off
interest in Amazon echo seems to be
increasing over time so it I'm going to
be curious to see how that develops and
of course adding lots more different
apps they're moving into controlling the
car so it's a question about you know
why does one gather people's interest
and game people's interested in why
doesn't the other because people are
quite difficult to predict and also I
think in the home context it's not about
making things more efficient is not more
about functionality it's about the
relationships between people but again
you have to be very careful as to how
you then translate that into a
technological
solution and I love this kind of
provocative video from super flux
looking at what happens when this
gentleman's children decided they wanted
to help care from a distance Northwest

okay let's get our systems in healing
you think New York City from andy and
Julian David and rich a getting inside

the latch to lock copy uh Jeff just
working putting the doors back together
thanks many to close the gap and we're
gonna press on you've got a way to do it
do it trap and a ratchet waiting story
Musgrave improvised a solution it was a
success the astronauts were related
I think this is a great way of
highlighting the creativity of people
and actually you can get a great
pleasure out of you know sporting the
system so bear that in mind as to what
people might do with the systems are
presented with and how they might get
around things so I'm just going to
finish now by a sort of zooming out a
little bit on to the larger domain of
the cities and this is really an area a
domain with an economy of scale that
does make it particularly interesting
and we're seeing a lot of great
developments with resource management
with smart grids where it's really
making a difference with respect to
sustainability and the other particular
value for the city quality of life but
again I see a sort of repeating the
pattern and have to question as to what
is the image of the city that is
actually driving these visions that's
driving the technology developments is
it predominantly driven by people who
are responsible for maintaining the city
who are responsible for the efficiency
in the cost was it driven by technology
companies on what happens if people get
more actively involved in the vision of
the city and how the technology might
actually impact and improve their lives
a great example of this is the things
network how many people here are
familiar with the things Network couple
of people it's actually very started as
a local initiative here in Amsterdam a
couple of guys decided with a community
to build a laura1 network I'm just going
to show the video that they created when
they launched a Kickstarter campaign
with the idea to enable their mission
for this free to use crowd-sourced
Internet of Things City network to
actually go global imagine an Internet
of Things data network gets created by
the people and free and open for
everyone to use that's our mission at
the things network we are a group of
people that is building
Global crowd-sourced open free Internet
of Things data network new technologies
allow for things to connect to the
internet without bluetooth 3g or Wi-Fi
this technology is called laura1 it's
very very efficient so devices can last
up to three years is long range it has a
reach of around 10 kilometers and low
bandwidth ideal for the Internet of
Things the good thing is that this
network can be built at a fraction of
the cost of traditional normal data
networks the bandwidth used by Laura one
is open and a network equipment is low
costs in the old world building such a
network was up to large corporations we
build the network roundup funded by its
users so with a small group of people
it's possible to provide data
connectivity for entire city it's our
mission to support that global the city
of Amsterdam was covered in four weeks
and use cases were a bill on top of that
starting from the first day
and it's an inspiring mission so I was
actually inspired after I heard of the
launch of the Amsterdam things network
to set up a meet up in the city in the
south of netherlands in Eindhoven and
also within a space of four weeks with
members from the community we also got
this rather smaller city covered by this
laura1 network and is now spreading and
I believe there are a hundred different
locations around the world joining this
community and building this open IOT
network of course the question is well
what are we going to do with it and it's
it's quite exciting because it's very
early days so we've been going now for a
few months and the first meters have
really been about tackling the
technology challenges and we've got an
incredible mix of people and for me that
was one of the exciting parts in one of
the inspiring parts because what makes a
city interest in exciting other people
and I love this this way of describe
because describing it it's about the
collision density the opportunity to
actually meet with people who think
differently so with this meetup we're
bringing together creative people
designers hardware people software
people are very different range of
people also from the city administrators
and we're just starting to raise the
question what if we can do whatever we
want what might we do and have to say
that question is easier said than done
so we've got the technology is being
developed as we're actually starting to
think of what we're going to do with it
the kickstart is going to be delivered
in July so we're gonna get more gateways
we're gonna get no to the whole back end
is going to be red it's not even ready
for us really to use yet so what we're
doing is also running workshops using
design thinking tools to start from the
other side of the equation is we have
the technology but what would you like
to do with it as citizens as creatives
as people and inspired by the current
driving visions for the Smart City
quality of life now I have to apologize
to perhaps being a little cynical when I
question whether having a faster way of
parking your car is really improving
your quality of life what I'd like to do
and what we did with the works
is actually start from Toronto research
unit model on quality of life we were
talking about being belonging and
becoming as a person in the environment
and how much time you have to spend on
that and how much you're actually
enjoying and in valuing those aspects
and also sustainability stretch that one
to go beyond purely resource
sustainability resource management
looking also at the natural resources
but also looking at urban resources and
also human resources in a city is being
very important creativity health and
well-being so this is a starting point
and with groups of people that turned up
in a weekend in their free time started
brainstorming using experience scenarios
getting into the the shoes of the people
in the city walking around saying what
does it mean to be belong or to become
someone or something in this city and
also using maps of the city to start
drawing so what can we do might we do
with this technology as of amazing ideas
coming coming out of that there was
still in the early stages so the idea is
as a technologies developing also
looking at developing use cases this one
particularly caught my attention it was
actually a really large kind of system
of ideas that went across the whole city
core the serendipity city but the reason
I liked it was because we also had a
student sorry an artist in residence
visiting the city he was working on a
project in Columbia and a park she
actually got very excited about this
whole idea it was about bringing people
together about hiding information a
little bit of gaming a little bit of
history a little bit about integration
of different cultures lots of different
ideas that was spread around the city
but she could also see that they had
potential for different place of the
world in a different context and so
she's going to keep in contact will be
coming back later in the year and maybe
we can actually take the steps towards
building it but it's very early days
from sketch to building but hopefully
within the year we're going to actually
start getting something up and running
built by the people with the people's
ideas about what they want a different
way maybe you're thinking about what can
we do with the internet of things and
what can it mean for us building it
ourselves so I'd like to finish just
with one thought is that you know maybe
it is time to start rethinking the way
that we're developing these systems with
the Internet of Things and rather than
always trying to automate people out or
not saying that's a bad direction to go
in sometimes it does make sense but also
looking at how we can actually integrate
human qualities into the system human
qualities that maybe cannot be replaced
by technology critical thinking ethics
and Trust and also humor and fun and
serendipity thank you that was my
closing comment and I would love if
anybody have any questions to get into a
dialogue
I don't know thank you very much want to
thank you very much for this inspiring
talk about how we are transitioning from
a to a new connected world and there are
three questions for you from the public
one is that you showed us how ownership
for companies slowly transitioning from
ownership of things to ownership of data
and actually controlling the data and
the question is how do you think this
will transition in the near future
that's actually enormous question that I
could probably take a long time to try
and answer it's we're going through
different stages so the first stages we
indeed the business model from sort of
things to data or the combination but of
course now with the data privacy it's
it's raising the question of who
actually owns the data and how you
actually give access to that data and so
it's also looking at what is the value
in how'd you get the value out of the
data so there's maybe a little bit of
rush at the moment of gathering enormous
amounts of data but I think the next
step is really going to be seeing where
is the value how do we get out of that
so machine learning ways of actually
generating insights but of course also
working out who has those insights who
owns those insights who has the ability
to develop and control them so we're
heading into super interesting times and
it's going to be moving extremely fast
and do you think that the legislation is
going to adapt to that really quickly as
well well European legislation is is
certainly going to be having an impact
and I don't think anybody really knows
what that impact is going to be how
compliance is going to be monitored but
one of the things I'll maybe
optimistically like is the idea that
people will have more of a say in their
own data more insight themselves and
insight into the insights that are being
created from their data and rather than
that just being a control and
transparency thing I think that could
even be a trigger for innovation from
co-creation from people when they see
the possibilities they might actually
have ideas of how it could be more
useful to them thank you very much and
the next question is which more devices
well I see that you wasn't wearing a
smart watch yourself
how do you decide what smart devices
that you use on yourself and in your
home right well I actually I have to
confess my attic is kind of a graveyard
of Technology so I do tend to love
trying things out but I've noticed the
last few years that I almost got the
nest for example but once it was bought
by google I I don't at the moment buy
any product where I see that advertising
and data scraping is the business model
but then for example the Amazon echo I'm
kind of intrigued to try it out because
I see that people are enjoying the
experience and it's so from a creative
point of view I try things out which I
see succeeding or in the wearables front
I want to understand why things aren't
succeeding and I do also have the robot
vacuum cleaner and I love it lastly
being in front of a room of
technologists if you could have one
appeal for this public that I should
consider and building the next internet
thing solution what would it be for you
oh well actually that's an interesting
start to the question is this room only
technologists do we have any designers
in the room okay and how many people
would call themselves creative
technologists quite a few i think that's
that would what i would say is to look
at the role of being a technologist is
actually something that's incredibly
creative and actually seek out what yeah
we're saying the city that collision
diversity may be looking at different
ways of thinking social sciences design
creativity with creative technology is
going to come up I think with some very
interesting solutions one last question
that just came in are we at the point
where things are starting to own us more
than or ratify the versa where things
are starting to already the point where
things are starting to use our starting
the onus or that we are starting to own
them I think it depends which part of
the world you live in as I mentioned the
difference with a China Europe and
America but
I'm an eternal optimist and I like to
think that even though maybe the
technology is trying to get a tighter
grip we do have big risks I still
believe in the creativity of people to
find a way to make sure it doesn't get
too bad okay well Laura thank you again
everybody great applause for alone are
golden thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
