good day and that you're all doing a lot
of stuff with software but all about
security is that correct okay no all
right that's a basically no it's not
correct that's fine that's cool
Hey so let's start the day with a little
puzzle who is this guy
anybody know any physics people here
Google Image Search I don't know just
saying okay so this is a tour de Marana
he's probably one of the most brilliant
physicists that ever existed that it's
his whole life and everything he did is
a little bit of a mystery because he was
like the favorite child of Fermi he was
a disciple of Fermi and he mysteriously
disappeared around his 30th birthday no
one knows what happened to a toy to my
Adana and in fact he still had cast a
very long shadow on everything around
quantum mechanics and physics because
we're still looking for we're not really
still looking for it but we're still
looking at how the Maya on a particle is
going to affect topological quantum
computing so it's very exciting work
that he did a very long time ago that
has a huge impact on work that's being
done today but it's just a bonus
question it's like my icebreaker thing
and but what I want to talk to you about
is about privacy security and how
quantum is going to change the way that
we think about it and the reason that
kpn so I'm a CEO I'm a chief information
security officer of a telco here in the
Netherlands it's the incumbent provider
it's kind of like 18 T or BT or Swisscom
you know pick one of your flavored
savers and that's what we do for the
Netherlands and the reason that we're
interested in it is because we have long
term requirements very long term like
we're looking at you know 20 30 40 50
year requirements for privacy and
security
and my contention is that we have no
idea how to build that in you don't know
but neither do the hardware developers
neither do the rest of the industry
working in security who's actually
dealing with this problem on a daily
basis and so let's talk about the
problem for a moment why do we actually
need to worry about it and why would we
need to build in so we're going to talk
a bit about surveillance we're going to
look at you know how this impact is done
by quantum computing what everyone is
doing around it and what we are going to
do about it as a result of that so what
our strategy should be I'm not just
going to present you a problem going to
look at a way going forward so kind of
to start at all the threat is very
simple intelligence agencies have right
now at this moment complete information
awareness they know everything there is
to know about us you know where we are
they know who we talk to and they know
how we congregate with the individuals
that we do communicate with so really
despite this complete information
awareness they still worry and what
they're worried about is that the Eye of
Sauron like capability that they possess
to see everything all the time is
actually stopped by cryptography they
refer to it as the going dark problem
because there are areas that they cannot
penetrate with that all-seeing eye and
cryptography becomes a huge challenge
for them and you know even though we all
know the extent to which they're capable
of it was revealed through the Snowden
papers there's no massive outcry there's
no public demand for privacy and
security let me just ask you how many of
you changed your behavior after the
Snowden documents it's not enough hands
there's maybe like about 5% of you that
actually put your hand up now but the
clue is are we willing to change our
behavior and are we willing to pay for
solutions of other people that have the
effect of actually giving us tools to do
that for ourselves and my contention is
that we don't and and it's because of a
lack of public or form opinion but I
think the clue is and there's a great
John there's a comedian John I want to
say John hunt what John Oliver
thank you that John Oliver okay this guy
knows you need to go to him just Google
John Oliver video because when it comes
to informed public the only thing they
care about is when their dick pics
become revealed and are looked at by the
NSA or CIA with the exception of the
dick pics and this is not a colloquial
term with the exception of that they
really seem to think that everything
else is looked at by the intelligence
agencies must be warranted because
clearly we're trying to stop pedophiles
and terrorists etc and so what you
actually see is that we have a renewal
because of this lack of opinion and lack
of clue amongst the industry to change
the way that we look at the problem we
have a renewal of the original crypto
Wars how many people remember the
original crypto Wars it's an age test
none of you remember this is a bad thing
because this was a thing that happened
in the 90s we're going to talk about in
a minute but we basically thought we
want a war and it started all over again
and what we saw with the Snowden
documents is there's two specific
programs that fall under a category
called the black budget the black budget
means that the NSA has money allocated
to them which they do not have to reveal
they don't have to reveal to Congress
how they're going to spend it and these
two areas are called penetrating hard
targets where they actually look at how
they're going to break cryptography and
specifically start investing and
building a quantum computer and the
second one is called owning the net
where they're actually looking for okay
I've got a hard target I've got this
area where they have good security I
can't get in think of Stuxnet I can't
get in so now I need to find another way
a sort of side channel attack where I
will get in and you know because they're
exploiting the underlying networks and
the underlying systems the underlying
architecture they actually usually win
so if we take a look again about the
original crypto Wars it was basically a
question of what do we do with
cryptography do we ban it or do we just
cripple it a little do we just make it
so weak that it's actually not effective
when used and called for by the people
who need it the most so it's started by
this guy named Louis Freeh and Louis
Freeh has an
PressTV he wrote a book about it about
the stuff he did when he was a director
of the FBI and he brought down the Mafia
he investigated Bill Clinton some of you
may remember that famous blue dress with
a stain on it and this is a joke we are
let I'm making really horrible jokes but
it's okay
and he investigated Bill Clinton and he
fought the war on terror this is a
pretty impressive CV for anyone much
less the director of the FBI and you
guys all know who this is who's this
Comey all right very good have you had a
long day
have you been really tired we okay so
James Comey oh and this is Theresa May
who just wants to kind of temporarily
get rid of Human Rights because hey
that's so handy you know let's not do
that for now we'll figure it out later
and this is the EU the clue is that in
France as well they're very much
thinking about how do we weaken
cryptography in order to further the
capability of law enforcement and what
they're talking about is doing something
that they say it's not a backdoor I
don't want a backdoor
I want a court process judge mandated
front-door technically speaking there's
no difference if you remember what
happened with the FBI iPhone case there
is no difference they're just calling it
something else so it's easier for them
to use and get it allowable by the
public domain what they also want to do
is do something called golden key
management so imagine that you have one
of two scenarios one you have a supreme
golden key which always allows you to
unlock the crypto which means you
basically weaken the crypto and you
allow a sort of master key that's been
given to the law enforcement agencies
that's put in a sort of escrow and then
you mandate how that extra escrow
process works that's one way the other
way is called split key management where
you actually break up the cryptographic
key you entrust different bits of the
key to different people within a
government and then together they can
unlock the same crypto that we've used
when Apple or Google or Facebook or
whatsapp would do this for a single
country they would have to do it for all
the others as well
so you're basically opening the door to
have a hundred different 160 different
potentially split
golden key like solutions it would
require a flawless technical
implementation and a perfect process
execution how many of you would trust
your government with either one
alright the dude that raised their hand
we need to talk so so you get where I'm
going this requires a certain amount of
unicorns you know I believe in daisies
and unicorns pooping out of there but it
requires magical thinking and it's
something that's not very likely to
happen in any near future that I can
envision when it comes to this kind of
stuff but we're also not seeing you know
what the government's really like to do
which is an overhaul of intelligence
regulation if you saw what happened you
know in the UK when the stone papers
came out and people really upset and
lawmakers had to do something so they
put together this investigatory powers
tribunal to look for abuse of power and
this is unheard of but in the UK before
Tereza May they said you know what there
has been seven years of illegality going
on so actually all this time when you
were cooperating between the GCHQ and
the NSA it was illegal but it did not
prevent the draft communications build
or Ripa louis's which was actually the
baby of Theresa May from passing so it
actually passed so they said on the one
hand it's horrible it's terrible it's
illegal and then Theresa Mayes bill
passed it's just a little schizophrenic
what also happens is that we see a
massive movement for going from a place
where we used to come from from passive
interception so the traffic and the data
will be free we just monitor whatever it
is and we just look at whatever traffic
was actually passed to know al Qaeda was
not actually sending their mail so there
was no actual traffic or communications
that happened they left their
communications in the draft folder so by
monitoring the data connection we don't
see it so we need active interceptions
that means getting into the software
into the platform
changing the operating system that's
what we're talking about so actively
being on the server and requiring full
intercept capability there is a very
different ballgame it would mean that
you would have 200% require the complete
cooperation of the technology companies
that build these platforms in the first
place there's nothing passive about it
so imagine that you every once in a
while had a guy named Dave who was like
a sort of narc working for the law
enforcement agency that would just be
looking at everything your company ever
did but they mixed you and having coffee
everyone's want that's what we're
talking about there's old for the u.s.
Freedom Act which was you know a revival
of the Patriot Act and it passed it was
very weak but it basically tried to
reinstate some of the protection that's
being gone you know and since then it's
been trumped I don't know what else to
tell you and it's just it's a source of
continual embarrassment where I feel
like I have to apologize for being an
American so the in the Netherlands we
have something called the vet of the
indexing inside asides of instant which
is in a draft form which allows for
intelligence agencies to have greater
expansion of powers so previously
intelligence agencies you know all
foreign communications anything that's
over-the-air every country treated the
same which is that it's up for grabs but
national or domestic communication they
have to specify how they get it so you
have this idea of something that's you
know able to be tapped directly on the
cable and then not able to be tapped and
here what you see it's an expansion of
powers to get everything all the time so
this is a sort of international movement
that's not going to be stopped no matter
what you do SIGINT agencies or signal
intelligence agencies are always going
to want signal which is why you should
get some too so when you look at service
providers and you look at how telcos
handled a problem the way that we look
at is that we're pretty much put in a
plant in a pretzel which is a weird
shape there's this global phenomenon of
nationalism it started actually in China
where they said we're not going to use
any products unless they're Chinese
we're actually going to stop you know
the free flow of foreign
software and hardware but it also comes
down to how do we organize our network
communications so part of the problem
means that countries want to actually
pull themselves off of the rest of the
internet you might have seen this before
with what Egypt did but this idea of
creating national splinter nets in order
to prevent foreign signal intelligence
agencies from getting onto your national
networks this is a real problem for
service providers there's also this
notion of hacking back how many of you
know about in your country or geography
have hacking back legislation no because
here's when it comes interesting police
agencies as well as intelligence
agencies are slowly getting an expansion
creep of powers where they can hack both
domestically as well as abroad to
anywhere that they suspect of being a
cybercrime so imagine the impact to you
your company or your customers when for
whatever reason you've become involved
or extricated sometimes incorrectly in
one of these cases and there is going to
be hacking on your products services or
customer networks this is a real issue
that we actually worry about because it
means that we are going to have
fundamental problems guaranteeing
continuity of any of those services and
the way that I look at it it's a three
musketeers principle you know we're
doing all of this crazy work for one
target and it's you know usually comes
out to the form of creating a zero day
and this is one zero day for us all you
also want to cry I'm not going to tell
you about want to cry anymore but know
that this is actually what we worried
about which is this trickle-down effect
of vulnerabilities if you remember the
story I'll just refresh everyone's
memory the NSA in order to hack hard
targets needs to develop zero days
because sometimes those targets have
their security in order they've patched
everything they've isolated they've part
mentalize there is used encryption so
you can't just get in using the usual
channels because they've missed
something they haven't missed anything
so if they have their security in order
you've got to find a vulnerability that
is not previously known and exploited
and potentially already patched by the
vendor so they have to build zero days
in the creation of the zero days that
led to the shadow brokers attack the NSA
had outsourced the creation of their
zero days to the equation group the
equation group unfortunately did not
have their security on order got hacked
by the shadow brokers shadow brokers is
really smart and said we're going to put
it online in an online auction bidding
starts at ten million by the way I don't
know what business you're in but this is
a good business so you know bidding
starts at ten million and go ahead and
start go ahead and start paying but they
were clearly trolling us all because you
know regardless of who paid the ten
million they put the vulnerabilities out
on the street anyway and one of those
examples was when they released eternal
blue and double pulsar which was Windows
1710 and that resulted in want to cry is
everybody still with me do you guys know
this stuff already yeah
some of you okay good so this
trickle-down effect of vulnerabilities
means that it starts with the
intelligence agencies but eventually
wins itself in the hands of script
kitties and we're just going to see that
impact every time and it's just a
question of when we follow through with
the cisco juniper and other vendor
vulnerabilities that the NSA is also
looking to create 0 it is for okay so
now what's all this quantum stuff about
well I need you to know because I need
you to understand that it's new and it's
going to impact us all because it's
effective you know when we think about
quantum mechanics this is hard stuff has
everybody already had their coffee are
we good so you know classical physics is
everything that happened before 1900
pretty much you know big stuff I can
predict what's going to happen because
if I do something here this will be the
result we understand it it's intuitive
we we follow through when it comes to
quantum mechanics on quantum physics
it's a little bit different the birth of
quantum mechanics is really kind of
considered the 1928 Solvay conference
where Einstein and Bohr had a heated
conversation about what happened and the
effects of the microscopic world because
they didn't actually know
would happen because it's highly
probable istic if you do something here
there's a probability that something
might happen like this or something else
might happen and there's probability of
that too there's a very strong central
role of the observer and it's anything
except intuitive in fact Mel's for used
to say if quantum mechanics hasn't
provided Li shocked you then you haven't
understood it yet I find is really
irritating when people say stuff like
this but other than that the clue is for
us it's relevant because we want to know
when will there be a post quantum error
and that's an error when we have a
quantum computer so after a quantum
computer we're in the post quantum error
why is that important well quantum
computers have very interesting
properties in a regular computer we
talked about bits you know a 0 or a 1
and when we look at a stream of bits it
can be a 0 or 1 yeah we see long streams
of that when we talk about quantum
computing we talk about a qubit which is
a 0 and a 1 so in the same place where
you had a 0 or 1 you now have a 0 and a
1 this is already interesting because
you're like wow I have more stuff in the
same place good right but it becomes
really interesting when we look at this
property called entanglement
entanglement is when we take two qubits
and we put them in such a relationship
that affecting the one affects the other
regardless of the distance between them
entanglement is what gives a quantum
computer scale because in the place
where we had a 0 or a 1
we now have if we have two qubits that
are entangled a 0 no 1 and a 0 and a 1
if we have four qubits that are
entangled we have a 0 and 1 a 0 a 1 a 0
and 1 a 0 1 so you see where I'm going
here we're going from a place where you
had a linear expansion of capability to
a place where it's exponential it's not
quadratic its exponential so you're
doing that hockey-stick of coolness
technical turn so when we tried to
explain entanglement it becomes
difficult because Einstein didn't like
entanglement at all first of all this
idea this notion of connecting things
you know across vast distances
potentially across the universe that was
pretty groovy to him and he didn't buy
it in fact he called it spooky action at
a distance so he didn't believe that it
was even possible but we've proven in
about a year and a half ago at the TU
delft that it is possible there's an
article in Nature that you can read and
it's all about the loophole free bail
test why is that loophole free because
every single test of bells inequality
before that has loopholes in it to kind
of explain what was going on in the
experiment but this one was loophole
free which means in a distance of four
kilometers on campus of tu Delft we
could prove entanglement but if you take
those four kilometers and you make it
four million kilometers it would still
work theoretically if we could get to
four million kilometers apart if this
blowing your mind if it's not get more
coffee the other properties of a quantum
computer are fragility and no-cloning
and this is really really relevant to
all of the stuff we're talking about
about passive interception and active
interception because the understanding
fragility and non cloning will make you
understand what is so relevant when you
try to observe a particle you change it
if there is an introduction of any type
of observations there's such noise or
instability that you actually collapse
the quantum state because they're
finicky these qubits and these photons
they don't like that and it means that
it's impossible for you to copy or
eavesdrop in a quantum computer which we
can of course do with all regular
classical computers this is no longer
possible but you should know there's
more than one type of quantum computer
the type of computer that were
looking at now the ones that are the
most out there you might have heard of a
company from Canada called B waves
they're working on the annealer the
quantum annealer which is really like
not that difficult to do it's working
and there's a lot of physicists who also
say this is not a real quantum computer
but you know that be said it's an L
Muller what we're probably going to get
in the near to mid term is something
called an analog quantum computer which
is using both properties of what we
regularly have you know there's going to
probably be a supercomputer next to the
quantum computer doing all kinds of
error correction but the Holy Grail or
the Google Grand Challenge or whatever
you want to call it that's the universal
quantum computer and this is what
everyone is kind of doing a sort of race
to get to first this is a thing that's
going to present a real challenge for us
in security but also going to change the
world in so many ways it's going to be
quite phenomenal for the whole
scientific industry because what it all
means is this we all know about Moore's
Law you know we have a doubling of our
computing power roughly every 18 months
but there's also the introduction now of
Amdahl's law which is we can keep adding
processors but we won't keep seeing a
linear increase we're actually going to
see it slope off and downwards so
because of angles well we have an
inherent need to find different ways to
keep having this fun effect which we
really enjoy of Moore's so the way to
get there is going to be through quantum
computing and what's really funky is
that you know we've already thought
about what we're going to do if we had
one because there's already algorithms
that are existing already now Shor's
algorithm and Grover's algorithm that
have been built before we ever had a
quantum computer just waiting for it to
happen okay and now I need to explain a
little bit of crypto and I need a victim
from the audience who's going to
volunteer cumin okay I just saw you poke
this guy because he poked you it's your
fault yeah so it's really difficult can
you come up here
all right hello welcome all right really
really difficult question ready yeah
what's 7 times 8 oh come on dude
not really okay you have to go back down
right now because you're ruining my
experiment is there anyone that can
multiply all right
can you yeah in front of people it's I
know right
I dude I I feel yeah yeah all right okay
you can multiply nice to meet you my
name is jaya all right mija what is
let's think of a hard one and okay me
how let's talk about what's nine times
six fifty four okay Mia what are all the
factors of 54 oh my god okay wait no no
you help me no this is it - no okay
that's good it's very good thank you
Neha that was it that's we did really
great that was it
so thanks Neha but I should have called
on me how first thanks Nia but the
reason is this computer's behave just
like Nia our computers today can
multiply problems really well and really
quickly but when we ask those same
computers how to do it the other way
like okay look I asked you what is nine
times six
okay so we have number nine the number
six and we have a result out of that
which is how come on guys how many beers
did you have 54 thank you but then when
I asked you to reverse this I give you a
result 54 and now I say okay tell me all
the possible numbers that could have got
you there when we find it hard but so do
regular computers because the way that
we do cryptography now it's basically
called integers integer factorization we
find it a difficult problem to solve and
that's why cryptography is based on at
least a symmetric public key
cryptography is based on multiplying
very large prime numbers so you place
the seven with a really large
prime number and you place the what did
I say nine and six you replace that with
a very large prime number your result is
the resulting ciphertext and what you
want to now is go back you want to find
your way back to the plaintext okay and
a quantum computer this is what it's
good at it's going to try all the
possibilities because that's what it
brings with computing power and we've
got an algorithm thank you sure that can
already do integer factorization the
other problem that we want to solve is a
discrete log problem and it's the same
way as what we just did now with this
integer factorization problem except
what we're doing is we're raising a
number by an exponent and we're trying
to reverse what the exponent was if we
have the result okay here's the clue the
basis the underlying basis for all of
this is called a one-way function it's
easier to do one way than the other
quantum computers happen to be really
good at reversing these one-way
functions so that's something anything
they're really good at they're good at a
whole bunch of other stuff you're good
at protein folding which means that
we're going to find better ways to cure
cancer because right now we've got a 2%
rate of curing someone when they have
cancer with chemotherapy 2 percent
that's our success rate of curing people
with chemotherapy that sucks that's a
really bad business case but we do it
every day but a quantum computer can
help us have better drug treatments to
cure cancer we could do protein folding
and amino acid predictions we could do
all kinds of different scientific
modeling nitrogen-fixing I mean there's
lots of really cool other stuff we could
do so it would be terrible to not
develop a quantum computer because we're
afraid of the crypto losses and you
should know that everybody on the whole
planet is doing this Microsoft has their
own quantum computing facility Google's
got their bets on two different types of
quantum computers you know everyone
really everyone universities academic
institutions they're all IBM they're all
in on this so in the EU because we
realize that this is going to be a huge
game-changer for this
and it will really put us in a very
negative position for not participating
and trying to take the forefront there
is a billion euro project called the EU
flagship I'm actually in that flagship
in the high-level steering committee
that determined how to spend the money
I'm really good at that so that 1
billion is going to go to a subsection
of industry and academia and it's going
to be there to actually help the EU
maintain the position when it comes to
figuring out what to do with all this
quantum technology here's the deal
though even when we have a quantum
computer right now a lot of the efforts
are also trying to figure out how do we
talk to it
what's the software it needs it has a
completely different topology than a
regular computer so part of that money
goes to figuring out it's called cue
soft quantum software how to have
software it's a whole new field how to
have software that is actually correct
to be able to handle all these quantum
transactions to make it possible to do
that protein folding and it's really
exciting
just saying so are we there yet not by a
long shot
and because we don't have a viable
quantum computer with the amount of
qubits that you would need to actually
break the crypto because the bigger the
the cryptographic key that we're using
the more qubits you need to actually be
able to go against it we're talking
about a system that requires thousands
and thousands of qubits for it to be
viable against all these attacks that
were dreaming about so what are we going
to do about it well we've got three
simple steps if you use crypto now make
sure that your key legs is as big as
possible as big as allowable by the
protocol specification of the crypto
that you're using size matters so key
length is really really important here
the second option is basically to look
when you have a network topology for
places where you would actually need
something called quantum key
distribution remember I told you we're
going to look for eavesdropping well
we're going to look for that on our
network and very specific links the
third thing is to actually say all right
the quantum computer is going to break
our cryptographic algorithms as we have
them today so let's come up with a new
set of algorithms and that's called post
quantum cryptographic algorithms and
there's an entire effort around PQ
crypto so the key length thing is not
just my advice to you it's the NSA's
advice to all of their subcontractors
they've actually published this and the
sweepy recommendations for how to handle
cryptography as developers you probably
have to do this quite a bit you have to
integrate crypto consideration so
actually doing this and doing this well
will define how well equipped we are
when it comes to the initial startups
that have a quantum computer because in
order for them to be truly viable
they've got to get past this first
they've got to have enough size ability
and viability to get past this key
length issue the second thing is that
quantum key distribution ones to talk to
Bob but there's this really annoying Eve
so the quantum Channel that alice is
going to use to Bob is going to be a
fiber channel so she's got to have
dedicated fiber to talk to Bob because
she needs that because otherwise she
can't set up this quantum Channel how
many of you have dedicated fiber between
every you know you and every Bob you
want to talk to I'm a telco
so you get the idea this is not that
easy to do let's take a look at how it
really works though so when Alice want
to talk to Bob she's going to have a
photon source which is call so called a
single photon emitter it's going to get
literally a single photon out she's
going to tell Bob how she set up her
diagonal polarizers on our horizontal
and vertical polarisers Bob's going to
set it so that whatever alice is sending
Bob can receive yes and what they're
going to do is if what Alice sent has
been screwed over by Eve you know when
Bob looks at it and Bob's missing stuff
then you know that this link isn't clean
that you can't use it to share keys much
less have communications this is just
looking for Eve that's it so you can't
use it everywhere you can't use it all
over the internet because you don't have
these dedicated fibrous channels because
there's maximum distance of fiber is
also only 64 kilometres so even if you
did have your own fiber factory 64
kilometres is a bummer Sao Paulo delay
they say from the University of Genoa
figured out well why don't we just do it
over free space so he did a project
between two islands in the Canary
Islands which is also a good way to
spend your summer and he had a distance
of 144 kilometers where he had two
observatories and he could basically
shine a laser Sun with lasers he could
shine a laser between the two
observatories to get a link going at 144
kilometres
quantum channel between two islands not
bad all we need is an underground
volcano and we're in business so it's
actually really cool but it has massive
implications because think about it you
know these two islands are separated by
water there's water vapour there's all
this evaporation there should be tons of
signal loss and issues getting that
clear signal across but there wasn't
because the Chinese figured this out
better than all the rest of us and what
they did is unprecedented in the world
what they're building is amazing
so between Beijing and Shanghai
they're building a 2,000 kilometer
network
that is fully quantum secure no one can
read this communication across these
cities even with a quantum computer
they're secure what they've also done
though that's pretty cool they've
launched their own satellite it's the
world's first quantum communication
satellite and the thing about the
satellite is it can also communicate to
equipment on the back of a tank get more
interesting though
so this slide it's not my slide I didn't
make it this is actually from the EU
thing on quantum that we had last year
for the flagship launching and
everything and this is actually from the
guy who's building this quantum backbone
in China they say that they need it in
the event of a regional war they want to
have a fully secure communications
network what do you think this is a very
big international effort they are the
only ones that will be able to have not
just signals intelligence but
information assurance and the majority
of intelligence agencies they also have
that dual role right keep your secret
secret information assurance while
making sure you get everybody else's
secrets signals intelligence and the
Chinese actually have the balance
leaning towards the information
assurance way more than the Cygnet
although that's not bad either
they also have the biggest budget there
is for quantum technologies and they've
written it down in their five-year plan
but they are the companies or companies
the country that publishes the least
amount of research so the most money but
the least public information so the
third thing that we need to figure out
how to do other than quantum key
distribution across food space or
satellites or whatever is this new set
of algorithms PQ crypto and there's an
entire organization that's been set up
around it it's done by Tanya Elana and
Dan Bernstein we may know that it's like
very much true that for a very long time
we've actually had algorithms that can
already do this
lattice based cryptography already
provides a certain amount of hardness
against these type of attacks and the
example that we have in the wild for
ages is called Mecca lease and it's been
there it's been np-hard since 1978 the
British government tried to create their
own crypto their own post quantum
algorithm this is a bad idea so I just
want to urge you for any of you to think
ah there's a huge problem I know what
I'll do I'll make my own algorithm don't
do it because when the British
government did it they design their own
algorithm just google it okay CSG and
soliloquy it actually was majorly
hackable so there is no security and
security the only way to get a good
algorithm is to let it be peer-reviewed
nixed actually has a call for papers now
and a call for algorithms and they're
doing candidate selection now for post
quantum algorithms the one of the most
likely candidates looks like it's going
to be s ID age or super singular I saw
Junie diffie-hellman the problem is that
in the cryptographic community there's
not a lot of people that understand
isogen ease so it's probably the best
thing that we've got going for us and
there's even an algorithm called a new
hope but you should remember that even
though I thought that was really cool
and but you should remember that even
though all of this is happening in
you're like you know what I'll see it
when it happens and when it's there I'll
figure out how to use it I need to urge
you against that side of thinking I need
to ask you to actually think this
problem differently think about the fact
that everything you have ever sent or
ever used or someone has done on your
behalf or stored on your behalf or
encrypt it on your behalf including
local government agencies or the tax
authorities or any information that has
that long-term privacy and secrecy
requirement that that's up for grabs
right now and without doing something
about it it's already gone because in
the Utah data center of the NSA they
have been making outright copies of all
of the electronic transmissions that is
considered foreign communications and
they've been holding it because their
philosophy is to capture it now and
decrypt it
because old secrets are often just as
good as new secrets and there have a
certain amount of predictive capability
over what you're going to do with even
newer secrets so if it's all up for
grabs rethink this issue we needed to
have started a long time ago but we
shouldn't wait to start later we should
start now one of the things that we did
at Cape Anne we built one link one one
link between The Hague and Rotterdam
it's not nearly enough but we just got
started and that's really where I want
to go back to in conclusion this is just
the beginning it's far from the end you
know all these projects are happening
but IBM on there they have something
which i think is really cool and all of
you can go out and get accounts now they
have a publicly accessible quantum
computer I'm going to repeat that it's
public you can go now and get an account
on a quantum computer on a universal
quantum computer the problem is that
when I first started it only had five
cubits this was less than a year ago at
this moment it has 17 cubits in less
than a year it will probably be up to 50
cubits and at 50 cubits Google promised
us last year that they were going to do
a quantum supremacy experiment which is
50 cubits would already prove that
quantum computers were better than the
classical computers that we have now
including supercomputers that was a year
ago
I haven't heard any public announcements
yet but what we need when we go forward
with this is this common way forward we
need software to be able to talk to
these quantum computers and to actually
be able to use them for their maximum
effects and we also need to figure out
what the hell we're doing with this
entire surveillance debate because we
have the tendency to throw the baby out
with the bathwater my worst case
scenario is where we have export control
like we were thinking you know visan are
kind of the treated to prevent us from
exchanging information about pen testing
tools etc that we would have the same
kind of crazy behavior export control
over one I'm computing or
you know encryption again that we go
back to the crypto Wars so we really
need to think about how we do this but
not forget how we always did it we need
to have more than one option we need to
be opportunistic we just think through
defense in depth
so I encourage you I ask you it's a call
to action to just get started you know
figure out what your strategy is for
your company for your data for your
customers data start now thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
