you're watching this later than I don't
know which order it is Cedric's here all
these friends are wow thanks for coming
everyone alright so this talk actually
has two parts the first part is right
now this talk and the second one is
homework to go mod some routers and mini
routers and do some cool stuff so
that'll be an exercise left to the
reader these images also had two parts
what you're looking at is far far away
near Lake Superior this place called the
ice caves but the first step was getting
there and then surviving there which was
this and everyone that has seen this
image says that's the most green screen
looking image possible but i swear i was
there i can give you the originals and
yeah just believe me there's even other
ones yeah that tape was never supposed
to be there it was it was ruining
everything now we're perfect thank you
know this talk is great and so I've
given this before and usually here I say
lots and lots of things about me but all
you need to know is that's me it's not a
green screen and I love go to so let's
jump right into modding why modding how
many of you have ever modified devices
or hardware or cars nice if you're doing
something that is not what the
manufacturer of the vendor originally
intended it to you that's modding often
people think of it merely as something
confined to computer modding
overclocking as a common one very very
long ago and time far far away i took my
200 megahertz system and cranked up to
233 and boy that was awesome but now we
have a whole new degree of modding but
really it could apply to many many
devices and anything that is generally
different than the
the vendors original intent but I think
that there's something that's much more
interesting about modding than the act
of just adding features it's about being
curious and seeking depth trying to
tinker and figure out what really is
under the hood and sometimes magical
things happen so I'm going to go through
a few examples in my history they have
nothing to do with anything else and
then we'll go into some really cool
hardware of the network variety modding
and security and privacy so Xbox of
course being the first one we'll talk a
little bit about that more later I think
you can actually almost see the Seagate
I think 200 gig drives that I swapped
out for whatever was there originally
and this is xbox one which i know is
before the one that was before the one
that's discontinued and it's old but so
cool this was the one that started a lot
and a long time before that there was
this ancient thing called the ti-85 but
I don't think they actually changed
these things ever so it may there's a
different number but it's almost exactly
the same and they gave me this 2.5
millimeter cable with it so I could
connect to my friends and I don't know
what we're supposed to like transfer
something but I wanted to uh be able to
connect it to a computer so that I could
do a little bit more and maybe store a
little bit more and maybe there were
some exams or AP tests and like why
would I need to ever memorize these
physics equations I could drive them but
that just takes too much time so let's
just put them on the calculator and had
a nice menuing system look up what I
needed you know V equals V zero plus 1
have a tease I don't want to memorize
that so that was one of my fun hacks and
it was like I think I have even the
walking little is that okay the Zener
diode that was in between the couple
wires and you put it to one of those
things called a parallel port right was
it 25 pin I think men that was nuts when
we had fat peripherals it worked but
then there's an even easier one the
super old relic that started it all but
what could you do with this probably a
lot and here's a couple the first one
the one I did this talk originally
um I thought about how you know I really
just love karaoke man and I just wanted
to actually change some of the words and
get the background music but to actually
get music like the tract versions that
are created without vocals or without
other things probably cost like I don't
know infinity money from when I was in
high school or grade school for
royalties so if you take the headphone
and in that Jack that 3.5 millimeter and
you pull it out like slightly not all
the way some people are nodding like
they know this right you pull it out a
little bit and there's an impedance
mismatch and it turns out that it
cancels out the frequencies which are
mostly vocals and a few other things and
you just kind of get the background
noise sudden you'd like you know pump it
into those old-school digital deals and
record your own stuff and slow down and
speed it up and it was great so that's
my walkman mod so let's jump back to our
old xbox we talked about the upgraded
storage now you get to see a little zoom
in on the PCB hanging out there with a
few little dip switches allows you to
manipulate boot I think you could see a
little enable/disable you could go in
the in the old days we thought hey if
you break one you should at least have a
backup it's good to have you know these
things cost reasonable amount of money
so that gave you access to a whole
plethora of features and it started to
actually spawn an ecosystem how many of
us have some sort of streaming device
playing media of some kind from some
service like our home Netflix okay so we
have Roku Apple TV etc chromecast does
anyone actually use something which
everyone now calls Cody Cody anyone do
Cody Oh Cody oh you watching some NHL
cord cutters okay I hear you I XBMC xbox
media oh yeah now we have some takers
right XBMC xbox media center right a
long time ago this started it all okay
the fact that we were lazy
and we used to before streaming have
this crazy thing like a small disk that
you have to get out of your chair and
out of the couch and walk over and press
the button and in then wait for the
ejection that like took forever so slow
and then pull out a disk and put in
another desk why would you do that when
you could just rip it to the drives that
you enlarged you know you and bigand it
and it was fully it perfectly cromulent
at that point so it's amazing that
something that's simple like modding
this you know very specific game but
general purpose hardware machine to
something that could be more general
purpose spawns a media player ecosystem
that now we all take for granted and in
fact because it is open source it is the
backing engine behind some of the
smaller like actual smart TV panels so
let's jump into something more fun
anyone recognize this device anyone have
this device still last time I did this
talk I had it with me so it was good
like you could vividly see it because I
gave this to university students and I
was unclear I'm like maybe your old
uncle or grandfather had this in their
closet I wasn't sure on the the gap
arranged no but I think this is around
2000 1 2 3 right because this was the
first to have wireless g really
interesting things happen and so I was
already used to modifying things like my
computer from its default operating
system to Linux but this was something
completely different a networking device
things that are not too different from
the big iron many many thousands of
dollars think so in this case lifehacker
actually popularized and maybe there was
an article turn your $60 router into a
six-hundred-dollar router some of you
probably now triggers that memory when
lifehacker was like one of the most
popular and it was like the birth of yet
another ecosystem where you could
suddenly have features unavailable to
the masses
um it was just truly amazing and we'll
get back to this a little bit later but
first we have to worry a little bit back
to the ice caves uh so yeah this is a
real thing it was really dangerous
that's my buddy Kyle but not that buddy
Kyle because he's wearing an Illinois
sweatshirt so clearly it's not him
because otherwise move a lot of problems
with those big ten competitions and we
had ice cleats like these things that
you strapped on your boots with teeth
that yeah so it was kind of dangerous
but the Internet's really dangerous to
him so I'm gonna ask a few questions
since it's a privacy talk it's okay to
remain anonymous and not answer the
first one is gonna be a little different
than what I asked last time how many
have ever used Wi-Fi for any purpose in
any way Wi-Fi do you ever use Wi-Fi ok
this is the check for digital recluse
as's well we have we have some people
that are just total digitalwrite wow
that's cool good stay on your Island
you're probably safe if it's unplugged
it's probably going to be safe but then
how many are using internet like in a
coffee shop at the library did you use
the westin internet here okay it's okay
if you don't want to answer uh check the
tweets from boaz i believe and we'll get
a little bit more into this later but
this is something that just happened
today where someone may have leveraged
the ideas in this talk and just
basically captured all of your traffic
and he has images and cookies and
everything you were looking at no joke
he intercepted every single SSID and
there were something like 300 and of
course I won't name names you'll have to
find that for yourself you know this is
a privacy talk so we're we're thinking
about this like and wondering is it safe
and we know about many of the dangers
the last time I give this talk we did
some interaction just to see how much
the university you know kids were
familiar with in and they came up with
great things like someone said firesheep
that was a great example we learned so
much when uh even yahoo mail did not
have
https for everything almost everything
out there things that you you implicitly
believed this would be secure and your
login page was definitely secure and
it's green and things are tracked in you
you like printed out big you know thumb
you know hashes and things and you
compared it with your friends like yeah
everything's great but then once you get
past the login it was in the clear this
is not uh and luckily things like those
research tools helped spawn or actually
provide enough pressure upon these
vendors and services which did not
previously use HTTPS to finally enable
it however there's something else what
if you're on west and Wi-Fi and you've
got all your traffic intercepted with
this interesting device by this
interesting person that happened here
today and it's HTTPS and you think
you're fine what else could be wrong
this is we'll do some interaction you
can shout out stuff like everything is
fully encrypted and you're just talking
web browsing for a second HTTPS what
other concern may you have with using an
internet connection that is not one that
you control all devices subject has one
yes that is good so you'll still leak
your DNS which I like that one a lot
because will help hopefully fix that and
you maybe we'll have some certs where
you didn't print out like all the codes
and like check with all your friends and
then like call the authority on search
or something with the double key signing
party and like did this match and it was
self signed and then you actually only
you thought you were going to like by
the coolest thing on ebay like service
com and really it was a malicious site
yes that's absolute true but let's go to
the leaking DNS for a second I had a
favorite physics professor that always
it whenever he wanted to use an example
of something that was just completely
different from science he said
underwater basket weaving so he said all
the physics majors are great and they're
geniuses compared to the underwater
basket weaving majors so you know what
somehow I don't feel as bad I did
whatever it is it may be interesting and
if you're going to underwater basket
weaving org even if it's encrypted with
HTTPS they've captured that you're going
there the captured the bite counts the
bite counts at time durations at
intervals uh we're young all kinds of
interesting things may be where you are
in the world could that do anything
could that be of any concern could yeah
it's just the metadata of course metade
doesn't count it but but maybe I could
never potentially you know imagine the
library starbucks westin Wi-Fi nation
state to ever discriminate in any way
against underwater basket Weaver's
they're just saying like mine was blue
my water was salty the weaving was great
but I don't know how this information
could be used and you know what if just
the active hitting that DNS is used in
ways you didn't expect what if your
experience on the internet is altered
based on your region these are all
potential concerns there are so many of
them their vast so we can also talk
about more later but this is a
talk so it's got to like be fun enough
on a pace so let's jump into the safety
now see like it was so dangerous I don't
feel like you're safe to leave the room
like you can if it's emergency but ask
permission because now like I need to
I'm compelled to make sure that you have
some way to mitigate all of these risks
okay so lots of us here know about this
a VPN you probably use it for work but
of course it's Bob and Alice it always
is Bob and Alice I don't know why its
security but the interesting thing is
you can tunnel you can tunnel with TCP
you can't oh no both UDP one of them is
not such a great choice because when you
have mrs. and then it's like but the TCP
inside the TCP but you know at least
it's good that it's versatile because
different network providers and
different places you go can use you know
these allow allow different
possibilities and it's great that you
can access resources from either side
including potentially the internet as
well as shares as well as printers if
people use printers or things like that
and of course the eavesdropper sees just
gibberish but in a true VPN which we'll
get to should DNS go where you would
prefer it goes in the tunnel right maybe
it may not right depends on your text so
we'll get to some of the different texts
in us in a second here uh so we talked
about VPN in general why it's
interesting in terms of its
encapsulation and you can access a
number of resources it was great when we
did not yet have everything fully in the
cloud always with infinite bits and you
could get your stuff at home which is
one of my primary and first use cases
for things like this I just want to get
to resources at home see I'm one that is
quite baffled I'm not baffled by the
cloud the cloud is natural to me the
fact that I have this much power in here
is way more confusing to me because I
always thought that you would have to
access remote resources to get all this
power so I was always doing that and I
was always trying to use something like
a you know a tunneling to get access to
those
so we know about them and uh there's a
few there's a few reasons we should talk
about the different technologies at
least a high level but weak always get
in tomorrow so pptp kind of broken
really probably don't use it unless you
mostly don't care and you're just trying
to watch some cool sports or something
that you want to just get it through and
it just happens to be very highly
compatible because it's old and garbage
l2tp okay like not broken yet tax don't
get weaker you know they always get
stronger but openvpn open open VPN is
really interesting because it is so much
more open less encumbered it's just you
have to have this extra client but
there's clients for everything so let's
see if this works I'm going to do this
do you guys know that all you have to do
is Google IP and you get your IP that's
a cooling um so then I just had this
ready to go where am I uh it thinks that
I'm in Chicago but it also doesn't think
I'm actually at the westin so I'm going
to do something here let me see if I get
my cursor over there so let's go ahead
and i'm sure most of you have observed
this but it was much more impressive
when where should we go we should go to
ooh canada there's so many fun Canadians
here you know Dave just went to his talk
all right so of course it should be no
surprise to see what happens that
changed and where am I whoa yeah I'm in
Toronto Toronto has different rules
about things so it may be advantageous
and of course this is if you're
wondering this is just a nice little
plug into network manager here for linux
but you can do it in many many different
ways and these guys are all turns out to
be open VPN which is nice
let's make sure I go back to the right
one awesome so it's a great choice just
because it is so versatile and the live
demo actually worked but now let's talk
about something quite fun this box how
did this box start so much like what is
the magic of open source anyway well in
june 2003 there are some people on the
colonel linux kernel that is mailing
list that started sniffing around this
really cool new device that just came
out that was the first one that did G
with G was a great new technology
awesome and they found a few little
nuggets that looked like linux and Linux
do people know what GPL is a 10 do
people know what copyleft is ok so when
this discovery is made and linksys
pre-purchased by the other company cisco
right was selling this as a commercial
product straight up as just buy it it's
the latest and greatest it does wireless
g and that's it the manual just said
some things like turn it on hopefully it
works but I didn't see any code or
attribution or anything interesting in
there so the colonel devs said whoa whoa
whoa Stallman taught us something and
did you know inserted I'm insert into a
country where we like contracts a lot we
like to actually adhere to enforce them
at least for most people this copyleft
thing says you can't do that without
having the code open as well so it
wasn't too much after that in July when
suddenly whatever disputes occurred they
back down they gave the code out and now
suddenly you have specific drivers and
things you need for this chipset that
did like the basic garbage of nonsense
in dhcp and get a network going and wpa
whatever the one that probably broker oh
my got all those scary things that are
long gone but then you could upgrade it
when the explosion of the community gets
access to it and adds wpa two different
tunnelling possibilities embedded sshd
everything fun happened and what's
really interesting about this besides
the fact that you're taking this dinky
inexpensive device and adding features
that are only available to big iron
corporate customers for thousands and
thousands of dollars is that you can
suddenly explode an ecosystem that we're
used to now because we have things like
new gadgets and app stores and then the
watches that make a whole new app store
and then a new language and then you
have to rewrite everything and then like
the new platform comes out everyone has
to make like the fart app again I mean
whatever but this was one of the first
ones it was great and suddenly
everything was available so let's talk
about the Varens many of you probably
have heard of just the wrt name or
dd-wrt or tomato or others but open wrt
is the focus of this talk and is quite
interesting because it's just so open
has a very good package manager very
Linux like very very small so one aspect
in constraining aspect of these devices
is you're not in the scale of gigabytes
but rather very very few megabytes in
terms of storage and memory and
processing capability so you do actually
want to be lean it's not just like us
crazy financial people saying it's got
to be low latency gotta be fast it's
like yet you only have 16 Meg sorry
there's only so much you could do or
even the 1i have who have to get that
out to where you may only have four or
even fewer megabytes not gigabytes
megabytes of memory and of course the
access is great with web command line
and we learned a lot from it so let's
let's let's look at one of these what
did I do with it it was supposed to be
right here it is the reason when we did
this talk as a workshop that we selected
this guy was mainly because it's a for
real product that can be purchased in a
shrink-wrap version
you know in the United States has a
device that does the things that are on
this slide uh and it's kind of cool
because then you're really altering it
from the original vendors intent and it
has a battery so uh you can just flip it
on right no wires required and this one
even if you don't mod it at all you
could still do interesting things you
can still get the NAT hardware aspect of
it which is a little fire wallisch right
away because we know over time there
were variants of windows XP before
service pack 2 and crazy things where
there was no such firewall and
everything was open and wow it was a
scary world so some of the use cases
that you would not anticipate easy ones
are you just want to access a network
maybe it's the westin maybe its
in-flight Wi-Fi and then broadcast your
own Wi-Fi network or maybe hardwire it
if you're cool like that and then you
don't have to follow their restrictions
what if you're of course they finally
changed it with the accounts but what if
the in-flight Wi-Fi is pay once per MAC
address this is one mac address that's
quite nice but then my former boss told
me another good use case I didn't
anticipate and that's what's great about
the tinkering in the modding you just
keep building on these he said when you
bring your little is it if it's a roku
stick or whatever media streamer you you
have to the hotel and you plug it into
the HDMI everything's great until you
want to you know get the Wi-Fi
connection everything and if it's a
chromecast we know they have to control
with your phone on so why not just do it
all on this personal network and then
have that other radio access the network
with the internet connection and that's
quite nice there was another good one I
wanted
that's okay we'll go back to it so let's
look at how it all comes together
essentially you combine the previous
lesson about VPN and a device it need
not be this travel router that was just
one use case it could be the larger wrt
home version and suddenly you're nice
and secure even your DNS all through
there so we got the plane we got the
hotel we got the chromecast there's
other stuff well we'll think of add-ons
in a bit so first let's talk about the
paradox of choice i only gave you two
examples to start this tp-link version
and the linksys others may find really
interesting ways to build this out of
say a raspberry pi there's another one
GL inet that is more suited exactly for
this purpose and has I it basically just
has a little bit more storage and his
beefier so I did not yet accomplished
the task of the raspberry pi version
because when we were we actually bought
routers for the workshop version before
and cost was a constraint so think about
this when you go to part two and build
it for yourself and do a little research
to see what's the most effective because
they all have a few different features
wait i just remembered it it's great the
other really cool thing little-known
fact very few hotels have physical
ethernet ports anymore but some do and
it's often the case that when you use
the ethernet port which a lot of these
devices have at the hotel they do they
do not apply the restrictions that the
two on Wi-Fi so while the Wi-Fi is like
10 M bit per the ethernet ports like
full stream just like the firehose
internet you're like oh my gosh this is
awesome I got fiber and no one else does
and then you're suddenly killing all
their Street it's great like I'll just
upload these you know like volumes of
videos that i had just sitting here so
try that I mean there's so many
interesting
ways you could tinker all right but I'd
feel bad if I didn't give you a little
more detail about the hack that you
didn't realize occurred until you looked
at this Twitter stream when I did it
this talk the last time I wanted to keep
it clean i wanted to keep the youth you
know curious but not necessarily let
them find the danger on their own not
necessarily introduce it to them but for
this one i just have to give you the
image of it this is a product the Wi-Fi
pineapple from the you know the group
that basically makes only more black hat
and less research you type things to do
with it with two radios and it turns out
that John oops I said his name added a
third because there's a USB slot on the
other side and you could have one
listening or connected even 21 Wi-Fi one
scanning for other wifis to start
pulling and one broadcasting for a new
one and you could have anything you want
in there this one there's a microSD slot
it can capture as much space as what 200
gig you could just keep loading and
loading and loading terrifying so there
is a dark side and it's good to know
that it exists if you want to use it
that's fine hopefully before you're 18
and the record is expunged and things
like that so this was intended to be
quite short because at the end of the
day but we can have some fun you know
what there's attributions I tried to be
cool here what other questions ideas
stories things do you have in your
routing modding passed in security and
privacy world do you have self you have
actual submitted questions check the
brain the brain scan go to Conda I know
speaker brain but it's come on it's
really reading my thoughts I'm not very
comfortable with it i'm still perfecting
my helmet thing with the Faraday cage
because I think tin foil may just
actually amplify no questions okay any
any live questions anything oh yeah sure
that's great I like it a lot and I'm
gonna start and then people can correct
me if they have other ideas ssh
tunneling is first of all brilliant on
its own like everyone if you don't know-
l- are totally learn it it operates on
both ends whoa you know what keep it
secret from the people that are afraid
of you know or like trying to protect
you from secure but it's powerful man so
when you make that connection stuff
flows and it can flow either way I I did
that as well for quite a while and a
long time ago with browsers of ancient
history dns did not flow through but
then if you go and you change the
setting and everything works so now
you're safe good so your question is
essentially you have your SSH tunnel
which is very very clearly like machine
the machine am secure we know about that
and a certain port locally that your
browser knows about because you set it
up in the config is sending all the
traffic there even including DNS it
comes out on the other server side
machines so I think that's okay for the
browser but what about the other stuff
there's other like are you running an
operating system that is just a browser
and nothing else like definitely nothing
else yes so definitely hopping so the
description for the microphone people is
that you're able to hop through that
host as a jump point to get to other
hose to do remote desktop connections
these are all very useful and what I was
referring to is the host where you're
initiating the ssh connection and you're
tunneling through that ssh connection
and the browser connections and maybe
other ports are set up to tunnel what if
let's say you have an operating system
that sometimes has a different program
that's not a browser that wants to
update itself or what if you have enough
a piece of software that uses the
internet in any way and you don't have
it connected to the proxy right cetera
so if you had the proxy at the system
level might be okay but if you have
anything else and the update mechanism
does not have digital signing
awesomeness you know hashing and
checking all that then you could have an
interceptor a man in the middle and
virulent nonsense and basically this i'm
glad i left this this slide up this
device in evil mode can just attack all
javascript jquery like anything that's
on pages if you end up getting um you
know a browser involved with this stuff
it will fake you out I mean this is the
supreme level of fishing it could do
anything because browsers are so
powerful now and once you have
JavaScript doing all the interesting
things that our speakers talk about
JavaScript doing and this device is
rewriting it you're kind of toast so
basically the point is what you're doing
is great but you launch even one other
thing that's not using the tunnel and
you're toast but with you do the openvpn
style the client that the greatest thing
about some of the clients is that there
they have options such that Internet
activity can be blocked if it's not on
the VPN or on the Android one there's a
when i restart my phone re-establish or
what should it do in timeout scenarios
like when you're in the elevator lose
connection it comes back how long should
it retry so these are interesting safety
features to compare and contrast
basically like i loved what you did i
did that for years and years and years
and then I just fully switched to open
VPN for all the use cases you described
because then it's just easier you don't
actually have to configure port by port
did that answer your question are you
excited about openvpn now
okay that's cool I mean it can go either
way that they're all quite good are we
out of time and we was there I thought I
saw maybe one more oh it was well they
were so the question was about the the
creepy factor of people watching you on
the internet and it is well known that
this pretty large provider turns out to
be Comcast right rewrites web pages if
it's not https they definitely do that
it's definitely known and so that bit
yeah that is a interesting creepy factor
if you tunnel out through something
that's not comcast then you'll you'll be
okay and then we probably should have
mentioned it a certain point that this
whole different region thing that we
demonstrated that there are reasons why
you may want to be in a different region
I kind of glossed over that if you go to
certain places further out from where we
are now and you go to youtube and it's
permitted to go to youtube where maybe
facebook is blocked or maybe Google
gmails box but maybe youtube is allowed
you don't always get the same content
and you know that's kind of a digital
rights human digital rights issue that I
think this helps with but of course
there's this so you could say get me
access to the videos I want things like
that but there's this interesting thing
that just happened more recently with
Netflix right because if you use a known
VPN provider then they're gonna they're
basically blocking you so if you go to a
different country and you try to play a
certain content item that they don't
have available for that region they say
sorry you're in the wrong region then
you VPN in to the right region and it
says sorry you're on VPN drat fully I
mean you feel like foiled again but the
simple answer is at home or at Grandma's
house where your parents house or a
friend's house you have your little open
you have your basic open VPN server
running so now or at home right you
basically are at home of course this
requires a heavy upstream speed if you
think about the way the
workflow is going if you're doing things
like video but for most things that's
quite good and gigabits almost here in
Chicago 18t i think has gigabit and who
knows maybe we'll be lucky and like
magical happen in fiber comes google
yeah go ahead so that that's a that's
yeah I lots of people do that the
question was do they block ec2 ranges
and that's a great hack I feel like
because I think they really can't right
or it may be a cat and mouse game but I
don't see how they could so if you run
your own and lots of people think about
doing this as a very low cost Thea
people like a micro or a free edition
and you're using it so little and it's
just an IP block there there's no way to
tell that there's any difference there's
no way to tell that you're tunneling
it's just emerging from one of these two
places in you know in America so yeah
except that um doesn't it cost more and
wait what oh yeah bedre know
yeah so the question was or the the
comment was that AWS there's so much
that's well known about the ranges and
it's pretty easy to block if they want
to but in like the case of actual
content providers I'm not familiar with
any that are yet or if they are but it
you know it's pretty easy to jump around
I bet yeah oh yeah okay so this is a
great question it's like isn't it easy
to defeat tour even though we thought
not that long ago that was great and the
layers are great and that there are
papers written about exactly that and it
definitely like in a research sense has
been proven to be not that hard and in a
like actual knowledge acquisition since
about nation states it's been pretty
well verified and documented that the
exit nodes are controlled in ways that
you may not have expected sure
yeah if you okay so if you're omniscient
which certain 8 certain agencies and
things are from the level of like
ability to well maybe they just light
split with prism all of the traffic from
really big back bony points then don't
they have enough information just from
packet analysis and rates absolutely yes
yes yes but uh yeah so don't feel bad
there's always hope there's all their
always interesting ways Cedric that's it
so the question was about when you have
the login page thing whatever it is it
may be free or accept terms or pay or
give me your name but it's a it's
challenging because the creds and the
cert process and not EV not even H you
know all these things even though you
know certs are easy and we have left
let's encrypt now and it's change the
world eff is great they still have these
technical challenges and Go Go Go's in
Chicago so maybe we can track someone
down and see like where they are but
forget it let's say that the server side
stays all sorts of crappy and we hate
them why not and and some some of these
exist out there why not write scripts so
that you know when you have your hacked
travel router and it already you know
wants to connect to VPN but first it has
to do some pay wall off accept terms
letter why not have that get scripted
right like very few of them have a
CAPTCHA or recaptcha right they're
usually just click east I mean that's
all co dab'll that's all scriptable
right so uh I can't remember the
specifics maybe someone out there knows
but like I I think some there are some
devices other people are working on and
there's probably enough you know just
search for it where at least a few known
ones I don't know maybe it's like
Starbucks mcdonalds something like that
that they know how to do it so there you
go boom shakalaka how does it sound we
could we could put that on github pretty
quick cool anything else thanks everyone
