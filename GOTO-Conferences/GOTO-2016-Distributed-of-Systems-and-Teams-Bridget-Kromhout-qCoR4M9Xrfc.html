distributed teams at a couple of
different companies and we'll do the
obligatory second though I guess in this
deck is the fourth slide I live in
Minneapolis Minnesota if you're not
super familiar with US geography it's in
the middle and by the big leagues work
for pivotal I do tuck advocacy for cloud
foundry we can talk about that more at
the reception later this talk isn't
really about that I podcast with
arrested dev ops and I'm also the head
organizer for DevOps days so I don't
think we've had a div up stays
Copenhagen so come find me talk to me
about that maybe we can make that happen
so I've I've spent a great deal of time
I spent from 1999 until last August on
call for production infrastructure it by
the way it turns out that when you go
into a tech advocacy job you don't
actually get more sleep like that part
was a lie because instead of pagerduty
waking you up as the fly delta app but
um I still work on a distributed team
and the fact that and I had to put it in
kilometers for this audience I'm an
ignorant American so I'm really not sure
how much that is but google maps said it
would take like you know 600 hours to
walk it so and our whole team actually
lives in various places in the US and
one person on the team in South Korea I
actually have a team member here
shoutout to kenny bastani sitting in the
front row but uh i think of all the
people in the team Kenny's probably the
one who lives the closest to the san
francisco and powell you probably
equidistant between headquarters in palo
alto and the San Francisco office I
don't know how much time do you actually
spend on the offices yeah he's a zero
because our entire team is distributed
which means we spend all our time doing
that communication stuff you know mostly
via the internet unless we're at
conferences together this here that
you're thinking okay maybe that works
for like you know traveling tech
advocate types but does that actually
work for you know devs and ops and all
of that and it's like well I mean yes I
think so but I want to clarify that when
i talk about distributed teams he
I don't actually mean one person you
know remote away from the rest of the
team because the problem with that is
one person or a scattered amount of
people that are really far away from
where this near the center of gravity is
and all the hallway discussions and the
offline decision-making happens ends up
being really isolated so that's
something to watch out for if your tour
if you think you want to build a
distributed organization watch out for
what happens when you decide to just
like tech some remote people on to an
organization that isn't really built for
that like I think you have to think
about you know building your team
mindful E or your whole organization but
whatever your unit of you know scope is
think about building that to be remote
first as opposed to just putting people
really far away from everybody else and
then like just logistics where I
actually work is I do have a co-working
space membership it's in a you know in a
really nice ancient building in
Minneapolis ancient by you know us
standards so it's like 120 130 years old
but a mostly the go you know favorite
coffee shop gogo inflight Wi-Fi which is
terrible um is where I do most of my
work if I'm not you know at an actual
conference but I still I feel like we
still have that DevOps you know like
thinking about the divisions between
teams you can still have that whether or
not the teams are co-located right like
so I mean how many people are familiar
with us like you know like DevOps wall
of confusion the this classic wall of
confusion on is from my android cliche
for some years back I like to think of
it a little bit more like hey
development throat coat over the wall to
operations oh no operations has to now
like live with the consequences of the
results if you have those sort of
divisions inside your organization and
their exacerbated by those team members
like never actually interacting with one
another possibly if you have your apps
people in you know I don't know offshore
door you're deaf people offshored or
whatever like you can get a lot of these
classic conflicts that we talk about in
a DevOps conflict on text in a team that
has you know a lot of remote distributed
members
so I think that like when we talk about
this stuff in DevOps I think probably
the there's always more depth to it than
that like simple brick wall right
because it's not as simple as saying oh
I'm just gonna learn everyone else's job
to it's like okay full stack is that
real I mean no I don't think so so like
you don't actually have time for that
and the part where you would like to put
all the devs on call that sounds great
in theory and maybe if you have a bunch
of microservices and you have your
monitoring set up such that you can
correctly and you know consistently
alert just on the problems with that one
micro service and just send it to the
dev team responsible for deploying those
problems into production like yeah it's
maybe possible but underlying all of the
microservices you probably have some
sort of infrastructure whether it's on
Prem or whether it's your AWS account
that you did who knows what to the VPC
and then like some dev team gets paged
because there's something wrong with
their micro service but what's really
wrong is a configuration in the VPC you
start to see how it's not as simple as
saying oh well well I'll just get along
it's like well you need a little bit
more for example in your monitoring and
alerting you need a little bit more
context for people to you know get
alerted on the right things the
actionable things and things they can do
something about and also have it be the
stuff that's actually within their
sphere of influence um we should also
like because in the devops context we
always talk about empathy i try to think
of it as like i spent a long time in ops
feeling like I was the villain of the
piece and I got to tell you when i saw
this bunny in our garden i was pretty
much like kill you know like you think
of you think of the person or you know
little creepy crawly critter that's
causing you so much trouble as being the
one who you just stopped them from
deploying some bad code or you just stop
them from deciding to make a whole bunch
of changes and like why didn't they put
an index on that query but it's not
really a them thing because like okay
seriously from this Bunny's perspective
it looks like he was actually trying to
get out of the fence garden like he got
in somehow because there was delightful
delectable delicious stuff in there
but he couldn't really figure out how to
get out and it's like when I thought
about it from his perspective I was like
oh he's actually trying to figure out
how to get out that's actually terrible
and I think about like okay the dev who
deploys you know or you know checks in
any way some code that ends up causing
terrible terrible problems is it really
their fault well I mean obviously you
have some kind of code review there's
also a lot of architectural decisions
that went into making something that you
could take down with like a single
deploy so it's like maybe we need to
think about that a little bit more you
know blue green etc um I also think that
especially on very distributed teams
like setting the expectations for what
you want people on the team to do are
pretty useful like it's really hard for
people to intuitively tell or guess that
someone on the team is unhappy I mean
you can obviously have all the back
channels you want on slack or whatever
else but like if people aren't talking
to each other how do you tell if they're
unhappy so like being more explicit
about your communication than perhaps
you otherwise would be you know like I
think just the other day schaefer our
boss sat on slack I think we need to
have a team meeting what time zones are
good for people and it's probably going
to take us a couple of days through
slack to figure out you know for
everyone to get to a okay this is what
you know will converge on what actually
works but I feel like putting that
expectation out there is pretty valuable
um there's also something to say about
nonviolent communication and like
emotional literacy which are I have by
the way I have a page of notes at the
end with a lot of references you can go
read a lot of this stuff I think it was
John alspaugh was tweeting about this
nonviolent communication thing and I
remember thinking like you know I think
I forget if it was he said something
directly to me or and a reply in a
conversation but I remember thinking
like nonviolent communication I mean do
I need that and then later you know I'm
mad about something and I'm thinking
stabbity stab at east avenue yeah it's
like okay probably i Nev I probably need
nonviolent communication but how this
actually works if you if you go read
about non finally communication it's
it's not as I don't know touchy feely as
it sounds
it's actually exactly what we're used to
dealing with in our systems which is to
say instead of using a UDP style just
spray a bunch of information out there
and then hope everyone got it you use a
handshape and say what I think I heard
you say was that you really don't want
to do the deploy on Friday because you
don't feel comfortable with it is that
right and then they repeat back like
actually yeah I feel like this is kind
of a disaster and we haven't thought
this through so stuff like that like
instead of listening to something and
then waiting for your turn to talk cuz
that's a lot a lot of us do when we're
listening to people listening to
something and then repeating back to
them what you think you heard is a
really good way to make sure that you
actually are on the same page and even
more valuable obviously when you're
doing a lot of lower bandwidth
communication like um you know obviously
email which you should never do because
it's terrible or chat or you know
hangouts or whatever are not going to be
as high bandwidth as in person so
something else you know another all spa
thing he was he likes to email people
PDFs but he also tweeted this particular
one and uh if you if you haven't read
this it's actually really interesting
the common ground paper woods at all
wrote this paper and um I suppose you
know I'm sure somebody has done this one
of the papers we love me too but yeah
what do you think Camille are you gonna
do this one of the papers or love maybe
but uh but the idea here is that at one
point you and your teammates understood
where you both were you were on the same
page you agreed with each other and
possibly say when you were designing
those endpoints or deciding exactly
which you know distributed data store
you were going to use for something
versus which one they were going to use
and then at some point you stopped
syncing your communications just enough
that later you're like why does this why
does this endpoint return 200 ok no
matter what I feel like this is really
bad if we're going to be using that to
decide whether or not to bounce stuff
out of the load balancer oh I understand
that you were actually using
health check for something I mean we
have club watch for that right and
you're like no it's for something else
so like that idea of whether or not you
think you're on the same page just
continuing to communicate is just
continuing to surface information for
the rest of the people on the team helps
a lot especially again when you're in
the lower bandwidth communication
otherwise you end up with coordination
surprise which is nowhere near as like
awesome other exciting as it sounds
usually leads to outages um and so then
you're you're thinking like okay wait
are you saying that like this is all
documentation you have to just write
everything down okay so I'm actually not
a huge fan of documentation and the
reason is because it usually ends up in
wikis where you can't find it and it's
also always wrong and that's because
everything is changing all the time
right and so like you can have a plan of
how things are supposed to work but by
the time I mean how many times do you
think to yourself okay I've done the
hotfix and I've updated the
documentation you know under pressure
when on call whatever it's like no
that's probably not going to happen so
I'd like instead I'm a bigger fan of the
really explicit clear commit messages
because I feel like at that moment when
you commit the code is when you have the
most context and you know why you did it
and also like don't just write what you
did be like change the value of you know
whatever and you know change that
particular load balancer and you're like
that's great I can see that that's what
you did past self why why did you do it
so like while you have that answer is
the right time to write that down on
this by the way I'm really excited about
my my spouse Joe and I are going to go
over to the Vasa Museum Stockholm later
in the week and I have seen it before
but I'm really excited to see it again
because you know this is the the
lightning talk you should all go I'll go
watches Peach has laksa 17th century
shipbuilding and your failed software
project from a monitor AMA in 2014
hilarious stuff um okay it's like
another thing about writing stuff down
like I feel like just writing down that
there's a problem isn't necessarily good
enough and you probably can't read that
sign so I'll blow it up
and I remember thinking this is in
orlando in the walt disney park and
remember thinking okay this is
disturbing on so many levels because
there are a lot of small children
walking around here and you know just
tourists walking around and there's no
fence and presumably no animal control
of any sort like there's just kind of a
warning there's snakes and alligators in
this beautiful water here don't be near
it even though I'm not standing like I'm
standing when I take this picture i'm
standing on the sidewalk at a very
reasonable distance and i'm thinking
like there's so many places that we feel
like we wrote down you know okay we mark
I mark that ticket won't fix it's like
yeah but it's still a problem maybe I
mean somebody wrote it down for a reason
and so just writing down like that
you're not going to deal with it I don't
think is enough of an answer I mean at
least say why right I feel like the
really roughly you can do to somebody
who's done the courtesy of like giving
you an even in an open source project
even not inside your entire organization
if somebody has given you like the gift
of their time to tell you a perceived
problem just to say we're not going to
fix this it's like ah that is not a
great way to communicate um one way that
I really like to communicate on my
coworker kidding and eyes have a
co-worker Casey West who wrote a really
good blog post and he was talking about
like the benefits of if you have a
distributed team that you do everything
in durable communication and I think
that's really valuable if you think of
it as instead of the ephemeral you know
let's it what is it with people who want
to hop on a call like I never want to
hop on a call ever but when people want
to hop on a call or they want to have a
hangout like that's a good way to have
higher bandwidth you know discussions
but unless you actually write down the
results of that it didn't happen right
like Google Doc or that meeting didn't
happen because even in person meetings
because if you think about it how many
meetings have you gone to whether it's
you know video chat or a meeting in
person where you leave the meeting
someone else leaves the meeting and
later there's coordination surprise
because you clearly didn't actually
agree on the results that I meeting even
you were both there like how does this
happen well we all experience life to
our own perceptual filters so it's like
it's actually really important to make
sure you keep some sort of record that
you can at least refer back to if only
to win arguments right um something else
that I think about a lot actually is
well cap theorem because distributed
systems but Eric Brewer went back about
12 years later and wrote an article i
think for info q about you know
revisiting cap theorem and he talked
about partitions being a time-bound on
communication the idea being like say
you have a partition okay that's cool do
you wait until the heat death of the
universe like probably not so you're
going to wait some amount of time before
you decide yeah we're probably going to
stay in slipper in for a while here we
need to cope with this so I was thinking
about this and I was like wait a minute
in our in our human interactions we
actually have a lot of this too right we
have a lot of this i was in bangalore
this last spring and i was at the target
a gentle dojo there and they have these
clocks on the wall because target is
headquartered in minneapolis and i
remember thinking yeah they are not
going to wait ten and a half hours from
Minneapolis to wake up to make a
decision every day right so the the the
idea of having a team that's distributed
everywhere needs to go along with the
ability to distribute the decision
making as far as possible to the edges
because that way you know if you're here
you're not going to wait for California
to wake up to make a decision and if
you're you know in bangalore likewise
and putting people in on putting people
in teams without the ability to do
localized decision-making basically just
says hey we're offshoring some stuff to
you but you're not actually autonomous
and I feel like we've spent a lot of
time thinking about this and just in our
distributed systems where we don't want
to lock and wait forever it's like mmm
no let's do centralized that so that we
can keep moving and provide like you
know a partial answer I mean even if I
you know distributed systems which are
collections of microserver
definitely are going to be are going to
be in a state of continuous partial
failure at all times we at least want to
be at least semi effective in some parts
of it I feel like that's really
applicable to distributed teams to which
does mean yeah the people at the you
know at the top of the pyramid can't
have all the decision-making flowing up
to them um this is actually kind of
funny that Sam mentioned this in his
opening talk this morning because i've
had this slide in the stack for ages and
what i like about this is an adrian
Cockroft by the way I kind of called out
this at a conference I think it was like
earlier this year late last year where
he mentioned that yeah but a monolith
has complexity to it's just hidden from
you and that's totally true but you
still might not know where all the
complexity and your micro services are
either I think that what especially when
you're trying to do any kind of auto
healing or any kind of auto scaling like
hmm you're not going to auto scale your
way out of a database problem like
there's going to be back pressure
somewhere so there's there's a lot of
places where you're going to have to try
to solve for which part of your complex
system made up of micro services is
actually causing your problems there's
there's actually a lot of there's a lot
of interesting work going on in this
space right now I saw Jason Dixon
tweeting that there's going to be
another monitor Rama you like you know
in the next year so I guess watch
monitor Rama and see when that's going
to happen but there's also i know there
was a talk earlier at this conference
about Hugh me oh and charity majors and
some other folks have honeycomb going on
24 this is lit that like looking at all
of the logs all of the context and
trying to get on some answers before you
just start I don't know scale up
everything see if that makes it better
it's like actually that might make it
worse sometimes depending on what's
going wrong um something else that I
think like in our both distributed
systems and teams that I think is
important to consider is what I was just
referencing the state of continuous
partial failure
like we all know people maybe for a
friend you can acknowledge that you've
worked with people that they architect
things for if everything will go well
and you're like that that'll be super if
everything goes well um if everything
doesn't go well I mean you're gonna get
page in the middle of the night there's
gonna be sadness and you're gonna wonder
exactly how many services you're
actually crammed into that microservice
like by the way I think everybody
probably just like DevOps everybody has
their own definition of microservices
mine is this if you can't have an
endpoint that can answer is this working
yes or no I there's too many things in
that service because if the answer is
well like no that's not a mic resurface
um but if you're if you're thinking
about the kind of failures that are
gonna happen in our distributive systems
and also in our distributed teams like
having some amount of redundancy is
great and you're like okay that's cool I
mean I can have an auto scaling group
but I can't have an auto scaling group
of humans I mean they're not completely
fungible resources even if some HR
departments would like to believe they
are like they're not so I would say like
having the ability to have members of
the team back each other up um I know
that I like you know Kenny and Casey
have done a whole bunch of roadshow
stuff and I think they can you know and
iron our co-worker Fred and I think they
can all do each other's talks by this
point is that right Kenny Kenny's
nodding from the front row so that's
kind of if you have um you know like
some plan for when some person becomes
unavailable because you know sometimes
people just want to go canoeing like
where there's no cell signal like those
things do happen and you have to have a
plan for that and on the topic by the
way of just just because the two pizzas
teams are super popular trope I don't
know about if there is popular in Europe
and I know in the u.s. they're super
popular with when you talk about
microservices this idea of you have like
this cross-functional team and like
every single skill set possible and
they're all working together in this
little
they just work on this one service and I
guess you hire like n of those teams if
you have n microservices doesn't ever
have like six thousand microservices I
kind of wonder if like how many micro
services per team but then I start
wondering like you know how hungry are
these teams and how big are these pizzas
I feel like there's there's a lot of
dividing people up into groups that then
don't need to talk to each other because
they have everything they need inside
their group that is kind of I don't know
kind of reduction is like just because
for example just because you have all
the everyone inside your little team
that you know runs and operates your
micro service you know from soup to nuts
and end is all together whether they're
all together virtually on the same slack
channel or whatever and that doesn't
mean that they're not going to need to
talk to other teams and I think that
there's I sort of see like there was
even a recent discussion on Twitter
about like oh you probably don't need to
have the ability to have teams like
communicate because you have everything
communicating through api's I'm like oh
I so fundamentally disagree with that
let's see because I look at Conway's law
and I think like okay so if we're going
to design systems that are going to
perforce look like our organizations
like I just got a recruiter spam I
tweeted about it because it was kind of
distressing I should put that tweet in
the stack where they said that they have
two different implementations of
OpenStack at their organization that
they're running in production and I
remember thinking like okay why and
somebody replied and said well there
were two teams the two separate budgets
that both wanted to get OpenStack and
didn't agree with each other I'm like
yep that's probably why it's so like
this is the the kind of stuff where
you're not necessarily going to design
the ideal system if you're trying to map
it perfectly onto your org chart but you
also aren't going to be able to say have
one team working on your back-end api's
and another team working on your mobile
apps and have them never talk to each
other ever because it realistically
someday you're going to want to
deprecate v1 of the API or like there's
going
n points that you have to make breaking
changes to for reasons like having the
ability to talk to each other about that
stuff and again it the team doesn't have
to be co-located to do that but they do
have to have enough trust in
communication between the teams to do
that I think is really important um ok
so like on the topic of tools it's like
ok so we're all here because we want to
talk about computers and that people or
whatever and that's cool but like I
think tools are an important part of
making distributed teams work but I
don't think that they're in any way the
only thing that you would use to make
distributed teams work it's like for
example I think like just for an example
at pivotal we this is an example of some
of the tools we use for synchronous
communication I do literally end up
dming some of my co-workers on Twitter
more than I end up talking to them on
slack depending on the co-worker um you
know slack shared Google Docs I you know
hangouts you know messages whatever um
that's kind of one of those things where
like some people in the org or not going
to be using slack for whatever reason
and so then you just end up talking to
them on google chat and wishing that
they were on slack those are the kind of
things that are not necessarily perfect
I've in past versions this talk I had a
haiku about slack because it was so
great when I was at an org word
literally everyone used it and like now
well you know what not everyone does
that's just something that to deal with
and something which is kind of
interesting is thinking about these for
when you think about asynchronous
communication for us a lot of the tools
remain the same because you don't
actually have to all be there at the
same time to have conversations on
Twitter or slack or collaborate on a
google doc I and we also end up using
obviously like github and tracker and
Trello and um there is this thing called
social chat which for some reason the
field really likes so i don't know i
look at it sometimes mostly I just
filter the emails from it um okay so one
one thing I you've been hearing we say
like you know distributed everybody far
away from each other it's great spend
time with your cats at home like this is
all very true I do think that when
you're
new starting a job or if you're hiring
remote people for your teams I think I'm
boarding on person in person is really
valuable and it doesn't mean that
especially if you don't have a central
location for your team it doesn't mean
that the onboarding has to happen at an
office somewhere but I do think some in
person face-to-face with an existing
member of the team is a really good way
to have this super fast super high
bandwidth intense kind of you know dump
all of the info into their brain that
you want to get started so I do think
that that's one place where the in
person is really essential if you're if
if you're going to take a remote job
someplace and they're like we emailed
you or don't we snail mailed you a
laptop you know here's some one-time
password stuff with credentials and
you're like that's super i guess i'm
logging in on my first day don't do that
let's just we are human beings we do
like to see other human beings from time
to time so don't do that um and uh I
think there's there's also a lot of
assumptions around how people are going
to interact this is this is by the way
from Kyle Kingsbury is excellent Jepsen
project that you should totally go you
know read all of the stuff about for
testing failure and distributed systems
it's very interesting but uh it's its
name for this a Carly Rae Jepsen song
you know call me maybe and the the plot
of the song will give you a slight
spoiler here is that they have vastly
different assumptions around you know
these people's interactions with each
other one person is thinking one thing
another person's thinking something
completely different everything gets
revealed at the end of the song and I
think that when we're when we're
interacting with people that we don't
necessarily see in person all the time
we have to rethink some of those basic
well of course fill in the blank it's
like maybe not maybe not of course so
like for example and we had a at my last
gig I was working at dramafever it's a
streaming video site that was a lot like
Netflix if Netflix were much smaller and
mostly Korean soap opera and Ayn Rand
doctor in production since October 2013
oh yeah
and I you know cutting edge bleeding
edge there was there's lots of blood but
a we had our employee handbook and
github you know as one does and one of
her developers actually went in and
edited some not intended to be harmful
just it kind of funny stuff you know see
when your co-workers will be letting you
down let them know when you'll be
repaying the favor is funny but it's
depending on the cultural context to the
person reading it or have guilty they
feel about having to take some vacation
time that's not necessarily the language
that's going to make them feel
comfortable about taking their vacation
time and so this fellow patty went and
changed it to like know when your
co-workers aren't supposed to be working
so you can encourage them to stop
replying to you on slack that's kind of
paying attention to those and those
barriers like when you're if we are
coworker Casey calls it instead of
work-life balance he calls it work life
blending but like the idea that if
you're on a distributed team does that
mean you're always working all the time
it shows just sitting there looking at
me like uh huh but you're probably not
right like you are going to spend some
time with family or friends or whatever
um and having it be perfectly fine for
somebody to you know set those
boundaries and say this is when I'm not
working even if other people on the team
maybe still are working because time
zones right and another another thing
that I think is really important this is
an example from my last job where I had
um I commented on a like a github issue
and my boss had replied with something
like well while you're in there do
something else and I remember being
really upset about it because it sounded
like he was saying I was wasting my time
doing something that I thought was
important and so I steward about it I
was kind of upset and then I just asked
him like did you say this because you
really thought what I was working on
there was unimportant didn't mean it
that way at all like I just assumed that
so I think having that conversation even
if it feels awkward and uncomfortable
because what if he had said yeah I
really thought the thing you were
working on their didn't matter sorry
like that that would have been kind of a
not great thing to have to hear but it
also at least I wouldn't have been
sitting there wondering you know so even
it feels awkward and weird I think it's
valuable to at least over communicate a
little and I also think especially and
again I'm like doing tech advocacy now
but I was my last job was a year doing
ops remotely we were five people on the
ops team and none of us were
geographically co-located and so every
time we were you know poking at
production and some sort of on this
unexpected way or whatever um we would
definitely be explicit about what we
were doing what we were working on we
ended up putting we were one hundred
percent in AWS and we ended up on just
like we looked at cloud formation in
terraform and at the time in early 2014
they were both still a little bit too
green I think charity would probably say
terraform is still too green but um we
ended up just dumping the the JSON for
all of our AWS configs for all of our
club watch etc you know auto scaling
groups everything and then throwing that
in github so that if there was something
that we expected our infrastructure to
be a certain way and we needed to change
it then we had a Jenkins job that I set
up that would break the build for you
know our infrastructure if something was
changed that wasn't checked in so that
way we could at least see if things were
changing out from under us in an
unexpected way and I think that like
having instead of having the well the
assumption is probably everything's fine
unless we have happened to have set up
an alert that will tell us yeah I mean
you know that that's not safe right so
like just being explicit about what
you're working on what you're doing what
you're changing and asking for help if
you think you need it you know getting
getting a couple of sets of eyes on any
kind of ops or other stuff is pretty
important and i also like this meme was
going around last year and if you can't
read it from the back it just says like
you know 1995 we were all going to just
do everything from anywhere and 2015
must be willing to relocate to San
Francisco like okay just show of hands
who here has actually relocated to San
Francisco I see maybe four hands so ya
know on it's not really something that
you really want to do for every single
job ever and
some of us like a couple years ago we
were having a polar vortex like extreme
cold in Minnesota and I got an email
from a google recruiter asking me if I
wanted to come interview in California
because I see you're in Minnesota and
it's very cold there right now I just
wrote back with one line snow as a
feature not a bug like this is like now
if I had wanted to move to San Francisco
like i'm old enough i probably would
have done it during the first combo so
it's like no probably not and i think
that there's sometimes this idea that
you absolutely have to in order to get
something done even if perhaps if that
something is like it really smells
startup you're trying to get off the
ground or whatever and i do think that
being in a room with your teammates can
lead to a lot of fast iteration but
there's plenty of coding and
contemplation that you don't have to do
in direct proximity with each other so i
disagree with thee you must be a hundred
percent collate co-located for you know
some particular kinds of work i also
think that this idea like that our
industries are all you know i talked to
in in my role as working at a vendor now
I talked to a lot of people from a lot
of large enterprises that are possibly
rightfully concerned about everything
changing in the industry but I also
think that it's not entirely surprising
I mean the world keeps changing if we
just expect the cycle of change to like
continue then you know let's just assume
things will keep changing okay check
later if we were right so the idea that
people are going to in order to get
their goals met that they need to follow
whatever the tech trend at this very
moment is and so you know for a while it
was like let's outsource everything and
then it was like oh no we have to bring
everything back in-house and it was like
we should build everything ourselves
from scratch it's like no no we should
use public clog for everything it's like
there's an awful lot as Schafer likes to
say there's an awful lot of tribalism
and fashion and tech we don't
necessarily have to follow it all um but
he's also right when he says that there
is not actually a talent shortage like
there's a shortage of people who there
might be a shortage of people who
already have a ton of experience and the
thing that you want and live where you
want them to live and will accept the
pay that you want them to accept and
want to work with you like there might
be a shortage of that but that's
something that there's an overall talent
shortage and so people who are trying to
you know higher which seems like every
conference I go to every talk I go to
like people are talking about how
they're hiring we're hiring too by the
way pivotal dot io / careers but if
everybody is hiring yet saying it's hard
to find the people who are right like
maybe you have to reevaluate who are the
people who are right which factors can
you change maybe you don't want to
change the factors about them being
people you would actually want to work
with but perhaps you want to hire more
junior devs and you know train them or
perhaps you want to hire people who are
absolutely perfect in every way but live
in Montana and have no desire to move
because like have news for you they have
internet in Montana now like it's
probably fine um and there's also a lot
of benefit to the flexibility that
having a distributed team or at least
partially distributed team on brings to
an organization even for people who
often go into the office and this was
from a couple of jobs ago and it was
just one particular day that I don't
even think it was raining a lot that day
I don't know maybe it was beautiful out
but like everybody seemed like everybody
was working from home that day i was
working remote so i was like working
from home like every day but the people
who were working out of an office a lot
of them needed to not be in the office
that day and it wasn't actually a
problem because anything that they
needed was going to happen online anyway
and so like even for the people who want
to go into an office every day you know
being a little bit more remote friendly
is a huge win in terms of giving them
the flexibility that they need to live
you know their normal human lives there
was a martin fowler blog post that had
some really interesting points about
remote versus co-located work and
there's a lot of stuff in there about
how you build your teams and etc but
like the one thing i just want to focus
on is this idea from
on this image of like you can team might
move faster it might be really fast all
co-located together but at that point
you can only hire the people who want to
be co-located in that place and so if
you want your best selection of people
co-located or not then probably the way
you're going to achieve that is getting
all the people that you can from
anywhere wherever it is that they would
you know happen to live and like they
can if you have all of the best people
however you want to try to define best
then like if you change that must
relocate to San Francisco Mimi I'll flip
that on its head you give yourself a lot
more hiring options which can it's no
guarantee of being more effective but it
can certainly give you a lot more
choices on there's also something else
about microservices that it probably
should point out which is when you're
working on a giant monolithic system
like maybe you feel attached to your
little piece when you're working on a
surface that's just you and like the
four people that you spend all your time
on you know your own slack channel with
you're going to probably get really
attached to it and you're also going to
have a lot of you know interactions you
have to manage whether it be via your
you know with your fear your AP is with
your contracts and whatever those
however you're going to set up your
contracts and promises your platform
your interactions with the rest of the
distributed system that your micro
service is a small part of you have to
negotiate all of that and you're not
going to negotiate if you're not going
to be able to negotiate all of it by API
calls like that's just not realistic
because can you imagine like having
already thought of all of the things
you're going to want to argue about I
mean I haven't ever had that happen in
the workplace so I think that that's
that's like probably one of the things
to watch out for when you go for the
explosion of micro services to the point
where i'm a trainee from uber claims
that they're not sure how many github
repos they have had other people tell me
no we know how many but
um when you are going to you know an
explosion of microservices I think it is
important to think about that like how
are all these pieces going to interact
and if you're not going to be able to
negotiate between all the people what
are your contractual you know
commitments in terms of how these
services are going to talk to each other
so that you don't end up with horrible
horrible problems like prototype will
give you one for free definitely don't
share your data store between micro
services because we've totally made my
last job we totally made that mistake
and in one particular case it proved to
be a huge pain right so it's like oh
yeah we totally have all these changes
we need to make to the database but we
can't make those changes to the database
because that will affect this other
micro service it's like oh okay so
you're not really doing micro surfaces
are you nope so in a particular case um
let's see oh yeah something else I think
thinking about all of this you know
weighty stuff to think about an advice
like I think most of us probably have a
you know have a reasonably well
developed Jiminy Cricket like conscience
ourselves what do we think is actually
the right way to interact with other
people like just because we're going to
be on a distributed team where those
people are mostly tiny icons I actually
end up leaving slack expanded so that
you can see the little face icons a lot
of the time just because otherwise I get
kind of lonely with compact view makes
me lonely but um but the the part where
you should treat other people right that
we probably since we're all adults
walking around in a conference center
and not like completely feral we've
probably all learned at some point you
know how to interact in kindergarten and
that's that's kind of by the way how I
feel a you know a certificate of DevOps
or whatever would be it's like
congratulations you learn not to hit the
other children and not to eat crayons
like good job on is like you know how
you want to be treated you know how to
treat other people like even if the
other people are on that other team that
built that one particular service that
really should be three services
the health check is always like
reporting that things are broken and
throwing things that is a load balancer
when they're not actually broken and
everybody isn't mad and everything's on
fire like even when you're dealing with
stuff like that like remembering that
these people probably didn't go to work
intending to do a bad job like they
probably tried to do their best and
figuring out there was a you know just
we've been hearing in other talks
earlier like about things like blameless
pneus like a communal was talking about
learning reviews figuring out where
somebody went wrong what was it the why
on earth did someone give Bridget wrote
anyway exactly like figuring out um why
something happens so that you can have
it not happen again is a lot more
valuable than being mad at that other
team which is a pretty typical and
inevitable consequence of like breaking
yourself into a whole bunch of little
teams working on separate services um
that's pretty much all I have to talk
about like I think that there's a ton of
info there and there's a there's a ton
of stuff we could discuss and we I think
I have brought probably enough time for
a few questions but I would also be
equally happy to just talk to you on
Twitter or over at the reception um but
yeah that's that's pretty much my job so
thank you
sure okay so uh alright so here we have
the talks really mm-hmm the questions
just say will there be drinks at this
reception uh so he's a good question
actually how do you build a shared
understanding about a product in a
distributed team yeah um I think shared
understanding about a product is a
tricky one especially because you may
have fundamental disagreements just from
the outside about what the product
should be or should do and I think it
really does help to have product
direction coming from people who
communicate with each other a lot so
they may not be co-located but the
product manager or managers for the team
need to definitely be having you know
probably video conferencing meetings
quite a bit and then also have a at
least you know some amount of notes from
those meetings that other people can
read so that especially because later
when some naysayer says well I just
don't understand I thought we were
building X you can at least look back
and say well in April that's definitely
what the note said this is where we
diverge from that oh dear we should have
been paying attention so yeah I think
the constant syncing with each other is
really a really helpful useful way to
keep that from being a horrible disaster
that was also a lower-level question
which was how do you know when people
are awake that is a wonderful question
actually um in terms of knowing whether
people are awake or not I don't know
about you but I leave my slack ass
settings set to away on almost all my
slack teams a lot because otherwise
depending on the slack team like the
devil stays organized or select team for
example has people all around the globe
and if I open my laptop because I need
to get something really brief done at
you know 6am but then I plan to go back
to sleep I don't really want to get
drawn into a long conversation so like I
kind of you know don't I leave that flag
as like not available but I would say
like
my work one on the other hand I never
turn that one off so if my laptop is
open like my work one will be green I
think that if you're not using slack I'm
you should be using slack but if you're
not using slack if you have any kind of
presence indicator that especially I
think it's really nice if it's manually
toggleable also I don't know if HipChat
still has this but at one point there's
said if you were on a laptop or mobile
and I actually don't really like that
because it shouldn't make a difference
and so I don't want people to be like I
wonder why that person's on mobile right
now so i think that there's presents
indicators are probably a good way to
deal with that also if you just have a
selected add that stuff where you can
set your note you can set your awake
hours in there so that you if you have
your notification set so that you're
going to be notified when you get
messages like push notifications you can
have your sleep hours set so that you
don't get messages during that that way
your co-workers don't have to feel bad
about at mentioning you or messaging you
while you're sleeping because like if
you are sleeping it's not going to wake
you up cool okay I know we're standing
between you and meeting a robot i
believe and alcohol so i just say thank
you very very much to bridge it once
again so yet random applause thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
