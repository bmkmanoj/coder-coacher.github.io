that's a question to you um how did you
respond to that
okay here's well I've already said that
something that takes a hundred pages of
traditional specs should be down to less
than five so what we're talking about
here is a maximum of one twentieth of
waterfall documentation but it's even
more than that some circumstance for
example a German company building a FDA
certified medical device had 12,000
pages after six months of scrum they had
eight hundred eighty percent automated
and it was going to three hundred eighty
percent automated so twenty percent of
that is like sixty pages handwritten so
sixty over like one thousandth we're
talking about one thousandth of the
documentation that's what agile means
how is that big upfront design
with the brothel to get that to get it
done in that way my take also known for
a long time information content
well it's certainly true that the
product owners job is a big job and in
my company now we have two product
owners for a team of seven because the
team is so fast to keep up with them you
know they're burning a couple hundred
stories a week now there's small stories
because the team to go fast get some
smaller and smaller so they're you know
on the order average a day used to
average a day now they're a lot less so
it does take a lot of work but it's
still I would say on the order of five
percent of what in the aggregate you
know for the whole project you add up
all the design I think it's still 5% of
a typical waterfall yeah in this case
the 60 pages handwritten these written
by one team or one design team and then
handed over to another team that is
actually doing the development or is it
the same team that is just doing the
documentation and then just giving
serious and one else
what is this sixty pages there
well there you know there's several
levels of design there's the there's the
world-class designer that says okay
here's if you want to if you want to
compete against Apple you better do your
product in this way and comes up with a
lot of examples with a lot of feedback
from from the company and it's probably
somebody outside your company because
most companies don't have people of that
caliber now once that concept is there
then you wind up with typically
usability kind of designers inside the
company that are really implementing it
and they're on they're probably doing a
lot of work with the product owners and
also with the team to explain one of the
big web companies I work with that I had
hundreds of web developers and build
many of the big sites in the United
States they had a design division that
I'd not only did work for them but it
actually worked for other companies so
that was a service product for them
design and the way we worked up the
strategy that is it the design expert
said you know we need the teams to
iterate three times before we can go
live with it with a web page so we'll
come in with it we'll work with the
product owners remember product owner
doesn't have usually doesn't have the
talent to do everything so these design
people are typically not the product
order because the product order doesn't
have that level of skill but a good
product on her nose when he needs design
and he gets somebody on his team to
execute it and so that's what would
happen in this company get the design
experts over working the backlog and
they would come up with design of the
web pages at the beginning of a sprint
they were doing four week Sprint's at a
time they would expect an iteration of
an implementation in one week they'd
come back and check it and tune it
iterations second week check in and tune
it iteration third week check it and
tune it and hopefully it was good enough
to go live that if not minor tuning so
in that case for then this is a really
large implementation the design ex
it's were separate from the teams but as
soon as they came in with the design
they worked with the teams to deliver it
in a narrative way did I understand you
right that just saying that it was more
prototype just to see for the product
owner hey this is how it looks like is
this right and then you're iterating
over the prototype and as soon as the
problem gives the okay
the development team goes over and
really yeah you know it depends on
obviously the situation what we found in
the venture group with with expansion
stage startups is that if we don't have
at least a wireframe of the web view it
can cut the velocity of the team by in a
third that the team will go into a spin
they'll go into a churn because they
don't know exactly how it should look
and so they're coming back to the
product owner who doesn't like it and
they just get into all these back and
forth so our investors are like product
owners you've got to you've got to give
these guys at least a wireframe and if
you're if you're in an application where
design really counts like Apple is with
the iPhone you got it you need a lot
more expertise than just a wireframe so
it depends so we're not talking about
big up for design we're talking about
the product order team pulling in design
expertise to get the job done in a way
that they win in the market that's
that's a lot more design than most
people do we don't realize how much pain
I mean I just the bank's I worked in the
banking industry many years we come up
with the cella system we put it into the
bank there's thousands of people every
day spending eighty ow
eight hours a day using it and it
totally sucks
it's totally painful it's a miserable
existence but the people use it they
can't they can't push back they're just
lowly clerks
so even if we won't do it to make more
money we should at least do it out of
respect for the people that were
inflicting our products on and that
means we got to get in there and find
out how can we make their lives easier I
think it's important to you like we were
discussing this was discussing whether
it should be the design and usually part
of ready it's also the invest katya and
in this context I think the M is
important in good negotiable and the
danger and I see of having a wireframe
as part of the ready it's like you make
it less negotiable if it says there like
this column and some GUI a the
developers just take that as a given and
I spend 80% of the development time like
producing that column because
calculating those figures is really hard
they must understand and they still in
the position where they can go like let
okay this column that's really expensive
can we like to do it in twenty percent
of the time and then leave that column
out let me talk about a totally
different example because to show you
the breadth of ways that this is done in
Norway the Norwegian post office started
buying up company up to company anybody
that ships anything they bought so to
ship your motorcycle takes a different
kind of postage than sending a letter
okay and when people went to the website
it was really hard you know if I want to
you know if I want to ship a car how do
I find in their website wade through all
the package shipments to get to I want
to ship my car and it was taking them on
the average four or five minutes for a
user to get to the right place which was
losing them business so they actually
hired an external expert to cabinas
product owner Tom Gilman Coghill and
when he came in he used the team to do
the innovation and prototyping he said
that the team the goal is the user can
get to the right solution and buy
postage
45 seconds today it takes four minutes
at the end of this sprint I want eight
different ways to do that and then the
team went and implement it then he
looked at each way and he said okay
what's it going to cost to implement he
looked at the value you know the speed
the look and feel
he did a return on investment
calculation and then he select ok this
way is the one we're going to implement
but now he's got the the fully fleshed
out prototype for the team to actually
do the final coding so it's not that the
team doesn't get to participate in this
whole process but it's still the same
process they got - they did set base
concurrent engineering to get to the
right implementation and then and you
may find interesting that that Facebook
first of all works in a very you know
scrum like way they have very small
teams and they're empowering everything
and so these teams has have various
roles they have engineers they have data
scientists look at the use of statistics
and so on and they do have designers on
the team it's a very important part of
development at Facebook and saying I
don't know how they do it that's a
frequent recommendation is that
designers were like at least one sprint
ahead and they prepare things that could
be developed in the future but then they
also support the team while they are
implementing things they are there - and
they always talking with each other and
another thing I wanted to mention is
little really working a proper waterfall
way but as I take it the time you get
feedback in waterfall is in better
testing and then perhaps it's not just
early enough to fix the most important
bugs you can't really change anything
important what people like naughty can
recommend is that you get user feedback
even before you start developing no more
that's a difference another thing is in
waterfall this as I understand it you
have a separate separate requirements
phase and design phase and then
engineering phase the test phase and
multi Kagen for example strongly
recommends to to put design and
requirements together it can't be
separate that it's the user experience
the product really the designer has a
lot to say on requirements and then of
course a development and testing that's
the you know if you'd be agile standard
now that you but you develop tests
together with the code and at the ends
you can automate automate response but
the court is correct or not and then
multi Kagan speaks of a product
discovery team that consists of the
product manager what he says product
manager you can really insert product
owner the way he understands the product
manager role that's it's really the
product owner role you can even take his
hooker and inspired and then read it
like the Bible on the product on the
goal it's that close so you have the
product owner abroad manager and then
you have the interaction designer but
then you have the lead engineer he
thinks these three roles are very
necessary to define a product or feature
they're necessary because of the product
many choices
has to be the expert on on value doesn't
make sense for a company to develop this
feature on this product and the
interaction designer it has to figure
out if this can be made usable it's no
good if it's available in theory but
nobody can use it you can sell it and
then be the lead engineer you endorse
the architecture and he can say if it's
feasible this a good idea based on the
architecture we have been developing the
last 10 years or something like this or
perhaps there are there are change is
necessary but the feature is so
important that we just have to do it but
we're taking here and we have to stop
doing other things and this input is
extremely important so at this design
phase you already have several roles
observer the product manager product
owner what owns their this part and then
who comes up with the ideas when I've
heard about that and I must have lit
when when I read Jeff's blog post about
that you know this this evening
specification and so on
I was initially a bit you know I didn't
really like it either I felt you know I
want to participate and I hope they were
saying this and so on but then first of
all if you as an engineer feel so
strongly about the success of your
product perhaps you should consider
becoming a product owner that's one
thing and the other thing is who comes
up with the cool ideas product owners
probably are more senior than the
developers tend to be younger and and
they you know they know all the latest
tech and who knows what has just become
possible what cool things have just
become possible it's usually the
engineers so multicam says although the
product manager owns this he has the
last say many of the most innovative
ideas actually come from the developers
so you don't want to have you pull them
into this and you want to put them in
front of users and then see if they have
good ideas but you steer is it still
worthwhile to think through yet the
design and tested before you start
writing production code okay I think
it's from the an interesting point that
we exciting about the design itself you
know I think Marty Kagan is more about
saying let the mark to cut designed and
I think from you Jeff I heard that the
product owner is deciding we're going
with this design and I like both ideas
but maybe it's pretty because of the
difference of the product but like
Facebook browsers or eBay or these web
companies they are just throwing
something on the unmarked up a be
testing and then the market decides oh
sorry but but they don't do just that
I mean if you think of the the profile
page the design of the new profile page
is timeline and probably most of you are
familiar with that I mean you can't a be
test your way to such a design these
these big changes you can bet they have
been working on for years these they
could probably do it in turn I don't
know okay okay the scrum master has to
have a changing personality depending on
the team if the team doesn't know what
they're doing they're not so for it as
it that's not happening the scrum master
needs to be forceful and in shock
therapy he's a dictator
yeah this is bad yeah sorry what I
thought that was one of the good ones
there's a paper on shock therapy and we
just published this month it's going
into a conference in January of
follow-on paper on high productive
metrics so both of these two are really
useful and you can get this on if you go
to my blog scrum Jeff's uncom and click
on the link two papers Jeff Sutherland
papers you can go right to the shock
therapy paper I I don't know if the
hyper productive metrics one is up there
yet but if it isn't send me an email now
what we trained in the course is we want
the scrum master BIA to be a facilitator
a facilitator leader a servant leader
but that means that the team has to be
functional you know if the if the
velocity of the team is like ten percent
or less of what it should be and the
team is not working then you just can't
let that go on forever so one of the
things that we see some of the best
scrum coaches are best scrum master so
you can watch what they do if you throw
them in you say hey you be the scrum
master for a while watch what they do
their personality will change depending
on what the where the team is so here
you get like the average team which is
about you know 50% of their capability
or less now when that team really Peaks
out at 100% we know that what that is
it's about 15 function points per
developer month
what's the scrum master doing there
nothing other than watching you know
watching it's like a high-performance
airplane watching that airplane and if
it starts to falter just coming in and
giving it a nudge because if you don't
watch it it can go in very fast so
in my view you need to empower the scrum
master to do what needs to be done and
work with them while always coaching
them to move with the team into a
facilitator mode servant leader mode and
as the team really spins up backing off
more and more with very subtle control
yeah I think Xiu Hari is a good example
in the shoe state the team are beginners
and it's like you go into study of
martial arts we had a karate expert in
my class and Amsterdam earlier this week
and I said what happens if you're a new
guy in the karate dojo and you don't do
what the master says and he says you get
hurt okay Scotty they don't miss a route
they just whack you yeah you know the
martial arts yeah they're a little more
flexible so that's the Xu state you need
to get the basic principles of scrum as
laid out in the scrum guide and in the
scrum primers that we've been talking
about implemented the facilitator is in
the hast eight as you practice martial
arts maybe you get a belt or two now
you're executing the movements well now
you can start developing your own style
in the Xu state and scrum you need to
you know you need to be you know you
want to establish a baseline velocity
you want have a clue you want to have a
clear definition of done and ready and
you want the team to be at a sustainable
pace and using the retrospective for
process improvement that's the baseline
most of the new teams I work with here
in Switzerland they don't even know
their velocity so they're not even in a
shoe state yet so if they were
practicing martial arts they get whacked
okay so a good scrum master will whack
them like we can't have this you know we
should you know we can't we can't be
messing around and unprofessional as
this to not even know what we're doing
okay it's a mental change and that takes
a long time it's not just applying
but I should actually if we go by the
rules and you'll start learning but yeah
I see I mean higher the original
question was about self-organizing I see
that in love people of here okay
yourself organizing that that mean we
can do whatever we like and they
actually take this scrum and try to roll
it back to what they had before so in
the ha state in scrum Don means-tested
integration testing ready means good
user stories I think in and the people
we had here today about over half of
them were doing scrum already none of
them had good user stories so that tells
you right away they have data that shows
velocity has at least doubled so the
these are really clear this is not
rocket science you can just ask them how
they user story is good they'll say no
well clearly you're in a beginner state
of the implementation with that
in the restate your velocity has
improved at least 400% and the value of
shock therapy is that in in in both
Scott Downey's experience who's the
co-author my experience and a CTO of a
Swedish company our experience is
universal well implemented shocks
therapy always get you over 400% and
always in less than ten sprints it's
guaranteed yeah well the idea came you
know came with shot was Scott dowdy at
MySpace which had all kinds of terrible
problems and eventually when they got
new management in they they they got a
waterfall CTO who banned scrum and then
of course the company spiral that their
I think they may exist but they only
have a few developers but what what
Scott found in that environment of an
agile team they had no idea what agile
meant they could argue for three weeks
about the format of a scrum board I mean
it made no sense so he said ok new team
that knows nothing about agile ok it's
like you're in the dojo for the first
time and here's the scrum board that's
the floor mat there's going to be no
arguments here's the daily meeting it's
no it's no more than 15 minutes and here
are the street questions and actually he
added a fourth question the question
that everybody has to answer is what did
you do to get the first story on the
scrum board done yesterday we don't want
to hear about anything else because
nothing else matters if that first one
is not done what are you going to do
everyone has to speak to get it done
today because the team perform
is going to depend on driving the top of
the board to testing as fast as possible
and systematically working that down and
so in the in the in the daily meeting
he'll let the team pull actually when he
starts off the first week he doesn't
even let them pull the story he might
ask him what story do you think you
should do and they start picking the
wrong we said no why is that the wrong
one he's kind of a Socratic questioner
that is absolutely the wrong one you
tell me why it's wrong and he'll just
work with the team and then he will pull
it himself after the discussion and this
all happens for the first week and they
hate him now in the first week if they
if they are starting to get the idea of
how it works
the next week he steps back and lets
them start pulling the story's still the
same questions and his goal is by the
third sprint they've at least doubled
velocity so by the third sprint they've
hit the ha state then he moves to
facilitate a mode so it's only rigid at
the beginning and Scott is a big bear
kind of friendly laughing guy but he
doesn't tolerate any nonsense and so
he's very good at getting this team
loaded up okay so you know might try it
see if it works for you what he's found
though is that he has never seen a scrum
master been able to get a ha to a ha
state in three weeks
if the scrum master did not put the team
first it's all about the team it's not
about the scrum master looking good it's
not about the scrum master getting
promoted
it's not about whatever their motivation
is it's all about the team being great
and and that you know it's just like
we showed a picture of the All Blacks
coach All Blacks rugby team you know and
he says for 25 years what gets me off is
the team is great so everything I do
every day is to figure out how to help
them you know win the Rugby World Cup
and I am only successful when they are
outstanding athletes and they feel that
and they will perform as a result so hmm
there are there are subtle personal
dynamics in team formation that great
scrum masters understand it's a personal
thing it's a personal integrity thing
yeah difficulties and problems and in
the end well in your specific case what
caused it not to work in the case you
are talking about where you're trying to
implement it didn't work what caused the
failure management yeah well I wouldn't
implement if management does not want to
improve the company by changing it's a
really bad idea to implement scrum
because you're gonna make everybody the
miserable the management is going to be
angry and the people are going to be
totally demotivated and depressed so you
would never want to implement scrum in
that environment so
see I say of course I work with a
venture group they say Jeff don't work
with any of these companies like that
our goal is to put them out of business
as fast as possible and you're just
prolonging their misery the market will
take care of them okay and it's getting
harder and harder to survive the global
speed is is accelerating so the markets
going to take care of all these managers
that don't want to improve that it's
going to be game over for them and what
I recommend I mean I remember my wife
implemented scrum in churches and I
would recommend this even in the church
and even stronger in an IT organization
when the management turns bad get out of
there
that church is going to fail you're
gonna wind up in an absolutely miserable
state you'll have trouble getting
another job because of what happened in
that place
get out of there while the getting is
good yeah my space is good example soon
as a band scrum everybody failed yeah
those that didn't have it on their CV
and they removed it for the CV yeah okay
that's we kick that off okay so I think
actually yes to some extent only and
this question is like in the action area
interaction design is a part of the team
is that clearly yes yes part of the team
more to add to that
prepares Marty Kagan Khan says that
product discovery team okay there's one
person like the relief engineer like the
lead engineer who has two hats he is
part of the engineering team
implementation team is also member of
the the product discovery team and well
you can extend that you have these two
teams but maybe you want it to be
everybody's job to discover good ideas
and maybe you can have like like
Facebook you can have hackathons by the
way everybody can just you know code
something in one night something cool
and then they can present it and Mark
Zuckerberg says oh yes let's do it
that becomes the next great thing
everybody can you see that on Google
they see more companies like everybody
they get some spare time at what time
but they can do whatever project they
like yeah okay let's cuz if then we're
done how to get out of scrum pot would
be the next one well you know why don't
you watched
okay that's okay well then I get the
last question good you want to talk
about that or got me didn't you go ahead
well for the last three years I've been
working with a scrum patterns community
to try to capture the magic of Mensch
making scrum teams work in patterns the
great thing about pattern is you can do
them or not to them
it's totally voluntary they're designed
to solve specific problems and they have
to have proven to have been worked at
leat in at least three different
companies and that they they are framed
with a context so in this kind of
situation this strategy is a good one
and they have to go through they have to
be workshopped
by experts we're all around us from all
over the world go through your pattern
and shred it and they may shred it
multiple times before it can be
published and it usually takes at least
a year sometimes two or three years to
get a pattern through the process so
this these things are really well
reviewed so I've been working on what
are the key points where the scrum
master can apply pressure slight
pressure and it causes the team to excel
so the first pattern that the team needs
to meet needs to work on is the teams
need to be stable if you don't have a
stable team it's very hard to get
anything done well team performance
pretends on teams learning how to work
together and if you're constantly
changing people on the team the
performance just stays low so that will
be the primary impediment of a scrum
master try to figure out how to fix that
and if you're in one of these companies
where the management wants to change the
entire team every sprint as there are I
know a big bank that did that the manage
thud scrum was great they could change
people at every sprint and I recommend
you get out of there you know there are
four hundred and twenty four thousand
open scrum jobs in the United States and
we hire people from all over the world
so there's plenty of jobs out there so
get a stable team now once you get a
stable team you need to get the the
sprint planning problem solved and you
need to the pattern that we want to use
is yesterday's weather I see so many
teams when they're starting off
struggling what to bring into the sprint
and then they bring in too much and they
fail and they could do that every sprint
for a year and that creates endless
misery the team is it's like a soccer
team that loses every single game for
the year it's just depressing
so the scrum master has to figure out
how to get the team to pull the right
stuff in and by simply implementing the
pattern called yesterday's weather as
part of the scrum process they can only
take what they did last spread or the
lat average of the last three sprints
into this sprint and it automatically
sets them up for success it
counterbalances to set them up for
success and that's not hard to do now
once they're into the spread then here
is a little more difficult situation
you've got to get the developers fixing
their bugs the same day they're found
there's a pattern called daily clean
code if you can do that then they'll get
to the end of the stories they work on
to the end of the Sprint will actually
work at the end they'll be done they
need to have been estimated in points
it's presumed that they're actually
doing some estimation they'll be done
and they'll have the number of points
done and they will have a velocity
yeah yeah there's three main types of
bugs one that are preexisting which need
to come in as stories really ones that
come in while you're in the sprint
customer went down and the ones that are
created by stories you're writing
there's these are the ones I'm talking
about the stories you're writing have
bugs it really means they're not defects
it's just not done so it needs to be
fixed right away and if you can do it in
less than a day
we know that the team gets a significant
acceleration well the velocity will
double if they're that fast at fixing
bugs and I don't have time to go through
all eight patterns that set up a scrum
master for success but there are these
simple patterns that are like pressure
points that in martial arts you know
I've seen martial arts experts that have
been working at it the casino at night
somebody gets up sets gonna start a
fight hitting somebody the bottle they
come up and they tap them on the
shoulder when the guy turns they pinch
them in the neck and the guy goes
unconscious okay so a good scrum master
sees the teas malfunctioning it just
says well we're just going to try
yesterday's weather a little pinch but
it has to be a forceful pinch you cannot
let them wiggle away from it okay you
have to make sure it happens but it's
just a pinch it's just a little thing
and then and then you start putting
pressure on fixing the bugs and and you
know you need to be like your ear across
between a caption and captain and a
coach you know I remember I've coached
many teams I remember a ski team okay
winning I had a champion ski team okay
so the team would will come down and I
would say well you know how did it go
today and they would say well it was
great I didn't fall down once
and I remember a day when the whole team
said that great day none of us fell down
once and I said that's horrible we're
gonna lose the championship nobody's
pushing themselves hard enough to fail
and figuring out how to get better and
so sometimes you have to be emotional as
a scrum master like things are like just
so upsetting you can't stand it and it
puts the team into enough of emotional
pain that they'll try to make you feel
better okay we'll fix we'll fix the bugs
today okay just calm down these daily
meetings are getting out of here no it's
kind of the the next step after shock
therapy you kind of move out of the
dictator stage but now they're reverting
so then you start to act a little crazy
like how could this be you know so all
of these things there are eight patterns
and I think and there's really simple to
understand and if a scrum master will
implement them they're guaranteed to
bust out a scrum butt and have a really
good team and in many cases a great team
so I think we really figured this out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
