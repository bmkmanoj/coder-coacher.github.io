after lunch so in the morning if I give
a talk I just fill it with as much
information as I can but after lunch
that's not fair because otherwise they
need to provide pillows and you put your
head on your neighbors shoulder and all
of that so there's a little bit of
interactiveness in this as some music
videos it's a it's a slower pace kind of
a thing we will of course cover shoe
hurry but what I want to do just in the
first five minutes is without giving you
any particular description more than the
word guest leadership guest leadership
is an interesting word because it
implies that the guests are the leaders
and this is interesting for many reasons
one of which is that they're at a party
there are 20 guests for one host in a
corporation there are 20 employees for
one manager so there are many more
guests than there are leaders is really
interesting to think if the guests take
the leadership moment and people take
leadership moments all the time you
could be on an airplane or a train and
there's somebody who's short and can't
put their thing in the overhead
compartment right and then if you're
tall enough for whatever you stand up
and you and you help the person put the
thing up that's that's a moment of
leadership when you step out of your
normal role into a moment of leadership
or to take that's a solo leadership
there's no followers but but you get out
of the the subway the metro of the thing
in in Paris right where there's lots of
steps and there's a and there's a mother
with with a stroller you know an infant
and with two suitcases and looking at
the steps right so maybe you stop and
you get somebody else on this two or
three of you and you help carry the
strollers up to the top of the steps you
carry the suitcases up to the top of the
steps so the person who does does that
is a leader for a moment yeah or it
could be you're having a party and and
maybe you notice that the the bread
needs slicing so you start slicing the
bread though you've run out of beer
typical thing in the US and you organize
a beer run okay let's make a beer run
okay who wants what you know and
somebody collects orders and then a
couple of you right that's a moment of
leadership in your neighborhood
somebody initiates a neighborhood
cleanup and I have to just say I find
that really disturbing to have the big
I'm sorry I'm very you think I'd be used
to cameras by now but I don't see any of
you all I see is this round thing
following me around everywhere and I
can't even think of the next sentence
there was one place it was really cool
the guy was trying to be surreptitious
sneaky and all I know I'm talking and I
see the camera poking out from behind
here and the camera poking out from
behind here he's lying down in the
alleyway and poking cameras at me like
that
it's all I saw the whole time so I'm I'm
sorry you take the pictures you need to
but just don't stand in the middle there
else these guys won't get any lecture at
all wasn't refined um neighborhood
cleanup somebody decides that you're
gonna have a block party or a cleanup
party or something like that and so
that's moments of leadership that from
somebody who's not designated as a
leader so people step out of whatever
their daily life is or their job
description is and take a moment where
they're the leader for a few minutes
hours whatever and then they go back to
being themselves so what I'd like to you
guys to do is to turn to a neighbor you
can get in groups of two or if you like
you can get in groups of three and just
for a few minutes I'll give you three
four minutes see if you can name think
of sometimes when you stepped forward
what was it at that moment such that you
decided okay I'll step forward I'll take
this one I'm gonna do this look at that
and if you have time maybe look at a
similar situation where you decided not
to so what's interesting is to try to
work out why is it we step forward what
what triggered us at that moment to say
yeah I'm taking that one and maybe in a
similar moment I'm not taking that one
go ahead and discuss that with your
neighbors see where you get to in a
couple of minutes I will revisit this at
the end
yeah that's one way to stop it
so bianca is going to be so kind and and
run up and down a little bit there's
only one of her and she doesn't have her
track she does have track she's on just
just to hear what some of the things are
the thing that triggered you so could we
just get a hand up or two somewhere
close to the aisle maybe so she can get
you the mic yeah we'd have over here
somebody so would like step up when we
want something really badly to happen
but like we know nobody's gonna do
anything then which is like okay that's
one let's hear another one let's see if
we can get I'll take the other one them
the other day I asked a few kids to move
the place where they were playing
because I thought they were that's a
good reason for me to step up okay right
down here yeah make a run people in the
back raise your hand make a run yeah so
women and image two handles it if a some
circle person stand looking on something
and cannot decide if to or not to do
something it's pressure growing up with
with the time so it is pressure applies
to each of these time pressure if
there's time pressure and we also we all
think okay because do this and at some
point this pressure just breaks the
resistance of each person thank you
let's find another one somebody else you
guys are all talking so maybe you have
anything I don't know maybe you just had
a nice talk which is also fine I think
besides rational reasons there's a very
strong emotional reason it's small as a
decision from the German we say from the
stomach I don't know it's a correct
translation in English and it highly
depends on your current situation
sometimes you feel like supporting other
people or helping
so my question that's not very general
my only question is yes it's from the
stomach it depends we got all of that
what is the thing that you can recall
that you decided to do something pick
one instance where you did decide to go
and try to work out what was it in that
moment that you said yeah I'm taking
that one okay because I wanted to
support some people and I was breathing
I could help them and I want to do some
thank you myself beautiful I wanted to
support some people we had a hand right
here the microphone is staying down here
so uh I think typically we assess the
risks and I don't generalize right don't
like are we in the nature of human kind
no just give me one for you for you what
made you choose to go forward at some
moment well sometimes I make a
suggestion and I think it's a it's a
good initiative because this is very
likely to succeed so if that goes wrong
I won't be your failure likely to
succeed so you're more likely to step up
if you think you might succeed
yeah I'm sure and we have let's take one
or two more let's see we have one right
there on the left yeah to me it's not
only a factor of that I feel that it's
the best thing to do but it's also when
I feel that other people are ready for
me to do it so to say so I kind of sense
what's going on and I think okay this is
the right thing to do when you sense
that other people are ready for you to
do it I won't just take one more this
there's a man with the hand right over
here yeah the actual example is that I
stepped up to start recording individual
at my company to help the other guys
learn the basic skills for so my
questions for you you created a coding
dojo you could have not done that and at
that moment you decided to do it and in
both cases you want the people to learn
this coding dojo thing can you recall at
the moment that you just go yeah you
know it's gonna take some personal time
of mine but yeah I'm going to do it what
tipped you over the edge right there
motivations like management or
appreciating my job and also me learning
by that so okay good thank you so just
just take this back now we do these
things that are in scrum were called
retrospectives
I don't call them retrospective as I
call them reflection workshops
retrospective as implies looking
backwards I'm not really interested in
looking backwards and looking forwards
kind of a guy but if we generalize this
concept of retrospective for a moment
it's - this reflection workshop there's
a moment in time when you have maybe an
hour and you're not coding or designing
or testing or whatever you normally do
you're all together as a team and you
can use this time together to do
interesting things to learn about each
other and make the working together work
better and so this is one of the kinds
of questions you could you could float
in one of these sessions hey you know I
heard about this thing guest leadership
what causes people to step forward and
take initiative and just float that
question and what causes them to not so
I'm doing this in all of my advanced
agile classes I do this in various
workshops I'm trying to understand this
thing creating a culture where people
feel safe feel inclined to take
initiative for things now imagine if
everybody in your neighborhood or
everybody in your family or everybody in
your company was doing this you can
imagine that things are going to go a
lot faster so this idea of guest
leadership is something we find in the
more successful companies okay so that's
just a placeholder that's a marker and
now you're going to get the the
irrevocable shoe hari discussion and the
heart of agile so if we could step
forward the reason for doing this heart
of agile I was called on by my colleague
to really like solidify this concept a
couple of years ago is that agile has
just become too complicated and scrum
has got all these rules
and there are no matter what you do
everywhere you look there's the rules of
agile and it wasn't ever intended to be
that way you know it was very
complicated software development was
very complicated in the 90s and then and
then around 2000 you know Bob Martin
who's sitting right here called a
meeting and said and said I think that
we've got something in common let's talk
about it and we really we simplified it
down to basically four statements four
values of the manifesto and then they
got complicated again so I'm here to
make it super simple again I claim all
you need are these four words this is
this is the collaborate deliver reflect
improve methodology my intention is to
make it so short that you can't not see
it there's an ad in the u.s. from GEICO
insurance I love this it's a YouTube ad
they have this little you know lizard
that goes around so I click on this
thing in YouTube and and I can see it
says Geico right and it shows this
family coming to sit around a table and
I'm looking how you find that skip ad
button and it goes 4 3 2 1 like this and
I'm not seeing the skip ad button I'm
looking for the skip ad button and then
I see a little sign on the screen it
says this ad is so short you can't skip
it right so the ads four seconds long
I've brilliant everybody should make a 4
second ad right then you have you can't
you know did you just get put put it
right there so this is my methodology
that's so simple you can't skip it you
already have been inflicted with it it's
four words all you have to do I claim
all you have to do is collaborate you
collaborate to deliver collaborate get
your ideas together the delivery gives
you feedback then you reflect most of us
don't reflect very well but okay when
you reflect and then you improve so you
collaborate to deliver you select to
improve now in a sense you collaborate
you reflect on the collaboration and you
improve the collaboration you deliver
you reflect on the delivery you improve
the delivery there's a couple of loops
in there right but that's it right you
can't skip it collaborate deliver
reflect improve I can't make it any
simpler
than this this is the simplest like so I
had to talk about that the origin of
that the implications of that and end up
back in guess leadership and allegedly I
have a clicker let's see if I can make
this thing work
so I I had it was a certified scrum
master in 2008 and basically Ken
Schreiber and his crew said do you know
enough about scrum and you know I passed
that test and they said well do you know
how to teach and I passed that test so
well if you know how to scrum and you
know how to teach go teach so I was a
certified scrum trainer then I let it
lapse and then when I wanted it back
again at some point it said I need to
get that back again there were a hundred
and four learning objectives so they
sent me a spreadsheet with a hundred and
four learning objectives and you had I
had to answer for every learning
objective on what slide or in which
exercise was this learning objective
delivered right 104 learning objectives
in two days is like one every five
minutes or something like I don't even
know how to do that I mean I do that
because I'm a certified scrum training
about how my point being scrum is not
supposed to be that complicated there's
a thing I have on my I won't go through
it right now I do it in my classes scrum
on a post-it note scrum is real get to
Ari in a minute scrum is defined in five
sentences you don't need more than five
sentences and I hope they turn all the
cameras off just for a moment I'm going
to tell you a little secret you can pass
the certified scrum master test just
from my five sentences right so in my
CSM classes I'd give the five sentences
in principle they could take the exam
right then it doesn't matter I have to
go through one hundred and four learning
objectives I'm a good citizen and all of
that stuff my point being it doesn't
have to be that complicated and people
are arguing they feel straitjacketed by
the scrum thing scrum is so loose it
gives you so much space and so much
freedom we shouldn't be here but we're
here and I know why and we discuss it
and all the rest but that's it
now the antidote I just discovered is if
you go here scrum certification $29
cheap certification free book become
certified in one hour 100% pass rate or
refund I don't even know who these
people are but how can you turn down a
like that if you want your cert just go
get it so on the one side we've got like
too much and the other side we've got
too little
what we're trying to find is a space
where we can function and that's gonna
give me my my lecture here's the Shu
Hari part so many people have heard of
it but haven't like gone gone through it
so I'm gonna go through it very slowly
with some videos just to like you know
it's after lunch and I made this up a
little bit and I'm going to take diving
as as my example so shoe coms from the
Shu Hari thing comes from Aikido
Japanese Aikido and they got it from
Japanese theater you know in the 1700s
and stuff like that and the words mean
shoe means follow ha means break and
read means leave the idea here is when
you go to a dojo and I don't do Aikido
so I'm gonna use karate moves like I
don't know my Aikido stuff but I have
taken some Taekwondo so anyway you go to
a Thai con dojo dojo and you walk in and
the master is going all that stuff right
you don't ask at that point excuse me
what if the person's taller than you
what am I supposed to do then now you
copy the master you follow the master
you don't you don't ask any questions
you don't make any changes you just try
to copy now this it turns out is general
skills acquisition level one whenever
you start a new skill you say how do I
do that and the person says well you do
this not that my very first split a be
testing I don't know how to split a be
testing I'm gonna say how do I do that
my very first paper prototyping session
I don't know how to do paper prototyping
I'm gonna say how do I do that right my
very first TDD whatever right so you
come in this doorway mark shoe and you
say how do I do that and someone tells
you this thing and then you copy it
right your first time making bread
pastry right whatever it is that you're
cooking with you say howdy and you get
the recipe and you copy it that's normal
that's normal and that's you
rhymes with shoe like a shoe so we make
fun of the you know we make puns in
English with the word shoe so I the one
I use is the word of a shoe box so that
people learn a shoe level technique they
fall in love with it
they're never ever going to change it
and they make a little nest in the
shoebox and they never leave the shoebox
they're boxed in by the shoe technique
okay I'm just going to illustrate it
right here let's just say there's two
ways two basic ways to tie shoelaces and
I'm looking around and a lot of people
have shoelaces still two basic ways to
tie shoelaces one of them you make a
loop and then you sort of let go around
the tree and down the hole right and
pull it through how many people tie
their shoes that way around the tree
interesting the other dominant way is
you make a loop and then you make
another loop so you tie a half knot and
then you make two loops and you tie
another half knot how many people do the
the two bunny ears method as it's called
and a lot of people are not admitting
anything that's fair enough that's okay
that's okay
now here's the next question those of
you who do round the tree and through
the hole how many have never tried the
two bunny ear method fess up more hands
that went up you know even for doing it
okay let's just reverse it those of you
who do the bunny ears how many of you
have never tried the round the whole
ground the tree down the hole ah I see
we have some homework for tonight or in
a break I love it like find the person
who does the other kind of shoelace
tying and trade shoelace tying it's fun
okay so we're illustrating the the
tyranny of the shoe box right you
learned one way to tie a shoelace and
you go I'm done I never need to know
another one
so that's shoe and and here I have a
picture of us this kid and he's gonna
dive and you know we teach kids how to
dive and we say you get to the end of
the board and you bend over you get all
us things so if they'll only do that
they'll just fall forward and dive and
be safe right of course when I do this
the kids always get scared they
straighten up they get on the water like
this they go no no no no but anyway we
teach them a shoe level technique for
diving
does anybody dive like this in the
Olympics do they have they lean forward
and fall into the water event in the
Olympics I scan the Internet I could not
find any examples of professional divers
no nobody dives like this right
even kids like the second day they're
not gonna do that a third day right
they're done with that so Shu level
techniques have got their limitations
right you get comfy new shoe box but in
fact the whole point of a shoe level is
to be broadly applicable broadly
applicable means sub-optimal it's not
likely to be optimal in any one
circumstance but it's generally
applicable okay that's you I don't have
more to say about you at this moment
we'll go on to the next level the next
level is ha ha means means a break so
that's when you when you break away from
the one technique and in a general
skills acquisition context it would be
collect techniques so Shu means learn
one technique collect means hot means
collect techniques so looking for an
example for this and diving and I was in
New Zealand and I went to the home with
a bungee jump the coup or Y bridge or
whatever it's called and and I did this
and I said okay that's a good example of
ha and by the way I still get vertigo
when I look at this picture because I I
know what that how far down that boat is
down at the bottom we have a video on
this and we've got an operator at the
back whose name of I've forgotten
forgotten and if you could start the
first one and he's going to maximize it
and we'll let it run for a bit
the kawaru bridge so this thing look at
this it's 43 meters up it's been there
for 30 years this is the home a bungee
jump so you go out there that's really
scary you sign a toe tag when you go in
they give you a toe tag to fill out
that's what did put on your corpse so I
asked these guys and I said hey can I do
a back dive no can I do a flip no can I
do a twist no can you backflip no what
can I do
just dive so I just had my REIT a -
you'll see I just barely had gotten my
REIT a - you know a little bit before so
you'll see that so I'm thinking about
this and going ok I have a selection of
techniques that I can choose from I'll
pick one from my library of techniques
so I just chose this one yeah
can you do that kinda let you do
anything so I'll just do that and if you
try to touch the water they put the
stronger bands on me so I couldn't touch
too long and I'm just going to let this
run for a minute just to see so you can
see the technology they use to bring you
back after 30 years they have this
rickety wooden staircase and a rope and
a yellow raft and they and they they put
the raft down and then they pull the
rope back up so it's just kind of fun
there they are after 30 years there's
the rickety steps there's the yellow
raft there's me doing situps because you
know if you're type-a obsessed and
you're hanging upside down from a rope
or am I supposed to do with my time now
all set up so I guess I'll do sit ups
sit up sit ups yeah then you grab the
pole and you go down the pole and into
the boat it's very weird all right so
that's thank you very much for the video
can we go back to the presentation then
good deal so that's ha so you collect
techniques now the the next stage if you
get there
if and when you get to the next stage
its when you leave the dojo r-e means
leave you leave the dojo you're done
with the you're done with the the master
this is the level when you know
something so well you don't think about
it it's automatic and you do something
different every time it's a full-body
experience right you can't say what you
did there's no time to think everything
everything's moving at one time you
might call this unconscious competence
it's just it's just a happening thing
any of you who do cooking you know what
whatever you're cooking specialty is you
know you just do it you look at
ingredients right when you ask somebody
who's a real level cook and you say oh
this is really tasty what did you put in
it and they go I don't know whatever was
in the kitchen they give you terrible
instructions and when you cook then if
you made candies are particularly
terrible because they you stir this
thing the sugary mess to make some candy
or fudge and you stir till it gets a
particular level of thickness which is
till it's hard to stir
and the surface is glossy I don't know
what that means
what is glossy me what does Harvester
mean and and it's useless because you
one of these people says well you add
something to taste right stir till it
looks good
that's real level people they can't do
it because because they're in a full
body experience all the moment every
moment they're doing something different
so here's the thing re is the opposite
its antagonistic to Shu Shu says give me
one technique that's broadly applicable
and I'm just gonna copy it it might be
suboptimal but I'm just I'm in safeSpace
Rhee is I'm gonna do something different
depending on very tiny cues from the
environment it'll be always optimal for
the moment and I'm gonna give you a
methodology example of this just to like
bring it back to software for a minute I
was in nakiye and you know the good old
days and they had some UI designers in
Helsinki they had a scrum team in
Beijing and they said the problem is
alastair that we can't the the the
Beijing team won't make a sprint
commitment because the UI designers keep
changing the spec every all the time and
I said that's okay there's a technique
it's called pipelining it's like a mini
waterfall thing but the official name is
pipelining the UI designers do their
work you know for two weeks and then
they freeze their design the ship at the
Beijing the people in Beijing they've
got like a frozen spec they say what
they can do in two weeks nothing changes
it's good and then after two weeks they
get the update to the spec and you just
keep repeating that you know it's not
the most optimal thing in the world but
it works and it's called pipelining and
you can do it and they said yeah but we
sent the the the designers to Beijing
and they didn't have any trouble keeping
up and I said well of course not that's
completely different that's how read
people speak - well that's completely
different
right because the there is a
conversation every day in the office in
the hallway and and the Beijing
programmers the Chinese programmers here
the UI designers saying talking about
the changes they're gonna make it's in
the conversation and they're integrating
it all the time
and finally the you ideas
say okay let's go with this right so the
Chinese programmers have been in the
conversation I like that you saw and
they just change it it's not a big deal
that's very different compared to when
the evil overlords in Finland have
changed the spec again right you come to
work and the evil overlords in Finland
have changed the spec again I hate them
right so I said look you run two
strategies when you're UI designers are
in Beijing you do a fully concurrent
strategy and when they're in Helsinki
you use a pipeline strategy there is two
strategies but you see that these two
strategies are exact opposites of each
other and this is the same people the
same company the same problem the same
domain the same month all we did was to
move two heads from here to here and we
run the opposite strategy so that's read
right you're just like wow I'll just do
this or do this or make something up
right in the city in the moment really
level people make stuff up in the moment
and then you go like what was that
and then they tried to tell you and then
a technique is born and then it becomes
process and then it becomes Dogma and
then it goes on my scrum list of things
I have to teach right and then you guys
all feel shackled I hate scrum because
it makes me do ask these three questions
Ken Schreiber when 2008 I co-taught with
Ken Schreiber to see how he taught and
he said I'm so sorry I wrote down those
three questions if I had to answer those
three questions for the rest of my life
I would just get out of the business
right but he's being out for people say
what are we supposed to do oh there are
these three questions try these three
questions
so the real 'evil scrum is very loose
like heart of agile collaborate deliver
reflect improve that pretty much sums up
scrum - right but the people what am I
supposed to do and then how it gets
hardening of the arteries so we're gonna
get a video now if we can pull up the
video this is the cliff in a nice at the
end of the the street in these I love
this cliff it's my favorite place and I
go there and I do one or two dives a
year there's a sign up top that says
diving forbidden for very obvious
reasons like you'll kill yourself
and you'll see of course all of the kids
up there diving off there anyway so just
a little note the first time I was there
and and I was looking at this thing and
it's about seven or eight meters up and
you have to go out seven or eight meters
and you have to clear the rocks and lay
into the right spot and stuff like that
and so I was thinking about this and I
asked this kid I said you know can you
jump off so I can see how you do that it
takes a running jump and jumps off look
at that and the guy next to me French
guy says to me that's not for people our
age and I thought to myself that's not
for people your age so here's the video
this is the second time I ever did it
and it's rewrite you only get one try at
this you only get one try there's no
safety net there's no I lived my little
sister hates and there the flip flops
the flip flops come off can we run this
backwards please so that the guy back
there has been practicing and we're
gonna run a backwards just so I can
single step I love that one more pause
right there
thank you so here's the thing I look at
this video and it's trying to figure out
what's happening so at the moment of
takeoff horizontal distance is a given
right there's nothing you can do about
horizontal distance at this moment in
time turns out the only thing you can
change is your speed of rotation and
this goes so fast obviously there's no
conscious brain happening in this this
is like the body just does stuff this is
really read can we single step a little
bit here and so you'll see I'll bend my
body position here one more I love this
one that looks like it just fell out of
a balloon right there and then like so
and I'm going yeah is it good enough and
then keep going and then and then now
it's not good enough more rotation more
rotation stuff stuff stuff thing good
it's good boom and now it works out
right so it works out so that's read
right you couldn't you can't teach that
you can't write you just you do it or
you don't do it thank you for that we'll
go back to the slide show just another
example of read that one that I one that
I like my son was about was about 12
years old and
and so I was having him make bread bread
is good because the kids can pound it
you want the gluten to come out say he's
there and he's slamming and pounding
this thing like this and I call up my
wife and my wife was driving across town
you know you know one of those suburban
mom vans soccer mom vans right so she's
on the highway and I call her up and I
say what temperature do I set it to and
she says it needs more water
how good is that so she could hear the
sound of the dough hitting the counter
in the background while she's driving
and she says it needs more water so I
listen to bid and you can actually hear
the difference I go okay got it now you
know what temperature I said the water
to that's read right sorry and shoot our
opposites they're antagonistic you're
always gonna have people coming in new
they're always gonna need a shoe level
technique right have one handy give it
to them and then and then after a while
kick them out of the shoe box right
again and you need some real levels
you're doing like you know globally
competitive initiatives you can't be
running everything off of shoe level
techniques that's you re so Rhee is the
top of the performance curve right
things get more complicated you get
better they get complicated you get
better and I love that the chat that the
Japanese characters mirror this
complexity as you go from shoe to how to
read so so I'm going to show you kokoro
next but people think that if there's a
fourth thing it's better and it's not
it's different but I wanted to stay
inside the Japanese tradition if I could
just for fun and see how you do that and
I found this word Kokoro Kokoro a means
heart or essence and that's why I talk
about the heart of agile it's the heart
of the essence and the people who are
teachers who've been in the business for
a long time look for ways to simplify
things down so Ria's a performance level
kokoro is a teaching level now have you
guys seen the Karate Kid movie the
original one the original ratio had just
I get good cuz one day my audience is
going to be so young none of them will
have seen it so you guys have all just
aged to find yourself because even if
you saw it on a rerun you still thought
it worth seeing all right so mr. Miyagi
right wax on wax off paint the fence wax
on wax off paint the fence this is a
Kokura level teacher they're really
annoying because all they ever say is
master the basics yes but what if the
wind is blowing the sleet and there's a
tree by just master the basics any of
these taller than me and has a knife
just mastered the basics right really
annoying people so this is what I'm
doing there
all you need is four words collaborate
if you just collaborate better it'll go
better you know that deliver less sooner
and learn learn to reflect that's that's
kind of a mystery for many people and
then have many small improvements many
small small improvements all the time so
those are the basics if you just do that
then if I've got this one here one
second I'll come back to the the video
in just a moment what happens is there's
a second doorway in so I'm trying to
create a second doorway into a gel that
doesn't require a hundred and four
learning objectives I claim that in your
organization you know if you're
collaborating or not you know darn well
if you color you know what level on a
scale of one to ten how are you
collaborating how's the collaboration in
your team most people say seven or eight
how's the collaboration between your
team and other groups in the company
most people say three or four do you
actually know what it is you could do
unilaterally on your own to improve
collaboration of course you do right
there's no mystery we're adults we know
this stuff so this is Kokoro just
collaborate better I don't care what
you're using for a framework or a
strategy or a method just collaborate
better deliver less sooner and more
often to learn better reflect and
improve that's it
now to get the video for this I looked
around let's see if I can get this to
happen can we have the video number
three please so this is the same cliff a
couple of years later and the thing
about this is just there's no motion in
the dive there's none of that wiggling
so we'll just go ahead and look it's in
slow-mo which is nice and there's
nothing right
nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing
nothing nothing and the super cool is I
actually had a police officer video for
this for me hahahaha because it was
supposed to be illegal and I tried to
show it to his boss and his boss said
it's not allowed to dive off of there
and I said it's okay I don't need to
dive anymore I have to
you now so I've done with diving alright
good let's go back to the slide show so
that's you hurry and conquer all and
what I'm after is something so simple
that anybody can do it it gives you
freedom you don't have to have the daily
stand up you don't have to ask the three
questions you have to do something that
covers the dangers right however you do
it don't worry about it just improve the
collaboration improve the delivery
reflect and improve so that's that
so now I was asking myself the question
is this it I'm gonna go around the world
for the next five years and self
forwards and the answer by the way is
yes and and then it's but is it more and
the answer is there's actually more and
I've tried to make mind maps of this and
everything fits inside of this so in the
in 2015 if this had been 2015 you would
have all had a piece of paper on your
chair and we would have spent the first
five minutes of the keynote tearing it
up and making this little folding device
that has the heart of a gel in it and we
would play with it and so on so that's a
way of making a mind map is to expand it
and in that expansion I'm just gonna
show you it expands out a lot so inside
of the collaborate you've got the actual
act of collaboration I've got
collaboration cards that have a shoe
level technique from proving
collaboration you have to discuss trust
what increases in decreasing trust you
have to discuss motivation which brings
you to rewards which brings you the
executive bonuses being conflicting
rewards and how that affects
collaboration right all of that's in
collaboration from deliver you get all
the internal aspects of delivery that's
all the lean Kanban stuff so more or
less lean Kanban university fits in that
thing internal flow and you get
bottleneck stations and work in progress
and queues and hard whip limits and and
all of that kind of stuff right that's
all in the internal flow I'm more
interested these days in the external
you deliver for income we have staged
delivery incremental funding all of that
kind of stuff but that but the frontier
in the last couple of years is
delivering for learning delivering for
learning and I don't think I have time
to go through that in this particular
lecture but it shows up these slides by
the way around my website you go to my
website and you just look for the
latest because the title of this is
heart of agile , latest so if I make
changes I just always have the same URL
so just go find the latest talk and
you'll find the expansions with
disciplined learning and lean production
and lots of stuff right so this expands
out we're bringing in solutions focus
psychotherapy and coaching from the from
the psychology world we're bringing in
lots of new things and they find
interesting ways of slotting into this
these four words what I want to do you
know in sort of like four or five
minutes that we have is just a just a
flip through and I'm going to go through
it super quickly so you can see the
existence of these things just to get to
the one that I want to mention before
the end of my time here so there's
internal flow and and the aha this is
all written up in my book from 2006 so
it's like really old stuff design looks
like manufacturing if the unit of
internal inventory is the unvalidated
decision the fact that your VP of
product management or marketing has
decided that twenty to thirty year olds
who use snapchat for three hours a day
is the target market that is an
unvalidated decision you don't know if
it's true or false it could be that it's
14 to 17 year-olds yeah that's a very
different proposition because they're
underage so this is a hypothesis you
need to validate so this brings us to
hypothesis based development very 2015
16 17 topic everybody's waiting on
everybody you get these bottlenecks you
study the bottlenecks you apply all your
your lean stuff you make the bottleneck
smaller you balance the workflow there's
a long discussion it's very interesting
but that's not for today there's the
revenue one and we have a funding model
where you look at money being spent how
early can you make a delivery to start
getting a sense of self funding project
so early early income you could do that
but that's not for today
this one is deliver for learning so that
normally so what we're looking for is
lots of little
lots of little coat checks in lots of
little deliveries lots of it little
interactions to get the feedback this is
the delivery part we're trying to learn
we're trying to learn about what
business should we be in I know we
thought we were in that business but
what business should we be in social
learning how do we have the right people
and what does it take for them to learn
to work together technical stuff loading
performance compatibility all that stuff
and cost and schedule how big is this
problem how much are we gonna burn
before we get somewhere right so learn
early learn off and these types of
things I like this one this one I I'll
read this one that lab for you guys it
came off of Twitter I did a screen
snapshot and later I went and found out
who had run who had done this but I'm
gonna read it to you it's Pizza Delivery
and here's a text message to Brian from
the pizza house and the Brian and it
says Brian your next automated pizza
delivery is scheduled for Saturday
February 25th at 12:00 p.m. to confirm
text yes to decline text no takes help
for help and Brian the bastard writes
back thank you Papa John you handsome
man I shall call you the carbs vixen and
the response comes back we're sorry we
didn't understand please confirm or
decline and Brian the bastard writes
back when I make love I imagine you
tossing some dough shirtless and the
response comes back dude our automated
system isn't set up yet this is a real
person texting you I make minimum wage
please just tell me if you want that
pizza Brian's a genius but he's also a
bastard so that's this thing about
learning about business right they're
debugging so in the lean startup world
it looks expensive to have programmers
coding stuff up AAI system did you just
hire somebody and debug this kind of
nonsense right so programming and
delivering programs looks more expensive
for validating hypotheses than just
hiring you know part-time workers in the
collaboration of area
I've got these collaboration cards that
are the shoe level of things that you
can do to enhance collaboration you can
get them from either online or by
request or something and we used them in
my advanced agile class but the one that
I want to go after just with my
remaining like minute or two is this
this thing about motivation and where
I'm going to hear my clicker works is
one of my favorite cos anywhere in the
world is Neil nickel iesson Salt Lake
City it's been CIO CTO for decades and
he has this this - bitey that he draws
and I can't understand - bye - so I made
like two islands with a bridge between
them so I could understand and he said
in many places there's a command and
control culture in which there's not
much trust and not much ownership and
what we want for innovation is we have a
lot of trust and a lot of ownership and
when you hear the word ownership you
might also hear guest leadership right
this is a little bit where we're going
now in sociology there's a thing they
call Theory X and Theory Y Theory X is
autocratic leadership Theory Y would
match a little bit to guess leadership
but in the Theory X it comes from the
olden days in the 1890s and the 1920s
and you know people the assumption was
that workers are lazy and you have to
kick them to make them work and if
someone's shoveling coal and you'd go
behind them and you're faster faster you
know the muscles contract and they get
and they go faster but if you're doing
mental work it's not true so the idea of
theory why is that people are
fundamentally motivated and mostly you
just have to give them a space so they
can do the thing they've generally
motivated to do this is a theory from
the 1970s and it happens to fit creative
work because if you're designing you
know a UI or a framework or whatever
you're trying to do and some of your
manager comes by and goes faster faster
behind you right you freeze up in
lightful that's the end of that so I
call this push and pull just short words
right push model it's Theory X pole is
where you create a space and then people
pull
who's doing the pulling right it's not
that the manager pulls the workers know
the workers pull something right so it's
a push versus pull now here's a little
thought experiment if you look at a
corporation especially publicly-traded
ones Wall Street and the stock market
are fundamentally merciless they don't
care if everybody in the company has
ulcers and gets divorced and whatever
else they just want to know that the
share price is going up and dividends
are happening it's all they care about
so it's very push model so that the CEO
and the board of directors of them
become they're getting pushed on ok
that's a river Keable so that's Theory X
push control domination discussion down
below we're trying to create something
with theory why with pull with
permissions with freedom and stuff like
that and that means somebody has to be
the umbrella that converts a push into
pull and we have that in our language we
talk about this manager created shade
for us acted as the heat shield right
protected us we have all these language
for these poor people so that's a
fundamental thing that we're looking for
if you're a manager what is the role of
a manager well one of them is to be the
push to pull umbrella and it's a pretty
thankless job quite honestly because if
you do your job perfectly the people
below by definition can never see that
the pressure you're taking from above
right so all of you have been in that
position so those of you who've got a
boss who gives you some protective
shelter and some quiet space like you're
really thankful for that because that's
not that's a hard job but anyway that's
the that's the push to pull umbrella and
it gets me slowly to the guest
leadership question and I just have here
this thing of I have three kinds of
leaders basically I've been studying
this leadership thing for about ten
years it's beginning to make sense I'll
just call it leader one two and three
they don't have meaning they just like
tags the leader one is your basic what
we think of as a leader the purpose of a
leader one is to say that away right
that's the assignment that's the skill
the talent of a leader one is to go is
to indicate the direction and to get you
in that direct
right that's a leader one leader too is
a host and there's a lovely book out
called host and it's actually for more
like managers because the host at a
party's job is to check the environment
make sure the food the right people are
invited the conversations are going well
generally not to intervene too much but
intervene enough that that the people
are doing well by themselves well that's
a perfect description for a line manager
or a project manager or something is
their job is to see that the people who
are doing all the work have what's
needed the motivation the skill the
whatever so they can do the thing that
they're hired to do which is you know
create whatever and then there's this
leader 3 which is the momentary leader
by somebody who's not officially in a
leadership position who as you can
imagine now that starts to fit the
theory why the pole culture that people
see something needs attention like we
have a build machine we have dojos we've
got all these kinds of things who set up
your first continuous build machine and
why that was a moment of guest guest
leadership so the question on my mind
the one that I was checking at the
beginning is just for us to start
thinking about how do we set up cultures
for that how do we morph cultures entice
entice through poll how do we tent ice
more of this gift leadership thing so at
the end just to close this down you know
you can expand this out it's not the
punchline the punchline is not that it's
complicated everything's complicated the
punchline is that it's simple all you
really have to do is hang on these four
words collaborate deliver reflect and
proof and I'm out of time thank you very
much
