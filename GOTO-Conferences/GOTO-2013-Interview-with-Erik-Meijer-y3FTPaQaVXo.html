you are my pleasure I'm Dave Thomas it's
my pleasure to be here with Eric Myers
just given a wonderful keynote and
actors in the cloud as well as some
great inspiration about careers for new
grasshoppers so good to see you Erin and
if this a long time ago that we did ya
get together I guess that's good yeah so
I think the exciting news for those who
you might recognize is closed but this
is actually the outfit for Eric and is a
next life he's now down his own startup
called applied duality and this is
really exciting and because say I've
been about the sorts of things you're
doing and why do all these yeah
definitely so yes 0 and s Dave sensonic
mpo I'm trying to start a thing and
applied to ality is the name sense i'm
trying to apply all the techniques that
i developed in my canopy of career so
far which all have to do with duality
and to solve developers problems in
particular and what I'm focusing on is
real-time streaming big data so that's
kind of the reactive framework and
trying to make that into an enterprise
great product so maybe you can just
update us what I don't think a lot of
people realize that the reactive
framework has moved out of Microsoft
thanks to the Microsoft the open-source
efforts and the contributions from
people like Netflix and so on what's
kind of the state of the reactive
framework in terms of the open source
world yeah so shall we open sourced them
RX in december last year so december
2012 last year's
relative and about that same time and
you know the netflix folks started to
implement their version for java and
that project is incredible if you look
at the amount of full requests and
contributions that go into the and the
netflix version and the donate version
what people often don't realize is that
code has been under development since
2007 so it's incredibly mature code it
has shipped on the Windows Phone if you
have a window showing it in there and so
and the code has also been rewritten to
be super optimized so that code based
that you see for the donuts version and
it's kind of stable I don't expect you
know that we're going to do a lot of
kind of additional development in there
but the reason that we made it open
sources to make sure that other
implementations like in the Java want
for netflix or the javascript one remain
compatible because the whole value that
you get from our x is that if you have a
client and server that both have you
know deal with asynchronous events
streams that the operations are
semantically profitable and so if your
servers written in java your client is
in javascript you want to have events
dreams you know you want to be able to
partition the processing of your events
trees you know across the boundaries and
so that's the kind of main goal is to
make sure that all the implementations
and different languages are following
the same protocol the same semantics and
so to that that's on the semantics and
what we also want and I learned quite a
lot about that when we did the
JavaScript version is that you want the
API itself to feel native to the
language so for example in JavaScript
there's already map and filter on array
so
set of coming up with new games like
select and select many and where you
want to reuse the same names and in Java
since Java doesn't have extension
methods there you know the way to a guy
structured is quite different because
now you cannot do it interface based so
you have to do to make different design
choices that feel good for Jonathan but
the underlying you know semantics is
maintained no this is applied to the
word format as well that's a very good
question so I'm hoping to avoid the kind
of going to low level to the wire format
and and the reason is that I look at our
X really as an interface and then you
know there's an underlying
implementation and if you if you push
the wire format in if you standardize
the wire from it so since you're kind of
you're not defining an interface you're
defining a concrete implementation and
let me give you an example I've been
working on a binding for lovely which is
it and login form and they have their
own API they have their own format of
how to kind of you have sent your events
as JSON objects with a certain shape and
if you push the wire format to too far
down then it becomes hard to going to be
a blue these things together so and
maybe I'm naive but I do think that you
know it's better to kind of do not go to
that level and where and then say you
know you impose the RX interface you
know it's more on the behavior level and
whatever transport or whatever wire
format you want and you think yeah I
can't imagine someone you know reading
massive amounts of syslog records with
RX once I have them all transform to
some other formats yes because of the
other costs of doing that yes yes for
the benefit is yeah and you see this
often with with other protocols where
you know they have to define a common
type system and so on and we're really
you know in some sense you're just
why it's over the wire and then on the
other end to interpret that yeah I mean
even you know if you say you have Java
on the server side and JavaScript on the
client side I for me it doesn't make
sense to try to define a common type
system between Java and JavaScript and
and I think for those situations where
performance is not super critical Jason
is kind of yeah I think as long so it's
a default and just switching to some
other things in your talk there were
some as usual only slightly
controversial remarks even talked about
the you know the issues when I think we
should many people talk about from no
SQL basically the fact that the D you
know SQL syrup you know in a positive
way firewalls developer from the
database engine but in a negative way
prevents you from doing a lot of things
as a programmer it gives you a kind of
strange kind of API with Part A API but
it's also part programming language so
it's just a different animal I think one
of the things you talk about is that had
to be nice if the features that are in
the there are a lot of great algorithms
implementations inside the database so
if you sequel server or db2 basically
said here's our great beat Ruiz and our
storage management that does this our
logging system our transaction mechanism
and let me program with those
essentially treat them as libraries or
actress then you'd have a much more sort
of composable system where users could
work with data and the way they saw
guess up correct
exactly correct if you look at the
database I mean these are kind of
incredibly fascinating machines right
and there's like a low of like decades
of joining and optimizations in there
and but as you say the weird thing is
that the way its exposure to the
programmer is via this weird sequel
language api concretely like in when you
do link and link to sequel or our entity
framework you start with C sharp with
expression trees which is like a high
level representation of your query and
algebraic to read now in order to get it
into the database you first have to
translate this 3 which is circular very
similar to the three that that will be
in the database at some point you have
to translate that into sequel into
strings send it over the wire there will
be parsed at the optimizer will turn it
into some algebraic tree and then it
will execute it so there's it's like
incredible distance between what you
really want to do and you know what's
the database expo is and the same holds
for you know the storage engine the log
manager etc so I wish that you know if
you would have a database that would be
broken up in components where you can
pick and choose and that would be a
fantastic sequel life has a little bit
of that where exposes like a smoke a
little vm that's very interesting like
the bytecode to the end and well I think
that that's going to be one of the
things that I find very fascinating is
can we break you know this database into
the components that where you use what
you need and one interesting thing is
windows has a kind of log base like an
area slog system in their system dot IO
dot log and so that these things do
exist and if you look at google's
leveldb it's kind of similar to that
time
believe that the no sequel movement is
pushing or to work you know giving the
database in terms of rio's reusable
components that you can pick and choose
so rich a key of course give great talk
s turn to tomica that you did it before
you arrived yeah of course no rich empty
to talk here in the summer and go
tonight and you know the atomic hasn't
has kind of approach like this have you
looked at it in terms of meeting it you
know the be trees are real
implementation trees you can program it
you know the probe the real programs the
user they use happen to use data log
it's kind of the language but you can
really work with entities and the
limited supports immutability as well
yes I did something along the direction
that's definitely on the direction i
think i think what rich is doing is
extremely fascinating and one thing that
i would like to pick out there that he
chose data book which is another
interesting choice because that has been
used in the database world as far as i
can see you typically as a more to your
radical thing so and but there I don't
like there's very few databases that
expose data long as their prayer
language all the good data log guys get
hard to build SQL engine that's the
story but yes maybe that's just a date a
lot of people say I said yeah so I think
it's very fascinating that he's using
data log if you look at Joe Hellerstein
and Berkeley is also kind of you're
leveraging data log and and I think and
one of the things what they the Lord
gives you is that it allows you to
define recursive queries in a more
natural way and I think that's something
that's very important if you look at a
lot of the data structures that we have
like social data and so on are naturally
so I think the expression expensive
power of data log is very important and
and that's something that if you look at
link or is also lacking because it's
more based on on sequel so I think I
think what rich is doing is very
interesting in many respects but and
maybe you know and from from a developer
point of view it's also the fact that
data log suddenly becomes real instead
of thing of something that you read
about in some database paper well I
think it's really part of your in a
closure program it's really part it's
really marrying that the computation on
the data it executes in your process as
opposed to the database the database
process but certainly the transactor
decomposition and things like that's
very much like legally yet to sort of
thing that your time yeah yeah and then
enter also to gun against died back to
to sequel light if you look at the
sequel like white coats it's also very
fascinating they have like a little
instructions for doing transactions you
know building index is doing joins and
and I always wondered why you know the
relational database is not exposed as if
the M because under needs you know
they're executed it there's a machine
there that execute programs which are
synchro programs and and then always you
know the people they're doing the same
thing if you look at the database
they're doing the same thing but they
just use different words so instead of
you know abstract syntax trees they call
it very plans and I wish that if they
open it up then we could have more
innovation from the language and the fee
moving into the database and vice versa
because these guys know a lot about you
know optimizations and sean has been so
one of the classic things since I know
like you look like a dpa yeah one of the
classic challenges if you have a large
you know corporations and you want to
share data across that is it if you let
everyone build their own indexes and
their own Petrie's and so on how would
how in this new world will will they
share this data because many people
would work with data do not have that
you know they're not computer scientists
they don't expect to work with maybe be
trees or things like that so yeah what
are they going to get some special
affordances or if they look you dummies
you know you just have to know how to
program this way or you know I'll make
up this gaming yourself because we're
just storing all the data I mean how do
you how do you deal with the fact that a
real day of semantics you get false
joins very easily you just keep you
people a whole lot of data there's if
you would say well locally all up
customer number so I'll just join these
I mean it's data models crap we don't
need any of that stuff anymore it that's
interesting so I do believe that the
illusion of control that you have when
you have a DBA that controls the schemas
and the data and indexes and so on is an
illusion because what happens is that
probably most people bypass the pba and
put their stuff in a spreadsheet and
they sent across spreadsheet so my
feeling is that a lot of people are
using excel as a database and if your
data is not to make that works
wonderfully but there's no scheming in
Excel and we have not seen a couple of
kind of examples where you know the the
extreme dynamic nature of Excel leads to
problems but but I do think that you
know and even if you have a DBA then a
lot of companies have you know many many
different ways to define the same kind
of entity because you know different
departments or
if you have mergers of companies and so
i'm not sure that having like the data
mobile sensor on defined by a single
group will solve any problems and if you
give it make it more accessible to
developers i'm not saying that the end
users should do that but if developers
can easier make that easier then I think
the integration becomes easier so it is
less brittle but but III don't know it's
like I think it's it's yeah I don't
think that this thing solves the real
problem is just hides it a little bit
more and then people will work ready
they're rounded anyway and and my
favorite examples imagine it you know on
your normal file system though you would
have to have a schema before you can
save a file that that doesn't work and
it slows things down quite a lot and
often you know you don't need the whole
schema right you only need to know what
is the key and the rest of the of the
columns don't really matter so maybe
it's this notion of a schema and read or
you know the finest the fact that I have
some descriptions or many descriptions
which can be useful and maybe or do
compose those descriptions again so it's
it's not so much as a single scheme of
this in your control point but the fact
that you'll need meditators delicious
and you can use those along with the
bags the elders it by the way is an
index on this and indexes this but it's
not all of this one so you know so
people have to do hope you already have
but there'll be some sort of holy
computational description for these
things as well as the things themselves
yes although what I find fascinating is
if you look at a lot of the web baby
eyes and say twitter where they expose
their data as a via rest api there's no
formal description of the metadata you
go to websites where they have like
english examples you know it's like oh
this is going to be 0 in the results you
get it might have these things and in
breakfast it works surprisingly well
good examples yes are still
that's one of the best ways to
communicate yes and and and I think by
me by leaving it a little bit fake you
gain flexibility that you can consume
that data from different languages so
I'm very scared about like an uber type
system and so I rather kind of err on
the side of you okay just let's keep it
informal and pick you know something
like JSON which is really proper tea
bags and then you interpret it when when
you reach so just to switch switch
channels yet up you mentioned in your
talk of the current hot debate in the
JavaScript community about futures yep
and a new proposed actually what looks
like quite a nice solution you want to
just maybe if we give a pointer that
talks the slides will be online and and
Nathan Mars is talk and the other ones
from Yao that you referenced you know
are also online videos for people
looking and talks in Australia but him
what do you think about this yeah I
think you said use como nads for the
solution yes yeah yeah that's kind of a
little bit of a joke p people they're
kind of yours it's interesting for me I
and was a very fanatical kind of
functional programmer in the late 80s
and then since then I've become super
pragmatic and so for me moan at this
very much like a design pattern it's
great that there's like a formal
categorical basis behind it and but but
you should look at it more as one of the
tools in your your toolbox and the same
with coordinates and it's like an API
pattern or design pattern now the
interesting thing I
what is entered is important about the
debates that is now in the JavaScript
community is that we needs a way to make
asynchronous programming easier because
everything once you go outside your
machine boundaries or even to disk and
you have to deal with with asynchrony
you cannot make blocking calls so that
is great now the things like how do you
expose this to the programmer and but I
was arguing for is the kinetic approach
is where you're the continuation of the
future takes the future itself as an
argument and but the confirmation is
called once that the future the promise
has been kind of your result or
terminated and then inside the
continuation you know it's okay to kind
of get at the value and so now that
finished task represents the outcome of
the computation where as in many other
approaches you're passing multiple
continuations you know into in Nordic
you have to compose multiple
considerations which i think is not the
right thing now if you look at our X
that is also based on multiple
configurations but the interesting thing
is that is the result of the computation
so you should never have continuations
kind of in a past into a into a function
but you have to return something that
has the cultivation there you compose on
that level so it's all about like how do
you compose distinction and I think the
current approach that a lot of people
have the monadic approach is not the
easiest way to kind of know do the
composition so but we'll see and the
other thing is that also you really if
you look at dotnet we're in c-sharp MV
me and they have a sink support you know
you don't even ever use these operations
because that's all hidden by the capara
shaly compiler there's all the kind of
plumbing for you so I do believe that
that JavaScript and other languages
definitely also need something like that
because otherwise you're doing
innovation passing by hands which
android are you Ezra groan ever groaning
and that's what the compiler should do
it's like they're it's not yeah you're
doing work as a human dental compiler
shooting suspect we will have a new boat
but to be honest I think no it has to
have to just rent on that yeah I think
nose has many good aspects I think it it
conceptually pointed out that everything
should be asynchronous all the way down
but I don't like to program it with
callbacks and I think you know because
it your whole program gets turned inside
out and I know companies whereas
interview questions you have to ride
like a loop using callbacks and and so
their point mate right that's kind of
get the compiler to do that very point
when I was young they telling you how
did you write this program just using
interrupts yes yes it can be done but
you know in many cases it's just a lot
easier to do something simpler for me
the other thing is asynchronous it's
quite awkward to do you know a good good
practices uses state machines yes and
that's not a natural it's not a very
natural model to do that in the kind of
note like program yes excellent so
elegant is complicated yeah but I'm very
much an optimist so I just see the fact
that people are thinking about it its
progress oh no I think it's great i
think and we're just scratching the
surface showing how I think people are
realizing as they build larger things
that they they need need more more
support yes yeah back to another subject
you mentioned which I I'm glad I wasn't
the only person who read you know I read
the the preview that i read the thesis
on rest you know they went back and I we
did a bunch of
rest ap is and then ask ourselves are
they really restful you know do do we
pass the test and be hounding him and if
there are some great books coming out
and I think we haven't getting a much
better idea for doing this but I just
you know been feeling guilty because I
always just want an API and I think
that's actually pretty natural for most
developers and you had a comment on that
and I think you also referenced some
work at Google were they yes a project
where they found that approach to yeah
so so first of all let's kind of talk a
little bit about rest when I found find
strange is that people cannot define
what rest means in a formal way where
you can you know like I know what
functional programming is yeah that's
programming with mathematical functions
and I know what mathematical functions
are so that's great and then you can say
well so Haskell is real functional
programming or zygotic fundamentalist
friendship programming and then you can
say well in other languages where you
know we allow side effects and
strictness have whatever but you still
know if it's going to where it comes
from and how it differs but with rest
it's a kia it becomes more like a
religious kind of debate and and also
the fact that you know by actually i
don't know probably by accident your
HTTP has these verbs so are these really
got to do everything you need and so on
and so that's got to be our DD my desire
for precision which is not kind of there
and and then what is a resource you know
these kind of big words that i don't
know what what they mean and why is it
bad to have an art
see style thing so for me all these
things don't really matter because once
you say as a programmer I just want to
program against an API and the fact that
that this service is exposed as rest or
so or I couldn't care less because
that's the implementation it's like the
wire format and and in some sense I do
believe that having an API is more
abstract because now you can switch out
the implementation so rest is way too
concrete for me because it is a certain
and goading a certain implementation of
an API so for me the API just give me
the API and then the implementer of the
API can swap out whatever I wouldn't
care and I don't think anybody types in
the rest you are else because the first
thing that developer does is to rise an
API that takes objects sense them to
their and it gets objects back so they
turn it in to RVC which is apparently
bad but I don't know so maybe I'm
completely naive but I'm just I know
this is what I see everybody do and all
the client libraries for a lot of these
web services are are like that and no
that's this I think the easiest way to
deal with this as a developer yeah I
mean I thought
if it's so important why why can I just
say like put an annotation on this
procedure call it say it make an HTTP
yes right here which which I can
understand this is supposed to be but I
mean which case there'd be a standard
way to do this and you'd say okay I
understand this has to go in this format
because that's how the web does it but
yeah I really shouldn't have to worry
about marshaling on marshalling and
converting all this but that should be
somewhere separate as opposed to
concatenate all these strings which I
personally find quite error prominent
yes yes and maybe here again I mean I
look at this thing and I see a lot of
syntax Rachel what is the difference
between writing blah blah blah /a /p or
blah blah blah ? you know a and B yep I
don't I don't see any difference it's
just it's just different syntax but
apparently there's like a deep semantic
difference escapes me you've been off
steal it yes yes the biggest it is
you're so good so one one other point I
think you know you've been coming back
to fundamentalist functional programming
it's quite exciting now we have new
conferences like lambda jamma coming up
and functional programming from skala F
sharp closure and other languages
starting to be used more and you seem to
be now moving from the initial school or
you know well if you don't know him on
ads and come on I'd said you know yeah
if you shouldn't come into the room yes
or you fail the test that's next to you
know I mean in objects we always had
reflected so you didn't know the
reflective tower you didn't know what a
medic
this was how could you possibly do
object oriented programming then we
found out if you didn't know what a
metaclass was you could make a big mess
yeah like change object or something yes
yeah so it seems to say that you know a
lot of these things are inspired can be
viewed through you know you know
category lenses and that may be an
interesting choice of words but but
maybe that's maybe that's a bit
overemphasize because I think it's one
of the things that makes people who
don't have that sort of that particular
kind of mathematical backgrounds I mean
I'm an engineer I've got a strong
background and you know signal
processing numerical mathematics and so
on but I certainly you know most
engineers don't take categories and I
certainly did so maybe that's kind of
overemphasized or or maybe that the
Pascal community needs to learn how to
speak in other ways when in other
audiences or you know how do you think
about this yeah so so the way I look at
you you mentioned engineering which i
think is an excellent example if you're
an engineer say a mechanical engineer
you built models using matts but the
moguls are very much extracted from
reality you make all kind of assumption
is like you know there's no friction and
there's a point mass and this and it and
you do that as a conceptual framework
initial it's a conceptual model and you
know that this is not really the real
world but you're going to make these
assumptions and then you kind of want to
learn more about what you're going to do
but then when you build the real system
there's all kind of other constraints
that you have to deal with and engineers
realize that the model that they made is
not the same as the system that they
then purchase they're always partial
executive and I think the same is true
when you use like mon acts and category
theory category tier is more like your
your your your differential equations
but your code is always going to feel
different and you have to reel
and I think it's that's one of the
things that you know I do believe that
you have to keep in mind very carefully
that no you're right you're right you're
codes that's kind of you know where
there's a conceptual mullins that they
don't hardly ever met one to one and the
other thing is that people i don't know
it's like what I don't know what it is
where they kind of like maybe it's this
mystique because it's hard to understand
I don't know I'm really trying to take
away all the kind of mysticism out of
the mall nets and so on he's in the end
is just the way to model things that you
that you want to write in coverage and
the same for firms of programming in
general you can say well you write well
I go fundamentalist programs i do
believe that Haskell community has done
one really good thing and I think Simon
bathing Jones is the one to kind of
brace for that is they always kept the
language pure absolute and then you can
experiment again then you can write
these models and you cannot cheat and so
you have to be pure and then you know
what you've learned and then you applied
in practice and what I really like is
that a lot of the more pragmatic
language like skyline afshar closure and
song they are not taking the real purist
view but they say well what we have to
do is we have to write in a program chef
to interact with imperative world and so
on so they they're they're using the in
size from the from the your model to
build a real case and I think you know
it's it's a matter of also maturity I
think where you can let go of their kind
of your the real strict kind of adhere
strictly to the monadic stuff now you
know that okay and then I can apply
these concepts to month to my actual
work and for me the essence of
functional programming is really that
you make things first glance that you
can make computations first class that
you can extract patterns that are
repeated so you can say I then so
really mother function is it's like a
set of statements that you turn into an
object itself and we talked about this
in the basket it's really not that much
difference between objects and functions
and in many cases in subjective
difference and even if locally
implementation ensure no okay people get
horrified when you say there's the
simpleton what's the difference between
object oriented programming and
functional programming well you know and
why do get the environment have to find
the function and the other to get the
function have to find the environment
yes all that can be it right yes but if
you see the meta circular interpreter
you you know yes it's the reader valve
with this you know very little
difference in the actual yes exactly and
so I think it's always good to emphasize
or others the same instead of going to
focus on what's different which is
something that's computer scientists
like to do is they always come trying to
pick things down and few at the
differences I don't think that's very
productive I'm sorry just look at this
thing you know we'll istic lee and say
what can I learn and what can I steal
what can I apply well thank you very
much and great to have you very
enjoyable you'll be able to catch Eric
slides online and his videos as well so
thank you never ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
