feel the physical effects of a punch in
the stomach I pride myself on being kind
of a wuss so hopefully that won't be a
lasting impression the other thing two
things that I do wish to apologize for
upfront one I have a really bad leg so
I'm not one of those active speakers
that moves across the stage I'm afraid
I'm one of those leaning speakers so to
this side of the room I'm not trying to
avoid you I just have to do this and
secondly I fell prey to some nasty
little spring summer coughs so
occasionally it will sound like I have
tuberculosis but I can reassure you I do
not
so when Kathryn asked me to speak at
this it was quite some time ago it was
at a time when the world looks pretty
darn dire and we thought we were going
to have a whole bunch of right-wing
political people and so the conversation
was going to be a lot about oh my
goodness what can we in tech do to turn
this around
but fortunately things are moving in a
slightly different direction so today's
talk is less going to be about my
initial career in politics although
there are obviously some references to
it and a bit more about what is it about
truth and does it really matter when we
think about the things we're trying to
solve in life today so this is my mom
her name is Susie she was my truth guru
she was the one who helped me understand
what is right what is wrong what is real
what is not indeed what is truth when I
look at the definition of truth it makes
me realize that you know that quality or
state of being true something that's in
accordance with fact or reality indeed
in my youth with my mother these are
things that kept repeating themselves
birth birth is true you are birth you
are alive you are there that is a truth
it does happen sadly so is death
it does happen but then I finished
University and I took my first job my
first job was in Washington DC and it
was a very interest
but one of the most important things
that it taught me was hmm I'm not quite
sure what the truth is anymore I stopped
being a lobbyist on behalf of the
research-based pharmaceutical industry
because many years ago got some good
healthy wrinkles here so many many years
ago I was asked to walk around Capitol
Hill which is where members of Congress
and Senators have their offices and I
was asked to tell them that a two
hundred and seventy five percent
increase in a particular prescription
drug that was only used by people over
75 years old was a really good thing it
was very important I was not supposed to
emphasize the fact that this drug would
go off patent in 18 months and I also
was not really supposed to make a big
deal about the fact that it was for the
elderly and at that time in the United
States the elderly did not have any
prescription drug benefits so it was
coming out of their own pocket this just
didn't sit right because really my
argument my truth for doing this was
that it costs 250 million dollars to
produce a new prescription drug and if
we weren't allowed to do this price
increase of two hundred and seventy five
percent for the remaining 18 months that
this drug was on patents we might not be
able to create any new drugs we'll run
out of money they'll be no cash that of
course if you would look at a cash flow
balance sheet of any major
pharmaceutical company should have
appeared ludicrous to you but the
emotion of people will die
there will be no new drugs if we don't
get this price increase so I did it for
about a week and then I had an epiphany
and I thought this is not what I want to
do and that was the beginning of my
questioning if the truth
really did matter very much because
there was truth in that statement it did
cost 250 million it did you know it was
important to create new drugs but I
wasn't sure anymore so then I realized
what my condition was all those years
ago I indeed was faced with post truths
as the media told me over and over again
in 2016
post truth
being the replacement of actual fact
with emotions with all kinds of things
and then i thought as i sat there
preparing for this speech so the media
made a big deal about post truth in 2016
but was that actually new i mean let's
face it
mussolini on the right looks really
really really powerful in the leader
mussolini on the left looks like a wuss
who can't control his horse that's a
post truth because they just kind of
washed to the handler out of the
photograph it was much more important to
have that emotion he is a powerful man
and then I thought about what what are
some other old versions of post truth
that your dentist would tell you that a
cigarette was good for you because it
wouldn't irritate your throat or or that
you know so many doctors smoke it it's
got to be okay that's amazing I did take
out the one that said if you don't want
to be fat you better smoke so you know
there's been a lot of post truth it
didn't just show up in 2016 and then
there's things like this there's that
emotional appeal big fat liar we knew he
was a liar for a long time but he used
all that emotion he used all that
bullying he's just as post truth at this
but in 2016 it got really ugly it got
really ugly because ugly hideous people
were able to do some incredibly vulgar
things what was the difference one
difference that I observed and again
this is my personal stuff so trust me no
punch in the stomach but these are
things that I've been thinking about for
the last few years one big difference
was technology let it go so far so fast
I mean when somebody was vulgar and
gross I had a friend who worked in los
angeles city politics and she was part
of an education reform project and she
was in a bar one night with a few of her
friends and somebody walked up to her
and said are you part of that stupid
learn and she said yes i am and he
promptly punched her in the nose broke
her nose blood everywhere but that
didn't go out to millions of people that
happened among 10 or 15 it was vulgar it
was gross
with offensive he disagreed but it
suddenly wasn't everywhere and I think
that's where that post truth started to
take on a real different feeling I was
able again the privilege thanks to
Katherine to speak in Berlin and in that
speech I talked a lot about technology
and things that had been bubbling up for
years and years the ability to save
meand things didn't just start in 2016
but I think it really began to catch
everyone's conscious there are other
things about post truth in 2016 that
became really annoying the fact that it
was just so irrational I mean seriously
this is a recent headline but it could
have come out at any point in time
during the campaign her father who
issued some of the most hideous and
vicious things ever through technology
suddenly daughters like I can't believe
everyone so mean to Daddy
I can't believe it he's such a good man
and although I have an American accent
I've lived in Europe for 20 years but
this is just too much fun it's too much
fun to point this stuff out because this
is just gross let's come have a laugh
it's gross and the whole point is she
would have been whining in a Park Avenue
flat
she would have been whining over
cocktails with friends now when she wins
millions of people hear it some people
happen to agree with her some people
don't but it's all based on emotions and
then there's my personal favorite that
made 2016 post truth really painful to
me as an individual the blatant lying I
did start in politics I was asked to
shift the emphasis on we need money to
pay for drugs but it was true a new drug
did cost 250 million dollars and it was
going to be a two hundred seventy five
percent price increase we didn't do this
now people have lied all their lives
we saw Lance Armstrong and things like
this but but in 2015 this stuff just got
evil and if you're not aware of this
basically the people behind this woke up
the next morning the day after the
famous brexit vote and said wow yeah
that was never true and we were never
going to do that they just admitted it
within hours of the vote count being
final so this is what made post truth
particularly hideous in 2016 we know
that technology played a role in
it we know that technology will claim it
didn't play a role in it but it did but
I'm not here today weirdly enough to
focus on that shame shame shame I'm here
to focus on just truth matter is that
the thing that we should worry about
because if we have so many examples in
our lives where we are now increasingly
confident that the person isn't saying
the truth
we're not necessarily ourselves saying
something that we're proud and truthful
is that really the important thing if
we're trying to figure out ways to make
society better and to get the best use
out of technology I think the good news
is there's a bit of a trend shift
happening so for all of the pain and
agony that some of us and again my
apologies there may be a lot of people
in this room who are completely
comfortable with Donald Trump and
completely comfortable with brexit which
I actually do respect because that's one
of my things is that people are allowed
to disagree and have different points of
view technology when it allows you to be
particularly vicious and hideous that's
not quite so compelling but this shift
that we've seen so far in 2017 which
completely changed what I thought I
might need to say today to make everyone
want to go out and save the world is
nice we didn't get hurt I realized from
an academic standpoint people will say
social media possibly didn't play a very
large role in the French campaign but
for me today I'm enjoying a rather
simple view of the world we didn't get
her that's a good thing so her total
lies which I'm comfortable saying so
many of them were they were not the
truth her post truth appealed to emotion
didn't work as well in 2017 and for
those of you who are familiar this is
the labor manifesto for the many not the
few and if you by chance follow the UK
elections much to everyone's surprise or
shock or depending on one's tax
situation or political beliefs didn't
quite go the way they thought it would
and a lot of people are sensing that one
of the reasons was because this
manifesto this Labor Party
suddenly was talking about nice things
good things you'll notice I didn't say
they were telling the truth but they
were at least talking about nice things
and another interesting trend in 2017
and again because of my old life it's
one worth watching is what is happening
in small local elections in the US now
the Democrats who just unseated a whole
bunch of Republicans don't necessarily
rule the world but it was kind of fun to
read this on The Huffington Post because
some of these seats had been held by
Republicans for over a hundred years in
the same way that the Conservatives lost
a seat last week that had been held in
Canterbury for since the time of seat
was created so nearly 90 plus years so
these are little trends but please I'm
actually not saying this is about the
truth they're just trends that say it's
a different trend from 2016 and I think
one of the reasons that these trends may
be happening again personal opinion is
because the people who are suddenly
getting more involved in voting who are
suddenly stepping up raising their arms
wanting to be heard they just want a
different truth to be part of the
conversation so we come back to my mom
and we come back to why this is titled
when the truth no longer matters
my mother has extremely advanced
dementia and if any of you know someone
with dementia it has a really insidious
side to it which is and I don't know
this for sure but it has to be true I
think they know what's happening to them
and I certainly believe my mother knew
it was happening to her
so back in 2008 my husband and I were
visiting her and she had an idyllic life
she lives on a little salt water fed
canal north of Los Angeles California
and she had a little tiny electric canal
boat and we were all going to go out on
it and we wanted to clean it off had a
little bit of bird poo on it little
unsightly you don't want to sit there
having a nice little cruise with all
this schmutz on the boat and so my
husband says to my mom where's where's
the water hose where's this and she
hands him an electric cable
the very same electric cable that is
used to charge the battery on her tiny
little canal boat and my husband says Oh
Susie where's the hose this is the cable
and she looks at him and in his amazing
cherry face she says oh that does both I
used it just yesterday it works very
well and for my husband he's a solid
Brit who hadn't seen this before it took
a minute and he kind of looked at me and
I said I don't know that's when we knew
something was definitely going wrong we
cleaned the boat and we went on but at
that point we started listening and we
realized that my mother started saying
more and more outrageous things but to
her they were the truth she wasn't
telling lies and I learned because I had
to learn more about dementia this is an
excellent book by the way again I hope
none of you have to deal with dementia
it is a horrible disease
my mother was a most vibrant an amazing
woman
little handed my favorite story the
Olympics went through Los Angeles in
1984 she had just come back from a
fishing trip in the Arctic Circle she
had literally got off the plane she was
covered she's very fair-skinned she was
covered in cold horrible sores and
things from all the Sun and the extreme
weather she goes in the house I want to
tell you I was really young I wasn't
that young she mixes a pitcher of
martinis she gets in the car don't worry
she hadn't started drinking them yet and
it grabs me goes up not very far from
our house sits down with all the
neighbors who came out with their chairs
to see the torch really going by and
pours martinis for everyone so that as
the runners go by everyone can drink a
toast have a martini and say oh is it
Los Angeles wonderful that's my mom
but she's not like that she's a shell
she smiles a lot we're very fortunate
she's not angry but she is a show that
being said though I learned something
from this book and I've now decided that
this actually might be very important in
the world that we live in today when
you're dealing with someone who has
dementia it is not useful to tell them
they are wrong
because as I said I have this hypothesis
that they actually know what's happening
to them so when you tell them they're
wrong they get agitated they get angry
they get emotional it makes it worse so
that the last year of my life working on
an agile transformation and I came to a
doll not because I'm a developer not
because I had worked in this place
before but because I loved the
commitment to collaboration and good
communication and things like that but I
learned something unexpectedly in my
last year working in the agile community
there are a lot of people who use a lot
of anger and energy fighting for what
they say is the truth and telling other
people that what they say isn't the
truth I'd like to recommend they read
this book because if you challenge
people and tell them they're wrong
unsurprisingly we get emotional we get
defensive think back to those horrible
tweets think back to the serious global
embarrassment of what's going on right
now with Donald Trump in the former FBI
director he lied no he lied no he lied
no he lied these are not useful things
because someone's trying to prove
there's truth if I learned anything from
my mother's really really tragic tragic
disease it's that it isn't about telling
the truth
it's about listening it's about finding
ways to continue the conversation it's
about being gentle about being patient
and it's about being calm if that
doesn't apply to every situation we're
seeing in politics right now and again
I'd say to what I saw in agile
transformation recently I hope that's
the one thing you'll take from this life
is better if you're calm and you listen
I've been really fortunate I've been
able to do a lot of different things
Catherine only touched on a few of them
I've had eight different careers within
lots of different countries this is my
favorite project I have ever done and
it's all about does the truth really
matter so in 1985 ish Mandela was
elected president of South Africa and
coca-cola suddenly had a competitor
Pepsi Cola was introduced into the black
townships within two weeks they had
taken 55% mark share market share from
coca-cola field had just plummeted the
South African team of coca-cola were
about to invest millions of rand to come
up with an advertising campaign to
remind people that coca-cola was always
there for them coca-cola was there
during apartheid Pepsi was not we were
always there for you we were with you
were there
we're wonderful remember us love us but
interestingly some of the guys back in
Atlanta said we're not sure that they
really have the right story here that
they have the truth so I was sent for
three weeks with another gentleman we
had political backgrounds and we were
sent to do kind of focus group political
type interviews and I had the glorious
privilege of spending three weeks
talking to teens from black townships
this was within months it's before the
Rugby World Cup it was just so new in
Mandela's presidency I've met first with
the executives in Johannesburg they were
so sure that coca-cola was hated because
it was there so we need to run a
campaign to remind them they should love
us just love the arrogance of
advertising it's so so nothing and they
and they were angry they were furious
that they were being punished for having
been here for having stuck around for
having allowed them to have sugary dark
beverages but then we went out and
started talking to these kids and first
of all how I wish the story had ended
happily for all of them but wow at that
time I had just finished three weeks of
research in the US and inner cities same
similar projects what is the problem
between Coke and Pepsi inner-city kids
in the US
can be third and fourth-generation gang
member families things like that they
don't have a lot of hope they certainly
didn't back then 1995 so here I am
talking to these young people and they
say the most amazing things like data
says if I get an education I have a
future and data says all I have to do is
stay in school and I'll have a future
and then we started talking about their
habits you know what they buy you know
because you don't just kind of hit them
and say why aren't you buying coke you
sort of try to show some level of
understanding and interest
I hadn't really learned how important
learning was until this project
listening was until this project and at
the end of three weeks after being told
by the research company that they had
never had a white executive spent so
much time in the townships which I'm
grateful I did this is what came out of
this project there were three reasons
why coca-cola share had really tanked
the first one was imagine being 14 years
old and never being able to choose
anything you would walk into your little
shack of a shop and everything was the
same every day every week for 14 years
something you got to choose something
else why wouldn't you
there was no hatred of coca-cola I was
just never able to say anything but
coca-cola and now I'd like to say Pepsi
I'd like to try something else
so that was one the second one was
coca-cola had been there all during
apartheid and they had sponsored
football soccer all played on dirt
fields there was no grass in the
townships and that had been the only
sport these kids had ever known
Pepsi comes in they even introduced
basketball clinics they bring cricket
they bring other sports into the
townships kids had never tried anything
new they had never been able to play a
different sport it was just fun but the
third one for me was the best one the
one that taught me just shut up and
listened this was a culture that was
based on sharing when someone had a
funeral they would do a collection to
all the houses to pay for it I genuinely
don't think Pepsi knew this when they
launched
they chose to launch with a 1.25 liter
bottle whereas coke out of one liter
bottle so you're thinking oh great I can
have more no here's what the kid said I
can pour 1/4 glass for my friends so
they could share more it was fantastic
now again I wish there was a happy
ending because basically the Pepsi
bottler went bankrupt and it closed and
could probably didn't have to change
anything and these things happen but
it's I'm being a little selfish here and
telling you what it did for me it told
me that anything that I assume is the
truth
I got to go validate I got to go
question but the only way I can do that
is if I shut up and listen because I
think it's really important to
understand the voice of the people who
you want to do things with the world
that we live in today is full of people
who like to tell you the truth they like
to tell you their truth is the right
truth and your truth is the wrong truth
and they get really animated about it
I'm totally fine by the way if this
isn't working for you I apologize if it
isn't because I don't like wasting
people's time but I'm not expecting you
to go Wow my life has changed because of
this IMAP receipt if of the indulgence
of being able to share a few things so
that being said if you're surrounded by
those people who yell at you who bully
you who make their point who resort to
Twitter who tell you you're wrong I just
want you to know the trends are looking
a little bit better they're still going
to be around but the trends are looking
hopeful that people are beginning to
challenge if it's all about truth or if
it's about that conversation the
coca-cola thing told me that it wasn't
about truth because these guys were
going to invest millions they thought
they knew the truth it was about the
conversation because when you have the
conversation you really understand what
people care about some of these attempts
at moving beyond truth to good
conversations collaboration coalition
building they're going to be facilitated
by technology some might say they
already are again in my berlin talk
which seems like new news then but wow
it's just so well covered now people
didn't realize how much their
information was being
streamlines and my challenge in Berlin
was please please as people who
understand tech don't fight with people
don't disagree with them don't challenge
them just help them see how much their
information is streamlined because these
things matter and that's why I have to
give this little health warning which is
whenever you have a fantastically
wealthy and ambitious company telling
you that they're transparent and that
they really want to help build
communities please be skeptical doesn't
mean they're bad doesn't mean but just
be skeptical because at the end of the
day I used to work in media and people
always ask me about news and I just
remind them news is about selling ads it
is those ads are go along with the
editorial because they're interesting to
the people who want them and the ads are
there it's okay we live in a capitalist
society just remember it and if smart
tech people you can help people remember
this that although everyone wants to
believe that Facebook is a wonderful
place and it brings people together
there are other reasons that they sit in
their highly securitized offices we just
need to remind them a very very dear
friend of mine brought this book to my
attention the culture of connectivity a
critical history of social media I'm not
an academic that should be obvious by
now but it's a very interesting book and
I found this quote particularly useful
because I do think there's a lot of
truth to it it's ok all these companies
are here that early belief in what the
internet was about that it was all about
community it was all about free you know
Wikipedia is probably the only thing
less that might be free most things now
have corporations involved they need to
make money they need to reward their
shareholders just remember that and as
people who work in text help other
people understand that in a way that
isn't angry and isn't threatening I have
no idea what these guys are going to
talk about it two o'clock but the title
in and of itself tells me please think
about listening to it because a friend
of mine gave me access to a global study
that was done very very secret secret by
some of those big brands on the previous
slide
I won't get her fired but in that study
it was very clear that the issue for
2017 and 2018 for large corporations is
going to be tech epics because consumers
are beginning to understand what's being
done you can help them really understand
I'm not saying it's all evil it's about
making money
this is okay when people understand
things they can make better decisions
but that's just a little free plug he
had no idea it was coming although you
shake me said I'm very pleased because
once I saw that title I thought I'm
going to be there for that I know it's
important so in kind of a weird rambling
way which hopefully made some lines for
you
this is where the journey brings me as a
human being I no longer seek the truth I
do not believe truth matters I have a
mother who had many truths and now bless
her heart nothing she says it's truthful
she told everyone my brother was the
head of medicine staff health care
Doctors Without Borders
everyone god bless her let her do it
it's just not important the thing that
is important for me is conversation and
collaboration and again health warnings
about companies that make money off that
health warning about things I've
observed in the agile community that
claim to be encouraging it but don't
seem to be sometimes stand up for your
voice stand up for your thoughts you
don't have to follow one person you
don't have to follow one thing but you
do have to know how to calmly and
purposefully have conversations with
people build coalition coalitions and
find ways to work together that's what
I'm after
you have let me ramble on a little bit
today for which I'm very grateful so I
have violated my own rule of shut up and
listen so I apologize and therefore I'm
going to be quiet and leave you with one
thought the thing I'd like to point out
is this next quote was set in 2010 it
was said a long time ago before things
got a lot worse so rather than get you
depressed
please remember the trends that we're
seeing in 2017 they're not all based on
truth by the way I mean to be fair the
Labor Party won a lot of youth votes
because it said it would wipe out
student debt and do a bunch of things
that as far as I can tell there's no way
the government can pay for
but what the heck it got him involved it
got him in the conversation and actually
weirdly enough I'm okay with that
because yes they might be disappointed
but if they keep sitting down and being
part of the conversation not only will
they learn but they'll be able to
understand how things work in government
so with that I didn't quite take the
full 40 minutes but I thought you might
want to be spared an American accent I
am glad I didn't cough though because
it's pretty gross so I'll leave you with
this as a thought</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
