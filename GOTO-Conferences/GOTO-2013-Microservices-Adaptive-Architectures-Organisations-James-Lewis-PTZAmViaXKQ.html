people in this office I'm moving base
after the London office did the last
time I hadn't thought was office in
happy it was in obvious before this was
literally the size of the conference
room relaxing it's probably quite a job
we just do um first off how many people
are actually need to go to parties being
poor a few hands up yes fantastic I feel
about full columns I from recommend
highly enough apart has a speak at all
that's just always an attendee visits
it's for means that pretty much less
confidence and will ana martin fowler
always says that if if he was not
invited to speak softer many likely paid
own money to go so I mean it's a really
recommend it and also to each race i
dint of a training course running so for
those eight spaces up great um so what
we're going to talk about microservices
adaptive architectures and organizations
um
it's an interesting topic it's something
that says come up I guess in the last
two or three years just as a flavor win
today we did a survey internally a lot
of projects in Europe off I think about
17 or so projects that return results
pretty much two-thirds said that they
were using some form of micro service
for style of architecture which is kind
of interesting because I think probably
a year ago that would have been like a
any so that's fine what is it for us I
guess what we're all here to find out I
guess initially I just like to introduce
myself my name to James there is some a
principal consultant with full works I
guess I describe myself as a sort of
coding architect from the best
description i spent most of my time on
projects either as a tech lead or as an
architect or for writing characters
developer so at the moment I'm I'm
writing C sharp code some of the
examples from this talk were from
appointed about two years ago I was
writing Java code back then so it's java
SE C sharp is awesome as a language that
I'm really enjoying variety shop here so
um in thought wigs as well as being as
well as my daughters are carrying
Aquatech I'm also a member of the
technical advisory board that's a group
of technologists you get together every
six months or so includes diplomatic
power and you feel forward and we've
really something called the thought
which technology radar I'm doing other
things as well so you've come across as
before this is a bit of blatant
self-promotion of the start
and the technology radar comes down
pretty much once every six months so it
covers off I guess up-and-coming
technologies this convention to take a
look at that way that's enough of that
so what's this talk about as I said it
starting library services or what on
microservice me microservices really cut
off three things first thing is that
it's about evolutionary architecture
evolutionary approaches to building
systems it's about immersion design and
how we can allow our teams to actually
the design of a lot of our systems to a
murder or a bit of time a lot of things
I be prescriptive and it's also about
people in teams so it's about these sort
of three things that we've been talking
about for quite a long time and they
seem to come together in the last few
years or couple of years to some
formance idea of microscope system it's
also it's also got some other things
there's also got some giants along with
the target of all catering some
mushrooms terms in a cave so fun well
I'm going to start with is this idea of
big systems are we building systems that
asks you think that's the first official
and there's some interesting stats from
people like garmin this is an example of
oh so ninety percent of the total cost
of ownership of the system the current
application is including personal which
you can spend and 1,000,000 building
something and getting into production
you can be spending a lot of water act
over the lifetime maintaining
maintaining the perfect system it's also
in the united kingdom certainly been a
number of very very high-profile
failures of enormous programs of work
being big application programs that have
failed in this case this is the NHS
National Health Service in the UK and
what bank and projects
to spending twelve point seven billion
so I guess that's about 15 billion euros
is it that's why it's a lot of money to
spend another thing i'm not sure if
we've got any CEOs or see episodes in
the room um but we have to do this every
four years we have to rewrite these big
applications because they become
untenable three to five years in you've
got a big big application it's really
really hard to make changes to time and
this is a question I depends a house or
product get asked by people when I speak
to some cxo chief execs that kind of
stuff is they're not happy about this
why do we have to keep spending all this
money on these systems on rebuilding
systems so as a friend and former
colleague guy called Simon Stewart is
now google he's behind webdriver I'm not
sure of people come across webdriver but
his ex thoughts guy and he has this
really lovely other there of stories
hand so you can decide they're having a
team Shaymin which is a lovely kind of
thought someone who will tell you the
story of how things became the way they
are sonos you sort of start on any
project you look at this build and it's
this tremendously long great fall at
this alone and forth you're lucky enough
to score sheet account and these are my
thought this is terrible this is all how
did it possibly mean this must be get
but get this way assignments daddy
around team shame and gather your reins
over I'm going to tell you the story of
the bill I'm telling a story about how
the bills go to this step I like this
idea of a team shame and I like that
their stories turn because they can't
powerful so I'm going to start off and
there will be a few throughout this with
some scary stories some sort of
nightmares if you like but these are all
greeting in reality is raw treated in in
the real world this is these-a develop
from work that I've done as a consultant
and actually some of the people here in
this room from forwards work than some
of these
you might you might see some similarity
system some reports we've written before
so the first scary story ignorant I want
to talk fat is an airline it's Lee alone
cuk airline or not the most he mentioned
names i tuk a line and yeah they're
definitely be fit in pretty well the
rapidly expanding and then have a system
that basically look like this when you
drop some some retail site and you don't
seem to partial control systems and
you're a big database in the middle of
it that's effectively there this amount
of stuff isn't millionaire self the
airlines when it comes down to it a
pretty straightforward it you've got
individually which you need to sell
which effectively the seats on your
aircraft and you're going to get people
onto those aircraft outsiders according
so interestingly with this with this
with this airline we were asked to come
in and do a review of their architecture
of a period of time to about three weeks
they look at these systems and will be
found after hearing their stories is
that over time they had this database
and they had this this resource is the
parkin troll sign talking Thursday's
mess as they expanded as their as they
grew this database come sort of bigger
and bigger to start off well you know
relatively small sequel server database
and that I've kind of made a single
server database and some look in here
before DeNiro ended up as an absolutely
looming enormous sequel server database
that says 48 call 256 free tomorrow very
own that's the new Mercer it's not from
European standards come close it's about
a million bucks per per box and of
course they've got their architect tax
on so they're not having one of these
boxes they're having at least two in two
different locations so that's every time
they need to operate let's open America
me about four million bucks and I have
great cycles back to our 20 months whoa
that's a lot of funding
every 12-18 months just on your database
so we got together we wrote this report
for them and in our report we wrote lots
of kind of you know technical
architectural e sound stuff you reasoned
arguments relation to systems being
tightly coupled to one another tiny
couples of database and golden hammer
syndrome solving every problem with the
same solution just hitting it with a
sequel server hammer single points of
failure this led to cost it's better to
scale operational costs and high cost of
failure which is practice in the report
looks fantastic right it's not that
report the thing is with architecture
roles they become in the background or
robbery the full brain have real costs
to businesses right if you've got these
kind of citizens in your organization
your business is a pretty shitty
position and to illustrate that about
you previously when we were there this
happened ciblek no painting volcano went
off and Iceland I'm sure people remember
remember going off there was this
tremendous of problem with flights and
cancellations and this kind of thing now
it's the thing is if you look at this
system right what's the first thing
people do this is the question what's
the first thing you would do in the
event in worried about your flight in
the Lego castle you go to the website
right in check to see whether your
flight is is the label castle and
there's lots of people doing this many
more than normal and of course it starts
to slow down a bit and what happens when
it starts to slow down will you stop
them actually that five right he stopped
doing that
if their 2d dos their own their own site
now this this would kind of be okay if
there was any kind of separation of
concerns irritable but actually in this
case that wasn't in both of these
systems to liver the same database
people matching at five and all of a
sudden the benzo just dieter went away
couldn't handle anymore and how people
physically couldn't get all planes so
even the routes that weren't affected by
anything people couldn't actually get on
to the plans because because because of
the thought the coupling between these
two systems they physically couldn't
actually check in and actually get when
we go to the gates get from awful quiet
just quite scary critical me that's an
example one of these are the big systems
big database everything in the database
golden kind of Hammer um the next thing
is to talk about is this idea of Plato's
cave or different types of architecture
so Plato Plato's cave is from one of
Plato's dialogues and in Plato's cave
the ideas you've got a person who's on a
row of prisoners actually you were
shackled and a foot and they're staring
at wall behind those of fire and people
holding objects up in front of the fire
has seen the shadows on the wall now I
can see um yeah it's all very well be
showing architecture diagrams and say
the world is right actually when i'm
showing you is the shadows on the wall
and i actually show you the real systems
you know real systems actually are see
much more complex and the diagrams we
draw to show to show people to get to
get money gets idol this is an example i
guess of one of these solutions shadows
on the wall one of these type
these platonic performs this is this is
a system of words on this is really
where i first came across and put all
these ideas together there's a system is
basically like a banking and innovative
product the build-up have to be paid
because a bunch of different
capabilities that enable you to perform
different operations anyone in banking
so it has website has full sensors
applications and analytics users
transactions accounts and stuff up there
so rules engines reporting as faxes
entitlements the usual start you to see
in a pretty big convex system now
traditionally what I would have done was
was do something like this right back
then this was Java so kind of download
drink spring is going with the end of
mavin download the rest of the internet
I'm going to put it all into one big
application right all one big
applications will be talking for
flexpays I'm going to have all this
different all the difference valued
contests that exist within the system in
the same physical deplorable application
generally those the traditional way I
used to go back building new systems and
it's another period of time I guess
myself back down north and a few others
Jimmy Nielsen and so on we were talking
about the idea of banning all texts and
from the range of the design and how how
what would happen if you have started to
tease out battery contacts that will
generally exist within a single
application as in two separate
applications so rather than have this
one big sebass had one big application
for the purposes of the camera the
printer is now going in the corner Rutan
have one big application and what would
happen if you started to tease some of
these domains that different contexts
out in two separate deployment rather
like this and I don't just mean you know
having several applications talk
again to one big database the scary
stories of salt Sullivan is kind of
related to that that's kind of what they
did to that on big database single point
of failure lots of applications talking
to it rather than doing that we actually
move the data with the application so we
have bounded contexts that owner end
data separate from one another now
that's the first kind of thing I think
about when I think about evolutionary
architectural microservices this idea of
having hexagonal business capabilities
for business capabilities in the service
oriented architecture sense which own
their own data it's kind of looks office
so when I say sort of example that's
kind of interesting right this hexagonal
is promoted to executive architectures
which which have been around for quite a
while it's a something called ports and
adapters which I'll cut off in a minute
sonar I guess you know a shadow on the
wall architecture when we have is a
number of different business
capabilities which we separated act in
two completely separate applications
each earning their own data and each as
we'll see later eventually consistent
between one month and in the case of a
simple business capability it's another
example we have a capability of
decomposed into yet more applications
within the business capability and I
think when we talk about microservices
this is generally the sort of thing were
thinking of is having many small
applications do the job that would
previously been done by one big
complication
so in our case we had an event queue we
have backed by the veg stall we had some
q processes which are implementing the
kind of competing consumer pattern
holding an event queue and we have a
user service which was the source of
truth for data for users in our system
and this is a single business capability
but within it has three independent
applications actually had two databases
one of which was nice for our one which
was among go so choosing different
technologies as well let's all be well
but if you've got these different
capabilities talking one to another and
their applications within these
capabilities talking one to another you
kind of need some way to allow them to
do that in a fairly consistent now and
the next point is a scientist these
capabilities share the a uniform
interface so in our case it was the
uniform interface up hdb but the current
project Amon is actually not using HTTP
we're actually using messaging and you
can do the same thing with message
infrastructure as you can do with this
so for us of the pics at all for our
hexagonal or business capability we
ended up with the sonnet area from ports
and adapters on the kind of their taxes
sorry on the edges of these of these
hexagons support to the porter back to
pattern basically says we'll have a kind
of standard way of adapting input and an
advert to to to your application oh true
in our case what we were you going to
call that what would what we're going to
use is we have this this business
capability what was them by the way I
should point out that this circle city
this is
Arkham a turbulent group from the people
who brought you motor from togaf this is
proper architecture is not what what
were we going to eat well there's a few
options right then this makes this a few
options I don't say another story and
this is this is this is a real sort of
capability map of a client um it's
pretty cool although the colors this is
known as the rainbow diagram for obvious
reasons the colors represent different
types of data so by domain so say green
is user data so we've got user data
pretty much spread all over the place
all of these things are talking via
direct database access database the base
basin in some cases flight is something
brilliantly called the middleware
database but actually no catch middle
where we have the middle web-based mess
which is my pen name yeah as we can see
this stuff is better happening all over
the place and this is a classic example
of something called the stove pipe
enterprise the stovepipe architectures
have been known about for decades
notices 99 the quotes systems reputed
and developed to solve a specific
problem characterized by limited focus
of functionality and continued data that
cannot be easily shared but that's kind
of one option across actually most
organizations have a lot of this game on
there's lots of ETL resultant direct
database the database that's pretty cool
and this in general is only kind of a
small part of what and the large
organization system of space if you look
like it's kind of more i guess like that
right it's lots and lots and lots of
tens and tens and tens of systems all
called by the bed so what again when we
put
all together as we all went to do we
talked about going there logic being
scattered about data being scattered and
then it becomes very difficult to
predict the effect change or which
system is the sort of truth for any data
where do you go when you go to the train
where to do is get the idea of your use
of if you have to 20 different places I
was actually at an organization where
they have a better assist on the lizard
block of architecture lives a bit like
this and they have this kind of mishmash
of databases and the different 12
projects over the previous two years to
try and integrate trying to separate off
from these databases integrate with them
and every single project and fail if
they spent millions upon millions of
euros trying to try to address this and
just actually come to the point where it
was almost physically impossible to do
anything about it so I think I'm hoping
we're agreed in the room that this is
maybe not the best approach to take
towards systems intuition um there is
another one there are several other
approaches messaging and so forth but
when two years ago we were looking at
this this this this product as magnavox
we decided to look at the uniform
interface / https basically this this
brilliant talk online event if you've
seen this about god Leonard Richardson
this is 2082 coupons 2013 65 years ago
are we still having
taking the law of this combo which is
quite scary this is the outsourced a
coupon five years ago he talks about
really really interesting I they every
angel in contact it talks about his
maturity guru step and his maturity
heuristic is about how we integrated
between systems and the different
maturity levels of inspiration between
systems music nation so the first level
is level 0 is this swamp it causes the
swamp lover of pox that's playing on xml
level one up is you introduce the idea
of resources into your integration
scenarios the next level up is you
introduce HTTP verbs so you don't stop
you get to tunnel commands via URLs for
example you actually use the correct
foods from HTTP and finally you have the
crowning glory of rest which involves
using high community controls and the
great thing about mini controls is that
they allow you to decouple to certain
extent client and server interactions I
asked but this engine is my face tonight
other behold the 25th sort of hypermedia
is the engine applications day yeah so
based on based on that next restful
patterns based on some workers employees
to where the Robinson they've been doing
we decided to go and look at using a
restful start that integrate these
business capabilities and also
integrates the smaller applications
within those distance capabilities so
what does that look like well hope very
simply these resources ended up offering
up representations in some cases HTML
some case of external and some cases
adjacent which included things like
media controls so you are able to
marriage state changes within the
applications using those high per
million controls so as an example we
have I think this is a this is a page
for a user Brittany huge user we have a
form in here which you can act which
actually has default values which fill
out automatically using a piece of
client station HTTP flight some sort and
submit it also has things like other
controls that link off two indexes these
are indexes so what we ended up with in
our platonic world and i'll come up your
20 criticism and arrows will what we
ended up with is a kind of bility that
the like this with the interfaces to the
outside world effectively being HTTP
with well-known content types in our
case we'll be using maximum jason i
guess you probably owe data is
fashionable at the moment but simply we
had some we were exposing some resources
in this case it user request having the
specific a list of user requests and a
specific user requests in a standard
content top
so the next thing microservices and this
is what people kind of tend to focus on
is small with a single responsibility so
single responsibility principle all the
way down for brief familiar with maney
really with terry pratchett he thought
about and it's turtles all the way back
all the way down to the elephants I
don't think there any elephants in this
case unless you right back also when you
didn't go to the bottom but in a single
responsibility principle as applying all
the way up and all the way down what
does that mean well we've got our
capability which has an application
village actually it's probably a bit
more complex the one we took them bare
hands three little applications and two
different based bases and each of these
has a single responsibility each of
these has the responsibility to go or
achieve a particular goal and has the
business rules within within it to
achieve that evil so we have as I said
we have a vent from the menu we have
user services we haven't met process
though each of those things had similar
responsibilities when you dive sort of
into I guess one of these applications
generally they're composed of objects
and objects in our language um and then
we dive down in some of the objects
basically you hit on conjecture
which is that these things should be no
bigger than your head now this comes
with this down north is teaching this
other cause which is bizarre but this
this comes from a project colors on
where we made the observation that if a
class gets bigger than my head when I
put it up against TV screen then it's
too big at that point is going to have
probably more than more than one
responsibility that's okay because
actually there's not much in my it's
quite big so seeing responsibility
principle all the way down when you go
to the bottom this is where we normally
talk about single responsibility
principle with respect to
object-oriented programming with respect
of objects but actually you can apply
this as you chunk up different levels of
abstraction within your systems so when
you chunk up to the level of other
application the application should have
a single responsibility should do a
single thing when you chunk up again to
the level of a business capability and
service businesses it should have
similarly should do one thing and
similarly when you chunk up to the level
of systems of systems they should also
have single responsibility do you want
so as we chunk up these levels of
abstraction each these domains
effectively were choking up through
different domains and we're jumping up
on the davail of objects into the demand
of applications in the vein of
capabilities into the domain of systems
of systems each of those dimension be
small enough to fit in my head I should
be able to understand and what does that
mean in laughing Plato Plato scary world
in our case it man about a hundred or so
maybe about 500 certainly lesson Jerry a
thousand lines for internal applications
they would hardly really small doing one
one thing one thing only so at this
point quite a lot of people set starts a
I'll read you saw what about reusing
domain cone things across these
different locations so out a word about
reuse and that's where is that because I
am close that's all the fun of course
I'm not saying don't use then we use any
cash balance excellent example of reuse
is the sort of to become a very popular
is the external orient them or sometimes
internal open source model that a lot of
organizations are adult so an example
that would be netflix netflix this is an
example from netflix figures from their
open source web site obviously it's
netflix so they have each of these as a
film but actually in the bathroom behind
this incorporate each of these is a
small utility bill created to help their
developers solve common problems tends
to be infrastructure pedo it's all
infrastructure carries a Cassandra
library to help you talk to Cassandra
it's something to allow water scaling to
be more effectively than us its
infrastructure
but we used both shared limit so the
next point I'd like to bring up is this
idea of standard application process so
what we're talking about a top level of
HTTP with Leonard Richardson is I guess
https up as a as a protocol when we talk
about application protocols on means
something slightly I'm lobster if this
Jody translates at all into german but
moment Chomsky does the nestle Noam
Chomsky is interesting for Sparky he
uses the phrase time flies like an arrow
fruit flies like a banana to describe
the difficulty that computers have an
understanding language and processing
language I mean those two sentences are
actually identical but the meaning is
very different in English even though
the structure is actually identical it's
it's hard it's hard to program machines
to actually understand the nuances
involved in processing national language
so what does that mean when you go
trying to build and connect lots of
these small applications well it means
you're in a bit of a pickle frankly
unless you do something like choose a
standard protocol so this is because
this is what I'm talking about is the
idea of something for the semantics yeah
the semantic gap on read it
characterizes the difference between two
descriptions of objects by different
linguistic representation sounds that
sounds tribute effectively what it
means is if you've got one interface
that's exposing a link will control with
the reference registered to create a
user and another one create how do you
program a client to know which of these
hypermedia controls they should be
so we standardized on application
critical in fact as I say because Jim
Weber here obviously to large pot works
were with us a long time the Rope is
fantastic rest in practice that we
standardize on RF CD 5023 which
obviously everyone from immediately
identify as
so I'll figure it's basically acting pub
so this is more you usually seeing
Wendell trans earlier with you blog feed
reader or so on you'll do really in
human things with accidental atompub
autodata I guess as a hatred of you
tonight um after my Latin pub it
standardizes the sort of things you can
do between these systems the sort of
operations you so it describes the idea
of work spaces which are composed of
lists of collections with the medicine
these are composed of these in these
collections individually those
collections are then composed of entries
and the entries are composed of contact
now I'm going to go out on a limb here
and say this is basically soap remember
wsdl whistle this is effectively so kind
of in the sense that what you get with
this standard critical is an envelope
and a set of operations that everyone
can understand something not was always
tell you anything you kind of like Lena
but it did have the idea of an envelope
with common metadata and then a payload
underneath it well atompub does is give
you on top of it acts on top of the
envelope and the payload a set of
standards of operations which means when
you've got systems of systems talking to
one another you have a set of standard
operations that you can program clients
against and that's a really useful thing
to be able to sew it all will the
hexagons again this might new mic post
on one side post post doing users
collection and postal users collection
on the other and in this case this is an
example of the post we're posting
entry in order to crazy that's us that's
a standard that's something that the
standard DRC gives and all of your
applications are able to use that stand
and understand how to go about adding
deleting editing particular particular
bits of information within you or within
your domain a not i'm going to reiterate
i'm not saying everyone should use
accent pub all the time because i think
that would be crazy you should pick the
right solution obviously for your
particular set of circumstances so if
its messaging it's going to be a
different solution but it might be an
into of the internal application for a
scholar he developed but it's very
useful to have a superior a common
application protocol that each system
can use towards one
back to our capability in this case we
had a user request on collection and we
have entries underneath user requests
which you post which is basically post
axle entries into the collection and
that would represent the creation
operation so the next thing I think is
really popped in full flight is this
idea of architectural degrees of freedom
in your system the idea that we should
be able to flex in multiple different
ways as much as possible the systems of
the mill around different different axes
so back to my scary stories use the name
so in this case it was an act it was a
it was a client about three years ago
and they have to have us a fairly
standard big database the applications
in on top of it digital interested in
this client is they had multiple
different products didn't product lines
insurance effectively within product
lines within this application so they
have some home insurance that car
insurance that had credit card insurance
lots of different products within this
one single application and that was fine
that was fine but I happen had some
interesting constraints specifically
around things like scaling for full
performance the home insurance part of
this application cutting a reasonable
number of pieces the money
poverty didn't have that many at all but
actually Collins ever noticed that has
fallen trade this is worth it man I need
to make money by for you they had lived
in those users and the scary thing with
this you've got this one big application
is if you can't take advantage of the
fact that you can put these on to
business as machines so effectively law
you'll buried it by the biggest
application of here and there was
another problem that they had respect
them this was a real business problem
because it meant they couldn't actually
change so at this one big application
and one of the perks or several approach
although different change cycles so the
motor insurance site say was quite
stable whereas the home insurance was
being actively developed and the problem
comes when you've got these two things
these cycles mixed together and people
have come across bay street maps
operating currently in the lean world
this is a real nice dream of this
organization which is how long it took
to actually get stuff done for
particular one of these products so in
the very street map the top lines are
the value learning activities basically
so you know it might be three days worth
of development are one of our days of
testing and then half a day
set on the bottom you've got mail amount
of time they had to wait for other
activities to go so actively if you add
up all around a single change was ended
up taking a massive amount of time they
wanted to change an image on one but for
one particular approach a matter worked
on the release cycles of a completely
different products and this was having a
massive impact on the ability to get
stuff done both of the teams and was
really limiting the ability of the
business to get change out the door and
make effectively more money which paid
our wages which is also looks which
sucks so if you've got this world of
sort of my gratifications microservices
different business capabilities how does
that impact this kind of these degrees
of freedom do you have more easily by
that you do have more degrees of freedom
when you break things I hacked into
smaller chunks when you separate
different parts of your domain different
value context and in two separate
applications you can as an example
deploy the end of the capabilities on
vin boxes right you can deploy more than
one on a box you can deploy two or
different ones on on the same box you've
got more options you've got more
flexibility you're able to more easily
over better that affect your deployment
options with with your performance and
with little change cycles and so on I
did sort of have a title adaptive
architectures and organizations I think
that's really quite part of this is the
idea of where teams fit in
where things like technology choice
fitted in this world they're probably
doesn't surprise you or with thoughts
and that for weeks away from a big
believer in using the right tool the job
not being limited by by by using a
single till the time and what these sort
of this sort these sorts of
architectures give you again is more
degrees of freedom when you can to
choose different tooling implementation
so as an example declining one at the
moment the project were working on we've
got a number of these dif business
capabilities split at we've got it's a
generally a net shot so we've got two to
deliver implemented in c-sharp and then
we've got the note that service it's a
capability that's doing our real-time
monitoring so it's an event bassist and
so we've got a really cool real-time
preventing going on and we're able to
monitor that I'm using those few tools
on top of days to do that but it's
expect this we can actually choose the
right tool within the bounds of that
capability you can give your team's the
option the ability to choose the right
tool within each of these act within
within each of these values for X
similarly we're actually using fifth
days basically so the reporting database
is sequel server I think you've got the
others another sequel server database
right he's in mono for our production
environment for our events tours and
this pasta we're in to choose different
tools depending on the right
characteristics of a tool to the problem
of trauma soul rather in one big thing
that we have to use
I saw something with a nervous tissue
that probably makes amazing and finally
not finally um and ultimately I will
talk about design of replace ability I
think this is a really powerful idea as
well busy if you've got this business
penalties which equates which are which
are protected by the kind of hexagonal
boundaries important word that example
business capabilities if they're
protected by a car standard interface
talk about cyber world is you can
actually within those you can actually
replace parts of them and then isolated
from from other fast view of your system
so as an example we actually started off
this is this is the Congress the current
system we started off with sequel
servers and along the base base and we
decided that actually probably want to
use near to do some there's some big
data analytics stuff and that that's
fine we could actually influence that
these important adapters actually get
rid of them now these these applications
are small the actual cost of replacing
these things or thousand times retail is
not backwards the cost of replacing two
hundred thousand lights everything you
put a really big application that's that
significant the cost of finding a seam
to be able to fly off apart of that
professional the cost of accident but
this gives you a different different
options different degrees of freedom
when it comes to replacing parts of the
application design workplace
actually think that should be it's on
the software engineering Institute
non-functional requirements list as it
has a new as a new person on contour
line along the maintainability
performance business so finally on the
talk about product teams and prob lines
and this is something that's sort of
emerged very much from the kind of lean
software engineering management it's it
fits very well of Engineers delivery in
the continuous delivery techniques a lot
of people are implementing there but it
also fits sprayed with all of this like
let's say that so this is a sort of
standard enterprise right you've got
your motivational fish stevedore
operations group probably awesome
developers SI labels and testers there's
lots of handling of requirements between
the two the project management office in
orbit around la sierra bags apologies
the program program managers in the room
and then on the other side of this
bottom line you have quotes the business
the business and down down low and mine
fowler do the talking i think it's
called the you'll incur a subdued it's
not so much a device this enormous gap
generally between 19 comments and the
business the businesses that they did
partly well yet if you think about no
idea of Prada blinds and product teams
this is the idea of bringing
cross-functional teams together
organized around specific products and
in our world in this world in Billy's
business capabilities which can
implement specific products any kind of
start to look a bit like that you can
have individual teams formed around bees
and this is kind of nice business is
something but some sort of been bubbling
around with the industry while the idea
of Conway's look when I say why loving
commonly wrote this in 1968 so
organizations which design systems are
constrained to produce designs which are
copies of the communication structures
of those organizations damn law says if
you are seven people thrive and piloted
07 asking pardon basically it's the
reason you get database to use services
evil middleware teams and web teams all
right if you if you it's the reason you
get websites talking to services talking
to a database if you've structured
organization I think there's an
opportunity to actually use this idea of
of your systems Murray niall team
structure try to reinforce some of the
architectural goodness that we kind of
think back right so so we can actually
model our teams around these
capabilities which are modeled around
prague lines and reinforce the
distinctions between these different
systems so in this world back to this
set of their set of capabilities what
they ended up looking like was a number
of teams these are story points on up on
the red cards and team sizes but in each
of these teams was distinct and was
delivering one or two capabilities so
other staff I said I wanted to talk
about evolutionary architecture and
inertial design and other services so
really what I've talked about I'm sure
people in the room are aware is is I'm
standing on the shoulders of giants a
lot of this stuff is not new necessarily
in fact most of it isn't new the main
driven design and in context using
grasped to do systems integration using
things like Conway's law reasoning
principles from lean-to structure teams
around products using designing the
system such that you have different are
potential as ways of freedom these
things aren't needed right in fact
there's books with an acne and they have
been for decades so we've got release
its awesome like nine multi-bank design
just humbles concerns device materials
delivery wrestling practice but what
really i think this idea of micro
services does is brings a lot of this
stuff together in one place it's mainly
have the opportunity to do all this all
the time and it reminds me quite a lot
of units I mean that's what I on unix
means do I have another plan sandals
shape part of my beers offer it reward
that'd be betrayal it kind of reminds me
of all units always but this is a quaint
from from the Alliance commentary on
unix second edition this is a cultural
when the unit is first the OS was first
written when the original metaphors came
about and if this is a bad when this is
a bad way they had the idea of pipes
pipes and filters in UNIX and it says
the next morning we had this oddity of
one-liners everyone line I've let it be
said that everyone started putting forth
UNIX philosophy white programs that do
one thing I'm doing well statins are the
single responsibility right programs to
work together right programs that handle
text streams because that is a universal
enterprise the ideas are talking about
go back decades and decades we seem to
somehow manage to get ourselves into a
situation as an industry we just build
these massive massive mobilize and that
necessary thing about all the stuff
we've learned over a long period of time
and instead if we replace this partition
P as an exercise for the room for water
and how we r say so really I'm talking
about as I said consistent and
reinforcing practices these hexagonal
business capabilities are composed of
microservices Michael applications and
these you can rewrite rather than
maintain and they form this idea of a
distributed bounded context the
excellent is better this business in
ability and then you can deploy them as
you like but January
tell us and arrested operators and
services and supper plans and use
standard application protocol and
transport protocols between and also
standard Nexus tactics and finally the
cool fingers and the thing that probably
makes us relevant more more relevant as
ever being is the front ones of
infrastructure service requires so this
was we would have been really hard to do
without things like chef puppet NWS
broken which every whatever unity
lettering the functionality layering the
power you get from all of those
automation tools on top of these ideas
it gives you a really interesting
options near future so architecture is
all about the Australian ability this is
this is the degrees of freedom
maintainability and time to market the
fruit of the cost say portability versus
employability and replace ability versus
cost added new features basically every
three architectural original design our
approaches using these sort of
techniques that maximum is the options
you maximize
no it's fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
