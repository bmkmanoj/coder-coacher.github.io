box villain with mis he is a postdoc at
the Technical University of Munich and
also the co-founder of company called
see qfp welcome them hi Simon thanks
firing me everyone who are you and what
i am doing positive i earn my living
doing software quality analysis into
road on the one hand on a researcher and
in that role i'm interested in which
important characteristics of software
like quality can then LEC you tell us
about and my second role as a consultant
I care about what is actually useful
because there's many things that are
easy to metal for not Mary McDonald okay
if your clock and goes with it was about
a subset of your research and work in
practice what it is about my talk is
about how to debug software development
teams by looking at repository data by
that I mean will always have to
architectures we have a technical
architecture how system is decomposed
into subsystem and how they communicate
and we have an organizational
architecture like how a team is
decomposed into something and of those
two don't match problems arise and on my
talk I present analyses that show us
where mismatches happen and what the
consequences are typically informal
problems in the code a typical net match
is if two different sub teams need to
collaborate what can't really then a
typical workaround is that running team
copies code from the other team and not
just a bit of code but often like tens
or hundreds of thousands of lines of
code and then this code base is
duplicated and needs to be maintained in
two places and what we then see is that
back six has only happened one area not
on the other me of all the problems that
you have that you have a duplicated code
base and the underlying root cause is
that the teams can't really communicate
in the way they would like to do on that
code okay and how do
reacts to these filings pacifically
dependable but typically they glad to
know it but they cannot always rectify
the root cause sometimes it was a
deliberate choice to duplicate the
codebase to stick with that example and
sometimes they can't really change the
fact that the team in this setting
cannot work well together but then they
need to take measures to alleviate the
problem but for example you the clone
management tool to at least fix the bugs
in all the places where they have good
coffee talk okay but you were also show
a path to improvement so yes we do but
typically there's more or less 40 and
more or less painful solutions and it
always depends on the context how
radically change you can I want to do so
typically those analyses point on
problems but you require complex
information to decide which solution is
the best one this is beyond what a tool
can do this is where you experience and
interpreting the results and in knowing
the context culture do you maintain see
the database with all your analytical
findings yes we have an index in our
tool where we integrate all the data we
used to run our analyses on but it
typically stems from different sources
like from version control systems from
muckraker from traces from profilers we
run in production systems depends a bit
on the analysis question and it also
depends on the development and
production platform when you collect all
the data from many different kinds yes
what is it European is a very
interesting or very fun finding you have
across all the companies I think what
surprised me the most is that typically
when we first speak with the companies
they all say that they are special
because they develop on the time
pressure and I'm a lot of stress which
is really the unifying thing between all
different customers and like a first
glance and the method system what your
rising sea looks very different from a
whole
more than cobalt or an evap system which
runs on ASAP but if you take a step back
the problem you have if you have to
maintain those systems for 10 years or
20 are very similar they always have
things they always have architectures
and they need to match all the lies you
have to fix the problems that arise when
you maintain that software how did you
decide to work on this specific problem
all these problems good good question
let me think I think because these were
the problems our customers made at work
on when we did our PhD thesis on program
analysis we typically like looking back
what some problems that were interesting
from a scientific point of view for
example because they use a very
complicated algorithm but since we found
that the company we were forced to look
a lot of the problems that are relevant
much more than how sexy they are from a
scientific standpoint and so we looked
into these problems because our
customers suffer from them what our
future research directions in terms of
program analysis I think like the most
important research direction is to
reduce the feedback time many of my
analysis to run in a nightly build and
then you have to wait until next day to
get your results and this is this takes
too long especially if you run and run
in a multi brand development we're not
even every single branch the analyses
are performed and most of the research
work we've been doing is on incremental
analysis algorithms so that you get your
feedback after one second and one in the
next day and on multi-branch analyses
but so that we analyze all the branches
concurrently with the incremental
analysis algorithms that you get
immediate feedback which is relevant to
your work and not late feedback the next
day for the entire team okay so
basically it with me that we could
invent these tools in our IEP yes and
yes
instant feedback yes okay thanks for
going interview with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
