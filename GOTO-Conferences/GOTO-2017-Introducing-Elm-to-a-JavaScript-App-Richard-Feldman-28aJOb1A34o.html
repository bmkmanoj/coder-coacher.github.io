to a JavaScript app I'm Richard Feldman
so I work for a company called no red
ink we make software for English
teachers and back in 2013 we had this
sort of smorgasbord of j/s technologies
are using like some jQuery and some
backbone and some other stuff and react
came out and we introduced react and the
way that we introduced react was
incremental so we just didn't want to
say oh we're rewriting and react we said
let's just try it out and see if we like
it so we sort of planted this little
react seed we said we're going to start
with just one page and just rewrite one
part of it and react and see how it goes
so we liked it and it sort of grew and
grew and then by the end of 2014 it had
sort of taken over it became the
dominant paradigm of our front-end then
in 2015 we did a similar thing with Elm
where we said hey this home thing seems
like it would really help us out let's
just try planting a little elm seed and
just one part one page using some of the
techniques we're going to talk about
today and and see where it takes us and
since then it's grown and grown a lot
and now it's gotten to the point where
it's sort of taken over our front end
and it's become the dominant paradigm in
our front end and so this talk is
basically about some of the techniques
you can use to have the same experience
to plant this seed and get started with
Elm inside of your JavaScript
application so some statistics about us
so we have a little over two billion
questions answer bran tracks across
three billion is here we have a hundred
thousand lines of elm code which is as
far as we know the biggest elevates in
the world although I just met an
audience member who has apparently over
50,000 lines so there's people out there
that we don't know about obviously and
the entire time we've been running this
application I never get tired of saying
this it's been two years at this point
and the total number of runtime
exceptions we've gotten since we started
running it from our elm code is still
zero and we know this because we have
roll bar and we track all the many many
runtime exceptions that our legacy
JavaScript code continues to cause but
still none of them traced back to our
elm code
there are many other benefits they'll
besides this reliability but for the
purposes of this talk I'm going to
direct you to one of the many other fine
talks that you can find talking about
them and let's focus primarily on how do
we get this experience this zero runtime
exceptions experience
well interoperating with javascript code
that is prone to crashing on a fairly
regular basis in our experience so a
quick overview Elm is a functional
programming language someone asked that
earlier it compiles to JavaScript so
when you run the Elm compiler it goes
through and it checks your code and it
does type inference and stuff like that
to verify that all of its guarantees are
being satisfied and then at the end of
the day what the compiler spits out is
JavaScript so you hand that javascript
to your browser browser runs it exactly
like any other JavaScript and you're off
to the races the difference between elm
and other languages that compile to
JavaScript is that elm has completely
different semantics than JavaScript it's
not even object-oriented it's just a
functional programming language
so whereas something like dart for
example it's very similar to JavaScript
CoffeeScript has identical semantics in
JavaScript elm nothing related
whatsoever it's just treating javascript
to the bytecode it says we're just going
to compile to this and that's how you
get these guarantees is sort of the
differences in semantics and the
differences in language design choices
between elm and javascript so one
example of this is that elm does not
have no or undefined it just does not
exist in the language Tony Hoare who
sort of popularized null back in
all-gold w refers to know as his billion
dollar mistake because he estimates that
introducing and popularizing null has
caused over a billion dollars in
economic damage since he did it and he
has some regrets about Ted turns out
though there are actually ways to
represent the idea of the absence of a
value they don't have the downsides of
null where you can do it in a way that
can prevent crashes and make sure that
the compiler can tell you ahead of time
all the cases you need to cover around
that idea of the absence of a value all
values in elm are immutable
so in javascript you can mutate things
when you call functions they can mutate
things you're on any code it can mutate
different things this can lead to all
sorts of problems and potentially tricky
situations elm don't
to worry about that guaranteed all
values in elm are immutable
and finally elm functions have no side
effects so you may have been hearing
more and more about this idea side
effects as more and more functional
concepts get popular in JavaScript and
more and more libraries are issuing
warnings like make sure that this
function does not do side-effects please
because if you do side effects in this
function it's going to cause problems in
elm don't have to worry about that
because no elm functions have side
effects may be wondering what if you
actually need to do effects like you
need to talk to a server or something
like that we will get into that so let's
say that our goal is we want to get
these benefits we want to get to Elm in
production or from our status quo where
we have lots and lots of JavaScript in
production how do we get from here to
that goal ok so the answer broadly
speaking is Interop so elm compiles to
JavaScript and elm code can talk to
JavaScript code there are lots of
languages that do this
what makes Elm unique is the way that it
does it because the goal is to answer
the question how can Elm maintain these
guarantees while interoperating with
JavaScript which doesn't have any of
those guarantees how can we do this well
let's start by looking at some very very
basic code so let's say we have some
HTML on the page we just got this div
and we happen to give it an ID of elm
app and then we run this code that's
just L M equals document dot get element
ID L map and that's basically referring
to this element we've got up here and
then we're going to take that element
now we've got a reference to now and
we're going to call L main dot embed
passing that element in there so all
this code is doing is this is just
starting up an elm application it's
saying hey I got this element I want Elm
to take over that element and just
render into that element now this
element could be taking up the entire
body or it could be something very small
just one part of a page and using this
we have gone from having no Elm on our
page to having a running Elm application
now we can use this side-by-side with
JavaScript an existing JavaScript
application no matter how complicated
that JavaScript application is so to
demonstrate this I'm going to introduce
you to le
so le or the Elm live editor is
essentially like jsfiddle
for Elm but with some extra nifty
features thrown in it's written in elm
and so basically what we're doing here
is we're taking this react app that I
got online that sort of a movie
searching database and all we're doing
is we're adding a very tiny amount of
sort of a token amount if you will of
elm to it we have this really trivial
elm program all it does is say this text
is written in elm that's it that's the
entire program not super exciting but it
gives us the basic idea of how to do
this so down here we have our HTML and
all of this is representing primarily
the react tab but it has two elements in
here that we care about so one is div ID
equals app and this is how the react is
going to get so the react app is going
to get rendered into that element and
then similarly Elm is going to render
into this element so they just side by
side coexisting on the same page down
below we have that exact code that from
the slide the script that says app
equals L main dot embed passing in that
element okay so let's compile this
and I'm going to make this whole bit
smaller okay and here we go so now we
have this react app this text is written
in Elm but the rest of the page as you
can see is just this actual react app
and so primarily what's going on here is
all react stuff but we've we've
successfully snuck in some melt and
embedded it in the same page alongside
app so this also works we can change it
to you know search for Blues Brothers
because we're in Chicago there we go
shows up fine and I can also change this
text to hello Chicago and same thing
side-by-side coexisting great okay so
that's the very very basics of getting
Elm to run alongside JavaScript okay so
just knowing this knowing nothing else
we can use Elm for rendering not even
talking to JavaScript just coexisting
side-by-side and you might think well
that's not very useful but believe it or
not just having this simple paradigm of
a page with an elm app running and a
JavaScript app running this is actually
something that we have done and in fact
are currently doing in production so
this is our home page this is what it
looks like if you're signed out you're
just visiting the page for the first
I'm this is essentially our static app
static website it's just giving you
information about what our product does
and almost all of this page is just
plain vanilla HTML CSS JavaScript with
one exception up there in the upper
right that login button is actually an
elm application we've embedded using
exactly the technique we just talked
about and it's completely self-contained
it doesn't need to interact with any of
the rest of the page all it does is when
you click it it expands and then it does
some basic login form type stuff so you
type in your email a day late says hey
you didn't type in a password please
type in your password you put in the
password you hit login it sends some
data off to the server to say that the
correct email and password
send some data back maybe it gives you a
validation error and ultimately if you
do everything right then it logs you in
so this whole thing right here is just
an embedded Elm application in this page
again end-users don't need to know that
right from their perspective they just
say oh this is just an interactive thing
they don't really care what it's written
and they just care about what it does
okay so goal is to start from lots of
JavaScript in production and get to lots
of element reduction by planting a seed
like this right by planting some really
small bit of Elm in our existing
production code base so we can plant the
seed and then watch it grow okay but of
course primarily what we're in this for
is interactivity right that that login
form is not just sitting there
completely static it's interactive so we
can't really talk about interactivity in
El without talking about the Elm
architecture because this is how all
interactivity is done in Elm so the
basic idea behind the Elm architecture
so at the beginning is this idea of the
view function view function is just a
plain old function just like any other
that happens to take some arguments and
return some virtual Dom so the virtual
DOM is this idea that was popularized by
react and it's basically a description
using data of how you want the page to
look it's not actually running some
mutations on the page it's not changing
any Dom elements it's just a data
description of this is how I would like
the page to look and the Elm runtime
takes care of actually making the page
look like that so we've got our login
form over here and it's being powered by
the
runtime so this is the compiled
JavaScript that's sort of what the
browser actually executed this is sort
of a black box stuff the Elm runtime is
not something that we deal with directly
we just write an elm program then the
Elm runtime executes says so at the very
beginning of our page load or our apps
starting up we have this model and the
model represents our application state
and I really do mean our entire
application state in Elm this model is
just all of the state that goes on in
your entire running program and the
model gets passed to your view function
so there's essentially one you do the
first render you get your initial model
it gets passed to the view and then view
says ok I've received my arguments now I
will return some virtual Dom to the Elm
runtime the runtime says cool I see that
you've returned some virtual Dom that
describes a login page I will go ahead
and render that to the screen for you
great then a user type something in they
press login and because they clicked a
button they did some interaction that's
going to result in the Elm runtime
sending a message to Elm so a message is
a data representation of something the
user did this is like an action if
you're familiar with flux or redux the
basic idea is not to add an imperative
callback not to just register an event
handler right on the element itself but
rather to say hey when the user does
this action I just want you to send this
data to a function called update so
update receives that message that
describes what the user did and it also
receives the current model and using
those two it comes up with a new model
it says okay I see that the user has
attempted to login with this username
and password oh they left the password
blank so I'm going to change my model to
record there is now a validation error
and we need to render that to the screen
so once that update function returns the
new model the runtime passes that new
model to view which in turn uses that to
generate a new virtual Dom and return
that and the runtime will dis the old
virtual Dom the previous one that it was
given with the new one and really
efficiently come up with the minimal set
of changes to the Dom necessary to
reflect what you requested on the screen
so that's the basic idea there's one
piece that I've left out here which is
how do you actually do effect right so
we mentioned earlier that
functions don't have side-effects if I
call any of these functions if I call
update if I called you if I call any elm
function it's guaranteed not to do any
side-effects and certainly running an
HTTP request to the server to attempt to
log in is the side-effect so how do we
do that and the answer is essentially
using the same kind of paradigm that we
do with the virtual Dom so the virtual
Dom is just some plain old immutable
data it describes how we want the page
to look and a command is also just some
plain old immutable data which describes
some effects that we want the runtime to
execute so in addition to returning a
new model update also returns this
command that says by the way here are
some effects I want you to run and be at
once those effects complete the Elm run
time will send a message back to update
if there's any information that needs to
come back so in the case of an HTTP
request we're sending this data off to
the server and saying hey I want to log
in like this server will send some data
back saying hey here's what happened
maybe that was an incorrect username or
password maybe we're good either way
that'll be captured as a message which
gets sent to update so updated sort of
the brains of your application all of
your interactivity comes from messages
getting sent from the Elm runtime to
update that's the whole deal that's how
Elm programs become interactive ok so
how does this translate into
interoperating with javascript remember
our goal here is to preserve guarantees
right we're trying to have reliable Elm
system that's coexisting with a
JavaScript system with a completely
different set of guarantees while
preserving Elms guarantees and the
answer is using a metaphor for what we
just did literally so what we literally
just did we talked about how to talk to
a server right how to send data from elm
to a server and get data from the server
back into elm without violating any of
those guarantees so metaphorically
that's the same thing we're going to do
here so elm code talks to JavaScript the
same way that it talks to servers by
sending and receiving data back and
forth all right so if you're just
throwing data over the wall whether it's
to a server or to JavaScript and then
receiving data back over the wall from
either a server or from JavaScript that
paradigm effectively preserves all of
elms guarantees so here's an example
let's say we have this app J S which is
running our JavaScript code and we do
the same thing that we did earlier
document.getelementbyid IL nap
we're
call L my apt and bid passing LM now we
have this thing called app now what we
can do with this app is we can subscribe
to some information that we're going to
be sending from elm to JavaScript so
this a ports field is basically
describing conceptually the different
ways that elm can send data to and from
JavaScript so I call this thing here
data from elm code called it anything
could have called it foo or bar whatever
the case may be the SUBSCRIBE method
sets up a subscription for saying hey
every single time
LM set uses a command to send some data
to JavaScript I want to run this
callback right here so we're going to
get this data as an argument to the
callback this is something that elm is
sending to us over here in JavaScript
land and we can do whatever we want with
it right so we can do a console dot log
LM says and then just print out the data
to the console so in diagram form this
is what we're doing we've got our elm
architecture up here just like we had
before down here we've got co-existing
on the same page or JavaScript app and
somewhere in update we've decided we're
going to return a command to the Elm
runtime but unlike before whereas before
we had a command that we were returning
to the runtime that described talking to
a server sending data to a server now
we've got a command that instead
describes sending data through to
JavaScript and the runtime will happily
oblige so if we send hi as in this
command we say hey runtime I want you to
send hi out to JavaScript it says cool
no problem I will send that through and
then now over here when we have our
JavaScript code on our subscription this
callback will fire passing hi and so we
will end up console dot log else as hi
so that's all there is to it for sending
data from elm to JavaScript so this idea
of subscribing on the JavaScript side
and using a command to send it from hell
importantly we can do whatever we want
in here right console dot log talk to an
entire JavaScript library build react
from scratch and then instantiate it in
there anything we want to do this data
has now been thrown over the wall this
is something that elm no longer has any
attachment to so no matter what we want
to do inside JavaScript to mess with it
all of ILM's guarantees still remain
it's not holding on to that data anymore
so conceptually we now have a page with
an elm at
than a JavaScript app coexisting where
the Elm app can talk to the JavaScript
app it can send data to it and later on
we'll see how we can go back in the
other direction an example it is dream
writer so this is the first L map
location I ended up building initially I
wrote it in JavaScript though in fact
they gave a talk at Strange Loop back in
2014 about about this app when it was
just JavaScript because it was offline
first which back then was a lot harder
because we didn't have service workers
and apparently I'm a masochist of some
sort but at any rate now it's an elm so
how does this Interop work how did I
transition from JavaScript to Elm so a
good example of this is if you look up
here at the top this interactive toolbar
is ended up being built in l but this
stuff down below here this is content
editable and I wrote a bunch of really
custom specific JavaScript to mess with
content editable and have it do really
custom things I don't know if you've
ever gone down gone down that road but
once you've written that code you kind
of never want to touch it again content
editable is kind of a minefield so a
toolbar on the other hand is not toolbar
very straightforward we can just say hey
here's the toolbar and render it in
ailment in this case we're leave all
this alone this is just going to stay
being the existing JavaScript we had I
never actually rewrote that stuff but
now we need to - to interoperate right
we need to say ok coming from this
toolbar up here which is the L map and
to this JavaScript app down here when
the user clicks the bold button those
two need to interact I need to be able
to send data from the L map to the
JavaScript app saying hey bold the
current selection things like that so
sending data from the L map to the
JavaScript app and this is how we do it
with command commands in the same way
that we we just talked about so what
about the river sending data from
JavaScript over to L so one way to do
this is just initialization flags this
is not super interesting but it's worth
noting basically when you call L may
embed not only can you pass the element
you can also pass optionally some
initialization value that L can use to
set the initial model this is basically
just for the first render after this it
doesn't matter so this just ends up
getting set in the model or whatever the
the L map decides to do with it and then
from there on everything runs as normal
so initialization flag
they're one-way but what we're really
interested in is this sort of back and
forth communication like doing this on
the fly so here's an example of that so
again we have our basic set up that
we've been working with all throughout
we have this element we're embedding it
in getting an app variable for that and
now we have this new method called send
so this works a lot like subscribe
except in Reverse so whereas the
SUBSCRIBE took a call back that said
every time LM sends us data we're going
to run this callback and do whatever we
want now we're just saying hey send this
data over the wall to Elm those gates
are sending hey and sending that over to
L now conceptually here we have to talk
about a new source of messages so
previously we talked about how messages
can come from user interactions right
user click something and the L runtime
says cool I'm going to send a message
out to update what about global events
right things that are not tied to a
particular part of the UI what about the
location bar changing what about when
the user resizes the window there's no
way to put an event handler on some part
of the Dom when you're being embedded in
the middle of the body and so the answer
is Elm has this concept of subscriptions
and these are sort of global events the
global sources of messages that you can
choose to subscribe to on a case-by-case
basis like you can say I want to
subscribe to the location bar changing I
want to subscribe to the window changing
sizes and you can also say I want to
subscribe to data coming in from
JavaScript over this port and basically
say every single time JavaScript sends
me one of these methods one of these
pieces of data we wrap it up at a
message and send it to update again
updates the brains of the whole
application and message is sort of how
it communicates to at the outside world
cool so when the JavaScript app set
called that send method and says hey
send this string hey into into Elm the
runtime says cool we've got a
subscription that's listening for this
and I will wrap that up and a message
send it update and then again everything
else is the same so now we've got Elm
app sending data to JavaScript using a
command and JavaScript sending L map
back to sorry JavaScript sending data
back to the L map using subscriptions
and so again an example of having a page
where we've got both of these is
streamwriter so we talked briefly about
how we have this L map for the toolbar
and then we also have this JavaScript
app for the rich tech
editing I talked about when you click
bold we send data from the L map down to
the JavaScript app but what about when
the user changes the position of the
cursor like they move into something
that's bolted well we want to reflect
that in the toolbar right we want the
bold thing to show up and say hey you're
in a bold section now or if it's italics
show up italics
maybe both so to do that we need to use
this subscriptions idea to send data
from JavaScript back to ELQ and this
nothing can communicate back and forth
what about multiple and Ed's
like we've been talking about having one
elm application embedded in the page or
one JavaScript application embedded in
the page and those coexisting what if we
want to do both well turns out that
that's fine we can just do that if we
want to we can have a menu and say cool
I've got this menu element and this is
where an elm application for a menu is
going to go and that's going to be its
own self-contained thing but it can
communicate back and forth with
JavaScript and then later on as we're
making our app bigger and bigger we
think you know I want to be right the
sidebar NL and now I've got the menu
talking to the JavaScript application
the sidebar talking in the JavaScript
application that's fine they're
coexisting side by side take it a step
further right make the footer in Elm
sure that was probably not doing as much
interaction but no reason we couldn't do
it and this is something you can do
as stepping-stones to ideally ultimately
rewriting the whole page in Elm which is
kind of where we've ended up on a lot of
ways just incrementally changing one
piece one piece one piece until
eventually like you know it's just not
that much of a jump anymore to convert
the rest of the thing to L worth noting
though that if you do this you're going
to get the overhead of the Elm runtime
each time so this is not something where
you probably want to just you know go
nuts and say like I'm going to do 100
Elm apps on my page because that's going
to be you know there's gonna be overhead
to having the runtime that many times so
there are plans in the works to make it
so that they can share a runtime but
that doesn't exist yet so something to
be aware of ok so what about this
architecture you have the JavaScript app
and then there are multiple elm apps
that are talking to it this is actually
something that a company called circuit
hub which is one of the earliest Elm
adopters and production used and this is
as I mentioned something that we've also
done so here's an example of that so
this is the the teacher account
information page and basically this has
some some pretty standard metadata about
the teachers you know personal
information you
your password that's all well and good
you can link with a Google account or a
clever account or another teacher
account that you want to share content
with and we've also got this premium
code so we are eight we have a freemium
business model and so teachers can enter
a premium code here if they want to
upgrade to premium so this but believe
it or not this update account is a lazy
loaded LDAP so what do I mean by lazy
loaded what I mean is that until the
user has pressed this button there is no
elm code running on this page we're sort
of like prepared we've loaded it but we
actually haven't start we haven't called
embed yet so basically we have this
JavaScript where when the user clicks
update account we immediately call embed
right then at that exact moment for the
purposes of displaying this modal we had
this sort of reusable modal that we were
using for various places and we decided
we wanted to reuse it here and rather
than just going and pulling it a
JavaScript modal library or like that
we'll just embed an application in there
because as we've seen so far it doesn't
actually take that much so this whole
thing right here is just the the
embedded elm application and it's
triggered on the fly when the user
clicks update so there's nothing saying
that you have to start at the service
right when the page does
you can do it lazily but I mentioned
that this is an example of multiple
things
so once you've associated with a clever
account which was one of the buttons we
saw previously over here
you can then later on change your mind
and say oh I actually want to remove my
association with that clever account and
this is also an LDAP Legation again we
had basically a service written that was
for dealing with clever stuff and we
wanted to reuse it so we just said hey
let's just make this one little button a
lazy loaded Elm application so when the
user clicks it we just spin up the helm
application and go and disassociate them
from clever after of course bringing up
a modal which again is we're using that
same modal code so this is one page that
has multiple L map locations running on
it and not only that but it's not even
running any of them until you actually
click on something specific that needs
to do that particular interaction
another way you can do this is to use
Elm just for business logic you don't
actually have to embed anything visual
on the page if you don't want to this is
actually how we got started
so you
you can save a pizzelle my app dot
worker and so worker basically works the
same way as everything we've been
talking about what you can do send and
subscribe to communicate back and forth
between JavaScript and elm
but worker just doesn't embed itself in
an element it just sits there running
and is basically sort of elm as a
service for business logic and the
reason that we did this as our
introduction now this was actually the
very first thing that we did was we had
a big bucket of Forney business logic
that was really hard to maintain and by
forwarding it to Elm because Elm has all
these Knights guarantees in this nice
compiler it became a lot easier to
maintain when we when we converted it
from JavaScript to L so here we have the
idea of JavaScript in charge of the Dom
but LM just over here as a service for
business logic and this is how we get
started
second to last way that we can that we
can do this is just using Elm as a
drop-in component so here's an example
of doing this in react
so we're saying import Elm from react
Elm components which is an NPM library
that's designed for making it so you can
just drop Elm applications in to react
applications we've got something called
chat where we've got let's assume some
chat room and basically this right here
is the compiled Elm code so we we'd run
L make two to generate this compile j/s
we've imported this library and then
somewhere down below we have a react
component whose render function says hey
I want to return one of these L
components and basically all this is
doing is it's doing the stuff that we
just talked about except instead of
embedding in some predetermined div on
the static HTML it's embedding in the
actual elements of that of that react
component and so this library react
delma components is available on NPM and
here's the entire source code of it it's
just really not that much all it's doing
is just basically the stuff that we just
talked about and then some basic prop
stuff in case you want to passports in
and and that's really all there is to it
now this idea of having a jsap component
around an elm app is not unique to react
right anytime we have this ability to
communicate back and forth between these
things it doesn't matter if it's react
if it's angular its ember view meteor
anytime you have this conceptual idea of
a self-contained component with its own
states that can do its own side effects
and things like that an ell application
can be all of those things and it can
communicate back and forth with the
wrapper component which in turn can then
communicate with the library or
framework however it's used to doing
that but the most powerful idea of this
entire talk is the answer to the
question how far can we run with this
so we talked earlier about how the
virtual Dom is conceptually some data
that represents how you want the page to
look and we also talked about how
commands are some data that represents
conceptually some effects that you want
to run so we've got here's some data
that describes how I want the page to
look we've got here's some data that
describe some effects that I want to
have happen well interestingly all we've
been talking about here is how to
communicate between elm and javascript
using data so that we can preserve
guarantees but we also know from the Elm
architecture and the fact that this is
how our entire elm programs are built
our entire hundred thousand lines of elm
code are all built around this
fundamental idea of representing
effective data and as Dom updates as
data that we can use that in in the
context of sending data to and from
JavaScript and telling JavaScript not
just here's what I want you to know but
actually telling JavaScript in great
detail here's what I want you to do so
here's an example of that let's say
we've got an L map we've got a
JavaScript app sending data back and
forth Oh what if the data we're sending
back and forth looks something like this
the flux action or redox action you can
have a JavaScript app that's powered by
flux or redox or something like that and
the data that's being sent back and
forth is these actual descriptions of
specific things that we want done
parameterised with specific pieces of
data for how to do them as we've seen
from the Elm architecture this is all we
actually need to set up a fully fledged
communication between the two and the
best part about this is doing it this
way it keeps all of our guarantees
intact it's still this fundamental idea
of client and server so we can talk to
JavaScript we can interoperate with
JavaScript without worrying about things
crashing so if you're interested in some
more resources on this topic I viewed a
few to recommend so one is guy
Eleonora this is the official elm guide
it's got sort of from beginner tutorials
all the way up through Interop and
everything in between
there's a blog post on the Elm website
called how to use El Network and it
describes basically the the react
example of embedding Elm and a and a
react component pragmatic studio has a
free course on integrating element to
existing JavaScript applications highly
recommend them I've heard really great
things about like lots of people have
gotten into elm by using their courses
and this one's free
shameless plug I'm writing a book for
Manning called Elm in action it's
currently available for me but the full
version should be done by the end of the
year front-end masters I also did a
thing for them which includes a section
on JavaScript Interop that goes into
more detail on specific implementation
stuff than what we just did if you're
looking for Alan training I recommend
Chicago native Luke Westby who is
awesome he works for humble spark and
he's actually the creator of the le
application that we looked at earlier so
if this whole thing which is built in
Elm appeals to you and seems like
something that you would like to have in
a trainer I would definitely hit luke up
okay so to sum up we start with lots of
JavaScript in production our goal is to
get to Ellen production and the way that
we can do that is using nothing more
than this this is all it takes to get
your first Elm in production okay you
also have to write some code but as far
as the JavaScript side goes isn't it all
you need is some elements and some way
to render into it and then from there
all of the tactics we've been talking
about this entire time work out just
fine so plant a seed watch it grow
