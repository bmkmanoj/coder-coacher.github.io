know Corey and I have the pleasure of
talking with Tim Bray who did a
fantastic keynote last evening and now
we'll be looking forward to the video of
that coming out and those of you that
are heading to go to Denmark in
Copenhagen our hosts will have a chance
to hear Tim there yeah so glad to be
here yeah glad you could come so i've
been i've been wondering if I if I could
start never even have a question later
you know there's a lot of people talking
about how much the IT community has
given to them and they want to give
something back to the IT community and
we all know that you have given XML to
the community but what would you say
yourself was your worst what's the
biggest thing that you have given back
to the IT community oh gosh you know I
always have to stop and make this point
and I'm sorry because some people have
heard it a few times but I didn't admit
it to know okay yeah they were there
were 11 people on the working group
there were a hundred people on the
interest group supporting it there was
three co-editors I was the loudest most
I was known as the you know that was the
big loud no that was the chief marketing
officer for xml are you a part of it
right I was totally party yeah I guess
principal in you know in retrospect I
guess you know XML is probably the
biggest steak I put in the ground in
terms of helping helping the internet
community but you know I've done a lot
of other extra little things been
working in the IETF and w3c and even I
so may God forgive me a bit over over
the years and but i think you know i'm
not entirely out of energy yet and
really it's been awfully good to me you
know the internet and this professions
are not so good to me and i'd like to
really you know I've done out of careers
I don't need another career but I'd like
still like to make some contributions
I'm teaching a course now for the first
time in my life yeah well I think I've
done before but not for decades and
that's kind of appealing
yeah I think there's still lots more
work that needs to be done yeah I'm
terrifically interested in the issues of
privacy and confidentiality and I think
that we really owe it those of us who
are building the apps and and getting
paid for it really owe it to the
community to dig deep and take better
care of people's privacy and push back
against those who are compromising yes I
hear a lot of people saying that around
the conference's right now that IT
people really do have a huge
responsibility because we're building so
much of what people's normal lives are
using all the time absolutely and there
are some you know big low-hanging fruit
that people should be doing in the short
term for example you know anybody who's
listening to this who has an application
does your application work over HTTPS
even better does it work over all the
HTTPS with nothing ever sent in plain
tex well it should you know that's
something that anybody can get to with a
little bit of extra work and a little
bit of extra money and it seems to me
that the benefits of doing that you know
massively exceed the cost and
convenience and then there's you know
once we get past that there's lots of
other things we can start taking better
care because past passwords we can stop
using passwords where possible we can
have your really clear clean privacy
policies we can you know set up our app
so that they don't lock people in a lot
of people's baby in there there's you
know a lot we can do the question that's
a more technical question I'd actually
do applaud your remarks as I think it's
it's really just like essentially
asserting that you have a bug in your
program if you don't some more to https
i basically just shouldn't work right
you know Jason's the new XML if you want
and some some respects but those of us
that deal with systems over a long time
and those of us with the pros billions
or trillions of JSON data or XML day or
for that matter without it without any
kind of schema description we're stuck
in a world of parsing and guessing you
really comment on you know welcome
binary other two really two questions
there one is you know you know where do
you know shouldn't there be some sort of
you know schema applied in general I
mean there are there are proposals so
you think that some sort of description
so that when people add and drop
attributes as they're storing clicks
trees well um I'm definitely of two
minds it is clearly the case that there
are certain situations where having a
schema can be helpful if only because
the process of writing down the schema
forces you to sink in a clear you know
logically in constrained way about you
know what actually can go into your
language or your change format but you
know I got a note that Jason doesn't
have one and it seems to be doing okay
you know it's not holding it back I have
actually argued in the IETF that when
you're designing protocols you know
things at eight api's and protocols that
schemas can be actively harmful and
that's because I think that what are you
finding a protocol the most important
thing you need is a clear prose
description written you know by humans
for humans of what the fields are and
what their semantic sorry that's way
more important next the most important
thing after that is some nice open
source validation software that will you
know look at a message that reports to
be a member of this protocol and say yea
or no and that's because skin is by
their very nature are not going to be
able to test for you know really
important conditions like it's not at
all a telephone number or something like
that you know it's game I can't tell you
you know you have to go and look
elsewhere so so skinless can be
self-defeating in that I've seen people
you know invest so much money so
something like so much time and effort
in schema engineering that they neglect
to you know write down in clear terms
what they mean by an update message sure
underlying you basically specify the
type signatures but you also for the
protocol you specify a state machine so
plus you have a a textual narrative for
it that is a pretty effective technique
anybody need to hold what two people and
make sure that they write the textual
narrative down that is coherent and
comprehensible you know i would say for
all the criticisms with the IETF over
the years day I Jeff's actually done a
pretty good job of that of making sure
that people really write down you know
what that bit pattern means i think is
the reference implementation is a really
an excellent point maybe is a reference
implementation that's good people can
test against really i think takes it
takes it makes a living standard as
opposed to it oh you're right knee on
and my narrative of what's important in
a specification i mentioned the
narrative which is most important thing
and i mentioned the DD you know simple
addition but i didn't mention examples
which are actually equally as important
because the vast majority of people when
told to implement at RFC you know they
skip over all the pros I think go
straight to the example is it okay oh
the one that looks like that I I do that
Jenny how and so having you know good
clear examples is also terribly terribly
important what's your your views on
binary data formats versus textual oh I
think textual data formats are immensely
preferable in almost every circumstance
I mean you know there are exceptions for
example you know your ipv4 and ipv6
headers are our bit patterns and and you
can make a case that in that particular
since they are so ubiquitous in every
packet goes over the Internet yeah you
know the few a few extra bytes you save
on the payload are worthwhile online
lack of processing overhead but you know
there's been proposals for binary
implementations to both JSON and XML and
I just tend to not be impressed because
first of all I haven't actually seen
very convincing proof that it would
actually reduce the size of the payload
very much if you actually look at the
real work the paler doesn't shrink very
much and secondly it will depart faster
well prove that to me cuz I don't
believe it you know parsing is very well
I just did issue in computer science
we're good at it but an eric lee
sequential i suppose but in my
experience is that the runtime of both
excellent xml and json parsers is
dominated by memory management right
bye-bye you know allocating the stuff
you need to store the in a tree or
whatever that's in there it's not
dominated by the process of running
through the-- but you're right you know
for something like an ipv6 header you
can look immediately at the 28th bit to
see you know if it's priority writing or
something like that having said that i
tend to be very very skeptical of
demands for binary payloads in general
another question right no I think we are
time running excellent look forward to
seeing everybody in Denmark and this
book this autumn thanks very much Tim
okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
