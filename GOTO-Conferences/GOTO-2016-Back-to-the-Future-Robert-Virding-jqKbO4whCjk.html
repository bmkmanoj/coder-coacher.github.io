solutions we didn't invent cloud
computing at least not the name anyway
the name came afterwards yes so we're
hearing a lot at this conference and
other conferences about these fantastic
new ideas I mean there's processes and
actors and reactive programming and
messaging and stuff like this so we
thought the best way to get into this is
get ahead right and we decided we go
back in history to do this so we went
back in history about 30 years and
started looking at these new ideas then
to work out so we could get it for and
get ahead on them so when we come up now
we would be well aware of everything
that's going on how to do it so this is
what we're doing so getting back here
were wiring why do we want alling what
why invent yet another language even 30
years ago there were a lot of languages
so why do another one right and this
came back to the type of problems we
were looking at our problem to me and
this is from a thesis my boss at those
time wrote a lot of interesting about
the type of problems we were looking at
we're going to look at some of these
well a lot of points here but someone
especially interesting so for example we
start from the bottom even in those days
our system had to handle a lot of
concurrent activities with thinking
switches you might have easily have
hundreds of thousands of lines tens of
thousands of calls going on at the same
time plus all the other activity it had
to be fault tolerant yes you might lose
it call occasionally but the system must
never crash that just wasn't acceptable
okay it had to be reconfigurable while
it was running even upgrading software
while things were running again the
system must never go down not the
trivial things like upgrading the code
or stuff like that and you had the
requirement that actions had to be
performed at certain times or within
certain times okay till this divert very
hard requirements about this that when
something happened you had to have a
reaction within a certain time and this
just wasn't negotiable so the system
could never block ever anywhere I so
owling the language and the system
around our ideas for building the system
was designed to solve this type of
problem that's what we were after right
so we hardly is from the language we had
ideas how the language would be used and
how the primitives and the language
would be used so the reason our line has
the primitives it does is because this
was we found these were very useful for
designing these type of systems and our
long they are OTP it provides direct
support for solving these issues for
building systems with these issues yes
we have a lot of concurrency yes we have
to have fault tolerance no well yes we
have to do things within certain times
this system must never block and all
these type of things there's direct
support for doing all this how do I
build this stuff for now we get the
interesting thing here is we have what
we call the Allen ecosphere so on top of
the a line system the beam which is the
virtual machine here and the Allen go TP
libraries which surprise support for all
these features we are running the water
are running now a number of different
languages on this systems owling of
course naturally a relative a new one
that's come up is alexia which has
become very interesting on the website
we have LFE for those who like liz me to
do this we have a prologue we have a
lower system we have Joxer which is not
a lisp and all these are running on top
of the a line system using all the
features of the addling system and by
following ad say the rules of how to do
things all these languages can easily
openly interact with each other there
are no limitations I don't have to pick
one language through my system I can use
any of these languages I can use
multiple bush like use multiple
languages on the system because the
interaction between them is extra find
and easy to do right we can talk with
the outside world
have another system here weirdo thing in
gray and there are interaction
mechanisms but for the system to
integrate and because the the primp
these primitives are built into the
system itself into the be mailing OTP
level all the languages running on the
on the ecosphere in the ecosphere can
access them and communicate with the
outside world just because i'm using one
language doesn't mean I have to do it
myself because it's already there right
now the interesting with a thing with a
JVM we do actually have an extra
mechanism there because one of the
things you can run on JVM is our jungle
which is an implementation a real
implementation of our line on the JVM
and if you're using that we can use the
airline's its own distribution
mechanisms to communicate with them not
just running over the jato haven't in
the standard mechanisms of doing that if
you're interested now lying on the j JVM
our Chang's the way to go right so why
is this interesting so why is our link
relevant I mean we had all these things
with properties the system we were
trying to look at right we're trying to
solve now if you look at those
properties you'll find there is
absolutely nothing about telecoms in
there there is no telecom specific
feature there at all so yes they do
describe telecom apple systems but
there's nothing telecom specific in
there and that the same thing reflects
on the airline the OTP system on the
beam there is nothing telecom specific
about it it's all it's useful for
building systems which have these issues
these problems but there's nothing
telecom specific about it and what has
happened is that these type of problems
people have realized they are actually
very general there are many different
types of systems which have these
properties which have these issues so in
one sense the rest of the world is
caught up with us in realizing that
these things are actually important and
we were just up by going back we're out
very early designing a language a system
a setter design patterns rules for
building these type of applications
these type
systems right so that's why I'm airline
is still relevant or Israel it's even
actually even more relevant now than it
was before so I just want to wind up
with one thing here there's an hour-long
user conference here in September please
come you are all invited if you come now
we have we can give you a slight
discount price for as well too so that's
basically what do I had to say and I
made the time Hey yes so any questions
for Robert yes okay there are cases you
need both okay there are cases where you
cannot do that type of the other other
type of deployment you I have one system
I cannot take take the system down ever
have to have to upgrade it many cases
you can do that I mean if I'm running
multiple servers I can do a hot loading
I can just do hot loading and things
like this for it but there are still
cases where you do neither do need the
code reloading code on the running
system get that to work and it does work
it's not always easy but it does work
and when he do it it has a very
well-defined semantics of how it works
so you can use it and now other
questions it's not a hand ok so I
actually have a question yeah because i
just i just googled Erlang and micro
services and the first hit was a guy
saying you'll never hear an erlang
program or even talk about microservices
because they're a solution to a problem
that doesn't exist in the Erlang world
would you agree with that yeah what why
should we talk about micro services
which because that's what we've been
doing for the last 20
years why should we worry right well
okay I can just say one thing we have
been reactive we have been a synchronous
we have been actors everything like this
whipping buzzword compliant for 25 years
right so if we just don't really and now
you're even polyglot we're it yes cool
we've always been polyglot I mean yeah
sorry okay I can't get worked up about
thank you Robert okay so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
