in this software company called tri fork
and we produce software com software
developer conference called go to
actually a number of different places
but today here I'm going to talk a bit
about our go to conferences here in
Denmark we've been trying to figure out
how we could take this relatively large
event of a thousand plus developers in
Denmark and make it somehow more
intimate make it feel like a smaller
conference and so the new format this
year is there's a couple things that are
changed one is we essentially split this
one conference into four separate
smaller conferences that are just just
happen to be running concurrently so
that's the one kind of clear thing we
try you would like to try to define it
in terms of these smaller things we also
actually condensing trying to condense
the program we're changing it from three
day to a two-day conference which makes
it more likely that everybody will be
allowed to go for both of those two days
so again more it continues to day thing
with a narrower focus hopefully can give
you a more intimate feeling up that
conference as a conference maker a maker
of conferences you're always thinking
what is a conference now you're thinking
why do we have conferences why would
people want to go to them why do we want
to make them essentially very
existential II what is the conference
for for someone like me who's the
conference maker so for many years I've
been I've been feverishly arguing that
conferences should be places where you
go for inspiration you know we're we're
in an economy of modern information
workers that did you know need lifelong
education it needs to be be challenging
themselves and driving themselves
learn new things and in that way going
to conferences and inspirational event
where you can figure out what to go
learn for yourself because then that's
the place where you figure out what's
working for other people what new books
new topics new ways of working should I
try to learn because of course in a 45
minute speaking slot you're not going to
learn a significant new way of working
in itself what you're going to do there
is is realize that this is important and
you need to really learn it so that's
one side of conferences this is being a
smorgasbord at an overwhelming pool of
ideas that you can go pick from the
other side of it is ah is that of course
you also need to learn something and
there's been a constant push both
internally and externally from us as
conference makers to put more learning
into the conference something that you
can actually go home and use tomorrow
and that's the other part of what a
conference is is learning content and
we've always had these tutorials or
workshops full-day things around the
conference but this year we're also
actually putting it into the conference
content so that's another change that
like to talk about sewing in the
afternoons we actually going to have
longer sessions which are in some of the
tracks some of the some of the topic
areas some of these mini conferences and
and go to we're going to have long
afternoon talks where you can get more
in depth into particular topics and
these will be focused on things that you
can actually go home and use so is it
might well be aware we you know
traditionally been one of the larger
conferences in this in this area
worldwide and and this is not going to
change that we're going to we're going
to stay of course one of the large
conferences in this world and we're
going to stay on top of that but
combining that with the smaller groups
hopefully as to come to the event you
can both choose to to attend one of the
narrow for
Justin stay in that group and hopefully
get more of that experience but of
course you're always free to mingle and
switch and change and talk to other
people so in that way hopefully we can
get the bus the best of both worlds so
that's what we're working on we're
really condensing it slicing it it's
going to be a great experiment I think
you're going to like it
