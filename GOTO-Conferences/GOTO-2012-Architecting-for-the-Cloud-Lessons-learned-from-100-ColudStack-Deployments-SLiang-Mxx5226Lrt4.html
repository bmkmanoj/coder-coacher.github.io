cloud platforms group at citrix i joined
citrix last year when citrix acquired a
company I started called cloud calm and
cloudstack was the software that was
originally developed by cloud calm so I
think this to start without just give
you since this talk is a lot going to be
a lot about the development of
CloudStack and what we learned from it
especially so I just give you a bit of a
history of CloudStack in September 2008
you know was really largely inspired by
some of the work you know industry
pioneers like Amazon was doing we
started a company called vm ups and it
developed technologies a technology
called vm ops cloudstack and a little
bit over a year later was when we
shipped the 10 GA and about six months
after that we publicly launched a
company and the company's name was you
know changed from vm ops 2 cloud calm
and CloudStack at that time was launched
also publicly as open source software it
was GPL licensed at that time and it
also wasn't wasn't like a hundred
percent open-source it was just you know
we used to say in 99 percent of it was
was open source that we held some of
that stuff back as proprietary software
then about a year from that about last
year we were acquired by Citrix and you
know one of the latest development of
cloudstack is a april of this year
Citrix contributed cloudstack to the
apache software foundation so you know
from now on CloudStack will be known as
Apache CloudStack and you know for those
of you who don't know what cloudstack is
it is very much inspired by the
innovator of infrastructure as a service
cloud amazon namely and specifically
there amazon
you see to service so as many of you
know you know Amazon data center amazon
cloud underneath has a lot of hardware
resources that they manage networking
servers and storage and they've
internally used the open source then
hypervisor as the virtualization layer
then on top of that even more
importantly they develop a piece of
proprietary software they do use
internally to to orchestrate all these
individual you know thousands or tens of
thousands or even perhaps even even more
servers that they have who are
individually running the open sores and
hypervisor and once they put this
orchestration software on it I becomes a
cloud so what comes out of the other end
is it is an API that a developer can
consume and the developer can program
before you had that you know what you
had what people had to do before was if
you want to do anything in the data
center you actually had to hire
engineers that are certified by you know
say by cisco yet this hire engineers
were certified by the system companies
to manually configure all that data
center resources and and this is really
the great innovation that you know
amazon did a few years back when they
launched the amazon ec2 service but this
is just a service so what amazon also
has is they were certainly a market
leading e-commerce platform so they were
able to leverage that platform to sell
that service over the web and that's
where the amazon ec2 or emma's was born
as part of the Amazon Web Services so a
cloud stack was inspired by amazon ec2
you know we didn't have to bundle open
sores n hypervisor because there are a
lot of because citrix already make made
a open source hypervisor product called
citrix xenserver but as we start talking
to customers it turns out that for
variety of reasons customers prefer
other types of hypervisor as well so you
know as of today
we support a variety of hypervisor
choices and CloudStack is really a
hypervisor agnostic so the cloudstack
really takes the role of the cloud
orchestration software that is required
to turn that data center resources into
cloud EAP is and we have a this is not
the topic of this you know of this talk
but Citrix actually may also makes cloud
com Citrix also makes a piece of
software called cloud portal which helps
cloud service providers to run the
business side of the cloud so but but
but I'm going to focus more on the
CloudStack side of things from now on
and so so the reason we develop a piece
of software called CloudStack is really
based on a fundamental belief we believe
that you know the world is not going to
just have one cloud amazon or five
clouds or ten clouds we believe there
will be thousands of clouds and and
we're in a word where are those
thousands of clouds and so here I'm you
know I've got to access here on the
horizontal axis is is really about
whether the cloud was built to solve a
you know to be used as general purpose
infrastructure or used to run a
special-purpose application and then the
vertical side is is whether the cloud is
built whether the infrastructure is
built for internal IT consumption or
it's all it's built for a photo for
consumers outside so so that's the
difference between you know enterprise
IT and service providers so at the at
the bottom left and you really have the
very very well established industry of
people managing data centers for
enterprise and a big reason you want to
use those tools to do that is to
automate your data center management
processes and you can always argue
whether those tools actually is cloud or
is not cloud but actually for this
purpose of this discussion it doesn't
really matter it's a very
well-established space or very big
players in it a lot of the big systems
companies a lot
the big system software vendors and also
a lot of the big virtualization vendors
as well or in that space but as I said
you know we we would not have created
cloudstack had this was the only
business opportunity no it was clear
clearly a very big player whose is whose
a service provider who's taken a
different set of technologies largely
based on open source technologies and
created an infrastructure-as-a-service
cloud and from that it's a very small
step to imagine that there will be lots
of other data center operators who would
want to run launch similar type of
services so so they're easily hundreds
of you know service service providers
telecom companies managed hosting
providers data center operators
worldwide and we believe today's hosting
operation what's known as hosting
operational managed hosting operation
tomorrow will be cloud and you know we
move to the right they are really a set
of data center operators who don't sell
data center resources by itself but they
develop applications that run in their
own data center and and the Indian they
either offer a internet service or offer
software as a service and and those guys
historically have built the
infrastructure the old way and going
forward again their business is not
really very different from say Amazon
Web Services and we we see those players
on the upper right side to start
delivering on cloud infrastructure as
well and and finally the the area we're
really seeing a lot of activity is the
vertical enterprise cloud so these are
not necessary the clouds that would take
over the entire enterprise data center
but maybe part of the enterprise for
very specific applications so a good
example of that is I you know I remember
going to a supercomputing conference a
few years back and you end up meeting
some universities and and some of these
universities actually became very big
customer of ours because they had
essentially what used to be grid
computing supercomputing needs
and and naturally you know today the
there's no reason not to build it the
same way as you know as an Amazon style
cloud and similarly platform as a
service solutions which are now becoming
quite popular services like you know
Cloud Foundry services like Engine Yard
they need a set of infrastructure to run
on and and that in many cases those
platform activities also tend to cause
the infrastructure to be created and
they're always some of these more
forward-thinking businesses you know
businesses like Apple Nokia autodesk who
run a lot of death test work loading
house and they also looking to create
private clouds and specifically an area
that's very near and dear to citrix is a
part of our you know really our biggest
business is the is enterprise desktop
business and there's certainly a great
deal of a traction today running a
desktop services on the cloud in a
desktop in many ways per user per user
perspective probably consumes more
resources you know then the user will
ever ever want to consume as a as a
sliver of the server so all these things
represent a tremendous areas of growth
and and that's why we really believe
that the world will have thousands of
clouds and really this talk is about so
far we've you know we went in with this
belief and for the last four years we've
been building products and when by the
way we're not the only certainly not by
far not the only vendor in the space we
were not even close to being the first
vendor in the space but I think one one
area that we you know we decided to
differentiate was we were very very
focused on us finding real customer
needs and build the exact product to
suit those customers demand and and you
know so from the previous pictures that
there's really not much we can do on the
on the legacy data center automation
space so so the top left corner service
provider top right corner web 2000
bottom right corner some of the
enterprise specialty clouds you so we
ended up bill
200 clouds come in oil in pretty large
scale development today and this talk is
really about my learnings from it and
we'll discuss that so the first you know
the first big topic I one that discusses
is essentially about the definition of a
cloud and this is this is a very you
know this this seems like a very obvious
question because because it used to be a
very hotest you know discussion topic a
few years back at way I remember every
cloud talk was about what is cloud and I
feel still feel it deserves you know a
little bit more explanation and the
specific question I'm asking here is
what's the difference between
traditional style data center automation
which you know may or may not be cloud
but you know but that's certainly a real
business and specifically Amazon style
cloud what you mean what do you think is
the real business real real difference
so I actually went back and looked at
there's a lot of materials about about
the definition of cloud computing you
know certainly this is something I have
a great deal of respect for and and and
and it boils down to you know a number
of attributes things like you know a
cloud has these essential
characteristics on-demand self-service
broad network access resource pulling
rapid elasticity measured service and
and and I think there's more you know
I've also heard that some people say a
cloud must have API access must must be
programmable and I still think those
don't at the end of eight in my opinion
based on building all these clouds I
still don't think this any of these
things actually capture the essential
difference between good old style data
center automation and what we know today
as cloud computing as pioneer by amazon
so so what is the biggest difference
really i believe the biggest difference
is how to handle failures and that's
where cloud and and and silver
virtualization and data all that center
automation are very very different and
failures is a big deal and this is you
know some some data i quoted out of a i
saw out of a research paper down by a
couple guys from microsoft research so
they looked at data centers
Microsoft running kernel II and and
looked at how often those servers are
failing and there was the the number
were quite remarkable you know they said
eight percent of the server's failed
largely because of hardest failures
every year so it seems like a very big
number but of course you know it's easy
to work around hard disk failures
because you can you know you can have
raid controllers and things like that
but turns out raid controllers fail as
well and then there are lots of lots of
other other failures but server failure
is only a part of it you know even if
the server doesn't fail network could
fail or the software could fail or human
being could make errors when they when
they operate the data center so um you
know one of the and remember one in the
last few years I certainly worked with a
lot of data center operators in the O's
when they set up the network they all
sort of follow something like this this
is basically the best practice that you
know companies like Cisco have built
over the last 20 years is a you know you
know you largely follow a layered
infrastructure networking architecture
and you have redundancy pretty much at
every level and presumably now if it's
like flying an airplane everything is
redundant so then then although not the
likelihood of a failure is very small
right so it is it and actually I you
know I found another paper done by
another group of a Microsoft researchers
and they actually found that
specifically the network redundancy
hardware network redundancy mechanisms
really only forty percent effective so
like most of the time they weren't even
working and it turns out that you know
the biggest reason they found was bugs
as many of you probably know if you
write software you know it's easy to get
the happy path get the positive test
cases run but you know these negative
test cases the failover cases don't tend
to get exercise very much because
they're by definition a very infrequent
and and in other cases the the failure
mechanism is completely fine except the
admins didn't configure them properly
again because it's not supposed to
happen that often
they weren't really configured correctly
or tested and finally you know many of
these failover mechanisms again we're
working but but the way it was designed
to work doesn't necessarily mean that
the upper layer application wouldn't
know this at least a brief period of
outage you know sometimes it it caused
the TCP connection to timeout or took a
few minutes sometimes it caused the
spanning tree to have to be reconfigured
and again that could take you know from
half a minute to a couple minutes and
when something like that happens the
application notices and the application
fails so at the end of the day failure
in a large-scale data center when you
talk about percentages like this right
eight percent failures of servers every
year and a networking again had failures
of failure is just especially when you
have scale you know it's just
unavoidable you know when I am NOT
making this presentation on a laptop and
I don't expect really expect this laptop
to fail and I think it's fairly unlikely
it's going to fail but but if I got
10,000 of them then you know then their
failure is going to happen every day so
so here's you know our customers and all
CloudStack users are basically left with
a few not very good choices and some of
them you know really made some of our
some of these earlier builders of a
cloud they they made a mistake of
basically promising their users that
they you know because we bought good
hardware because we installed good
software we we implemented
enterprise-grade practices so we're
going to we're going to supply you a
enterprise-grade infrastructure that's
not going to fail and really when it
fails it's usually a you know public
relations nightmare sometimes they lose
customers customers get angry they
scramble to get things recovered so this
is we still see that it's very much the
norm in the you know in the in the
operator industry from both private
clouds and public clouds it's a big
problem then people get you know a
little bit smarter and they they realize
you know situations like a is really
unavoidable so really the best they can
do
is back up and they would do the back up
for users so if things fail then at
least you know there'll be an outage but
the least user won't lose data they can
recover the vm and and and this is by
the way before amazon happen this is
pretty much the state of the art but
still this is really not as good as what
amazon doing they basically tell people
to expect failure and if you want to
backup your data it's your own
responsibility and you have to handle it
yourself so uh so I mean you think about
you know a customer of ours Zynga
they've you know they build a the
building application in a in a
distributed way that they can
automatically scale and recover and this
specific application runs on not just
one data center to data center Bradley
runs on four datacenters both they're
both the Amazon availability zones as
well as their you know their in-house
private clouds e-club biltong built on
cloudstack and and they've run they've
certainly encountered some pretty big
outages namely there was one you know
there was those fairly well-known last
year when you know when when the entire
East East Coast zone pretty much when
other commission for a while but their
application was probably impacted in a
certain way maybe the users saw you know
some degradation of performance but but
there was no worldwide out a joke or the
service wide outage because again they
build the application to to recover from
failure so really what what you know to
me really the biggest learning out of
this whole thing is not all workloads we
had to deal with are the same you know
you can call them all cloud workloads I
don't want to say you know the
traditional workload is not cloud of
workload but there's a different type of
but a lot of the traditional work souls
are very different from amazon style and
technologies that i listed below you
know that they were really developed by
the computing industry for the last 30
40 50 years are really designed to
handle traditional workload so tech not
technology is likely
asian multipathing right vmh a for
torrents live migration any type of
strong consistency whether it's a
database level of file system level all
these things that they've designed so
that the app developers really don't
have to worry about infrastructure
failure and if you know the physical
machine actually fails then at the
infrastructure layer you know at the
hypervisor layer or at the operating
system layer you know things will still
magically happen fell over to make sure
the application stays up and that's not
how Amazon style cloud works the you
know certainly because things can fail
you as a program as a developer have to
worry about taking snapshots or backing
up data yourself you have to treat
resources there's femoral resources
they're good when you can when they're
available but they you know they can go
away at any time you know chaos monkey
is a term I I heard from netflix a
couple years ago and and and again to
address the issue that because failures
is so seldom encountered real failures
and you can't really most people are not
testing them very well so you basically
have to introduce artificial failures at
random just to make sure that that your
application can stand up and if you
can't rely on you know individual
cluster with reliability or host
reliability or even data center
reliability then multi-site redundancies
pretty much the only thing you can
counter and and and now instead of
talking then instead of talking about
strong consistency you talk about things
like eventual consistency so um so you
know a lot of it I was just at the
eventual consistency talk I mean it's
just a theme about you know what's cloud
and what's traditional and you can see
it's it's it they're quite remarkably
different and we've seen indeed how
people build cloud like cloud one of
them one of the big one of the big value
that you know in the early days when we
were started we were out there trying to
sell something called CloudStack help
people compete with with a lot of
competitors and we always said yeah
because we're startup our system is very
flexible and will be whatever you want
to do well you know you can configure a
CloudStack to do it for you but over
time
over time if you if you look back what
what those clouds look like they tend to
fall into one of two buckets one is the
type of availability zones that were
designed to handle traditional workload
so that's where you know like the vmware
vsphere hypervisor or a citrix xenserver
enterprise largely depends on hypervisor
clusters and hypervisor management these
things usually built on sand they build
on enterprise-grade networking and you
use enterprise app management tools on
top of that whereas on the other hand
for you know customers like Zynga who
are really just trying to replicate
Amazon then it they you know they tend
to instead of dealing with clusters now
they're dealing with racks and racks of
servers in many in some cases tens of
thousands of racks and and that's where
open source technology comes in people
use xenserver or kvm they use local
storage as opposed to San and there are
lot of innovation now going on in again
inspired by amazon cloud is something
called elastic block store and it's it's
basically data center wide block storage
it's not just limited to a particular
cluster but the storage itself scales
and you know it replicates within a data
center and you can take snapshots and do
backup very efficiently so these things
are beginning to we're seeing seeing
these things are beginning to come to
the market and this is also where but
once the network scale is the
opportunities of software-defined
Network now comes up briefly talk about
that also and some a lot of the
third-party management tools that
nowadays being created specifically for
the cloud workload you know solutions
like rice scale in Stratus really would
not have had a market in the old data
center automation days but with the you
know with with cloud workload it is
different enough that it justifies you
know these great new businesses to be
built the other thing you know that I
really learned this object store is very
important and if you you know I here I I
show you they're actually there's a
small
steak on the on the slide it says
availabilities on 12 it should be three
so there are three availability zones
I've distributed the app across three
availability zones and as front end it's
you know relatively simple you can have
you know you can load balancer today the
load balancers they also put some type
of a global server load balancing or
elastic load balancing so you can you
know either through DNS failover in some
cases actually even at a tcp/ip level
failover the user you know you can have
active active service and user sessions
will be fell over from from one
availability zone to another but the
question is what about back end you know
historically if you had enterprise
workload what's being very common is
people do disaster recovery they do
remote replication but you know but when
you have active active set up out of
more than two data centers you it's not
easy to even do replication and and and
and that's why you know services like
Amazon s3 is so important you know
people nowadays have learned to build
services that depend on a you know a
largely consistent eventually consistent
object store that that you know that's
really something you can depend on you
it doesn't really give you the same
transactional semantics as a you know as
a my sequel database but it gives you
enough guarantee that you can still
build a web-scale application and so we
these days we see customers there
stirring the minority but we certainly
see customers they would use the same
apache cloudstack deployment to manage
both styles of of workloads to actually
host both styles of workloads and
typically for amazon style workload you
see things like they use technologies
like object store and for traditional
style workload Andy they would still
depend on you know traditional
replication dr technologies to do to
make sure that the application is robust
and um there's that i mean i think once
i was i was at a talk by you know by
done by a really good service
cloud service provider and there it was
the claiming that you know they only
their cloud was the true cloud where is
a lot of the more enterprise clouds are
not real clouds because again for a lot
of the same reasons I I was just talking
about but I think there's you know
there's definitely some some validity to
that and and it is it you know I mean
instead of using the term to maybe we
should say Amazon style cloud right what
is what is an Amazon style cloud what is
really something that's closer to data
center automation or traditional
Silverbirch virtualization and and then
basically they're obvious setup
questions you can ask you know if if a
cloud is built on sand or veal and it's
probably not a amazon style cloud if
it's you know if it doesn't even running
multiple data centers or it doesn't
involve a distributed object store or
there's actually a single point of
failure then it's not Amazon's to help
crowd so going back to you know hundreds
of deployments that we've done what what
do you think people are really doing
these days you know it's cloud computing
really taking over the world is Amazon
your Amazon service is growing like
crazy right so so what do you think
these service providers are doing you
think they're really afraid of Amazon
and trying to replicate amazon service
that's what we thought but that's not
what they're trying to do across the
board you'd almost uniformly we see most
service providers for variety of reasons
don't believe they can compete with them
as though they don't want to compete
with Amazon so if you kind of look at
service most of the service for either
clouds building cloudstack they largely
resemble something like data center
automation they you know they largely
automate their VMware clusters or Zhen
Zhen server clusters and they largely
handle things like like like vlans they
do side to side VPN connections it's
it's very much traditional style you
know amazon style is really taking off
in in the web to double space is this or
the SAS space there's not a lot of any
of course in the you know in a
traditional enterprise still the
the the traditional style cloud still
dominates so so you can see with really
all this excitement around amazon or the
excitement around cloudstack around
building amazon style cloud building
real scale our cloud scale is a big
issue the reality of the industry's you
really still got to do both there's no
there's absolutely no doubt that the
growth majority of the of the new apps
are written to run our Amazon style
cloud majority of the Greenfield
opportunities are more amazon like then
then traditional like but but you know
but it takes time for a new paradigm to
completely take over so so next I'm
going to quickly talk about some of the
networking aspects of building a cloud
you know a data center here I actually
have two data centers to availability
zones connected through some type of a
VPN and if I blow up you know one of
those data centers CloudStack data
centers they kind of look like this
generally that you know internet traffic
go through the router and it is usually
a load balancer because any type of
cloud service you know it would be
spread across many VMS and you need a
load balancer to distribute the traffic
the increment NH a solution and if it's
distributed in multiple availability
zones accident Geographic load balancing
becomes very important then then when
you go inside the data center that the
networking is pretty standard it usually
just follows the you know the multiple
layer from from layer three core switch
to two then to distribution switch
access which all the way down to the top
of the rack switch so that's pretty
standard although there's some
innovation going on there as well but
but largely I don't think there's a you
know there's a huge problem there and a
cloud architectures are generally very
rough very very easy to replicate so
cloudstack as a concept called pod but
you basically can just just you know
just create a part and just scale them
one part at a time and CloudStack
management server itself is it's a
different setup because you know that
you need it you need a management
infrastructure just to manage all of
that stuff so typically what people do
is they set up their own
another set of load balancer you know
another set of servers and database
servers just to run cloudstack
management and and and and you can do in
a remote a failover of CloudStack
management server as well so so so a you
know a production scale CloudStack
deployment at places like those web to
other shops look pretty much like this
and and one thing I kind of like to
point out here is one of the big
difference between this picture and
majority of the you know enterprise data
center today is you you see there's
actually no firewall and and it's been a
big a bit of a problem because of
because in a lot of our large-scale
deployments it's very difficult to scale
the follow you know I like load balancer
which terminates TCP IP connections its
application level of thing it's
relatively easy to scale far words like
a layer 2 thing you know layer 3 thing
it's not easy to scale and if you were
you have a webs you know there's really
not a big enough for today that can
handle 10 gigabit up traffic or 50
gigabit of traffic in line so that's
kind of becoming a problem and that's
why you know amazon create some of these
new cloud networking concepts one is
called security groups many of you
probably already know but but just in
case why we need security groups because
the deployment of these virtual machines
inside data center doesn't follow a set
topology so you have you know you have
these pods and racks that did a pretty
uniform and then and then you're running
a web application and it starts to grow
so you keep creating new web pm's at
some point you need a database vm now i
have i need more data but web vm not
needed and yet another database vm so
now you have a situation like this which
make it very difficult to just use the
traditional you know two-tier networking
or physical flowers to separate these
type of workload right so that's why on
amazon or with CloudStack we have
something called security groups which
basically uses the host-based firewall
to provide access control so we can say
the database security group all the
virtual machines in the day
a security group can only be accessed
from the web VMs and then now the web
VMs can be accessed from the internet
but nowhere else or from the load
balancer so so that's you know that's
really how the concepts of security
groups work I mean I think the first
time I use security group on amazon I
thought it was a little weird it's it's
it's not a you know it's if you if you
know Cisco you like Cisco you feel like
linksys you know neck year this is not
the kind of concept that you deal with
every day but but it really makes a lot
of sense if you have if you have a large
scale like this right but but
unfortunately you know security groups
doesn't deal with layer 2 so it doesn't
support broadcasting where sometimes
it's necessary and that's why people
still do VLANs you know VLAN is a very
popular a deployment option with with
call stack especially for traditional
style workload so with real and is the
simplest thing of all it basically
virtualizes the land and and it turns
one wire into four thousand wires and
you can you know you can just allocate
these wires virtual wires to two
different users I've user one with its
own virtual network with user to with
its own virtual network this is all good
until you know real and stop scaling
there's a limit on how many v lines you
have this limit out how many v-line that
that that each switch can support so so
sometimes you are you know also when you
use VLAN aggressively you know even even
hypervisor or sometimes even the switch
firmware tend to intend to expose bugs
tend to tend to stress those up you know
those those software and hardware issues
and that's why you know this big
buzzword now called sdn that's not
really kind of becoming popular and at
citrix we've actually been investing sdn
for a while or you know the the citrix
xenserver was the really the first
hypervisor with open floor building as
the default option for for network for
for the for the networks which is will
open V switch and with open V switch
with the same problem we had before what
we were able to do is basically allows
you to create these gie tunnels very
easily class
I can create it directly we orchestrated
all of that those ggie keys and open
flow rules and you basically no longer
have the limitation of that you know
that comes with them you know that comes
with v lad so a real deployment for for
customers is a little bit more
complicated than that you know sometimes
the customer probably want more than
just because you know because Gies are
good but they don't they don't they
don't talk to the real you can't talk to
the real internet through a GI eternal
you can't talk to a you know a ipsec VPN
device a real Cisco device through it
through a GI Utah know yet so what we
what you know what what what class back
today can do is we basically allow you
to configure a mixture of VLAN based or
you know giu based networking and then
you can create a bunch of networking
services like in this picture you know
we have a we have internet traffic
coming in on the left you know through a
public read line through the netscaler
load balancer and then the traffic just
get distributed to the on to all the all
these web VMS the web VMS then then
dispatch the traffic to the app
application server vm the appearance of
a vm built on the database vm and then
all this all this stuff is connected
through it through mpls so i can set VPN
back on to the customer premise so we
have customers that that do this sort of
stuff every day today and a networking
is really an area we learned a lot over
the last few years while we build
cloudstack to solve those type of
problems so cloudstack today let you you
know support a variety of network
services out of a variety of service
providers I mean a service provider
could be a virtual appliance or could be
a physical appliance could be you know
something like it could be like you know
the
it could be a SDM provider or it could
be one of the you know more traditional
network infrastructures those done by
Cisco and you also can isolate network
traffic between tenants in different
ways of finally so I talked about you
know I talked about different style that
workload I talked about a cloud
networking a little bit and the last
thing I want to talk about is open
source as I explained earlier you know
when when CloudStack was initially
developed it was closed source software
we we focused on just get a lot of
customers make sure the cut the software
really works and at some point we
realized you know we realized open
source was really the way to go for for
for cloud computing and our initial
effort into open source was around the
GPL software and and we also only open
source part of the CloudStack packages
not the whole thing and then we realized
earlier this year the apache ways is
really the right way to go not only it
fosters truly collab collaborative based
you know software development it is
especially suited for the type of
software that's been kind of developed
either by a small group of people or by
a corporation like so it's relatively
mature it just works and because because
Apache really really focuses on quality
you know you when you you know when you
have a website to set up you just
download the Apache web server and you
just use it you don't really have to
worry about it too much things like
Apache web server things like Apache
Tomcat Cassandra Hadoop you know
Cassandra was developed inside Facebook
then it was contributing to this apache
software foundation likewise Hadoop was
developed inside Yahoo it was then
contributing to the apache software
foundation what couple other things I
really like about the Apache way was a
was it's a it really focuses on the
grassroots the open-source adoption you
know one thing that that a lot of people
don't know is a is big companies don't
have any standing in the software apache
software foundation you cannot companies
are not represented at all in
in Apache so only individuals can
contribute companies can hire people to
work on Apache projects but they don't
own the Apache projects and and
companies by themselves cannot sponsor a
party project I didn't really have a
say-so it's it causes a lot of
interesting a collaboration to happen
for example today that I see with the
Apache community every day and and I
think the other thing that I also like
is is this concept of standards you know
for better for worse I've actually never
had the ambition of defining standards
which are considered to be very good
because because because I've been in
some other open source projects when
people get mixed up but you know they
would wanted this they want to define a
standard and implementing it and there's
actually a lot harder to define then
implement and a rather just focus on
increment and it is there's plenty of
you know a panade a PR and stuff like
that already out there so we have our
hands full just just creating a
rock-solid implementation out of it and
apache movement has made a lot of big
difference to CloudStack i mean you can
see you know the stuff on the left is
just some numbers and stuff on the ride
was just some reason actually was just
published today I had an autograph that
was cute too and and this is q 3 so the
compares are all for you know but those
are the top four open source projects in
the same space CloudStack OpenStack open
nebula eucalyptus I mean you can see
just a patchy clouds like this continues
to grow it's just amazing no amount of
marketing can really compete with with
with apache community which is really
remarkable and we don't really do a lot
of good marketing around apache
cloudstack today but you know but
regardless it's it's just the the power
developers is is quite remarkable and
and they actually come in they work on
these projects you know the all the SDN
vendors integrate with apache cloudstack
backup dr vendors networking vendors
storage storages is really interesting
because i said earlier objects toward
distribute object stores so important
essential to be able to support amazon
style workload and and classic never
really had it had a building object
store option so it
really opened up a lot of opportunities
for you know companies like partial to
partner with us what's also very
interesting is you know actually apache
software foundation itself already had a
storage project that's called a dupe i
do but it's its basis is based on just
like we are we worried no cloudstack was
inspired by amazon ec2 hadoop was sort
of inspired by Google file system right
and then and then you build MapReduce
and everything on top of that so there's
a lot of work going on just to integrate
Apache Hadoop with Apache CloudStack and
use Hadoop SD you know HDFS or HBase as
object store and a lot of good work
going on over there and then of course
the upper layer in the management tools
or past tools they all have an interest
to integrate with the with CloudStack so
you know to summarize you know really
that I really was trying to make three
points for this talk one is really
understand you know these days you can't
just create a cloud architect the cloud
without worrying about workload you
really have to think if you're you know
if you if if I'm the cloud you're going
to run applications like in oracle
databases or more traditional
applications microsoft sharepoint know
what i mean these are perfectly good our
applications you probably should
consider creating a more traditional
style architecture you know i would
encourage our customers to deploy
enterprise-grade virtualization and
price great storage and then still use
cloudstack to automate it but it's a
very different type of cloud than say a
webshop who's a dupe shop you know
trying to really consume a lot of
resources and and and and and and really
try to build an amazon style
infrastructure so so so this this is
probably I'd say the most common mistake
I see people make is they end up
creating the wrong type of architecture
for the workload that they ultimately
want to support so they either end up
spending too much or they don't you know
they don't have multiple points of
presence that they didn't set up systems
like elastic load balancing your
geographic load balancing so when people
try to build you know reliable
applications on
top of unreliable infrastructure they
can't even do it so this is so it's
really important you it's really
important you implement at least one of
these architectures really well right
based on based on your actual work load
requirements and I think the you know
there's a lot of there's a lot of
excitement around sdn right now and
that's actually primarily being driven
by by the cloud you know I as I told you
earlier that the the reality is cloud is
still pretty much at its infancy you
know you look at our hundreds of
customer base they're really only the
web guys are doing real scale out clouds
most of the others are still more like
enterprise-grade clouds and the demand
for Sdn is still mostly in the scale of
cloud architecture so it's it's still
early but but but it's quite real I
think and and I absolutely no doubt that
that sdn will continue to grow and
lastly a lot of the success we've had
with you know moving cloud stacking to
apache was basically rooted on a one
factor which is at the end of the day
developers are who drive the adoption
for early-stage technology like this and
really there hasn't been you know many
strong open-source development community
is likely apache community so it's
that's why it's worked out very well for
us feel if you want you no more
information about cloudstack you
certainly go to this go to this web page
is actually in the process of being
transferred to to apache software
foundation so it will probably change in
the coming weeks but right now there's
already on this website plenty of links
back to you know back to apache org and
and things are in the middle of
transition right now well thank you very
much
