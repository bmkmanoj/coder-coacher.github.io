alder from front walk and we're here
interviewing to shit Trisha key from El
maps and Trisha can you tell a little
about yourself I'm just straight from l
max I'm a developer there I'm also i
guess a leader in the London Java you
sleep as well have two main roles I came
to this conference it and a bit about
your development background I've been
developing for over 10 years and started
off working at Ford Motor Company many
years ago and since then worked with a
bunch of different industries I've been
working in finance financial markets for
the last hour max for the last three
years and what's your language of choice
java job pretty much exclusive what are
you working on project I'm at the moment
we have four different teams in Almack's
at moment we've got to working on sort
of features and new functionality and
sort of traditional development type
stuff we've got a team who's working on
it's more pop star type team and doing
handling some of production support
stuff and then we've got another team is
working on performance and stability in
capacity management and this as we get
more users we're trying to expand and
continue to to retain our good speed on
good quality of execution and so I'm now
working on performance instability and
capacity management and I know in
you're doing a low-latency hi
highfalutin trading platform that you
used to disrupt our framework yes
explain a bit about this framework so we
created the disruptor because we we did
the good scientific thing and measured
our system and trying to get the latency
down as low as possible and we creates
the disruptor when we found that the
queues in between the different stages
in our pipeline was the highest latency
part of the system not the bit not be
interesting bit that's doing the
business logic but just queuing things
from system system and so the disruptor
is it's just a very very quick way of
doing that but rather than just being a
much faster queue which is where we
originally started we realize that what
we could do is have a single data
structure which would be a central place
for all the different bits of the
pipeline to get what they wanted from it
so rather than having to send it here
and then here and here we have it in
central ring buffer ring buffer and then
we were at the dependencies of the
different parts of the pipeline to fetch
it when they need it so you get much
faster execution you get really nice and
batching behavior from the fact that
it's a ring buffer and you get this
really nice way to manage your
dependencies and and see the way that
the work flows through your system what
about money costs and condensation
that's right for its kind of is
completely lot free and that's what
gives it that's what gives it the speed
and everything is managed by sequence
numbers so this ring buffer has a
sequence number to say where it's
written to the most recent things
written to each of the things which
reads from it has sequence number to say
where it's got up to as well and it's
these magic sequence numbers which
coordinate everything so if I've got
something down here at the end of the
pipeline which needs to make sure that
all of these are finished doing what
they're doing all that has to do is read
the sequence numbers of those things
rather than get notified or rolling
weight on it locks and the sequence
numbers can be
so then that way anything that happens
before you update your sequence number
has definitely happened someone your own
sequence number updates then you've got
you've got all the rights that happened
in the ring buffer we'd have to look
anything at all it's all just done with
volatile memory values and these magic
citizens and you said you're involved in
this job on developing news yes and
since it's Java is a bit old and some
say its legacy and so what do you do to
keep this community alive and actually
that's an excellent question because we
we as the london java community were a
little bit we do and we sort of made it
felt so much of what's more global
communities that we had concerns around
java the java community and where it was
going and and basically someone said to
us all why don't you do something about
so we got ourselves elected to the
executive committee of the java
community process so now we have a seat
on the on the executive committee so
rather than just standing the background
i know roger was rubbish and it's dying
it's not doing what we have developers
need it's not doing more industry needs
we have a seat on that on a committee
stop saying well actually this looks
like it's going to be good for java it's
going to be good for the community good
for developers or this doesn't really
it's a great idea but it doesn't really
when you use it as a real developer that
the API doesn't make any sense and it's
going to be difficult you have got
buying from vendors so go away and think
about it some more and then come back to
us a bit later so one of the ways we try
and not just keep Java alive as a
community we're really trying to feed it
back in via Oracle and via java and just
really try and and make sure that next
Volition's do what we want it to do
other than just complain when the next
version comes out no it doesn't support
lounges the way I want
don't you get a little envious of of
your Caribbean languages for example
prove you can hear you have land deaths
and closures functional program yeah I
mean that laterally that's I mean I
don't know I'm the wrong person to ask
because I'm a bit like when Newton I'll
just come along I think I'll that's nice
but I'm kind of doing this thing at the
moment and I don't really have any space
in my head for this new thing so I I
don't tend to be one of these technology
bandwagon people because I just I like
to learn something I learn it well and I
just don't have time to keep jumping on
the new bandwagon I do look at things
like let's do some stuff in c-sharp of
all things and the way that the
delegates worked I was like oh that's
quite nice should we have that in Java
so yeah there's a certain amount of that
but when you feel sort of pang of
jealousy or a kind of oh we're missing
that then you try and push for that in
either through well if you can't really
push for it for the JCP because you have
to submit Jason as a formal process to
go through but we one of the other
things we're trying to do is get more
involved in the openjdk so there we can
start making price small incremental
actual changes to java and as we get
more people doing that and that we get
we gain more trust from the openjdk
community then we can start really doing
what we want to do and so yeah I mean
there's certain like jealousy but if it
told us what you want to do then use
that tool and if we can use I don't know
scala for some of the stuff we're that's
the right thing to use then we use that
because they're all jb on languages
right ok so that's watch entire using
java it's the platform up mr. self no I
use Java just java to start with the
language of it there's no reason why you
couldn't if you wanted to use some of
the other genelia Magnus but yeah i mean
if if I felt extreme jealousy around one
of those things like going what some oh
you do that or find a way that it's
going to work with business ok I heard
you're involved in
the development community too and what
Charenton I I feel really really
passionate about making sure that people
don't make the same mistakes again and
again and I think that for the first
five years of my career I kind of found
it a little bit trying to figure out
what I was going what I was doing and I
don't really I don't have older brothers
and sisters and I have all the cousins I
don't have parents who work in the
industry I've got no money but no
mentors to follow and and sort of tell
me oh well that's just how it is in the
industry but you can get around it by
this business by this doesn't mean more
some of the more political things learn
the actual technology means
understanding that as a developer your
kind of head down in the road and you
always had a computer and in order to
get promoted you need to do stuff that
isn't code some of that political stuff
and I kind of want to feed a lot of that
hard-earned knowledge back into the
greater of communities so that's one
thing's kind of letting other people
learn from some of my mistakes another
thing is that and I feel I guess kind of
related I feel people don't come into
our industry who I think we're missing
people i think know those who drop out
either at very early age or even at
university and they go and do their
degree and they think they think i don't
know i like computers but i doubt my
coding or I like coding but I don't
really want to work a computer all day
or don't like the fact that i'm going to
be a loan shark or so there's something
like that and I really think that just
by showcasing the industry not all of it
lost things do things like and some of
the agile stops in the pair programming
some of the idea of developer and test
which is a different sort of idea than
just developer the collaboration
technical authors business analyst and
showcasing this massive diversity of
roles that we have to the development of
developer the Graduate developer
community I think that people are going
oh how I didn't know there was such a
things technical offer I wonder what
that does that sounds like it's going to
scratch my itch to understand things but
also allows me to communicate and
writing I just think that people are
dropping out because they're because
they don't know and we're not telling
them what we do so one of the program's
we've come up with is a meta mentor
program it's like speed dating with
mentors and so we're just getting
mentors of it's just getting it started
in London at the moment you've only had
a few events but it's starting out
really well we have some tables of
graduates with two mentors sort of peer
mentoring it's all good XP practices and
two mentors and they show their stories
of how they got to where they are and
the mentors might be might have 10 15 20
years experience so there might be a
couple years out of college and that's
fine that kind of range of experience is
really good so you can the graduates can
see oh it's quite difficult in the first
couple years because of this and the
difference between university and and
you know the first couple years in
industry is this you can get that from a
newish graduate mentor vs all right
10-15 years time I could be there doing
that and it's nice to get that that
difference of opinion in the meant that
graduates are done so far I've really
enjoyed it this said I didn't know I
want to know more about business
analysis or I want to know more about
all the different technologies i'm using
or i wanted i was pair programming
things you don't do paper a program at
university right we're told to do that
project to get it done so it gives them
ideas on questions to ask doesn't answer
all their questions it actually opens a
lot to more questions they can ask and
people who can ask those questions and I
convected when you have these metals
impaired than the cave and they mentor
each other Austin yeah exactly you can
or not one of the things i get i get
asked a lot you know I don't think I've
really got much to offer because I'm
doing my PhD at moment or I've just that
i've just graduated them I've only done
a year in industry or I've done five
years but I'm not an architect or
anything I don't know
and they've got so much to offer the
graduates but they've got a lot to offer
anyone who's been around for long in
that as well because you know it's it's
10 years since I graduated and I i
graduated in comm crash and things are
quite different then than they are now
or I think they are they write me I'm
not sure that's the thing right so I
learned a lot from those glasses to what
it takes to make that step from the
University to industry and they kind of
learn a lot about how you know I found
my career path or the fact that you can
I don't know when I graduated you can be
a developer for 10 years I thought you
have to be a developer and than a team
lead and then a project manager because
that's what you've seen seeing that
someone can just do the same thing same
thing but I have the same job title for
10 years but learn so much you can't so
far is quite nice as well last question
what is your biggest version mighty to
me don't really hate oh oh I've got
through just one and what I really hate
i really dislike and incorrect
stereotyping of stuff this Broadway one
of the things I really dislike is the
the way the media portrays our industry
that foolio says me but even inside our
own industry we've got this kind of like
a seashell developers are and in this
kind of we have this of siloing buy
things you know Europe you're a Java
financial markets developer and I am a
Python web 2.0 developer and I'm like
already a bit more in technology you
know there's certain expectations / how
you dress and how you hope you eaten you
know the beer you drink and it's just
like I mean this isn't a cited by this
industry across the whole society but I
really hate this kind of
it's passing them sort of thing at the
moment one a few weeks back I was
working in dev ops and that team has
some developers and some operation
systems guys and we worked together this
want to just kind of a nice DevOps thing
and as soon as you move into DevOps
within the day you start talking about
them meaning the developers and you're a
developer in there unless this whole us
and then mentality and I just think that
but more collaboration a bit more we're
all people all in together you'll want
to run the same team like if you want to
think of it as IT people generally being
on the same team versus the rest of the
world and that's a little bit more
useful but this kind of this kind of
barriers and clans and as in there's
just a bit doesn't get anyone in your
moment ok thanks fucking to you thanks
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
