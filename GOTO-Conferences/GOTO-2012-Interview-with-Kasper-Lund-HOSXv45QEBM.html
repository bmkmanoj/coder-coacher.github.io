program chair for a lot of conferences
among these go to conferences in bows
and cocaine and in that role I have
children to a ride my phone is Jerry
Casper look from Denmark in Auvers to
present dark the new programming
language here income Hagan and also talk
about the dark implementation when we go
to office in October so would you like
to tell us a little bit about yourself
Casper why why are you here well have
here well as she said I I do work for
Google and I'm working there for for
some years on programming languages and
and the latest thing that I've been
involved in here is that this is new
from language called art yeah for the
year for making the web a better place
for applications and for the developer
set try to write them so the first and
obvious question of course is why does
the world need yet another programming
language well I don't think we need just
yet another one we need many more
languages so language is a really a
great way of fostering innovation and
it's it's very very important that we
have a development of both the tools
that surround the languages and the
language themselves so we keep the
innovation momentum going for for the
way we as developers express ourselves
so I think it's really crucial that we
do not just settle for what we have and
they stop and innovating on the language
from so I don't think we just need yet
another one we need leave many more so
you're not thinking of it actually as
another programming language as such
you're thinking of it as a part in a
huge development going towards a mess of
the of programming languages that can
support us in our different ways of
working well as far as I can tell right
now there's more interest in
in in languages and then we've had for a
while for a firm for at least some years
the world was ruled by fewer language
than we see now there's a lot of
interest in more languages I think what
we really need now is is languages that
form a great platform for applications
especially on the web where we really
lacks a sort of a very solid foundation
and but I also a rounds of the
surrounding things or all the things
that sort of need to be in place for the
languages to really shine as all the
tools around it and I think that's a
huge part of it too so I don't that
answer it's a question but I think
languages are part of the solution to
the sort of the innovation issue that we
that we were trying to tackle but all
the tools around it are huge the two
yeah so so all on people who are trying
to invent a new language to have a nice
new syntax or some fluffy language
constructs that the most important thing
is I hear you say is actually not just
the language but all the surroundings of
it the support for the language that's
what it needs yes well I think I really
think of it in terms of platforms so a
language is interesting might be
interesting by itself but it's often
more interesting in in the way it can be
used as a platform for developing real
applications so certain languages have
an advantage there certain languages are
very right widespread and can be used by
developers like JavaScript for instance
it has its own pervasive it's everywhere
because on my cell phone it's on my
desktop it's on your desktop is
everywhere might even be in the camera
who knows yeah it's everywhere and so
it's interesting because it is sort of a
platform for writing things it may not
be the best platform so I think we need
to improve that but it is a platform but
Java has the same thing going for it
it's really like a platform with I get
well developed virtual machine and
libraries and all that stuff and that's
what we really need to focus on building
these platforms that allow us to to have
good foundations for building beautiful
interesting applications so let me give
me
and we can use our applications
everywhere I think that's the that's the
end goal for for most of us yeah we
really want to make sure that we can as
developers we can express ourselves and
read in a very nice way and then we can
depend on the platform supporting all we
need to be productive so do you see da
as a new lingua franca the new English
language for bit development or do you
see this as an addition to what's
already there no I think it's certainly
an addition I think what we what we M
like the language that are up there
today are valuable and on their own and
I think we'll see them being valuable in
the future as well yeah i just don't
think there are enough like the web
platform today for instance is is it's a
fantastic thing you can do a lot of
interesting things on the web with web
technology but it's not always super
easy to do these things and i think like
the next big thing that we have a
software developers that we have to
fight is really we have to make sure
that we we stay or become even more
productive in the future because like
there's a huge pressure put on us as
developers to produce more and more and
needs to be better and better highly
polished very beautiful interesting
appealing apps and i think right now
we're not making it easier to develop
them and it's not always and i think we
need to to make sure that the platform
that we depend on our supporters as well
as it can I mean to push that boundary
I'm on the support level so remember
when Java insert the stage they were
searching for something called the
killer app hmm so are you looking for a
killer at the doors oh yeah no great I
mean yeah if we have two or three that
we be perfect to so now it's suddenly a
the case that like a platform or a
language in itself is hard to just to
sell to people think people want to see
what you can use it for I mean the core
technology is interesting to to me maybe
to you and to some other people in the
in the field and but for for users what
really matters is what can you build
with this analogy not what you know what
you like so we of course we're looking
for four ways of making it very visible
to people what kind of things you can
achieve with
art that might be hotter with the
traditional toolchain or traditional
platform yeah and then relation to that
in the search for a killer well maybe
Tim I've heard you you have these
hackathons where people are programming
that is that sort of community you're
starting to create a round off and we
definitely think that the community will
be a big part of our success so and we
are trying to to engage with the
community in various ways and I think we
actually had a pretty good community
going for us but it's still just forming
there's a lot of interest and and we see
lot of interest from from different
different groups and seems like people
with a c-sharp or Java background find
it very appealing to be able to use
their skill sets to develop for the web
and people with a JavaScript background
and some of these the people that have
been burned a bit by trying to build big
applications in JavaScript they see
where we're coming from they understand
why we're trying to improve that as well
but there certainly isn't is it a big
interest the hackathons are essentially
a way of making sure that the interest
and then we get the feedback that that
interest sort of leads to right it's
very easy to get negative feedback
people are always willing to tell you
what's not working that well it's very
hard to get positive feedback for some
reason at least on the on the web so the
hack sons are away for us to of course
get a share of the negative feedback in
a good way where we can ask follow-up
questions but it also gives us a feel
for what work what's working really well
like it would really really be bad if we
decided to change some feature of the
platform that people actually really
like just because we never heard
anything partial about it so that's
something we always worry about that
it's easy to get sort of skewed feedback
on the features that we built them and
things were working on and the most
vocal people are usually the negative
people and a lot of people and I will
tell you something that's really truly
broken yeah and it's not only that the
negative people are the most outspoken
but it's also that you
listen because you know how is your own
success is good but at Las Vegas better
so making sure they're people that are
interested in business again so in
relation to that I heard somebody
describing dart as being hostile to and
even harmful so I've heard those
allegations well and so so I think the
people that worried about the open web I
think they really want to make sure that
going forward we still have a web
platform that is open not owned by
anyone that people contribute to from
from different companies and individuals
and I think that's super valuable we
need to keep that going and dart is
certainly not trying to mess that up and
that's big part of the reason why we
decide dart so it's translatable to
javascript in a very efficient way so
essentially what we're trying to do is
to try to push the the web to to
innovate on the language and platform
front and but keeping it compatible with
the the current web and by essentially
translating to JavaScript and using that
as a strategy for keeping it not only as
part of the open web but actually like
fully compatible with what was out there
today yeah so you have to build on
what's there so how is it going with
that on I'm film it's going really well
so we have an we have an sdk software
development kit that contains a build of
chrome that has the dart VM in it so you
can run a guitar program directly in
chrome and in this special build and we
use that for testing our things and
working with that and it's it's it's a
really nice development experience and
when you download the dark goats we have
the editor and all that you get a copy
of that and is easy to play around with
and dart is not like the virtual machine
is not yet part of the official google
chrome that you can download from from
our website and at some point it
probably will be yeah but we wanted to
reach a state where it's a it's a it's a
stable foundation we like push it out to
a wider otherwise you get a lot of
negative feedback face or something
that's not ready mature yet well you can
also say that they go our biggest fear
is probably that once you push it out to
a lot of people it's hard to change
about at least the resistance to change
it becomes bigger and that'll probably
makes it hard for us to it to adapt and
to get real value of the feedback that
we're getting from from various groups
so we want to stay essentially you know
in a place where we can still use the
feedback that we get as long as we sort
of needed to build a stable yeah it just
started still in the flux right I
wouldn't call it Fox I mean we started
out being night and I wouldn't even call
that flux when we really see the
technical preview a like the core ideas
for fairly stable yeah but of course
when it comes to syntax it's very easy
to change things and make things around
so they they look a bit different appeal
more to some people so we've done it
like a bit of that and will probably
continue to do a few tweaks here and
there but it's certainly not in the
flocks like that the fundamentals are
sort of it most of the things in there
are not something that we've we've
invented we just might be put together
good ideas from various languages that
that makes the experience fairly stable
when it comes to the conceptual model
that we try to to rely on in there it's
it's not something we've invented and
that you say we're just trying to build
on it and make good use of it so that
means that the the model as in the
course assistant is super stable and it
has been for a while and and I think you
might see the syntax changing a tiny bit
over the next ten months and so but at
some point we'll probably lock it down
and say now the benefit of changing
these small things it's not big enough
to essentially sort of warrant having
everybody else that uses dark go ahead
and change too so it'll mostly view the
sensex changing because as I as I
understood it you can still ask to get
you a pit language construct into a dart
virtual class yeah you can always ask
but so I think what we'll see is that we
definitely want to keep up the
essentially the innovation momentum in
in the language going forward to and
there are some languages out there that
have been very successful in involving
over time and others have not I think we
want to stick in the camp that that
evolved and but you have to be very
careful when how you do that and when
you do that and so for now we're
focusing on delivering at first
reasonable and stable version of the
language that's not too complex so that
we can have that implemented well and
people to stop relying on technology and
building like relapse on top of it so
that's that up step one from that and we
definitely need good idea somehow to to
go to the next level and and one of the
things we should be looking at adding
for that and feedback from people like
you claim that you want virtual classes
it's great we want stuff like that and
and we need I think that kind of
feedback even if we at this point will
say it's not something we want to deal
with right now we probably will put it
on the list and say something that
there's there's probably something to to
this kind of feature and we should be
looking at it the thing with language
design though is that is everything has
to fit together so if you it's not like
a whack-a-mole kind of game if you if
you decide to change one area you hit
hit that something else might pop up
right then suddenly you need to tweak
something else in it takes time it's all
tied together and you don't know if you
like they're all this strain than
something else will break you never
quite know well often we do know and
that's probably why we were a bit
reluctant to change a few things in the
language that some people find it's very
obvious for us to change and just
because we are constrained a bit we want
to be able to compile to JavaScript and
have Heather be really efficient and a
nice experience too and sometimes that
makes it impossible for add like really
neat features that we would love to see
in the language like non-local returns
where are you from within some function
you can return from a not just the
function itself but from a surrounding
and a set of function which is a very
powerful thing that small talk and small
talkers have enjoyed and used to great
extent for for many many years but it's
really honest translate to JavaScript an
inefficient
yeah so it's certainly something we
wanted to add initially when we designed
at the spot project which was thought
that the the preview to the the dark
project we did add something like
non-local turn because it was kind of
neat and it's just very hard to
translate to JavaScript so we have some
constraints yeah and I think the biggest
one is that we want it to be compatible
with the open web and through JavaScript
and we want it to be accessible and
familiar and essentially want a
mainstream language in want it to be
something that anybody can use and it's
a phenomenal Eric T all the boringness
or the well-known s that you also being
criticized for people say it's boring
because the syntax is so is so well
known but but you have a reason for that
you want it to be safe yeah start
programming Oh truth be told we are also
getting a lot of very positive feedback
on that no case exact thing right so
from the hackathons people will come to
us and all that no experience of da da
da at all they'll sit down and they'll
look at and say hey this is fairly
simple I can do that right and in a
couple of hours they feel like they can
program dark and they can be productive
even though the platform is new and it's
not completely done in all all areas
it's good enough that they feel like
after a few hours with a very little
supervision or help our guidance they
can actually be productive that's great
that's exactly what we wanted right so
that mostly goes for people that have a
background in say Java C sharp or
JavaScript and so they they know the web
and they know some of the language they
can usually people really quickly the
great thing is that the set of people
that that have those qualifications is
huge yeah we just them get again and
those are the people you need yeah so
it's and it's the people that the web
needs juice it's not just us and then we
need more people to program for the way
up yeah and essentially that doesn't
really matter if they're using dart or
some other technology but we need to
bring more people to being to get into a
stage where they're they're productive
and efficient and when developing with
notifications so okay so why did you get
involved with creating done well
so before doing the arc I was working at
Google on 98 started that project and in
August and we reach the stage I think
we're and the development we did on v8
was very interesting and it's very
instead of its hard work it's a
complicated language to optimize for
JavaScript and and if there was a lot of
satisfaction instead of doing it anyway
yeah on the other hand you at some point
you feel like you have to essentially
like you have to invest too much in in
making it faster whereas if you just fix
the language to be easier to optimize
for more understandable better to work
with so using javascript is not sort of
naturally or inherently a language that
you've not so nice for no it's very
complicated there's a good reason why if
you look at the performance of
JavaScript before the year the whole
JavaScript performance competition got
started and it was basically flat lining
and it was much much lower than any
other any other language that was used
for building real applications so it
took some some new ideas or essentially
took some old ideas and then and so when
you a few new ways of getting those old
language implementation ideas into play
and to to make it take that sort of the
first performance that forward and from
that point it's been going pretty well
but still it's a lot of hard work and
and the biggest problem with it is it
and it's very unsatisfying as a it's a
vm developers that there's there's
always like a subset of the language you
can optimize really well and it's very
hard to tell people what that stuff it
is but you can definitely tell them that
if they're not getting it the
application of their writing will be
very slow and that's not a good place to
be right you want some level printed
predictability in that kind of setup and
JavaScript does not really have that at
the core of it the the very dynamic
model where you add properties to our
picks and essentially anything you do to
an update this is based on strings as
key and it's not a very performance wise
a stable model yeah but I'm thinking
about you know you made are to be able
something javascript but you're also
thinking about the user experience when
I think about that it's mostly the
optional typing I really like so uh I've
always been thinking well as small
targets it's a very neat language you
don't have to imagine all these types
and it's very easy to get started right
up but it's difficult for novices
because they don't have the type system
in their heads so then it's much better
to have a very strongly typed language
where when you have to write the types
in the code it helps them a lot but the
fact that you make the optional typing I
think it's very interesting very useful
for the programs why did you choose that
was that because of your experience with
mediate so I think the eight certainly
demonstrates just like small talk did
that you can have high performance of
limitations that doesn't really rely on
typing yeah that's not of step 1 once
you realize that you can have a really
efficient implementation of the language
where you don't need to trust that the
static types it doesn't really matter if
the user writes them everywhere he can
write them where it makes sense and you
can have a type system that allows you
to express things that are not
necessarily like from a theoretical
standpoint not typesafe but they make
sense to you yeah once you have that
idea and you start thinking about like
allowing people to write in the style
that fits their needs and also allowing
to take essentially i can incremental
approach to adding typing so instead of
saying you need to edit everywhere or
the compiler will be really am an
unhappy you say you put it in there
where it makes sense to you and your
coworkers yeah and and you don't have to
have the discussion that if you add more
typing it becomes fast or slow or
whatnot it doesn't really matter night
everything is dynamic exciting it's just
your experience as a programmer that
changes you can do this yes is ashley's
it's really nice to write in the
language where you don't have to write
the types yeah yes if you don't worry
about to happen in your head I think
you're right but every now that it and
you have to read other scope yeah in
that model you get a bit frustrated
right I think he was trying to make me
understand that the second document to
this function should have been an
integer but I'm not quite sure after we
disco that's not a good place to be
either right so you want to find a
balance yeah so the simple stuff
maybe without types and more complicated
way though so what we see working pretty
well for us is that locally within
methods people tend to not a lot of
types because if you add that level you
probably need to understand the logic in
the middle anyway but at the interface
level we see lots of times so if there's
a sort of a semantic coherence with an
LED spot like a method or toss yes well
without you how to communicate yeah
essentially it's sadly true that many
interfaces between stuff yeah if you
have if you're trying to write some some
API for something usually you need to
document that API and if you can write
the documentation in a mostly checkable
forum where people that use the API code
up against it get some benefit from the
documentation you've written and that
could be informal static types that's
great right yeah they get early
notification and something is broken if
they're trying to pass the wrong kind of
things in there and they get more
recognizable errors out of it too and so
dart types are not just used for static
type checking we also use them as
essentially assertions at runtime yeah
you can run the road where we check that
they're correct and the idea there is
that it's better to get an error in it
that it's very recognizable that's
understandable the program is telling
you that this string is not a string you
think it's a string but it's not that's
very very useful right you can start go
back and see where that came from you
just start operating on him you get we
have results out it's not a great place
to be like really developing or testing
you use this ocean to get your warnings
just like you do with assertions
essentially they touch something about
invariant in your code and and you want
to know if they don't hold and so we try
to use it the same way and also that
makes it visible for people looking at
your code yes what you expect it to get
me sure and we don't do sometimes see
people that write the code and they sort
of have this mental model at the static
type is just the static type and then we
run the code in what we call the check
mode or developer mode where we reuse at
a type annotations as type assertions
and their code doesn't work but it's
usually a good thing for them right they
realize that the either the tech
notation is wrong which is something
they want to fix to avoid confusing
future
leaders of the coma or that there's
something that they missed in the
implementation right it gives them
feedback right there it's very powerful
so I think that combination of not
having to write things with static types
and and still getting the benefit from
them when you do is very very good I
think the final thing I think to say
about the static x is that being able to
run code that is not necessarily typable
or does not have static x it's great for
involving code think while it's running
like like modifying code yeah I don't
even try that in a Java setting where
like some Java implementations do
support a usually call it a cop swapping
where you can replace a method while the
program is running it's a great feature
it's really really powerful the problem
is that if you change any like public
signature while doing it it just stops
there's no I can do it that's very
limiting now you can't do any
refactoring while the program's run you
just use stock right so I sort of a
teaser you start doing it just stops or
you can't do it and this because the tax
have to match because the system think
the virtual machine below it depends on
the types being correct otherwise the
implementations incorrect yeah the dart
VM does not have that problem we I mean
it's the ties very correct we don't care
we do not optimized based on them at all
no that's a great strength yeah in a
world where things are like fairly
dynamic and you stitch components
together at runtime like having a
coherent touch system that works across
like versioning of components that are
sort of being plucked it together and
then ripped apart again at runtime is
very hard it's very hard to reason about
version types over time I am fitting
together it's just it's a big mess yeah
yeah I'm simply just saying that at one
time we don't care is very simple yeah
and I think simplicity is a it's a good
starting point get the implementation
you have you had frog
yes how is going with your frog frog is
fine so from is a we let me tell us all
about frog frog is it's actually the
second generation dr. Joseph translator
that we built we started out with a dr.
Joseph translator we called the dark sea
at that point and and it has a tendency
to generate fairly verbose output yeah
weird about that too so people looked at
that and thought hey does that mean that
any kind of translation from dr. Joseph
will they leave me with this like huge
chunk of code and none of us on the team
of course the reason that it's fairly
it's simple enough to do something about
that by eliminating that code and all
that but because we bundled with fairly
big libraries and if you're not doing
anything about it you get a fairly big
binary yeah or a fairly big JavaScript
blob so frog was the first attempt to
try to do two things first was to do
tree shaking that's our it's really a
small talk name for in getting rid of
that code what do you think of the your
application and instead of in it and I
connected tree and you can you can grab
hold up its trademark and yes in the
essen garbage collection on how does it
work yeah you could say that it needs to
be somewhat conservative so essentially
you you you cannot you don't always know
what like a certain call a function
called in your code is going to call it
might be it's so these four methods are
potential times message to leave them
also attacked appear that runs on
dependent and but just getting rid of
the stuff that where you can clearly see
that there is no there's no cold and
there is no call to a foo in the entire
program please get rid of all the food
message right you don't need them and
that works really well and it works for
the rapid are too so frog was the first
implementation will be trying to make
good use of that and we also reached a
point where the dart VM was mature
enough to support writing the compiler
so we now have a dart compiler and frog
was the first of that a dark compiler
written in Dart yeah that's kind of neat
you can take the dark compiler you can
compile it with itself so suddenly you
have a dark compiler
in JavaScript you can put that on a web
page and you suddenly have again a
JavaScript compiler to compile dart code
to JavaScript doesn't need anything else
doesn't need the dart VM yeah just right
there that's very practical it's very
cool and it's also great for us to use
their own language right in order
something from that so fraught with was
a early attempt to try to do that and
get some a big benefits out of the tree
shaking smaller output yeah and much
more JavaScript the output and looked
much better and it was is a good success
for us I think and at some point we we
we found that there are some
discrepancies between how frog the
generated output behaved when it came to
like number semantics and array access
and stuff like that what was something
different than what the vm does we want
to try to fix that and to actually fix
it and we started they doing it that the
third and that final the doctor
JavaScript translator that has a really
nice infrastructure for optimizations
and dr. tree shaking 90 and frog sub
show was a really good idea and that's
what we were very close to shipping to
two people so that will be there the
translator that people will use for
translating this code to go so what's
that called said cut called something
funny like frog or something really
boring like that two Gs yes it's it has
a boring name people were asking us a
lot of question about frog so initially
at dr j s i had a code name to it was it
was called leg so it was part of dog
yeah it's a frog leg people didn't
really get it now I don't blame them so
we decided that we needed to rebrand it
a bit and just call it dr. J's and then
they also having multiple different
compilers with cute nicknames and it's a
lot of fun than a project and but it's
when you have to try to teach the
community about them and it takes longer
and so we decided just say get rid of
that and just call it dr. J's I guess
sorry about that I just would French
people and all it could be very funny to
have something called the leg of a frog
so they'll you didn't yeah I don't know
maybe I don't know they probably like
frog legs I do like chocolate yeah
it's like they would probably really not
eat it yeah the biggest problem we had
you could say is that we started out
building this leg thing as a part of
frog which makes sense from a conceptual
point but that also meant it you could
have so cute emo on yeah but you can
also talk about the the legless frogmen
which was kind of a scary thing to to
picture so yeah and they're all these
experiments with frogs do some frogs
that you put in a Trinity too and
they're still doing switching even know
that they're yeah I don't yes I think so
this is is probably better it's simpler
to many ways yeah it's not it's not
maybe it's not the most sexy name in the
industry of project names but it's a
almost self-explanatory yeah which is
good yeah that's good easy easy to
understand so speaking about names why
is that Coltart and we'll motion typical
juggling and darkness it's a good
question so when you when you decide is
essentially like the biggest unsolved
problem of computer science right coming
up with good names yes it is like and
when you start a project you need a name
not like in 14 days or three months you
need it now because you have to create
that first directory like that folder
they input your stuffing which will be
there forever yeah you need a subversion
to pass your a github thing and you need
to update sort of domain name you need
the main man yes and clearly yes so so
everything has to fit together you want
usually want a fairly short name eat
into still easy to spell recent leads to
search for you want to always ridiculous
to search goes actually hard to search
for it is so icon that scale it's
probably not a good name on the other
hand it's really short leash more and we
went we started out calling it the very
early version what's called spot yeah it
was a it sound like a dog and a really
nice dog yeah so I we just decided that
we needed something
be different and some planet seen it was
called Dash as well yeah but at the end
you need to pick a name that that
doesn't have to make sense but it has to
be reasonable doesn't have to have any
meaning and dart was nice and short so
it makes sense to us how much the
association's something like that right
you can find any anybody having anything
really negative to say about garden
sounds it sounds okay it sounds okay so
have just two questions left okay yes
for the first is and could you explain
that kosher stuff without an editor that
closure stuff all the stuff I show them
that yeah well that's easy so you
probably know what a closure is and but
so essentially what you have in a
closure is it's not just an code it's
code plus the context it needs to
execute in such a package so it's a
little thing that you can throw around
and it actually it grabs all of its
context and in the example I showed it
grab it took hold of some of the local
variables that was in scope when you
created the closure so you can actually
grab all of them and you can you can
execute it later so and it executes in
the original scope so that if if the
closure has code in there depends on
some local variable it actually gets to
use the real value of that variable when
it executes later it's hard without the
editor I agree but these very well so
you can create a closure in your code
where you have a piece of functionality
I can function and that depends in some
some context and then you can throw that
around and it's great so how much of a
transitive closure due to take with a
closer like that and you take what you
need so the nice thing is that it's
static so like the scoping and when you
have local variables you can tell that
you have local variables unlike other
languages like JavaScript where it's
very hard to tell because you can do
eval so you don't really know what do I
need and in dart you cannot do that so
if you know your nominee you know you
can ecstatic detail which kind of
variables are referenced in context is
well defined it's very rare it's very
well defined I guess I think that's a
nice
feature in JavaScript down know if
people are familiar with the fact that
you can introduce local variables with
eval and you can delete them again do
you think it's a nice feature it's not
very interesting to implement know like
I guess not but I'm stabili interesting
but it's interesting that you can do it
I'm not sure how useful it is people
usually go through great lengths to
avoid that proper that introduces
because it's very confusing yeah you add
new local variables dynamic not and you
can go eat them yeah can I think I'm is
promised lies in london my favorite
answer is very yeah it's very
interesting right so I just one final
question for you kiss bet it's gonna be
the final one yeah I think so so is
there anything you would like to share
with the nation at this moment yes
that's a weird question and not really
clough that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
