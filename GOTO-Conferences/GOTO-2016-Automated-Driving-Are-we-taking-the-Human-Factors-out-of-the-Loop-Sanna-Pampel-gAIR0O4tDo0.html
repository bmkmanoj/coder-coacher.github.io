of Equalization so please remember to
write session okay so I'm from the
University of possible and I did my PhD
me and my while I wasn't me I was
fighting for driving simulator one day
and that's the first time I experienced
and have automated driving it was summer
in kind of bias easy conditions on the
motorway and I was first arriving
manually and then the automation and I
was sitting in the driver's seat and
looking to the front definitely and at
some point I remember my mind was
wandering I was thinking about something
else and suddenly kind of alarms went
off and red lights went on and I saw
that there was a car standing in front
of me on the motorway and I immediately
slammed on the brake and I didn't really
managed to get the car stopped in time
so I crashed into the front car and all
the time all the time several of my
colleagues were monitoring me on screens
so it was quite embarrassing and I came
out of the driving simulator and I try
to explain to them that the brake didn't
really work but they didn't really buy
it actually I I disconnected mentally
from the driving task so basically I was
I was out of the loop so I was kind of
not really able to react properly and
and bring to the car to a stop when it
was needed so why are we developing
vehicle automation what are the benefits
of this
according to the British Association of
Insurance ninety percent of accidents
are related to human error and so
there's a lot of potential to improve
traffic safety at the same time there
are efficiency gains to be made in the
traffic so British people British
drivers spend about one hundred and
twenty four hours in traffic jams and
that time could be used I don't know
either productively or for relaxing but
standing there is it's not really
pleasant time I'd say and one isn't
really sure about this so there are
certain risks but in the automotive
sector they also drops there many people
already working with automation and this
is also the reason why car manufacturers
are the main kind of drivers office so
the main investors into the automation
are the car manufacturers then we have
technology companies and also
governments so the U is funding a lot
but there's also for example at the
moment I call out by the UK government
for automation projects so we talk we
let's get to to some definitions at
first so when we talk about automated
driving we say that tasks are the tasks
that are previously done by humans are
now taken over by machines and when we
talk about vehicle automation it's often
actually kind of a teamwork between the
driver and the color because automation
does not necessarily mean that the
driver is doing everything when we talk
about kind of the driver driving
sometimes human driving at times and the
car driving at times there are hand over
and take over situations so take over
situations are initiated by the driver
so what the driver could do when the
vehicle is driving at the moment is to
input like to to steer or to press on a
pad
break or accelerator and then the
automation stops and the drivers driving
a hand over is initiated by the vehicle
so often say when the vehicle is
reaching its limits or when it's kind of
I'd say not really sure about about the
situation then it can issue a signal
saying okay drive I take over yeah I I
can't do the task anymore so that is a a
hand over the actual full automation is
the autonomous car that means that there
is no outside control needed so the
human actually doesn't need to control
the car that doesn't even need to be a
steering wheel in the car or or pedals
so here we talk about proper driverless
cars where say a blind person could
drive from A to B as well
so yeah when we talk about automation
there are different different levels
this these altogether six levels are by
the SAE the Society of Automotive
Engineers another very common
classification is that you find in the
media is by by the Nitza by the years
transport institute for transportation
so let's start with the first level it's
no automation so what the car could do
is to issue some some warnings but still
the driver has to drive in this level it
could also it's it could also be
possible that the car is assisting with
breaking but still the driver is the one
who has to step on the brake pedal and
to make that decision so I put a picture
of a 40 as a example of a of a very
simple absolutely not automated car in
everyone some tasks are automated so you
could for example have cruise control or
adaptive cruise control where the
longitudinal control of the car is
automated alternatively the LED lateral
control could be automated say bye-bye a
system that's steering for you and
keeping you in the lane so here's an
example of a Volkswagen Golf adaptive
cruise control system if you combine the
lateral and longitudinal control we're
getting over 22 level to where the car
is kind of doing the driving but the
driver has to be monitoring the
environment all the time and at all
times be ready to intervene so in this
example so you have adaptive cruise
control and lateral control the car is
doing the steering and the car is kind
of pressing the brake pedal and coasting
for
are you but the car for example wouldn't
break for you so s it's necessary to
break us a drive I still need to put on
the brake so mercidas is at the moment
capable of doing this kind of level 2
automation so until here the driver is
monitoring the environment and the cat
the car can monitor it to some degree
but the driver has to at all times be
absolutely aware of what's around them
from level 3 the car is monitoring
what's going on in the environment so
level three is conditional automation
where the car can is able to to do the
driving for you but not always not at
all times and you need to have a capable
driver at all times sitting in the
driver's seat and the car may issue a
hand over at any moment and the driver
needs to be there to to do the driving
basically at any time famous example of
this level of automation is the Tesla hi
automation is level further where you
don't always need a driver kind of who
would take over the driving task at all
times so the does say for example like
an automated car is able to do
everything on its own on a motorway or
just drive in in cities just kind of and
it would do that it's reliable and the
and even when the the driver kind of
wants to take over or needs to take over
it's kind of Tolerance oh so you don't
need to be there at all times and fully
capable to take over I put an an example
of a Google car here although it's a
little bit controversial where it
actually is
it's it's it's quite a an example of a
quite a high automated level but still
not fully and then full automation is
the car without without steering wheel
without pedals it can do drive from A to
B for you on its own and an example that
you can find today would be like a park
shuttle this one is from from Rotterdam
full automation is working today is
usually a limited speeds in in limited
areas so where are we at the moment so
early for example is currently level to
automation on the market and level 3
where the car can do all the driving
conditionally would be on the market
next year mercidas at the moment capable
of level 2 automation but it already has
three track balloons on the roads a
platoon has anyone not heard of platoons
yeah it's like an automated convoy so on
on motorways you can have say different
number of lorries kind of talking on to
each other and they drive at very short
headways which was quite if and and what
you can gain from which is efficiency
and fuel usage can can be quite low or
quite lowered so that's where where my
see this is at the moment and Tesla
currently has the level 3 automation and
with Google cars we at the moment not
really sure kind of whether it's level 3
or already level 4 actually I mean go
the google test have to have been
driving a lot like millions of miles
until now but there are several take
overs recorded and so several sorry
several hundred of Zoar hundreds of
takeovers recorded and several take
where the drivers needed to intervene or
felt like they needed to intervene and
they are also several maybe about 70
when I I was reading up on this 70
handovers where the car which limit and
said I I don't know what I can't do this
MO and then the driver had to continue
driving the actual proper full
automation where a car can drive on its
own from a to like from one city to
another it's not expected to be out
there for another ten years and that's
quite an optimistic estimate so there
are others who talk about 20 or even 30
years so we've been doing some studies
in the University of Nottingham with
about level 3 automation and this
participant is requesting the automation
to be switched on
okay this should all right yeah didn't
yet this sorry so the Dakar just took
over the driving task and she carefully
took hands off the steering wheel and
it's making herself comfortable with
some water and soon she's going to take
a phone and and relax and you can also
see that very soon she's getting a
little bit tired so the automation is
this level he is perfectly green so
because the automation state is very
confident fast-forward 25 minutes about
and she is still looking at her phone
and sometimes at the road and the
automation level the confidence is
decreasing a little bit so where we are
now it's on a on a motorway scenario and
the car is staying on the same lane all
the time and the study has been going on
for days so so this is I think the
fourth time as she's sitting in an
automated car and we were kind of
looking at what people are doing when
when they're driving in in automated
vehicles so every now and then she's
looking at the road and looking at the
the status indicator and what is
happening out there is said some some
focus arising so that's the reason the
car is not able to that's the reason why
the car is not kind of confident enough
and why the status indicator is it's
lowering and lowering so this is
happening for the first time after
several hours of her sitting in that car
and and experience in the automation so
she puts already one hand on the
steering wheel and she's monitoring
what's happening around him and I think
she's expecting something and it's a
really really good example it's a very
nice example of of teamwork between the
car and the human being so you can see
how the car is it's lowering its kind of
Automation stayed and how how they how
the driver is is kind of getting into
the driving task kind of step by step so
now we are at a dread so there's at the
moment quite a lot of fog out there in
the motorway scenario so but it's been
has two hands on the steering wheel
she's sitting upright looking around
checking the mirrors and at this moment
you hear a loud beep at this moment in
the car and she's taking over in the car
stops doing the driving and she's
perfectly able to control and to
stabilize the vehicle I have another
example so the automation starts and he
is taking the hands off the steering
wheel grabs a research paper and starts
reading perhaps a pen and he forgets
everything about the driving task but
it's very concentrated and stops
monitoring what's going on around him
fast-forward 20 25 minutes the
automation state is at its end so and
he's very concentrated reading his his
paper and he has to take over now
there's this alarm that there's a loud
noise and yeah he throws away his paper
just noticing that he still has the pen
closer Pend Oreille and he's can see the
the strong steering connect corrections
so he must have been swerving a little
bit and it took him some time to
actually properly stabilized the vehicle
and and confidently drive and also to
get aware of actually what's going on
around him
so those were examples of of level 3
automation where the car was driving at
certain points and then when the
participant the human was driving it at
other times so level 3 automation
requires a responsible driver a
responsible person aware of the
surroundings at all times and there are
lots of problems we human factors people
are working with so as you could see
there people are getting fatigued quite
quickly and start mind-wandering
actually automation is considered one
source of distraction and the takeover
times are relatively long so it can take
15 seconds for a driver to take over has
been found in the in Leeds University
and it can take up to 40 seconds for a
driver to fully stabilized the vehicle
and these are quite long times
considering that sometimes it can take
split seconds for something to happen on
the roads over time the skills of the
drivers can degrade eight so you have
the case that often the easier driving
tasks are automated and then suddenly
the driver has to do the difficult tasks
that the car is unable to do and yeah
that that's this has also been shown in
aviation is it's very problematic and
over time the drivers trust the vehicle
even people who haven't trusted
automated vehicles before in in studies
has been shown that very quickly they
trust the disengage and they might also
get a bit bit complacent and not put all
the effort into kind of taking taking
over the control when it's actually
needed and then you get also to to
misuse which you've probably seen or
heard about in the case of tesla's where
people have moved to the back seat and
take videos and put them on YouTube
so what are we how could we deal with
this we talked about kind of keeping the
driver engaged re engaging the driver so
we could kind of make sure the driver is
staying in the loop while the automation
is on and if we could give them tasks or
could kind of make them in some way
monitor the environment and this could
also mean that we need to give back
certain tasks to the driver so that the
drivers at least doing something doing
driving but then we kind of step back
again in the automation levels what's
also possible is or what will be done
i'm quite sure is to monitor the driver
at all times I mean cars are already
able to monitor steering inputs and
pedal inputs and you can infer fatigue
from them for example what we're doing
and driving simulators is to monitor the
eye movements a lot and then you they
are also an indicator for for stress or
or fatigue say when you're fatigued
you're blinking more and when you're not
engage you're looking around more you're
not looking on the road so we still have
many problems and there are more and
more voices saying okay don't do don't
do level three automation it's just it's
dangerous it's complicated and they have
also been the first fatalities so
instead of adding functionality to the
automation and increasing the automation
level by level and taking the control
away from the human step by step there
are increasing announcements an
increasing number of announcement that
car manufacturers and technology
companies are working with working
towards full automation so this is not
necessarily kind of going from from zero
to five
could also be somewhere from level one
or two towards four ish and this is the
big I'd say the the kind of this
disruption because full automation is is
quite different in a way of the
automation levels where human beings are
still considered and fully automated
vehicles doesn't just mean that fully
automated vehicles will be on the road
the transport systems catapult for
example hypothesizes of expect that at
the same time you have more electric
vehicles more connected vehicles and
more lightweight vehicles on the roads
so the environment could really kind of
be disrupted and changed so who's
announcing this what's what's going on
so Volvo is announcing test and London
by 2017 with kind of semi automated
vehicles and by 2018 with fully
automated vehicles so Volvo is really so
other companies that are very committed
to to driving safety and expect that
fully autonomous vehicles will increase
safety Tesla is very very optimistic and
it has been said that fully autonomous
vehicles would be on the market on the
roads in two years time let's see
whether it's going to happen and forth
created a subsidiary called smart
mobility and they are working with fully
autonomous vehicles and alternative
concepts mobility concepts and they say
fully autonomous vehicles what could be
on the market by 2021 what I like or
what I find quite quite interesting
about Ford's announcements is that the
idea of autonomous vehicles isn't just
like on the very kind of luxury high
level it could be kind of affordable for
for the general public in a way but then
again we also have the luxury class of
course BMW announcing the I next by my
2021 as well so that would be an
electric vehicle fully autonomous with
some facilities also 4dr drivers to to
drive if they want to so when we talk
about fully autonomous vehicles what
does it mean for us the human factors
researchers do we say considered need to
consider the human beings I mean of
course I we have humans in vehicles who
need to trust this entire system and
they change from being an active driver
to someone to people to people who have
like a nice experience traveling from
from A to B and they need to communicate
with the car and there will be saying
modern human machine interfaces will for
example include natural language
interfaces where the car is becoming a
bit like a like a friend like kitten
Knight Rider and you can kind of talk to
them and they can make sure that your
travel experience is as nice as possible
and the cows can also support
non-driving activities so interesting
question is how would satellite
navigation systems look like I mean of
course you don't need them anymore to
navigate but you can still could still
use them for engaging with the outside
environment seeing where you are and
figuring out where the next caffee is
and I mean who doesn't like like driving
I mean as a German kind of okay looking
back um I I personally I've really
enjoyed kind of driving on the motorway
where there's no speed limit kind of
driving above it's like 150 miles an
hour sunny day motorized free so this is
like has been like very very pleasurable
it's it's fun particularly just after I
passed my driving test so
and the question is how car
manufacturers can keep up this driving
pleasure because Audi and drag your Land
Rover they're still saying okay we don't
want to treat people as cargo which I
don't just want to transport them we
want to have to deliver a nice a good
experience for them a good driving
experience so maybe it will be possible
only on racetracks sometime in the
future or within certain boundaries on
motorways but then again I'm asking
myself if driving pleasure is also risk
and speeds like how would how would that
look like i I don't know we have the
humans outside of the vehicles who need
to to feel safe they also need to trust
the vehicles and ideally also have a way
of communicating with the vehicles as
you'd normally do or as you do today
with the driver like how would the eye
contact look like there are some ways
for cars to show to indicate with lights
for example and symbols that pedestrians
are recognized and that they are okay to
cross the road and so in this would be
quite interesting when we come to the
transition period where some cars will
be automated automated or autonomous and
other cars won't so you will have some
kind of mixed traffic with kind of mixed
cultures and mixed habits so that could
be quite quite interesting looking at
the traffic environment they have been
really interesting discussions about
ethics when we talk about ethics we have
this kind of trolley problem the dilemma
between simply say protecting the driver
or protecting the driver by steering and
hitting a pedestrian or letting the
driver crash into a wall and killing the
driver basically so so what would one do
and who is making the decisions
so this is a really complicated problem
and it's not really clear for me whether
the engineers are making the decisions
or whether they're going to be
regulations and this is one of the big
problems in my mind to solve and then I
mean for the for the environment
hopefully things will be more efficient
travel quality improves and time
improves so young and lifestyles I mean
as i as i mentioned luxury vehicles they
will be status symbol Tesla's are
already stated symbols and some in some
areas but then again that is potential
for people with mobility issues to be
able to participate in in kind of to
travel and to participate in society
connected vehicles are coming with this
with the automation s cars need to
communicate to other cars kind of make
sure where they are you also have have
more more opportunities kind of from
vehicle to vehicle committee with
vehicle-to-vehicle communication vehicle
to infrastructure you can talk to others
and you can talk about problems you like
communicate problems you find on the
road and the car oh sorry and the can
can also kind of take care of its own
maintenance and then we have the problem
of of misuse you see a pigeon holding up
the traffic I've been running few trips
when I was still in the the Institute
for transport studies in Leeds we went
to see the park shuttle that I showed
earlier on in Rotterdam and as we
arrived with the students the first
thing some students did was just in run
in front of the the park shuttles just
to see whether they stopped and luckily
they stopped but um so especially when
we talk about this really like small
pots in in pedestrianised stones or
things pedestrian so nice don't then
normally pedestrian I stones will they
be able to move around when they are
pedestrians very comfortable and just
walking into that way I'm almost I'm
quite running out of time ok so I'm
briefly going through through this as we
talk about fully autonomous vehicles
that is of course a is big part of it it
will help with maintenance figuring out
what's going on with the car and taking
care of informing the right places we
are able to know about the driver state
that's part of the the recent study I've
been doing myself kind of measuring how
the drivers doing looking at that kind
you can almost kind of measure their
their stress their workload emotions and
then adapt very music lightning to to
improve the experience for the driver
drivers have different different goals
so some some are just in a hurry they
just want to go from A to B as fast as
possible some are quite kind of
aggressive how would you imagine like a
sports car driver how would an autumn
autonomous car kind of drive for them
and others might prefer very kind of
more elegant experience like a
rolls-royce or song so personalization
is so an interesting topic to discuss so
one problem that comes with artificial
intelligence especially when in the when
the car is learning in the actual Road
environment as it is today is that cars
are able to pick up the bad behaviors of
humans or the bad habits the Google car
accident for example what happens there
is that the Google car learned that in
some crossings cars are driving into a
to the right on the road kind of almost
creating an informal right turning lane
that doesn't officially exist so and
it's not really correct behavior but the
Google car ended up doing the same and
then another car actually a lorry driver
didn't expect this type of behavior from
the Google car and that's why they ended
up kind of crashing into each other not
much happens there but there you can see
that I mean no one was injured but there
you can see that we kind of need to
figure out how autonomous cars to drive
I mean should they drive like humans or
yeah okay so I also to drive like humans
or like machines I'm going to talk about
this in a second um and then kind of
overtime as there are less kind of
humans driving on the road and the cars
behavior might change and and kind of
learn and adapt where the humans in the
car actually accept this and understand
this will it make sense to them so
coming back to the question humans or
machines I mean I've heard this several
times when autonomous vehicles are on
the road for that for drivers it would
be like driving on the train so there's
much to worry about however they are
studies that show that people accept
automated behaviors or automated driving
behaviors more when they are more
human-like this includes kind of
breaking behavior driving around curves
but you cannot but it has also been
shown that drivers are sometimes not
comfortable with the short distances you
can find in the platoons which then has
implications for the efficiency of these
platoons when drivers don't accept them
then you don't get the the fuel saving
benefits of them so maybe the cars would
drive like better humans but then again
what is that and people will have
different expectations and they will be
disappointed over time so in research we
try to address these challenges
so I guess I've really quickly mentioned
basically that s the cars don't exist
yet the autonomous vehicles not exist
yet we need to kind of answer our
questions we can still find ways to
answer our questions today we can
explore the problems and boil them down
to small research questions and then try
and often we can find ways to answer
them without having the full autonomous
scenario on the roads one example is
that if you want to look at mobility
improvements for elderly people and just
say kind of would they travel more would
they participate more in society you
could also give them taxi vouchers and
see what's happening and how they'd use
them and of course all the time we get
more opportunities as there will be more
automated vehicles on the road so take
aways there's lots of potential with
automated vehicles but also dangers and
problems so many car manufacturers and
technology companies I kind of creating
subsidiary's announcing fully autonomous
vehicles and the fact of the challenges
for us human factors researchers still
remain because there will see every
humans in the vehicles outside of the
vehicles and in the the wild traffic
environment and I find it quite
interesting to look at the challenges
posed by artificial intelligence and we
do our best to kind of answer what we
can today with the research methods we
have so are we taking the human factors
research out of the loop with autonomous
driving now we still need to consider
the human being so that's all that's me
and please don't forget to write the
session
