stop talking it's my Johnson I had a
dream I dreamt of doing operations for
large-scale applications to White Way so
for your game games here and here 23
million users they have a lot of hours
and you have to fix them trick enough
and I had a renovation how to do this
better than every tool of Margaret and I
rent on this cast to make this happen
when products and tools he attorney and
when false and despair disaster and
didn't work at all and then
elasticsearch came along hey maybe stop
that mean for us
let's have so I had this dream how did
the game's history so when I started
here this company over seven years ago
my first game was this game monster it's
a beautiful farm game unfortunately
anymore shut down this we must go there
was no memory but basically it's a farm
game was fresh game when the game we
started we all that stay everything from
the database to the time have to press
something on the game click button is
killing our squad would be done on
better information that will be safe
there so we have not even a veteran
client and lodging in the background was
mostly to validate of the time and was
not sending the right thing and error
the game was pretty successful so it
still get something like 2.5 million
and users clicked a lot so we had
something like 10,000 API calls per
second these are more force than he has
but actually he still changing state to
daily so we had something like wonderful
day was vice president and never thought
about a large and the article is
consistent so we had something actually
served as 150 applications well versed
and sell it to cable service everyone
else establish service cost a single
mother failure and I'm the only person
to blame for that across the system
shame on me but I was also doing uncle
UT you build it we run it I broke up in
the last night fix man so whenever we
have these kind back-end running our
sink an exception request in the server
and users then can see this talking
about no problem we love and continue
and most of the time actually this
happened you to network colors so
seventy percent of the airspeed have
internet
I mean someone to defuse might have best
anchor connection Raziel is also another
government is not so great so basically
one quarter bust even one cc because
these costs are not animals just like
was not so travel user that might happen
everyone else at least 30 grand
conservation so not that bad at all for
some high-tech personal uses every day
monitoring some kind of profits and
that's two hundred fifty thousand users
today so that's a lot of noise you seem
so forget about that I fixing all
backstitch simply not possible in this
kind of system so besides these network
problems we had three main categories of
arrows and one boss we have some
harbhajan singh apart of failure
databases training but they were kind of
easy to detect nothing father for the
rest he had something like she had more
than let's say 15 hours per minute
person bracelet waking up in the middle
there for real Anjali we had a second
category the trip cheetahs so are we are
we bail remember this family who managed
to create 500,000 exceptions in a single
hour and two o'clock in the morning
three times in 28 in the world and
brought the intimate organization that
just checking how many sections you have
is not the best thing because deputies
are betrayed masters of these exceptions
so actually what we want to know even
arrows importantly want to check like
how many users that is actually the
metric and it became my trust to
convince everyone including human that
please don't check the numbers of errors
always check for how many different
users are factors that is much more
problematic unfortunately it's also much
harder so anything from we have caused
by the new version does I mean tests
coverage of flesh
didn't help that the projects are all
sorts of company they need to go the
golf retreat I was held so one thing
doesn't even come back operation
business press pass TP so we have a
universe out there and his admittance we
need to know the version new versions
worse or better than your efforts worse
than need to go back over fast Sophie to
expect I found a screenshot of this
video to smoke mine and behold my HTML
and CSS beauty you see here kind of like
the left-hand side is economic avi
falsity half and you see two girls so we
were segmenting the users by version of
our time this case my version and then
look at this you see that is a newly old
version the new birth roughly ten
percent of using breaks at seven
thousand in this 10 minute Frank
directive and about 67,000 you are
wanting to do and for each of these api
calls then we will open up to data
search and the bracket is kind of like
how many exceptions here how many users
will knew how many sections we have and
the percentage is how many percentage of
users bogeys and that is happen saying
it's pretty easy right so here 28 10 8
users were affected more than 18
but he has he done like 19 years
perfecting new girl and Sammy's video
still the present Josiah so the thing is
by using error rates you have an
organization to prepare different
different sizes user seconds and later
on this became very relevant a new book
on mobile operations and you staged
rollouts they thought you were the one
percenters users on any word you can
prepare these the error rates that is
one percent of users head to the 99 so
there's no holding back it's a simple
thing but I want this deadly so I had
this I until I could show the people and
he was right there was just not for me
so yes I could segment users perversion
in time and I could have to see you know
like Caesar weights and they could
measure losses in fact it to let me
inside together from times today
different types of either and also
different games because of something
that compared against me so this was my
dream but in the implementation side
come this is
actually there are more educational
stuff so I had added one more days I
mean and to make it one this is running
an amazon used EBS volumes on all
solid-state this anything and they were
running in the rate zero concentration
remote for humans this is scared of you
so this is the no redundancies thing so
among them ever got head actually it was
just still down and that won't slow down
the basically the back there this
database filler better to be that mentor
database explode after that all the
plastics we need to hear this it's a bit
of irony so the system i managed to
measure this cause this so yes i have
this act is kind of like holy basic
Emery's are the way to go yes but they
also put everything in five other
students down maybe there was something
to do so the years go by I still
believed in my dream I saw still on my
chest so on 2013 I
there was a student bachelors
I reckon this time we have traded this
new team before we have against so one
team was responsible for one game and
then back in terms of how the team
there's more are games that more and
more made a sense because he so we
created one team to provide services by
the tennis service to these other teams
so this team simple a conservative
opening this offering cells by
resistance configuration any test a
payment wire and I practice student to
create a new service so look like this
again for setting something Paul put it
in producer then white took after which
the human system the region at the time
crucible very powerful in Africa it's ok
if not come to me later when I have
something in mind let them to my level
of violence kaskus espero quick assembly
the student before was working in the
business intelligence team and
everything cast iron customers so
actually you are using their system so
who got all business events or business
in the IRS right over this time see and
then you were just in a browser go they
have great educational be to their homes
first look super straightforward not
really respond so it was like yes yet
the system and ask one step closer to
her dream and the really am like this
after on QA makes so much sense at
negative of us so there was no of
exploding fires everywhere anymore that
was good he mentioned not only took
three thousand crashes but also like
int'l statements are statements in every
life you or three baxter ironic through
the system because we have the very easy
and the full-text search and you learn
that
I mean this of course boss is like
centers in concentric stinkfoot exert
our students so yes was working six
weeks on the car load and then moved on
and test coverage
how so close
s chance one year later the lap times
this term except I'm if we're working
games and most games will just fail so
that's just reality and mar- on your
games combined we stop sometime
introduction across we realized we
didn't and that type of something that
when you stop the project was some back
and developers on it then you start a
new project he don't get back and right
away so what will the back of the girls
put in Disney at that time so we have
two left and at the moment one set off
to fix my restaurants the world and one
I could convince the nicest and the
stuffiness feature so there's some books
the business nice combine so you see
here kind of like this is the numbers
percentage of users
it could see this over time we could
either through powers my name instead
nice to see like what induces what I was
esteemed then is room in a bit glad to
see like that how many r processor all
off from this deception of this ever
happened how many pizzas were affected
involve the sensitive uses of this so I
had my hair right finally circles
actually this kind of system is very
hard to build because many of our ways
it's not only the events that leads to
another network you also need to know
how many this did not have a network at
the time mark make sense so every time
someone started playing a session and we
you know this is making ten times a day
they will need to send a call to our
packages it again so that the whole like
Tom uses a cane system so we can
calculate is percentage of users and
also this revelation
it's not a trivial operation good for us
they're also like paper enough ratings
given in this my paper was about high /
low block that's a probabilistic
algorithm actually from 2007-11 bloom
filter was in vogue and 2013 year he
implemented at every game everywhere and
have a lot of making us in 2014 and I
think I need to explain to the office
does and I'm borrowing some thought four
to ten years who had salad year 2014
decremented crashlytics answers based on
high / low key so I can offer our
progress let's imagine you have 1
billion devices but unique identifiers
otherwise exist and if you want to store
them all in one set to see like this is
usually set up answer watercraft
accountant continuity as I said anyone
need something like 10 gigabytes of data
let's have a lot of the need for
pirouette but you sacrifice some
accuracy because it's a probabilistic
very one and it works like this so you
would take the device ID and we'll take
cash out of it so only five whatever
some creative 7 64 bit of that and in
that net
then they look for the longest
consecutive role of bonds so you don't
remember the whole get set but you're
just an m-type okay in this case we have
four months Americans have it in for of
this and for every easily important to
typography just measure like which was
the highest number of consecutive
monthly ever saw it's a bit like let's
say I need to coin and to toss the coin
and taxes abundant 80 and you throw them
up and down the whole time to come back
what's long streak of hat and after some
time I come back and we tell me three
the longest a row of Hans's three I
don't know they're probably on board
after five meetings and very long if it
had be 20 by then you toss of the coin
bot and it's got like this so basically
it's an attack simulation how many
different user use internet thing the
problem is the very first that stuff in
my vball ones and then you get to
complete a different result so they do
something I activity is the first bits
of that of the bit set to determine
trackers for example if you just use the
first bit then they're fifty percent of
diversity going to Pakistan fifty
percent
to you and if you usually use terms like
discussed system this so you have 65
care practice and this outlier
everything one language effector in
volume of the 65 k box so they take
attendance what goes to explain later
the thing is this is a very clever thing
to not use a much memory and CPU
consumption to find out how many
definitely use it it's basically a
distinct background very good and very
fast you suck sacrifice some probability
we might be offensive so all the net
time bye-bye pepper can we set up a
dress to it that system based on that
how cool is that that's left so if we do
a lot of stuff and he chose balances
system so basically in berlin you can
spawn love process the process a bit
like sweat and a JDM but it's much more
life and social problems one more cig
machine each one has its own dark
relations
in this regard that forest ecto someone
was occur so let's say get progress with
the newly diversity and yours powerful
forces that will keep this hyperbolic
structure in them away and different
colors would go to the same level so we
just need something with for keywords a
magnet for itself and the sustainable in
memory cells class if you stop sending
requests to their thing then you have a
timeout after some time that's part of
the key framework and you will just dump
the number we have to this and have a
wonderful breakfast then for example the
number of distinct users in a day or
minute our second so you score different
counters by like this and after some
time is supposed to provide if the
nougat rest comes time to read this or
to buy something else in response and
rose again look on this week we find it
we score the state 30 so this is how
basically stateful session the state or
concept this is how we buy someone like
most of all they be above a page so to
draw in all this time it's this kind of
conferences and for every hour of you
would have different counters so imagine
my to get an error event in then it will
update 3 counters so one for a campaign
Malcolm and once our community actually
to be more clever so we get these masses
of advancing
just updates feelings are just in memory
which you're talking about each that's
awesome that's really fast and if you
put this hole in the system that looks a
bit like this I get this depressed in a
process that process spots of groups
that managers group so that's basically
the information for the error that have
the same name as that person the trolls
same process so you spawn off but this
time we would come sister diamond
Willoughby's who can do some extra
operations so we would stall for some
respect wrist but i have only once
and this group process but then he was
once notice one of these countless or
multiple colors for each other so this
is a system that is basically modeled
after fitters form it's kind of a
classic real-time processing system and
it's pretty cool stuff benchmark this
and I just about nice we cool system and
of course this need to run a cluster
because develop into more than one cheap
and low and then some thing is how this
customer together so let's say we got
water updating group on the first over
here but to infest ends up here and we
need to know k need to update group
roast on the other nails so in the java
body was used some light zookeeper based
on patches aguas on
imitation framework to be created and
this locker frozen hands on a machine
and basically this one process if they
are like a bitch cameras managed by
bitch machine because men having spawned
a new process be able to register there
so this guy he knows that the group is
here because this would question and
then we'll just send the data to them
that's how customers so basically you
can't in any node in the cluster and the
data would get medically and
and this
it's magnificent
possibly go wrong with the system that
awful sorry awesome it's amazing two
things change after we finished the guy
on to you enter into the system first of
all calm down okay offices to look at
home so we have a little bit of that
from which the game's attitude this
decline however this data later I forgot
that part sorry your browser same thing
he had a singer christina me who's the
singer that before so this morning
typically angler and angular would call
talk to actually one of these machines
who have a different role and this was
then expect ratified basically to prove
very particular take on so this is the
system and this is magnificent and
nothing will go wrong because because I
mean you often this was we simplified
version of explaining the system it took
me some days to find out over a servo
could possibly actually to say sir so
first one we launched a new game
this is a mobile game and it was the
biggest launch into the system so he
knew exactly when to start that he had
to hike contain the Aqua came running up
to TV advertising whatever so I think we
have something like three million
installs of the earth became and this
game had one thing that he didn't did
talk before it was my one end world and
it was good and bad for the system you
come to the same and the second thing is
remember there was a lap time project
and lap time projects are temporary so
exactly when this project can be one and
what good was becoming more for the most
of one thing ever the sky death penalty
so the simple decade services team were
used to dealing with resistance and
other systems they sunny in out in this
system just a moment then it becomes
really and he had the course and the
first one just
basically they also worked with you so
whenever they had one game a new version
of the game soft launch berth Emma just
gotta compete every fix that it would
have gone top city running amazon
proteinases on top apparently same setup
have a producer of attitudes you in the
consumer then puts it into the system
data records said that one was easy to
hit the sack nieman was not so easy to
fix so he has highly disregarded really
cool online counting cover system this
one here and the problem is there was a
lot of interactions the communication
because of these counters at the end
they had more than a million of these
processes running around edges that
everyone went to their own bed
sweetheart and every press after that
only three but when you are trying to
read than you might think something like
thousands also he had some nasty little
impossibly ever in fact distributed
network out an assistant
by yourself that's what I'm coming two
weeks the whole team to just fight and
the whole system is kind of like kind of
like the old days so 11 daughter just
about got a thing and then come back to
other customers are saying that
hopefully came crashing down in the end
we just remove all
so on and as he said every game designs
on one of these nodes in the cluster
this is finally accepted the way they
the same very how are you ready because
it only at least effective this time
they only here 8 service includes of 14
and every user which was I probably
using system so we just completely
removed her into a classic communication
with some kind of step Charlotte like
this we use complexity a lot and
suddenly we could mostly rappers but the
third problem and we were assuming there
every event that comes in the number of
cars you would my to this follows the
eventual end its linear so 35 cars that
were fun and the whole system was based
on the crumbs and that would have been
true different system unfortunately when
you look back at these slides maybe you
notice this here we have two versus so
of course then we need to come to be any
different counters right so I need to
calculate the number of users affected
we'll be in the process more than just
conversion and comes in first to lose
this one it's a faceted search that's
many different dimensions so we thought
it would be like this vanity that first
be multi-dimensional is both do not only
updated 3 counter but three colors per
person from operating system version and
every device and we are talking
about any word watch at 95,000 objects
which I was gutted something 20 house
this is actually one we taste but a
spirit was unbearable and very tough to
handle then I mean also in the legal ID
he could combine these so you could
select one berth on technical version so
we also needed to install commerce the
combination and when he did Ferris to
the system and these houses none of
memory it could happen that one crab
meat and one is that they had something
like they were started like 100,000
processors at the same time at the cell
phone memory so during the warmer
transferring the whole system so yes I
had my sister and actually he managed to
Nash's admirable and without his system
we would not have been able to do that
because at that time for unity there was
no service available and by this kind of
like different
find out like this is about device it
has only 16 kilobytes of memory so we've
all shipped it so we could exclude them
from and then was critical for the
success of a lot so in that sense this
project was successful I felt like this
is awesome firefighting the whole time
so we had something like early to make
this is the fire thing about something
like this because of my stupid sister or
maybe fall and then we spend another 10
to fix it maybe running because we're
committed to the system we had this body
we had to make it actually is Heather
ourselves an internal deadline for I
think first of the summer 2014 if you
put it succinctly put everything away
just based upon body apart I'm fixing
system or negative value state attorneys
before the both really flows
in the student protest system we have
learned that school and full-text in
year-round I remember like probably
remember 10 years ago very soon from
destruction I remember said that context
are cool could you add something like
just a search box or something so he
took the system after you and just will
find everything happens then that you
will get actually call that the system
will get just put white dumb to
elasticsearch so a key thing sometimes
out of a service okay cool so then we
had such boat anglers on just one or
volume so this was silver Georgia
systematical take certain to you and
this is the net exactly centered and he
did the most simple thing he could do
you just trust trying to go back they
found enables the plastic cloud just
picked something that we have to service
so we have to service and two very very
zones
and on Highway Patrol and every day
which are starting windows we will have
14 of them 14 the next part so far the
news just that
so
so for me the first really a surprise
that we make all this effort and all
this pain and we really professional
persons per unit asses off tonight is
fine and the same water table is just
done with the visitors vice no
optimization whatever interests up at it
and then we read something we might
guess this likely to actually hurt
called hyper local customers are
actually in Valley talk about that boss
on a blog post from lesson because they
commended have a lot of customers in an
estimate and basically what it does is
it is the same recklessness have a lot
of not fun writing the letter but when
reading it on the fire ant mound just
ask so basically you have four different
aggregation is you can have a power
piston company collects though I can say
like do this aggravation and it uses I
forgot the other algorithm and if the
data set that we give users have a lock
so basically what I've just described to
you and just on the fine they're only
mark weisman to Travis interesting so we
can around a bit whiskey bar and this
case we have enough are you I felt
system and it didn't trash the whole
system yes but just that by to fiddle
advice islamic faceted search and this
is something i met this morning just to
get speeches that so all these were so
and painting only girls is surface owe
me that sounds interesting so we traded
the new system the system to double in
this side everything must go
use this and just cow all that stuff and
that's a good way but the one this is
the system through the door and you know
this to go simple they won't make
everything better because not you so
your angular and the steam there's no
drugs with development on the teeth on
later left the team and an actor
spiritual belief is very powerful system
but this are folks who really know how
to run amazon service or routine
operation no movie and our script and
and you just had a small great education
for just how to react application and it
looks beautiful so it's not once
just need to show your influences this
is not life on our system
so this is one of my life games
let's see that looks
ah so we're not suggesting I see message
so it's a really cool thing so it's a
really nice grant application so that's
the life you of one of our games from
sex games that's a lot of warns no
errors and of course because we need to
be pretty cool it's all one page is well
then if you click on whatever here I
don't see when I'm clicking here they
scroll down you can use the mouse to
skip through there or so these are all
real time very less exposure index that
have a few words in it engine starts and
really cool it can even close something
like to go down like t'see let's see I
want to see all marks by this operating
system version
yeah I can't I don't know how to sue me
and the thing is that because this is
all one page and it's react he managed
to build so many bugs in it that we no
longer know how to fix them so if so
basically add the filter here and if I
do the same thing i manually I get
different results and lots of other
things so it's a really cool licensed of
it it's beautiful I mean look at this
it's it's amazing you see that versus
and compare like which ones better and
all that and it's just an amazing system
so there's so much for
no mr.
so do you know the game trying to mouse
yesterday
so two beautiful system and you actually
just tuning today for marketing this
professional to other countries but the
reality is they're us for this team it
was super hard maintain so yes successes
the system lenient beautiful and does
fulfill all the requirements just this
team was not able to sustain so bad fix
it is a feature request in that thing so
the first system you should also put the
background you should also include this
product so coming to the last system and
I really like this acronym in case
especially the second test so so we had
system and the success was just working
beautifully I just differ so we kept
exactly the same deck hand and put it
before the first of all so we just used
to playing where its application because
for this team
and it's not hoping that we go just
 gross and this is how the start
it doesn't look as beautiful as the
other one see if this time it goes bad
so this is beautiful but this is a new
version
and production texto have some food
so basically is a classic vessel search
on elastic search this game has seen
something like 3-4 hours a day and many
clicks something then you're when you
eat no Ethel's calling as some
data can also go over there girls 50
bucks have some charts basic
ha
so if you want to know what manager so
it has same functionality it's not that
nice probably not nice enough to pay for
it so the system now is capable of
assessing something like 30 seconds but
we have total for each individual game
1,000 requests so this is something
maybe a quarter on the pieces if you
have more we just stop talking tests so
we protect our system something that we
also learn the hard way and monday is
very much less per second
it just works on these two service as
because it's exactly the same day I
didn't change anything on the elastic
stretch reckon just call today for 14
days I'm various 20 million events in
the system the total size of the first
few bucks so actually this thing enough
us and this elastic search system we are
not seeing bound oh man we gon via this
is ex parte so and you look at all the
data that we have in here so he said if
the games see this is for 30 days to see
these days of ice that if India and for
time for our favorites the solar stocks
you see these two different goals at the
Essex arguments so that's a producer
starting a session and these are narrows
so one large
now but if you look for the last month's
you see these outlines real remember
very early in the beginning like our
posters activity version please meet us
since you have Q in there this is a
delay time so this is how all the
records are that basically it's a red
line and if something we misbehave so
working this up before get to the base
of his eye
I mean
so for me this is the time County to
look back I believe who God the seven
just actually provides the last day here
in this office start something you do
that in two piece so and by doing the
total for and now was this talk was kind
of like to reflect a look back because
this was all food fest and journey for
me about five six years and one thing
even with all the pain and all that
using our brains melt away how we do it
here we go maybe not restricting caught
up daily switch to using and extensors
but this is today how we know our two
operations are so honest revving up for
me is kind of like the d communities be
consistent about it all the years even
if its payment cock-ups but that's how
many life
a second one for me is the solution and
build need to fit to the problem first
we're time for such a thing that was an
awesome amazing thing and it really got
there was a brilliant engineer
engineering masters but it was not fit
to the problem Kozma and what they
talked about the whole premises were
exploded by the second one I mean that
that's all right cleanest requirement
immune system but a secondary for me is
even more fun because it was not so
clear to me for a solution that build
they also need to fit to the team
maintaining auditory but where we have
come by the color of like everything
anew the innovative do something you and
you just overdid it this anything
Twitter spa is really cool of your
twitter if you are not with amazing
should not try to the system which makes
me to the last night additionally funny
still is it's amazing
so we had this great system and he
resigned says dr. asses off tonight as
well single argument its many white
people until us just in case the Bekaa
Valley which are host servers made us to
church and it just different and for me
allow me to learn system that is more
simple that is my attitude that upholds
really the relative kiss by keep it
simple stupid the stupidest most of the
time to myself something that I really
admire and really proves me developers
so for me elasticsearch really is is
amazing because it allows me to do their
to simplify system by are so many good
it still works so for me my son
so if you have questions and also the
time constant if a photog inside decided
you could say losing electrons per day
of all performance who takes the best
accessory no comments have adjustable
show you so if you tend to be charged
for a larger stain you might want
something like maybe five seconds or so
but as long as there are small gains
that only major so it's pretty enough so
say Seth usually 20 seconds so it's not
like it locks that you go like the new
trailer for any minute it's not the case
because they tossed our structure and I
think it's also due to the very obvious
problem how
it's very simple it's basically so we
have arrested the other clients will
close which is basically instrument of
key value pairs and some of the words
can be pretty long for somebody to look
something like breadcrumbs or metadata
or safest and most of time it's very
easy to use that applies and so about
all this is left there also needs yeah
it is not necessary this is another
subscribe and you maybe share some work
or magnitude like around ten five or
like 100 times assuming how it feels in
the air
things for the something like 20 Keys
results or 15 to 20 keys and then maybe
sneeze for large ones like the bread
profits can be years okay but something
so all pretty small documents Khan had
to
so we used to dominate Tony and also
from time to time to give access to all
developers to their really want to
having but we did not really consider it
to make it publicly available to
everyone because they me feel like a
different person then kind of like
affect everything but also actually from
most cards we don't want to spend time
educating everyone system so we decided
to build we have an opinion on what
matters not and to put that in your eye
and and used to God if you really need
to get data data but then is probably
what I got us and Arthur gay to use to
determine anything else cause 100
similar errors so basically all the
hours they are moved so far cataria so
so the consumer actually creates a hash
out of I think it's names they are too
talented and I thought exception anthem
and the hash of the sectors of both
together and then used as unique
identifier rules for the navigation in
decline but also scores document so
basically this identifier becomes one of
the field of their princes of the 20
million and then we can basically the
neck get them all that have the same on
them two distinct offer users to get an
erection it's pretty simple so it's a
blessing of every error event that the
only thing is we put in this group are
you so the connector and the booze just
mash
the question Sofia using Amazon's
elastic search so the car version 2.2
version 2.0 to use Amazon's elastic
search and instead of stl solution so
right now we are not using Amazon all
the education service are a Muslim and
also elastic hopes hostin the reason why
Chris vigil is that the standards
service silence for work tirelessly
pretty much runs size and can just scale
it up and because we'll need along this
pace we are very overpriced in terms of
CPU if maybe 20 sit 10 users using the
system and you put the ruthless Reina's
house if you just will have more
disguise so you're probably too
what instance types are years because I
think the whole thing it's 64 gigabyte
12 of them so I think talk across the
sample xtina out of those months ever
since everything is easy be half are we
let's go eat
