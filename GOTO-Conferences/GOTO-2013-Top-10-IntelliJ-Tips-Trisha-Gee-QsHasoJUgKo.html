top-10 IntelliJ tips I'm not gonna do 10
IntelliJ tips I just thought that that
was great alliteration so I might do
more I might do less and Dan has
threatened to pair with me so I don't
know if he's going to or not no maybe
yes alright so what I'm gonna do I can't
see anyone and what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna go and I'm gonna do some actual
work I'm gonna do a real piece of code
that we need to implement so this could
of course go horribly wrong because you
know that you don't do code in 30
seconds flat it's always this always
takes longer than you expect it to so
we'll see how this goes and I have an
emergency bailout mechanism if this
doesn't work which is to flee and get
out of here I don't have a timer so I
don't know whether I'm gonna be running
out of time can can you tell me when
I've done 10 minutes and then I can pull
into emergency procedure okay so this is
the good thing about working for MongoDB
I work for mommy duty by the way not
JetBrains but I'm wearing my IntelliJ
t-shirt just for the sake of it and the
good thing about working for MongoDB is
that all of our code is open source so I
can actually do real work in the open
and you can look at it which is quite
cool that I have to worry about
anonymizing all my classes so that you
can see it I'm I am an intelligent I
have used NetBeans and Eclipse and I
think I started using buy or vert door
something and I didn't really mind which
one I used for a long time because it to
me it was just a tool for typing into
which just shows just how wrong I was
and I started pairing with people that
Lmax and the reason I was kind of
ambivalent between Eclipse and IntelliJ
at the time and the reason I switched to
IntelliJ is because most people are
almost all it is better obviously and
but most people at Lmax were using it
and so we were pairing on the same IDE
and I learned how to use it really
effectively and for me anyway and and I
wouldn't have got that if I hadn't
paired it would have just been just
another editor to me so the piece of
what we're going to do is we have this
command class
okay and we want to get rid of this
command class right yes we're moving
deep it okay yes totally so we're moving
from commands to operations
Nach which is more or less the same
things just a different word the first
thing I want to do is I need to find all
the subclasses of of this command how
did you do that how did I do that mostly
what I do it's a good question because
then after after I've done the muscle
memory thing then I have to look at
which keys it was it was alt command and
B to find all of the implementers of a
particular class and so I'm gonna pick
list databases because that's a really
nice little one that I want to get rid
of so now I want to find everywhere
where list databases is used which is
alt f7 and and it's used you'll notice
it's not used in the test so is used in
this field it's it's used in this class
called Mongo now I'm working on the new
driver for MongoDB my plugin for my
company um and we've got two we've got
two api's at the moment we have the old
compatibility API and we have the new
API and so there's a certain amount of
stuff which obviously you want to share
between the two ap is which is kind of
the reason for moving towards operations
so that we can have operations which we
share between both api's and all they do
is to call the operation and the API is
quite a dumb layer on top of it and so I
found I know I can enter option layer
between the two worlds right so I found
that lists databases is used inside
Mongo which I happened to meet happen to
know is the old world order because it's
got driver compact there and I need to
find what my next keyboard shortcut was
and I also need to find write and I know
the equivalent in the New World Order
some doing command n is a client admin
in pull one of the things I was calling
new code in Paloma cuz that be this is
the new code this we should talk
this gloss over that and so one of the
things I like about command and if you
use IntelliJ you probably already know
this but you can't you don't have to
fill in the whole word translate for the
non Mac people control in oh yeah sorry
yeah and sometimes it's a command can
sometimes it's controlling sometimes
it's not but um so I can do color as in
and then I get my client have an input
which I really like because I'm an
extremely lazy typist so I happen to
know that if I do I need to find command
and f12 will tell me all of all the
methods in here and I know that this has
a database names as well so that's like
a little overview of the current yes so
command of twelve and I can see it's the
same thing that turns up in the
structure you start typing there what
happens oh there you go so get database
names and I'm here so what I want to do
is I want to share the code here this
code here is pretty similar to this code
here so I want to move this into an
operation I'm gonna remove the to do
that's how I fixed it I just removed it
and so what I really want to do is I
need to turn this into an operation it's
already using command operation but
command operation is a generic operation
which is kind of reusable so I want to
create a new get date get database names
operation and normally if I wasn't so
this is refactoring but normally what
I'd be doing is I have a unit test or
acceptance test and I would write what I
was expecting an acceptance test and
create the classes from the acceptance
test we're just driving in from the
outside here yeah so I know this is very
similar to the the the hardcore TDD
earlier things this is really nice kind
of time so it's I'm not writing the test
here because I'm doing refactoring but
that's what I would normally do so and
of course you have to have to check
whether this is gonna be the right yeah
we'll get there yeah removing code
around right now that's true that's why
I wanted to I did want to show that
actually I wanted to show that so get
database names and wanted to check that
it is in fact tested so I'm going to do
alt f7 it's in something called DB test
and it's a hidden something called Mongo
methods test this is the old code okay
this will be better
and client admin importers test that
already Pacific current admin in pool
let's see if there's any test for that
there's an acceptance test database
admin acceptance test should list all
the databases available whether it
sounds like something I wrote um and so
anyway moving simply on I know this
needs to extend base operation against
super super lazy and this is going to
return a list of strings I haven't done
Java for a while I'm if they dangle
better don't lie and so neurons are
going to do the magic alt-enter button
because alt enter if you're in doubt
press alt enter and I'm going to
implement the methods on that abstract
class so and if you're a Simpsons fan is
the little nodding bird think all you
need is that most of your coding that's
exactly and so then the other thing
that's missing is it is constructor so
it creates my constructor from the
superclass
the general theme here is like anything
you can possibly infer any type English
that can be inferred you shouldn't have
to tie it no all right so this is a
whole class and I did it with I don't
know like half a dozen keystrokes and
the other thing I want to do obviously
is they want to create a test for it so
I press the command shift and T and it
says though you don't have a test for
this not surprisingly so I'm going to
create a test for it I'm going to create
a spock test for it because spock is
amazing you should all use it for cash
in and then i'm going to create one of
these I'm going to put it in unit I'm
gonna have that yes let's get I'm gonna
extend oh no I'm gonna extend
specification or IntelliJ you've let me
down
oh no specification import
and I'm not gonna write the test because
IntelliJ support for group that's left
to do yeah until the movie is pretty
good so I've got I also have and I have
custom templates so that I don't have to
do as much typing so I type test and
press tab and it gives me my test so
should be amazing and then then I can
work my test but I'm not going to do the
groovy test because IntelliJ support for
groovy is pretty good but it's not it's
perfect you can't get all the way
factoring stuff there okay so what I'm
going to do now and so now I've got
wiggly line here so I'm going to do so
obviously I added that default
constructor so what I could do if I
wanted to see what the default
constructor is is I could click in here
and I can have a look and see your
buffer provider session closed session
and I I'm pressing command alt and back
to go back to where I came from or I
could just go in here and press command
P and I would see what I need to put in
there
so that's your signature right here yes
I get oh no it's not giving me the
IntelliJ wake up get buffer no I know
what it is it's not what are you doing
live demos safe it should be kept which
I always nothing it doesn't like get
buffer pool it's not doing command P
anymore either
no oh it's not touching through anymore
so let's let's let's close this and
reopening its own it off and on again
I don't fail again it's a good thing
you're done again I don't want to so I'm
learning two things I learned that
IntelliJ is awesome let's head down the
max really flaky it's it's totally fine
it's always fine this is ridiculous oh
no I'm gonna have to turn it off and on
again how embarrassing
I'm gonna write two jetbrains and give
them a little handle on the fire they
did it it's not even it's not even
shutting down now oh no no all these
Macs
these kids are there max should run a
proper operating system in a shake and
there you see procedures running you
should be running Linux but the Mac is
so pretty it matches my glasses it does
that's amazing
I know and it's totally died and now
I'll cut shut it down do you have X kill
is there like if you go to come on front
old force quickly oh I did old Oh No
okay so back in some village a Holtz and
then click up there oh yeah that was
mm-hmm I am a developer really die die
rogue process die come back I've got
three minutes right I might jump to the
weekend we can get there three minutes
ten tips hey a useful Mac shortcut what
was that die bunny died all right our
client admin in foam pool session yay
yeah it just they just had a had a bit
of a I had a moment someone's gonna say
I should be using Emacs now I can't
think hey and I think you should be
coding in Lisp rather than Java as well
fine get session and then outright Raja
space from ethics
Kotaro shifts yeah and that usually says
what do you want to put here yeah that's
better typed completion space that's
happened then it will just follow that
word up so that's that's a good thing
okay cool so I've got one of those I'm
gonna now just do a cotton copy paste
coding there is a way to move methods
into other classes but that actually
takes longer in the end of the day so
I'm gonna put oh no I know what I wanted
to do
undo command said undo said undo I want
to in line
you can't me see this for I'm gonna in
line this constant because I want to
move this code and I'm going to in line
this constant so command alt n for in
line and because I want to keep that and
then when it get for you going to unpack
them again yes
maybe see how it goes see how much time
we have so that I could put that in
there yeah if I want to I can be I can
say this is the OSHA to admin database
no no please
and then I want one of these so I'm
gonna do I'll enter my emerges thing
create the field for command codec this
is actually a codec no it's not one of
those stop being so quick and then I'm
going to turn that into a final so then
IntelliJ says you need to initialize it
I'm going to add it in the constructor
parameter so that's fine it'll just do
that for me and then this is great so
again you're doing it it's very
intentional it's like this is the code I
want and it figures out where it needs
to put stuff yeah and then hopefully
here it will wherever it has gone oh
yeah it's putting the right thing
command codec because I called it
command codec so it knew that I needed a
command product get off a pool client
this is one of these on these in the
fields description so did you pull that
up as a field oh yeah sorry
command alt F it initializes it here and
I want to move the assignment to the
field declaration I don't actually what
I really want is I want it to be in the
constructor and then I can say I want to
push this into parameter so command alt
p pushes up as the parameter I'm going
to call that description and it figures
out this needs to be renamed this
description and then when I go back to
here it's used client don't get
clustered or get description to put the
right thing in there mm-hmm
so that's all that's all fine we've got
eight seconds left and so now I can
show you all the top ten tips I was
really going to show you if you want
awesome so what I've really got is I
wanted to say what are these going so
these are some of my main I'm keyboard
shortcuts and I've got 13 of them so I
don't know if I've got time to quickly
demo some of those shortcuts or if we've
done enough or we we have nothing right
a hard stop here but and yes so these
are good shortcuts to freeze-frame
yes and and that's it thank you oh yes
so I've got an idea plug-in which didn't
fire up actually when I was doing that
which shows you the keyboard shortcuts
for stuff if you start using the mouse
too much so that's quite good it's
called key something you just I did a
google for keyboard shortcuts in
IntelliJ IDEA um and other plugins the
Gradle plug-in is pretty good as well
but the keyboard one is pretty good when
you when you starting to learn IntelliJ
and you don't know what the keyboard
shortcuts are it will always flash up
and say you should have done this and
that's a really good way to get up to
speed very quickly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
