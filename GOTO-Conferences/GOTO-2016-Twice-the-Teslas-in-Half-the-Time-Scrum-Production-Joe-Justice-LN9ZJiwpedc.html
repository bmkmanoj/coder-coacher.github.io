president of scrum and hardware at scrum
incorporated I primarily work with
manufacturing teams and R&amp;amp;D teams or Rd
then through production and the
president of scrum and hardware at scrum
incorporated I'm the founder and CEO of
wikispeed incorporated that's a
automotive manufacturing company teeny
tiny but very global we have very small
operations in 23 countries and that's
run all with scrum and I'm the author of
the extreme manufacturing methods you
may bumped into me I'm lucky enough to
been written up in for Forbes five times
I've had the privilege of guest
lecturing at MIT Cambridge Oxford
University in England and others Harvard
Business Review has three articles about
me and my work this year alone I've had
the opportunity and was able to give a
TEDx talk on scrum and hardware now so
I'll keep in mind TEDx is the junior
leagues
there's TEDx and then there's Ted I did
TEDx so it's not that huge but it was
still a fantastic experience the
Discovery Channel has done a miniature
documentary on me and the car company I
own wikispeed Incorporated and CNN Money
fortune wrote an article about how
wikispeed Inc the company I founded and
owned how they operate and they titled
the article how every company should
train their staffers oh thank you CNN
Money so depending on where you get your
news you might have bumped into me
before but let's do the short version of
this presentation I think we can I've
always wanted to try this so glad no one
said no yet here is
wikispeed calm right so there's one of
our cars being driven by trans logic one
of the media programs that's that's
covered us there's our car it's fast
it's ultra efficient it's extremely
affordable it's the least expensive
carbon-fiber mid-engine rear-wheel drive
extruded aluminum thing in the world
that you can buy and it's all built with
scrum and we have a lot of fun with it
I'd like to share an open letter I wrote
to Tesla and this is hosted on wikispeed
comm and the article is entitled twice
the Tesla's in half the time here's what
I've got for you
in 2006 I designed and manufactured the
wikispeed modular car very soon after
there was a whole team supporting me but
it did begin in my garage at that time
in Denver Colorado in the United States
now I live in Seattle Washington in the
United States and that was the car in
2010 team wikispeed produced the scrum
build server in software if you create a
cool modular piece of software and you
need to compile it you need a a build
server so we had cool CAD well in the
beginning it was me but soon it was a
week we had cool cat of cars we wanted
to make so we needed a yeah and that
would be a whole factory if I could
afford one but I just started my garage
I didn't have $100,000,000 mega factory
so we had to figure something out and it
turned out we figured out was
revolutionary but none of us realized it
at the time here's what happened in 2010
team wikispeed produced the scrum build
server a scrum team with flexible
tooling capable of compiling a wide
variety of CAD designs testing them and
deploying them as complete physical
products so this is what it looks like
inside a scrum build server there are
five teams with colored clothes and they
use CNC machines if when we can afford
them they use hand tools which actually
work really well and they're much
cheaper and they take CAD and they make
physical stuff and then they test it and
they deploy it they compile the cat into
physical stuff like this car
so this is a scrum builder server making
this car in 2011 Tim Meyer helped us
refined refine our test-driven
development practices to create modern
continuous integration and continuous
delivery for the wiki speed build server
in hardware in 2011 Keith bhulok
designed and help us prototype the shop
in the box or shipping container micro
factory this portable factory module has
known stable input and output and may be
arranged with other micro factories to
create a modular factory for complex
products the advantage being it is very
inexpensive to upgrade a module refiner
module reorient to update the flows of
production and parallel flows for
hyper-threading or even ship the entire
factory module by module to a new
location and enable an agile
manufacturing at scale so here's the
test-driven development part so we have
to crash test our cars right like
everybody does but when we crash test
our cars we also simultaneously simulate
the crash test and we compare the two
right afterwards then we refactor the
simulation to try to get closer and
closer to the physical crash test yeah
we were able to iterate until our
simulations match the physical impact
plus or minus 1% so millimeters of
difference in the deformation so instead
of sending the results of the physical
crash test we sent the United States
federal government the simulation they
said it was so accurate we no longer had
to physically crash tests so we have
automated testing and we started with
manual testing but we no manual testing
is slower right and and more error-prone
and less consistent well now we have
automated testing and it just runs on
our cat as part of the build server in
February 2016 I I got to teach the
world's first scrum and hardware
train-the-trainer class with scrum
incorporated we spoke about massively
parallel concurrent manufacturing or
structuring the factory floor like a
hype
threading CPU we evaluated and validated
the concepts hands-on during the class
by manufacturing products in that model
with five parallel walks work streams so
five scrumming build scrum build servers
working in side-by-side coordinated with
scrum of scrums in August I presented at
the world's first scrum in Hardware
conference on work density measuring the
velocity per cubic meter of a production
facility of factory to improve
efficiency and performance in
development manufacturing in all stages
of delivery in September
I watched the Tesla shareholders meeting
recording from all the way back in May
but I didn't watch it told September and
I was floored to see Elan talking about
work density also his concept was
multiply the volume of a factory by the
density how much of that factory is made
up of cars versus everything else by
velocity it was similar to the
measurements I'd been teaching my scrum
and hardware trainers and coaches but it
wasn't identical it was obvious the most
disruptive manufacturing companies of
our times was on the edge of scrum and
hardware so what did I have to learn and
where could I help
Ilan went on to say the fastest
automotive manufacturers produce a
vehicle every 15 seconds which is a line
speed of 5 centimeters a second which is
the speed of a tortoise he would he
would like to get the production line to
1 meter per second a slow walk which
would be an incredible 20 times increase
in speed so that June I was doing a
public build event sponsored by PTC one
of the world's largest CAD companies and
scrum Inc and we timed the scrum build
server I had no idea how fast it would
be it had an equivalent line speed of 60
meters a second 1,200 times faster than
Tesla's goal we said I think we've
learned something interesting we didn't
realize it was fast we knew it was cheap
right that we knew we didn't have to
invest in
large factory we didn't know it was
quick or at least that quick but now he
had a benchmark of comparison yeah 60
meters per second I knew I had a lot to
learn from Tesla but I also knew I had
some real value to share in return I
could learn an enormous amount about
production production automation
investment and investor management
supply chain negotiation and political
negotiation for factory site setup and
support likely that's just 2% of the
learning opportunity in exchange I could
help with development speed and
coordination increased velocity through
impediment removal self-organizing teams
to accommodate complexity but most
importantly I think modularity the Tesla
Model S works as an example it has four
primary modules the motor assembly the
battery pack the software and everything
else the everything else hasn't changed
significantly in seven years but the
battery pack changes every couple months
the drivetrain changes a couple times a
year the software changes 14 times a
month
those three modules iterate quickly the
everything else is on the same speed as
Mercedes so it's they're not disruptive
at all the everything else is too much
it wants if it were more modular it
could be faster is the theory the
plastic front fascia has been updated
and that's a matching pace of innovation
on this monolithic unmod lor chunk
similar to development pace of all major
automotive manufacturers but that's not
the big win the big win would be the
machine that builds the machine the
factory and even the machines that build
the factory the factory is the build
server it's limited by how fast we can
deploy updates and enhancements to its
flow and production capabilities this
means modularity and enables massively
parallel concurrent production unlike
sequential single threaded manufacturing
used in most facilities now or even
feeder lines which are essentially a
math math coprocessor for the single
threaded assembly lines you imagine it's
like a factory
is the analogy of a 286 computer
single-threaded no parallel processing
it doesn't even have a math coprocessor
to help do some computation alongside
we'd like to build servers the factories
to run like a modern CPU like intel
pentium i7 with at least quad core so at
least for threads of manufacturing
happening simultaneously that's not even
happening that's completely disruptive
apparently the current manufacturing
they're all single threaded dear Tesla
production wikispeed has conducted
simple tests to validate modular
manufacturing this has let us test many
ideas quickly and cheaply in the six
years we've been doing this we have
settled on a production flow process
modeled after a modern core i7 CPU with
multiple cores onboard cache and hyper
threading this would give the world
twice the Tesla's than half the time
actually 1200 times the Tesla's if our
recent build Athan experiments are even
close to reality but just building a
factory along these principles would
still be out of date in minutes right
what if we made a 1 billion dollar
investment making that Factory and
someone had a better idea tomorrow all
right so that's still not the win
modularity inside the factory floor is
manufacturing agility we do this through
grid or other geometric patterns each
grid Square is owned by a
self-organizing scrum team of 4 to 5
people trained in aggressive scrum not
the mamby-pamby non-accelerating scrum
we see all over Silicon Valley and much
of the world each grid square has an
input and output labeled clearly and the
acceptance tests for their input and
output are automated if possible the
teams change the flow and negotiate IO
changes during the scrum at scale
meetings every day for continuous
improvement it is it is currently the
very fastest production and production
improvement process we've seen anywhere
with the lowest defects rate and the
highest employee satisfaction that's a
link to a Harvard Business Review that
talks about that Harvard Business Review
article about the work I did at John
Deere about that
dear Tesla if global climate change is
reduced by the adoption of your solar
panels and vehicles and your products
are not demand constrained it would be
environmentally responsible to consider
scrum and hardware production due to
please allow me and the trainers and
coaches like Paul takun that I've gotten
to work with to help you can reach me at
my email address here's a photo of some
of the team wikispeed members right
after putting on a car display with
Boeing at World Earth Day so thank you
so much with that I'd like to invite an
intern who developed our automated
steering and automated acceleration and
some facial recognition and lane change
tracking pre-processing over last summer
as part of his internship so on one
summer we went from a normal car to a
car with autonomous steering and
autonomous accelerating and some digital
single processing with the world around
it and it was all led by Jackson Rudd
Jackson what do you mind talking a
little bit about how that worked and
you'll need to wear the little Mikey
thing it's gonna be good that's my
favorite picture all right well aren't
you tipsy okay cool
cool hi guys my name's Jackson I'm a
student of math and statistics at Stony
Brook and I've been working in agile
environments for the last couple years
during the summer but it wasn't really
until last summer that a lot of the
agile ideas really kind of sunk in with
me so today this little amount of time
that we have I'm going to talk about
three things I'm going to talk about me
sort of having a baptism into the world
of iteration and some of those agile
ideas I'm going to talk to you about one
of the algorithms I did there
the summer a neural network which is an
extremely cool algorithm which I'll talk
to you guys about and you guys will be
many experts on it by the end of this
and lastly I'm going to talk about how
statisticians working on things like
neural networks and agile is working on
things like agile and a lot of ways are
actually solving the exact same problems
and even using really similar methods so
just to kick off when I started my first
day at wikispeed I walk in and you guys
saw some of the pictures like you can
look around and you see these people
working on engines and carburetors and
all these weird confusing things I had
no idea about you know and I've been
spending the last year in college you
know just just doing stuff with paper
and pencils and I had it's like how am I
gonna help here you know so I want to
talk to Joe and say you know I can't do
this I have no ability to do this and
before I can get a word out Joe grabs me
and you guys met him you can imagine him
doing this said Jackson this is a giant
piece of sheet metal and we need to cut
a hole in it so I try to explain to him
no I can't do that like I don't see a
paper I don't see a pencil like I have
no ability to do this
could you tell me how to do it you know
I look it up at Joseph Jackson this and
he hands me this giant weapon it's
called this is awe it's as scary as it
sounds asses aw he says
Jackson with this weapon I just want you
to push the trigger and not kill
yourself
so I grabbed this weapon and I didn't
shake him five reading and it hits the
metal and sparks are going everywhere
and I can't hear anything you know and
Joe's laughing maniacally of course
and then suddenly the saw gets tight and
suddenly I'm moving instead of a saw and
I have to let go and I break the thing
and I'm doing early die against Joe's
advice and I am filled with shame I I've
exposed myself as the hardware fraud
that I am you know and I look up
anticipating Joe's disapproval for
breaking hisses aw you know and Joe's
just looking back at me like why aren't
you doing it again you know so I
gathered myself you know got rid of that
flight or flight instinct you know and I
tried again and again and every time we
tried something a little bit differently
and at the end of maybe 15 minutes
trying it maybe eight different ways we
were cutting through this piece of sheet
metal like it was butter and there's a
couple things that really struck me
about this and the first was that Joe
actually had no idea how to do this but
more importantly it's how weird my
instincts were I mean I just spent the
last four years in college and you know
my first thought was I don't know how to
do something I better hit the books you
know I better ask an expert and what Joe
taught me with that in 15 minutes was if
you roll up your sleeves if you iterate
towards a solution you know you can go
from not knowing anything about
something to feeling comfortable enough
that you could actually teach somebody
how to do it at the end of 15 minutes
this blew my mind completely blew my
mind and even cooler it reminded me of a
very awesome algorithm which I promised
I'd tell you guys about a neural network
okay so it's anyone here worked with
those before I believe it very cool okay
so for the rusty ax I'm gonna give you
some intuition about how it works
because it's a really really interesting
idea and it's very simple idea and I'm
gonna explain it with a very simple
analogy so I want you to picture that
you're on a beauty of beautiful like
countryside okay there's really high
mountains and low valleys and
and this beautiful tumultuous landscape
and you can't see any of it because
you're blindfolded for some reason and
someone tells you you have to get to the
bottom of the hill or to the lowest
point around you and so you can't see
anything so you have no idea how to do
this do any of you guys have any idea
about how you'd solve that yeah feeling
your way around that's exactly what you
do so here you're standing there you're
on you're on this mountainside you feel
around hey you know actually this place
is a lot lower than where I am just I'm
a little bit lower feel around again
this feels about right just jump down
here a little bit lower do this over and
over and over again do it thousands of
times and you'll probably hit the bottom
this is kind of what that picture is
there's someone doing this algorithm the
algorithm that the man in the gray just
invented is called gradient descent and
it's an incredibly powerful greedy
algorithm that is the idea behind neural
nets what you're supposed to think about
is that every point you're standing on a
solution and the height that you are is
your error and you're thinking where's a
lower error solution and you see oh if I
change my solution in this direction a
little bit I love a little bit of a
lower error and you do this over and
over again until you have an extremely
low error solution so something any
sense to guys yeah all right cool so in
the last part of this what we just
talked about iteration from a practical
perspective that was Joe you know
witnessing me in a very very scary
moment in my life and then we talked
about a neural network that form of
iteration and for the last part of my
talk I want to talk about how in
statistical statistical iteration like a
neural network we can actually use ideas
from that to help us iterate practically
and I think there's so many examples of
using statistics to help us in practical
situations but the example I want to
give
is to motivate the concept of a quick
win so here who's heard about like a
quick win before or heard that word
before and agile yeah so when I mean I
always thought what a dumb word right I
mean obviously you want to win why
wouldn't you want to win quickly if
you're gonna win anyways but after
studying these algorithms I actually see
it's a really subtle and a really
important point and I'm going to try to
explain that by talking again about our
gradient descent algorithm and more
specifically and importantly when it
fails so let's build up some an
intuition again all right we're on the
side of a hill in the beginning we're
able to make these big big changes in
the air because it's super steep but as
we approach the bottom it's going to
become a lot less steep and we're not
going to be able to traverse her error
function as quickly and when we're
really close to the bottom we're just
gonna be shuffling around this is when
we say you know what the solutions kind
of close enough let's call it good now a
neural network attempts to solve well so
what would be the what would be the
enemy of this type of algorithm what
would make it so that you would feel
like you're at the lowest point but you
actually weren't the answer is a ditch a
ditch is you'd feel around if you were
blind you'd say oh okay
hey this is this seems good this is low
and then you'd end up in this ditch you
take a step forward backwards right left
and think man these are all higher error
solutions
I need a shuffle around to to lower my
error and now you're stuck in this ditch
you can't iterate out of a ditch a
neural network solves this problem by
basically putting people all over the
hill and starting them in a new place
once they hit a ditch maybe six or seven
times so what does this have to do with
quick wins
you could definitely think of quick win
as the same as being able to quickly
traverse your error function so in the
beginning you take a step and you make
these big quick changes in the error
function you guys probably experienced
this when you're iterating on something
you know in the beginning you make these
big changes and then you might step
around and find yourself in the ditch
and be shuffling back and forth and that
is when you're--when velocity is
extremely low and the only way that you
can tell that you're in a ditch is when
you're no longer able to traverse the
error function quickly aka you only know
that you're in a ditch if your wind
velocity is really low so what you get
is sort of a mathematical model of why
it's imperative to track your winds you
track your wind so you can't end up in a
ditch and you don't end it up up in a
ditch because it's impossible to iterate
out of the ditch anyways I think that
there's a lot of really cool
similarities between these new ideas and
statistics of machine learning and some
of the new ideas and agile management
this is a really cool example but I
think there's there's a lot of them
there's theorems and statistics that say
that in the long run that for really
complicated datasets that iterative
things like a neural network will
perform the best in the same way I
imagine that as businesses become as the
business world becomes a lot more
complicated businesses are going to
become increasingly relying on iteration
to solve their problems and luckily
there's this whole science of iteration
that's totally untapped into in machine
learning ways that's my talk thanks a
lot
ma'am one minute till we call it 30
minutes yeah so Jackson was just saying
wouldn't it be cool if you could track
your winrate right how many people in
the room use an agile method I knew I
was with my people how many people use
scrum specifically I thought you were
nice people okay in scrum if we track
our velocity we know the success rate of
our current level of iterating right but
if we track our acceleration in our
velocity we have exactly what Jackson
was talking about anybody in here know
about state theory we went over it in
the class I was just teaching day is
anyone here from that class anyone here
stay the whole time okay so we've got a
couple people that know all about this
well the state theory by the way it's
what Jackson just talked about right
okay so on state theory it says a scrum
team if your goal is hyper productivity
twice the work in half the time but
that's the definition of hyper
productivity with the same or better
quality and people that aren't burning
out happy people that is the definition
sustainable pace that's in the agile
manifesto place to work a half the time
well you can get stuck in your current
state state your retrospectives there's
only five scrum meetings the
retrospective is the meeting where the
team says how are we going to get faster
and happier what change we're gonna make
to get happier faster and you can
improve in your current state a lot well
what if we configure the build server
better what if we start pairing what if
we swarm on the really tricky problems
what if we run better product backlog
refinement so the stories when they come
into sprint planning we've already
talked about them a few times and done
some research and we improve and improve
and improve in our current state well
there comes a point where the team's not
getting faster some of you may have been
there the team's really fast you're
probably already the fastest team in
your company but you say I'm sure that
we're not at the ceiling yet but we're
stuck why is that
that's when you need to run a
retrospective to find breakthrough
innovation you essentially reset
yourself at a different point on the
landscape and iterate again that's when
you blow up your scrum there's articles
written on it my scrum master talked
about it in Zurich two three two years
ago at the Gesu conference right across
the way I think was in the conference
hall across the way and that talk was
called popping the Happiness bubble
we're really happy we're pretty we're
pretty fast how come we're not getting
faster
and it's we have to reset even if that
feels really frustrating to the team now
a really skillful scrum master not only
knows how to do retrospectives that will
lead the team through incremental
innovation innovation iterating their
velocity and their happiness
but they know when the team is only
shuffling around and not getting much
faster how to do breakthrough
retrospectives that blow up their scrum
and we can get to faster and faster and
faster I know a few scrum masters like
that
one of them's named steve daucus he
works in the building with Amazon
robotics the automated fork trucks that
do the drones inside the factory at
Amazon it's about 30 minutes west of
Boston and I've worked with the guy and
he's got a team he coaches called the
Mach speed team all their data is public
I highly recommend looking up all of it
Steve daucus Mach speed team their team
is at sixteen point two times the
velocity they had in sprint one he's
been you he labels every sprint velocity
and what they tried in their
retrospective so you have a clear map of
what hit the breakthroughs the
incremental innovation and it's exactly
them it's this it's exactly this you see
incremental velocity increase and then I
explode incremental velocity increase
and explode here's the shortcut have any
of you ever even heard of scrum plop org
pattern languages of production that's
what Steve does when the team is no
longer dramatically accelerating he
pulls out another proven scrum pattern
for hyper productivity and says team
wood
be willing to support me in trying this
and their big deals they require rigor
their XP practices hard things to do and
he tries to get the team excited enough
to try one and when they do the velocity
blows up again and again and again folks
