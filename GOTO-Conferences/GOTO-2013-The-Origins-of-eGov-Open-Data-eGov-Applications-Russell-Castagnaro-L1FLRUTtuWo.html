came here from Hawaii so I think I just
found out that I came the farthest
because I don't think anyone could have
come further to here then then I did
have any of you heard about this thing
that's going on in the United States
right now evidently we decided not to
fund anything yeah is it is it yeah I
guess TSA is still working so still
hassle you when you come in and out of
the country but they decided to defund
things and this is actually something
that an e-government in the United
States we face all the time because at a
legislature level for some reason no one
is interested in paying for ego vermin
services because they immediately pay
off and make the citizens happy so for
some reason they don't really like to do
it so so I'm going to talk about a lot
of the I think different things from
everyone I've talked to there's a lot of
differences between eager meant as it is
in the United States and specifically in
state government and what you folks are
probably more used to as egovernment so
uh so how many of you had had I've had
experience working with your government
doing something that you needed to do
right the rest of you are sleeping and
that's okay so I also you know we have a
tradition of giving things away so you
can think of this as a bribe to give me
good grades or you can just you know
let's see there we go up you get that
later there we go so so I come bearing
gifts it's true so I'm so you know how
many of you that have had these
interactions have had positive
interactions where are you right get
away saying hey that was great right so
a few of you and and it's interesting
actually seventy-five percent of people
think that for a government interaction
to be positive it has to be online does
that make sense to you guys make sesame
I made that up that that's the only
thing I'm going to have made up today
but it seems like that's about it from
people that I talk to and I talked to a
lot of people about it in my job I like
to make those kind of like those kind of
you know life-sucking you know
government downing horrible experiences
go away and so that's what I get to do
in my day job which I'll tell you in
just a minute
but so you have you have girl any kids
anybody have kids here today like
Phineas and Ferb you ever heard of
Phineas okay so every day before Phineas
and Ferb start their next adventure they
have a moment where they say I know
we're gonna do you and I would put
egovernment so um so that's what we're
going what we do right egovernment and
so this this darling young girl is my
daughter saffron and this is when we had
our state ID adventure so in Hawaii you
can either get a driver's license or a
state ID for people who are non-citizens
or they don't want to drive or they
can't drive or whatever there's a about
three times as many people get state IDs
as get driver's licenses so the building
the decision is called the the
territorial building and there's an
interesting thing most these people
don't drive so they get their whole
families and they come down to the
territorial building pick you up filling
up the lobby and then by maybe ten
o'clock in the morning they've actually
gone out into the front of the area
where food trucks come to serve them
because the average weight is an hour
and 50 minutes to get your state ID
George no because he's actually done it
and and there are and it's you know it
becomes kind of a festival atmosphere
unless you actually need to get
something done we're going to work or
have your kids to go to school um
although a couple years ago they started
filming Hawaii five-o who are two
watches wife either okay that's revenue
going straight to the state of Hawaii I
will give you a reward for that and you
had one too yeah okay so um so uh the
the thing is is that this was an
excruciating process was horrible what
we did is we worked with the attorney
general's office who ran it in my
official capacity we made it so you
could fill out all the forms online pay
for it online and you're in and out of
there in less than 12 minutes if you get
my flickr page you actually see the
whole thing we took pictures and it was
wonderful but that's the kind of thing I
like to do you know I like to solve
problems at kind of a personal level and
that's what you gummy to me and I'm
hoping that that's sort of i like to
make that stuff good and I think that's
my idea of e-government is making
people confidence in their in their
government whether it's state federal
county whatever so Aloha Gann this is a
the view from my front door now this is
a this is a beach somewhere in on Oahu
but uh but we're going to talk about the
government applications today and what I
mean by e-government applications is if
you think about the whole open data and
government data space this is where the
data actually comes from and by enabling
egovernment applications you are really
bringing data to the whole the flow if
you will for all those DevOps but folks
who have been sitting through that
you're actually enabling more data to
come out to the public whether it's
activists or whether it's business or
anyone so as far as me I my name is
Russell casting narrow you see there I'm
black i I uh I like to do things like
triathlons and swimming which is why I
like to live in Hawaii quite frankly and
Dewey government stuff and um and like
take awards for let's see if we can ever
get that their win awards for the state
for our government then I just go around
and dipping people who happen to be
there giving the awards out but she was
very surprised but she she took it in
style this year she didn't let me do it
she said don't do that again um I work
for hawaii information consortium I run
it on the president and we're a wholly
owned subsidiary of a company called n
IC incorporated they they're on at
Nasdaq as ego and they we have 31 states
that work in a portal we have a portal
set up the self-funded government and so
when I talk about self-funded government
a little bit you'll know that there's
some sort of reference to it but I'll
explain it as we as we go along I
couldn't believe that Brian showed Duke
today that was great so I thought I was
the only one who actually still going to
show Duke but I so I started developing
Java in 1996 just to show that I
actually have some technical skills
somewhere in there I actually could
follow what he was saying today
surprisingly got really into j2ee when
that went along and eventually I I
started with this company in 2003 called
HIC took over running it in 2008 and
came developmentally useless because
they wouldn't let me code anymore but
the thing that keeps me there and keeps
me really excited buddy government is
that it's unlike anything else that you
can probably do except maybe social
media and that is create new things all
the time our products are like 30 to 90
man days of work and the products out
the door and we solve major major
problems for people because they're you
know they're having some problem they
need help from the government and they
are they they really need the help and
lots of people use my stuff lots of
people use the stuff that we work on
that does anybody like that doesn't it
like you people using your stuff doesn't
it give you like a thrill you don't even
need to pay me I just want I just want
people to use my stuff that's all um so
just a quick philosophy on e government
and then then this is my general
overview this gets the more more boring
part of it but the the big thing about I
like to do is increase efficiency and
solve problems for people i think i've
said that already all the other things
are great and those are your value
propositions that when you talk with a
government agency or everything but the
reason that that they work so well in
the long term is that it increases
efficiency and it solves problems for
people and whether the people are
legislators or division heads or the
line workers or the people it doesn't
matter it solves problem for them it
also solves problem for open data
because if we're collecting the
information we are enabling transparency
right we're enabling information to flow
in the form of data as opposed to what
you typically get as paper documents
especially when your state or federal
government is not paying any money to
automate those systems and they're
coming through is scanned not even they
don't even try to OCR the documents they
just take an instructor documents and
say oh yeah it's here come pay for it if
you want to take a look at it so this
would you say this is like an example of
a great of a great implementation of
technology or modern sort of thing who
said this is like a pretty new
implementation right here who would say
this is really really old okay who said
new good would anyone say knew nobody
all right I'll get I get this one
the key so we implemented a new system
for the Bureau of conveyances they
handle all title transfers whenever
something's bar sold or a lien goes in
and we put a whole electronic system in
but they still print everything and they
mail it out and they manually tag
everything in cata and categorize and
index it so if you look at this I took
this right before he left 523 13 if you
look at that in American date that means
May twenty-third 2013 that's when we
received these they received these and
they've still not been mailed out as of
last week okay so great that's an
automated system and that is not that
data all these documents are
unstructured documents that no one will
ever get the data out of because it's
still dealt with paper we still have a
lot of problems to solve they get about
three to five thousand documents every
day that go through and have to index so
in government space in my mind you've
got sort of this continuum of and are
there any ASAP folks here good I don't
really want to deal with that at this
point but uh you know you've got these
really expensive proprietary systems
maybe a hundred million two hundred
million dollars to implement a good
solution right and you got like drupal
which everyone he's all hot about and in
the federal government space the united
states because there's no money and and
i think that the answer is somewhere in
the middle you know smaller solutions
solve smaller problems and you know be a
little more agile about it maybe so
that's that's my philosophy and i also
believe that that this is not rocket
science there is no problem in guttin
egovernment in government that can't be
solved with existing technology if it's
applied a reasonably intelligent way so
we're not looking to change any
technology here we're just looking to
bring them up to speed and they really
need our help so um the basics of iffy
government is either the the thing that
you hear all the time and I don't know
if you hear as much here as you do as I
do in the United States with free or
data and the world will become this
beautiful ecosystem where everyone can
do in access everything
and I say okay that sounds really good
but you know there's some problems and I
also found this online and it's
basically Cecilia to open government
there's open data and there's government
data and open government data is in the
middle and it's a Venn diagram so it has
to be true but but there's there's a lot
more to this than than just you know
these things are talking about and you
can see my Venn diagram is horrible and
so you've got the whole body of all
government services that are provided
out there you got government information
which is overwhelmingly in the form of
paper documents unfortunately or just
things that are just not there all
analog and then you've got government
data so that's stuff that we can
actually access as data and then there's
open data where you have a small little
smidge of things and so when we talk
about government applications we're
enabling these government services here
and we're putting them into making that
government data box a lot bigger right
because all that all the information we
can take in in the beginning in the
front end is now available in the back
end problem with another problem with
open data is that there's a lot of
static to signal right if you really
want to see what's going on um it's not
so easy to see the face in the middle of
all the static and a great example of
this is very well-intentioned you've got
I'm day to you our data gov is put out
by the state by the federal government
in the United States and so we get data
sets like this okay does anyone think
this could this be any more frustrating
than they have oh here's a data set of
everything that happened with this
sensor from from you know July
thirty-first to August fourth and here's
that same sensor from you know from
April 23rd to April thirtieth it's
probably even the same data structure
right but they has no one actually sat
down with them and explained that maybe
a developer would have a really really
hard time using this or maybe just group
the data together or maybe publish it
all and just keep on updating the same
data set with new data you know there's
a whole lot of stuff out here like this
that makes everybody's life really
really difficult we use in the u.s.
overwhelmingly Sakurada is used and
there may
can better tool so you can merge these
things but it sure would be a lot better
if their systems just published more
efficiently and and transparency is
great and I love it um and and I love
being able to see what's happening and
everybody does because you know more
about what is happening in government
but if all their information is in paper
all right this is another one of our
partners the Department of Land and
Natural Resources if if all their data
is on paper how frustrated they going to
be when you have to say oh all your
information has to be open data they are
originating you tooth-and-nail because
they don't have a good way to do it they
can see they're backlogged and what are
we going to do to help them so if it
doesn't help them if you don't design a
way to help them with it they're gonna
block it from day one we've just passed
an open data law in in Hawaii so they're
all panicking and we're trying to say oh
no what can we can help you we can make
good things with it now and they don't
believe us believe it or not so now
quickly I want to tell you about
self-funded government because that's
what I do and that's the I think the
biggest difference and if I'm wrong
please somebody let me know if there's
any self-funded government stuff
happening in Europe and in other areas
um in Hawaii this is our this is our
trending page for our Hawaii gov portal
and you can see we have like in the last
seven days we had sixty three thousand
transactions 98 online services all the
other stuff but all these things are
funded by transaction fees most of the
services we provide are funded by a
transaction see that that enables some
sort of business function so it's less
about getting the information out and
more about getting the information in um
they're the business enabling kind of
things filing your initial business
filing documents submitting your reports
getting licensing renewing license
you're that kind of thing um we
typically don't charge anything for the
development of these applications that's
why it's a gamble for us it's a gamble
for them but we're absorbing most of
that risk and it's a partnership so we
don't do billing rates you know we meet
with them to work it all out and
and you can imagine if you do agile
development how that can be a little
crazy but but it works pretty well
surprisingly and and most of our
projects are in the 90 120 days of work
per project so we take relatively small
bites of functionality and try to
enhance them and and so we get a
transaction fee in return for developing
it for hosting it for doing any sort of
payment processing that's associated
with it from maintaining it and even for
things like marketing and so these could
be something as simple as as like making
a tax making a payment so part paying
your parking citation right so we have
this little portal administration fee
that they're going to add onto there so
it's a service that we wrote for the
state's they have that or confirming
that your contractor who's working on
your house is actually licensed and
hasn't been scamming people and been
reported or maybe filing your taxes I
know you guys don't actually have to
file your taxes in Europe isn't right
must be possum we have to file our taxes
and and then and then so this is a
system that lets people file their taxes
online so great right and the thing is
our taxes are generally lower so we sort
of perceive these additional fees as a
tax so um one of the big things we do is
business oriented things so starting a
business or getting married or recording
the sale of your home those kinds of
transactions are the ones and the
marketing that we do is very broad so
this is a this is a poster that we made
that goes up all over wherever licensees
are it talks about the professional and
vocational licensing services that we
have about I think it's about 48
different boards that do all the
renewals online and new applications
online we send that email reminder so
people go through and we do all this
kind of basic things that make sure
everybody switches online and in hole in
the United States we're the highest of
the states that have the participation
in other words we have a eighty-five
percent of all licensees renew online
this is even like contractors and
inherit and people who do hair so it's
pretty it's pretty cool that they
actually do it and they think
that easy we handle things like updates
rewriting from mobile upgrading that
means upgrading the operating systems
updating the databases all that kind of
stuff handling all the Oracle upgrades
so everybody's familiar with that stuff
now it all seems really easy and great
right but when you get in then these are
the things that bother our application
and your applications whether you're
talking about a big one or a small a
small application development that is
the barriers to think so you've got like
sometimes you got staff who becomes
drunk with power just like this little
all cat who's in this big in this small
room right what is it that actually you
know what was it that they'll actually
do so they want too much validation they
want to enforce some strange rules and
what's going to do it's going to drive
people to stick with the paper process
instead of going with an online process
because you've now made it three times
is hard to go and develop it online I
swear to god this is real okay I did not
make this up this isn't like that
seventy percent number this is a real
form okay not only is this real form in
Hawaii okay but every time any division
takes in any money at all okay and they
want to go and deposit it they have to
attach this form along with a deposit
slip now I don't know if use it this is
two rows okay and do you know what each
of those mean this is not human readable
right but humans it's so complicated
that they have to have dual data entry
to make sure that information is going
in the system correctly every time any
division takes in money in Hawaii they
have to go through this um and you know
and this is the this is the the paper
process design of the paper process
imagine what it's going to look like
when it's electronic well happily we are
working with them on redoing this and
making an electronic but this is a
quadruplet piece of report for it so
it's carbonless quadruplicate form that
goes through and goes to different
agencies it is a nightmare and if you
want to talk about an open open data
nightmare this would be definitely one
so the big temptation is to require so
much information
that that you're basically going to make
everybody go away and they decide that's
not really worth it still you can
overcome that right you can say okay
trust me let's just try it with less
functionality that's okay so you apply
some discretion and some different
things and and you get these things to
go but still you get a major problem and
that is something like what we see
behind my back in and this is a good
example this is the Georgia the state of
Georgia their website and so you look at
it and it seems like oh it's nice and
clean and everything but how do you get
anything done right well if you're lucky
you can see finding a job applying for
food stamps so maybe the big ones are
there if you don't know the agency which
won't show up we don't know the agency
associated with whatever your service is
or if your service is something like
starting a business we have to license
with four different agencies you are out
of luck and if you have if your citizen
comes in and wants to do something and
they have to go to four different
agencies to do it you've lost you've
lost them already even if you have the
greatest system in the world you um
you've already lost them as an advocate
and as a happy customer so lots of
different agencies you can give them a
question I don't know if this is really
polymorphism tell you the truth but but
you can you could ask the same agency
the same question and get different
answers it's like quantum government so
you know is the is this the answer is it
not the answer it is the most
frustrating thing for people when
they're dealing with government right
next to statics are queuing up this is
the most frustrating thing so um so you
can ask any different agency and this is
this goes in Hawaii how do i start my
business so you could go to them and
they you could say to agency one the
department of taxation say say how do
you help i start my business oh you fill
out the BB one form you're set great you
could go to the Department of Land of
labor and industrial relations and say
oh you want to start a business great if
you're going to have employees just fill
out the you see ten and you're all set
and you can go to another one the dcca
Department of Commerce and Consumer
Affairs oh just go fill out the DCCC one
form is
online should be no problem you can pay
online too or you can talk to another
agency and say oh just write us a letter
with your letterhead and you're all set
right and so if they asked if individual
asked any one of these agencies they
would get the right answer and it was
the exact wrong answer for them so how
do we solve that right very simple um
you should never assume that you know
anything about a bit that the user knows
anything about government or about the
hierarchies that are around government
right that is the number one mistake
does anyone know what agency you just
guess what agency you would go to record
information about your property changing
hands any guesses you'll get candy for
it if it just guess no Department of
Land Management you've already got a
candy man to go um but uh oh sorry but
no so is it it's pointless to ask
because you know you're going to be
wrong ninety-nine percent of the time so
you need to make sure that you give the
public a way to find the services that
they need that they want to use once
you've made them there's a lot of really
good services out there the people have
no idea how to find um and you have to
answer the questions that they meant to
ask because they don't know what they
don't know and so they just call and
they say hey I've got this problem why
aren't you solving it for me you're with
the government because the government
means everyone in the government
everyone in the government knows
everything about everyone else in the
government right so of course it makes
sense that they would be able to answer
that question wrong um you have to
recognize the context of the request so
somebody calls din to our customer
service or our chats on to our customer
service and says hey I've got a hundred
and twenty seven dollar charge on my
card i think there's fraud okay did you
do some did you pay something online did
you know you have to figure out where
they're coming from what their question
is and then you have to let them know
when they do come online you have to
keep them informed of the workflow in
the progress that they're making through
the workflow of the system so this
question is i wanna i want to start a
business so the real assumption here is
whoever you are
and whatever agency you're with you know
exactly what I need so as me as a person
is trying to start a business you know
all the answers for me and that's
exactly what you can't you you you have
to realize that they think that and so
you have to slow down and redirect their
behavior just like my 8 and my 9 my 8
and six year olds so the real question
is I want to start my business and fill
all the forms i need and pay for it and
whether that means you know registering
with the city or the federal government
or the state or the Knights of the
Templar it doesn't matter you need to be
able to tell me how to do that another
question I have this charge for some
amount on my bill um why is it there
right and so you have to have some way
to identify that if you don't have a
centralized way to manage payments and
to know where they're coming from you're
going to have a whole lot of problems in
government because people are going to
be disputing charges and you have to
avoid the black hole effective lots of
agencies once you send it in the only
way you find out whether there's any
progress is when you get your signed
documents in the mail right and that's
that's really no good at all that
doesn't work for anyone there used to be
it used to be before the we recently
brought all the marriage system online
for Hawaii but used to be that you got
married and then the part of the
officiant who actually married you would
take the form from you sign it and
everything stick in the mail sent to the
Department of Health and it would
magically show up at the the new married
couples home some points in the future
and that was how they got their wedding
their their their marriage license a lot
of trust in that surprisingly many of
them got in another some of other
strategies that we have actually used in
Hawaii is we have a single sign-on so
everybody can go into the same sign on
there's any spring fans in here we're
completely sprung we have a central
processing system so central payment
processing so all payments are processed
the same way we can track them if
someone calls and says I have this on my
bill we know we can find it relatively
quickly we have enterprise dashboard so
they can actually see their transactions
across all different agencies
this a of consistent messaging so that
they're always going to get the same
message every year when they have to
submit their annual report the same
messaging when they're going to have to
renew it stay at least the same channel
with a with there might be tweaks to it
but it's going to be very very similar
something they're familiar with we even
choose the same color postcards every
every year for different boards when we
send out reminders and regular mail just
so that they're always used to seeing
the same colors we have customer service
that's all integrated in one place
whether it comes through mail or phone
or in person whatever and responsive
design is a big as a must because more
and more people are going mobile our
single sign-on that we've got we like I
said we leverage spring and it's a
standard across the enterprise we
started doing this in 2005 and it's paid
off for san ornament normally in fact we
just deploy this something I'll actually
show you in just a minute payment
processing all the transactions that go
through whatever they are they're going
to go through the same method um this
way we have few people calling in saying
oh I don't know what to do I don't know
how to do this it's really easy to do
these things to this the hard part of
all the applications that you do is
actually the workflow these common
services that you make are the ones that
are actually relatively easy so you have
a common check out things like I don't
know if you have to deal with payment
card industry services or if you're
doing each X have to do all sorts of
different audits in the United States
you probably have to do similar things
here and then you have a simple
interface to the agency back office
right so if they have to do some sort of
reporting reconciling that's all a
standard done in a standard way they get
standard receipts and so it's no
surprise for payers you get very few
charge backs and things like that and so
this we just launched this a couple of
weeks ago this is the first version of
our of our customer dashboard where you
actually can see how many transactions
you had in the last four days if you
click on it shows you all your
transactions that you've ever done you
can see all the different business
filings you can see I've done a lot this
is on the test system I haven't really
done this many business filings and then
and then camping reservations those are
our three most popular things and we're
adding more
or we're adding you notification that
comes from a single source as well and
then social media hooks and you can see
the transactions that they've got on
there it shows the before from the most
recent one and then they go back in
history for the different things that I
happen to do it's nice people like to
see that kind of things in reality is
not a lot of your users will ever use
this this service but the ones that do
are there going to be the power users
they're going to tell everyone else that
they should be using the system's
messaging you know we want to use email
and SMS messaging for for communications
because that's the way people do things
now even emails going out it gets just
lost in the sea but if you can go get
them an SMS message you're set they can
go and do whatever they need to do
online of course you need to make sure
you have the good opt-out language and
when there's a call to action you have
to make it really clear that there's
that call to action we leverage
different things like online chat and
and handling like the thing about chat
and think about email is you can handle
lots and lots of questions we we have
people answering phones just eight hours
a day but we actually have an answering
service that we pay extra for just to
take messages from people because if we
let them leave messages and we would
have to call them back and do all sorts
of other support by calling the back
getting more information instead we can
make sure we have all the information we
need solve the problem call the person
back and say hey this is what you need
to do right and it works very very well
we went to responsive design everybody
there's a responsible sign this here
right you'd be surprised how few people
knew what responsive design was and they
didn't have any idea why we were doing
it so we we made this little short video
here that actually people like
go round on Hawaii gov was built for
mobile with a touch first responsive
design putting content front and center
horizontal scrolling finger friendly tap
areas and swiping capability creates an
intuitive interface for all users
using modern coding to serve up designs
based on browser window size along with
flexible grid layout and fluid media
Hawaii gov is fully responsive
you can see the numbers changing showing
how frequently the services are being
used the online services page is
filtered alphabetically by agency or by
category our favorite of course is the
trending section because it displays
data on the number of transactions made
for each service for the past week and
you can easily access the application
from here online services are also
organized on individual pages service
tiles have a uniform look so at a glance
you'll know this is an online service
the new footer also known as the drawer
can be expanded to quickly access
information from alerts to elected
officials the new elected officials page
is the perfect way to get better
acquainted with your government simply
click on a tile to learn more
on the weather page the color coincides
with the temperature of each island the
redder the color the hotter it is the
moon phase section is based on current
data and includes Hawaiian moon phase
names the mobile page is a useful
addition to Hawaii gov all of the mobile
applications for the state of Hawaii are
listed here the portal has selectable
feeds you can find the theme changer
under the settings the search is
accessible from any of the main pages
for convenience any recommended online
services will display first followed by
the content results
shoky I'll stop it now so one thing I
wanted to show you guys on this that
this is all written from open data so
what we decided when we when we rewrote
your applique are our portal this year
was we wanted to make it completely
static but make it dynamic too and have
it based on all open data so if I can
actually get this to work i will show
you not that so this is our developer
page from the site and basically what
we've done is we've made all the sources
from all the different services from all
the pages everything we have is
essentially available as json data or
published up in Hawaii gov on our
socrata platform so we are using we're
rebuilding this every 15 minutes
whenever the data is updated so we have
static content that's going out the
anyone who wanted to access the open
data that's built they could build their
own portal right they can build their
own site but we wanted to to show that
look you can use this data you could use
these feeds to to actually build all
this technology and it's based on some
of the same technology that the the
Obama campaign was originally written
written on like Jekyll of course we
threw some other goodies in there and
you can see maybe some of you are
familiar with open data api's some of
the weather stuff and things that we
actually pulled that straight out of
open source repositories okay and back
we go okay so the things that have
worked for us really well of course
payment processing has worked very well
because that's straightforward simple
form intake services enabling certain
industries like for us the insurance
industry they need to get they need to
get certain things and you need to get
them quickly the health care industry
the same thing licensing permitting and
services that have some sort of
legislative mandate and a lot of
pressure that can be applied um these
kinds of applications I think are not
necessarily those typical ones that are
done other places they're small but when
we have things like I'm going to
actually run this with no volume and
talk while this is going this was our
annual business filing application and
oh there we go and just while it's going
so I can distract you the way that this
this whole system started this is the
mobile version of reporting your
business filing annually so whenever
everybody has to file their report
annually when they have a business is we
started and every day we would have to
go get a tape backup from the Department
of Commerce and Consumer Affairs we get
that we loaded onto our server and we
had a business name search website and
we started allowing people to submit
their annuals online so people liked it
so much that what they decided to do is
oh let's take this since we got so much
goodwill let's spend some money on our
back office systems and bring them up to
speed so over the course of about eight
years we went from having this system
where we basically had these tapes that
we had to go install finally we got what
got got to get rid of the tapes because
we had a network connection so we could
ftp the files back and forth then we
started sending them xml files with just
some data and PDF versions that they
would then print out and then later they
started getting them scanned in until
we're now we have we have replicated
data every 18 minutes were up to date so
we're actually sending data through and
the second you submitted annual filing
you can actually go and see what the
status is on the dcca sites that we have
so it's a great story where you can
actually make the public happy give the
the division or department that you're
working with a little breather and then
they can actually go and solve solve
bigger problems then you can go and
enhance services with some of the things
that are a lot harder to implement our
business process reengineering type
stuff public benefit applications one of
the the ones that was we you know I
mentioned the the treasury deposit
report thing that was supposed to be a
three-month project to get one of those
it was electronic online it's going it's
still going on two years later and we
have not deployed it yet which is
unfortunate but we have other things
that um that like public benefits like
there were when you have a warrant
that's issued like a bench warrant
issued by
we had a backlog in the state of 90,000
bench warrants that had not been served
which of course makes people kind of
like oh I've got a warrant so what right
so over the course of about three years
which is a lot longer than most of our
projects we were able to develop a
system that would enable the police to
get immediate delivery of all the
warrants that were issued by the
judiciary and the state didn't have to
pay for it they actually funded it by
adding a dollar on to a convenience fee
that we had for us or for another
service for them so that kind of foot
stuff is harder but it's still
implementable back office replacement is
really hard because you're normally
dealing with a staff that may or may not
be all in with your with your service
and then disruptive services that make
that maybe are redefining the way a
whole division does its work or
applications that are a response to like
public outrage hardly ever work for some
reason even harder are things there are
complete soup to nuts replacements of
existing systems and enterprise-wide
back office solutions because you've got
these massive operational aspects that
you have to support and given our model
are our business model it's a lot harder
to report to support that every day
making sure their software is working
and installed the right version in their
office but we do have some so some of my
favorites we just deployed a new
procurement system in in Hawaii so we
had one that that looked a lot like it
was developed by someone in 2007 that
was in 11th grade as a project and so it
was absolutely horrible and so I think
now we have probably the best one in the
of all the states in the United States
let's see I can run this one too since
it's short but you can just sort of see
how that how that works and the idea
behind it is that of course we're
leveraging open data in that ivory
procurement that goes up is now
available in a data set that can be
accessed by anyone if they want to have
other applications you know it's in
everybody's best interest to have as
many eyeballs on procurements as
possible but I'll skip over this because
you guys are not so interested in
mo I'm sure this was at a bench warrant
application I was telling you about the
cool thing about this is before when
they wanted to do a when they when the
police wanted to do a sweep so they're
going to a particular area and they just
want to get all the warrants and get
them out of the way and served it would
take to people about three hours to pull
all the warrants and organize them
because it was all on paper and folders
and everything and so now they just put
the address in and they pull it up and
they can download it to excel or print
out the map and have them go walk around
so it takes about like 12 seconds and
they they absolutely love that another
one that I really like is renewable
energy is really big in Hawaii for
obvious reasons so we have a renewable
energy registry to where the big
commercial projects can all go up
everybody can see it and that gets
published to open data as well in fact
we have an administration tool that lets
them publish it to open data and then we
pull it from the open data socata
instance so um so so basically what I
want to want to say with this is that um
that I don't know if the model will work
in you know in Europe or anywhere else
where you can have a self-funded sort of
thing but I imagine that going out a
smaller going at a smaller project a
smaller bucket might actually be a lot
less risky because you have a hundred
million dollar project that maybe has a
50-percent fail rate if you got instead
spread that money over maybe a bunch of
smaller projects that have a much higher
percentage you're going to get a lot
more win for it the you know the data
that you're going to enable from any of
these applications that come in is going
to be you know by far really really good
are really much better than what you've
got now and much better than if you have
a captive agency that's just trying to
just get you something and they don't
really care about it and it's
self-funded government works well in the
United States I'd love to see it work
well here because I'd love to come help
but um but if not you know not
everything is good for all for all
things so um thank you very much that's
what I've got and I hope that maybe this
will give you a way to figure out how to
solve more problems here and in the
countries that you're coming from so
thanks
any questions on the website but if
anybody has any questions for Russell
we've got a few more minutes before the
break this is a responsibility or
so that's a great question so the data
security aspects of these applications
and that is a part of our contract so
what we have a we have it's called a
portal manager contract and so we're in
charge of of caretaking for all the data
the data is the states and all the
agencies that we work with me work with
the counties to but um but we have you
know pci audits for payment card
industry we have we have I think we have
four different audits two of them from
internal sources and two of them from
external that you know it's probably the
biggest most important part of our of
our business and it's a huge expense as
well but that is our responsibility in
some states it's different some states
they require that it's hosted in their
own IT infrastructure to which you know
a portal doesn't have much control over
that but for us and for many other
states it's done through the third-party
process which is us that's a great
question so the question is do we use
any cloud services and we we have been
starting to move to the cloud and what
we what we do is you know the
transactional services that we provide
are the ones that are really the ones
that have to be up all the time and so
what we do is we've actually offloaded
our websites and everything to the cloud
so if you look at the the different
Department sites that we host in the
portal and different things like that
those we've moved up like our WordPress
sites and our Jekyll sites and stuff
those we've moved up to the cloud we
haven't moved the applications
themselves up to the cloud because
mostly security issues but we're you
know we're always looking at that was
our question up here yes sir that is a
great question so um how the question
was how how's the government make sure
that the services that we write keep on
running if something happened to us so
um so first of all the way our contracts
are written we own the code but the the
state government or the counties have
they they have the
they have the license a perpetual
license of use so if something happened
to us they actually have the code in
escrow and they are able to get it nuts
they actually have thumb drives but um
but they have access to all the all the
source code and so they could and in the
event that our contract was up they
would get all that source code they
wouldn't necessarily get the operational
know how but they would get all the
source code so they could keep things
going so that gives them a you know a
lot of break it also they own all the
data any applications that we have we
may have they have to have the have a
canonical database you know where
everything really is so it's different
in each state's the the length of the
contract but but for ours we have three
year perpetual renewals in Hawaii some
states they may have a three-year
contract but the new our new like RFP is
released it just depends on the state
most of them have like a transition
period of one or two years in the event
that another vendor was chosen to halt
to hand over things to the other one yes
sir
oh sure so we've we've had lotta we have
lots of projects and and it's really
important that we have those projects
because if we if we we knew one hundred
percent everything was going to work
then kind of the the benefit of working
with us wouldn't make a lot of sense
right so we've had projects forth like
the what is shifty the they're the
historical preservations division we've
tried to work with them and and just
from the number of things just didn't
work out we we probably have from the
point where we have questions hey are
you interested in providing this service
I'd say you know there's like a two or
three month like discovery period where
we think it might might work out it
might might work and at least fifty
percent of those opportunities after
they get past that don't go don't go
much further because either the agency
isn't prepared to do what they need to
do to make it a success or we aren't or
they're just a number of issues maybe
you have a division head that changes
and isn't interested in that particular
service anymore and one of the things we
do is we give our partners an easy out
so that unless there's a really really
expensive development there they can
basically give us you know three months
notice and then we'll turn off the
service and they can do whatever they
want so we try to protect them from the
risk and we sort of absorb it um there's
also the situation which you probably
figured out is that a lot of the
applications we got 9098 applications
out there right now not a lot of them
make money that making you know not a
lot of them would be a project that you
would engage on without you know we know
without anything else so they're they're
essentially losers as far as money so we
try to make sure that they'll but the
fees we have will cover their their
marginal costs but they're fixed costs
are absorbed by some of the other
applications that we have that we
develop that we've already developed
that are bringing in revenue so the
portal is actually developing
applications that would never get
developed otherwise so make sense
