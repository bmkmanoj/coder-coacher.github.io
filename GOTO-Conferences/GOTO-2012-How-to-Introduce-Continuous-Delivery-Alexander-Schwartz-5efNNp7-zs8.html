so on our t-shirts continuous delivery
is one of the topics which is mentioned
as what
around to go to conferences I'm going to
mention a few others as well as Kanban
and lean and stuff like this this talk
is not going to focus mainly on
technical things because I would like to
tell you a bit about how did you
introduce actually continues into
continuous delivery so I would like to
get you know the audience a little bit
better so I would like to find out who's
which kind of role mainly so who is
mainly a developer okay say eighty
percent who is mainly doing QA e the
only one who's made mainly doing
operations one and a half actually it's
perfect that what I'm saying yeah a
little bit that's perfect that's what
I'm aiming for who's doing something
else management oh cool did I forgot
some other role okay good that's it so
which delivery style do you have in your
organization so it's your experience how
you deliver actually more close to this
kind of very big ship so you load all
the stuff packet into containers it's
traveling for months and with some good
luck it's arriving yeah some good luck
is really it really meant literally you
know all the containers which are placed
the buff on the outside there is a cheap
ones right in case there is a storm so
you loosen really say a lot of lost
containers in the ocean so with a lot of
good luck as really meant literally it
means in case you do these kind of big
deliveries one experience you're going
to have is some of the tiny features may
not arrive right and it's actually not
the biggest risk the risk with having
delivering a lot of stuff of course it
takes ages it will take you months till
something is delivered and speaking of
the release process for a company of god
this one is taking a lot of time and
effort as well and quite often it's also
some really it's quite often very very
big nightmare so will these experience I
would like to have is more salads my
picture for is this kind of here is that
its former kaiten sushi so it's a sushi
bar where they have here or the surgery
which was just coming to you which is
called kaiten sushi and japanese and
that means all the stuff you would like
to eat is just delivered on the fly and
you can just pick what you would like to
have perfect c bucket size is also
pretty nice right you can try i tried
two Ozols yeah maybe looks fine in case
you ordered took something which is not
very tasty it's not a big deal right so
it's a very nice style how to deliver
sings it's pretty much on-demand
delivery speaking of more technical
release management roller procedure I
say yeah this kind of style is more in
case you could really deploy something
to production or maybe even from your
very first commit to production in less
than one hour so it would be very
perfect time for this one and of course
the trip we all happen automatically
likes like this sushi start no one has
to do something by hedge edit on one
side and it's taken away by the clients
on the other side okay so asking the
audience again what is your X tile of
delivery you currently experience and
sing booster the ring let's say the main
product less than one per months
lesson time it means not every you don't
don't in an average month you don't
deliver one update so we have so we have
three who is delivering one per month on
average interesting with delivering
several times a week okay
who is usually delivering every get
several times per day ok cool we have to
that's interesting the X actually that's
hear something decision okay good so I
would like to focus this talk on how to
achieve it XO to speed up delivery and
what helps but why should we do it a lot
of reasons which makes sense for me this
picture is the most important one from
me this is the one which is explaining
it let's take a look at the blue curve
here let's say you develop stuff very
traditionally it takes three months to
deliver a certain set of features and to
bring it to production to the customer
given your inner startup yeah it takes
three months you deliver all your
features you have your brilliant pedro's
head which is going to convince all of
your customers and you release it and
then you'll start earning some money
perfect right no ouch you're running out
of money before so in the case we write
it like that in case we have time here
and we have money over time on the other
axis which what is the money you
actually earn that is this surface it's
the surface under your curve okay so
that means we still the green curve is
something you do try to deliver some
value more early it means you start
morally to have some money which is nice
right and in the end for a start-up
could make pretty big difference and
also we should be aware that there
actually there are a lot of startups
around which are really able to do it
like SoundCloud but of course a lot of
others as well and for them it makes a
real real big difference so we could
learn a lot from this lean startups yeah
but of course not every company is as
good and is learning from from this kind
of stand so how we come from this
picture of delivery picture delivery to
be socially delivery start my heart
answer is I have no clue
but having said that I have no clue how
to do it in your ecosystem because your
ecosystem is unique you might have
different faucet it may look completely
different the only thing I could share
is basically I could offer what my
learnings are and what my insides and
experiences are so I started as a
developer later went into more roles
like a little bit management also a
little bit QA stuff and at some point of
time we really realized how we had a
problem to build and ship our
application it doesn't make any sense
right so we try how to develop something
and then no customer can see it that's
what was frustrating so I try to solve
this problem which is sometimes called
the last mile of software development so
I try to focus myself on folk and fixing
this one so it roughly means I spent my
last five years on doing something like
this introducing continuous delivery
improving the delivery quality in some
companies the first one where I did it
was in Annie Mae company that's called
mobility it actually was a very
misleading name it's the biggest
platform to sell vehicles and Germany
and it's a big evac company when I
arrived in this company it was released
looked like that the release branch was
created at the point of time of the
countries of course there was some kind
of hezron you know about the stuff i
mean already we have to commit something
your other ones the release manager of
pushing now actually I was a poor
release manager and one developer told
me I you as a newly risk management nice
to see you poor guy it sounds like hope
you survived your first month's and
actually was hard it was really hot what
I found out actually was all the stuff
which was developed was basically crap
so after creating the release branch
what happens aqate guy had to build the
product Oh interesting so it create did
some building also software of course he
had no clue what building the software
so we locked on to one machine and
launched the build script which was good
right there's a build script so it's
some kind of automated one was bad
actually is that the code was a some
quality level which was not compiling
very nice so it took a while till the
code was compiling at least the first
few modules of course we had to skip the
unit is right because they're broken
anyway okay so it took several years to
improve the quality of this delivery in
the beginning we had tried to do run
release every three month per sorry
every three weeks and it of course took
a while to deliver it it's roughly took
10 days to stabilize it and to really
ship it 10 days and it was of course
quite a lot of stress at nightmare and
of course we had a lot of production box
very nice bad outer quality very bad
experience how to deliver in the end we
achieved that we improved the cycle time
by a factor of 10 or maybe more and the
number of leases really by a factor of
30 not kidding so instead of we had 30
we had one release every three month
three weeks in the beginning in the end
we had for contributions which are
shipped to production on an average day
did not for five days a week because I
don't four days a week so just somehow
it's and maybe sums up but in the end so
in the end the company was able to
really ship a tiny contribution several
times per day which was really very very
it was really hard work to get to this
point for the rest of the talk and
mainly going to focus on this experience
that is at nokia so i'm actually Alex
you're hired before nokia places to help
to introduce continuous delivery and
when you let them try to do it so what
we deliver there is rest oriented
architecture which is serving the places
like he
nokia house shown on some maps
application for instance on devices or
in the map stone okay calm application
or a lot of others as well so there's
big rest oriented architecture and just
to fear you a little bit that's how an
early picture look like and this kind of
this rectangle here is actually the
scope where which i take care of so
actually we have a very big system with
a lot of customers which are showing
here above and which with a lot of resin
systems what we achieved for places is
actually that we get when i write we had
a psycho time which was far beyond 35
days and so roughly speaking maybe four
to six releases have been delivered per
year maybe a few more if you work let's
say 12 ah but some people are staring
with different stories so so actually
big releases yeah maybe once per months
maybe in best case every three weeks the
current current setup is the way that
actually what we see in the background
is our done column all the stuff we
deliver and actually there's an old
picture currently with a little bit for
instance eighty changes to production
since january so we speed it up the
delivery pretty much that means in total
the the cycle time was reduced pretty
much so for all the old applications
improvement factor of three for new
applications that we launched actually
the cycle time is 30 times better than
the one we had before for legacy
applications which is one very good
learning in case it would like to
improve something try to pick something
which is easy so in case you just have a
new application use this as a guinea pig
to improve your delivery because in the
beginning you cannot cause harm right
because it's not a product which is used
by the customer perfect so try to
improve your delivery in total we list
the number we increase the number of
releases roughly by a factor of 20 and z
rate actually by a factor of some
setbacks tab it means we almost never
have to do rollbacks or correcting stuff
which is ending up in production which
is very important as well as unplanned
work was reduced very very much up to
very low degree whereas before unplanned
work was maybe took eighty percent of
them of the full capacity good so what
helped us to really do it and they're a
lot of stories to tell really a lot of
stories I try to select a few other one
is actually try to set up the team's
appropriately so try to focus the people
on the job which is to be done in the
beginning we had something like we had
development we had QA list management
and operations so a pretty common set up
right most companies have something like
that and there is something which is
called Conway's law and as I understand
it means something like that in case you
build your organizational structure then
you will have a very very similar
communication structure as well it means
a new group you usually have a better
communication from one group to another
it's decreasing very much it also will
mean that maybe a team like that is
going to produce its own staff which is
more isolated so usually it will mean a
qat rule for instance creator QA tools
right it's very funny to have QA tools I
thought we have a product and we all
have a product right but in the end you
see you hear people saying are some
factors yeah we have here our test suite
and the QA guy will mean with our d QA
guys test suite like the application
developer has its own production code
right it's a company who s code and so
it also will mean in case you have a lot
of different groups working together for
one process and comes with into
face it will take a lot it will really
take about to deliver your stuff so
therefore we try to replace the team
like that with one actually or a lot of
teams like that which actually more one
team so actually we try to combine QA
and release management and operation in
all the build management aspects in one
team so this is some kind of deb deb's
approach that we tried of course there
are different lot of different
interpretations of the flops which you
might have but here for this case it
really helped to build one team which is
focused on really delivering this stuff
because then you could overcome all the
problems that the QA guys are focused on
just improving the test suite for
instance in the meantime they're
blocking the current roll out as a test
sweetest problem and cannot be used to
test rollout it's weird or the
operations guys are too busy to
stabilize the platform and actually that
means they don't are not interested in
rolling out stuff in the traditional
model operations guys have to be afraid
of all the stuff which developers are
producing because usually super asians
guys are paid for having a very stable
platform with no downtimes right the
developers when the case they are more
paid for features that means there's
some kind of conflict so we try to
combine it a bit but yeah the team seems
to consist mainly of 2a
merchants when did this seems to be one
engineer only yeah it was a very very
big problem in the beginning so when we
started 11 situation one year ago 15
months ago 18 months ago was very much
that we had also very flaky broken
production system was very hard to start
a lot stabilize it and most of the tasks
had to be done by operations engineers
only and the developers or all the other
guys are not allowed to touch this and
so but actually we had in the company
very very big capacity problem so we
hadn't had any not more engineers we we
had to fight pretty pretty hard actually
to integrate Eric into our team in the
beginning it was even worse we had two
days of Eric working for the team but
guess what happened in case someone is
working two days for the team then he is
doing it sometimes and then he is
disturbed by a lot of other stuff which
maybe wasn't finished on time so it's
really really hard to have people which
are not really integrated in 30 so for
us it was very very important to
integrate the only let's say the only
hardcore operations guy fully in the
team as full the dedicated team and team
member also of course meaning full
colocation 24 hours and 40 hours per
week is allowed to go home and sleep and
have some drinks of course sometimes
regarding the others actually all the QA
roles are fading away I'm going to talk
about this a little bit later but
actually all of them are no longer just
QA guess they don't ever say because
actually we are shifting a lot of the
activities to all the other guys as well
okay in order to focus our process we
use Kanban and lean so a lot of the
ideas behind continuous delivery is
comes actually from phone from the lean
approach and was developed actually buy
toyota for producing cars Michaels
and they found out that actually most of
the companies are too slow with
delivering castles of customer so they
really analyzed y0 and so slow and just
set up some kind of improvement
framework forum improvement process how
to speed it up and Kanban is pretty much
focused as or lean as I understand it
it's pretty much focused on reducing the
cycle time and the lead times only time
starts when the customer asks for
account and it ends in case the car is
delivered to the customer so it would be
weird in case the company is asked when
the car is going to be delivered to
answer yeah it's already done but we
have to test it the customer will be
very frustrated because it didn't ask
for stuff like this right is it showing
your corporate underwear customer wound
is when will not accept to see stuff
like that he wants to have a car full
working operating car and they're really
did very very great work identifying
actually where they had a lot of waiting
time in the process so the trust tried
pretty hard to reduce waiting time and
queues and also they reduce very much
when they have started to settings a lot
of things so in the end it's pretty much
some kind of on-demand delivery and
especially around the parts for the
vehicle is any meaning behind two
different colors yeah yep so we do some
color coding here the Reds stuff is a
back orange stuff is released we have to
do yellow stuff is usually task so we
have some color coding and furthermore
is maybe a little bit small I know I
have increased a little bit so we also
use some other tasks to place it on a
ticket to say it's me who's working on
this one because actually what you see
we have quite a lot of stuff to do and
of course we have also some kind of
different topics as we had to deliver
for a lot of different teams every one
of those teams got its own lane
also for different aspects to really see
what is going on so for us it helps are
pretty much to make all the stuff
visible on the board with Kanban then
the next step after making it visible is
that you try to limit how much stuff you
do because there's one learning that is
in case you try to do a lot of stuff in
parallel it will all take longer so what
you do is you limit your work in
progress and then you're going to be
faster so actually my team had a lot of
problems with doing so as we had a lot
of tiny things to do at the same time
actually we never introduced a very very
hard work and progress in it but
nevertheless using the avatars in the
number really helped in the end together
with stand-ups where actually the people
ask why you have file if open tasks this
is not probably a little bit too much so
we had some kind of soft adjustment
regarding so work in progress with it we
talked about waste regarding lean right
so for a cam manufacturer actually when
they produce value at the moment where
the car is arriving at the customer no
single minute before it also means that
all the parts which had been produced
and stacked somewhere what they are for
the company as a something guilt no
actually this sums their waste they
should really try to have very very
small stacks of things to do so a lot of
stuff is waste coming back to our Kanban
board basically all the stuff which I'm
showing you here is waste it's cause
these are not the main things we deliver
so we made something which is maybe not
very common is but we set up one very
important Kanban boards that's our main
Kanban board which is focusing on our
main value stream and for a delivery
team the main value stream is something
like yeah what you deliver to production
right so we really focus on that one
that means all justice changes which are
arriving
are going to be on this wall and it's
just the only thing we are going to
report because all the other stuff
around is basically it's just waste
because they are supporting activities
for instance we shouldn't count and say
yeah we did some 10 very great tasks to
repair our agenda kids infrastructure
because this one is not really providing
value for the customers where you will
provide is that we are able to deliver
it to production this of course includes
that we fix build infrastructure the
metric we use to improve it is see what
we call the release cycle time in our
case it means the development team told
us are we are ready here is your rpm and
can you please test it and deploy it and
so we start counting when we have the
announcement and we stopped counting
when it's actually delivered to
production and we try pretty much to
reduce this what we call release cycle
time of course very important is the
aspect of automation and there's a lot
of sayings like yeah in case you have a
process which is not very nice yeah
actually automating it could cause more
harm than than good and so automating
the wrong thing could be dangerous it's
quite often said from my point of use
it's the biggest I ever heard
so using this one as an excuse not to
automate will kill you as a delivery
team you have to be good and what you're
doing being good and what you're doing
is in case you do with several times and
it's related delivery it's like rolled
huh we have to automate it right and
there you have to automate everything in
case you do something twice start
automating it
we spent quite a lot of time actually
automating a lot so it was the stuff we
had been focused basically yeah last
fall and all the stuff so we decided to
take a system which is able to present
what we're doing that is in this case we
exchange Jenkins which something which
is really able to model the flow we have
the flow from first commit over some
compile and build steps deployment steps
test steps more test steps water steps
more deployments and all kind of stuff
we modeled it into one tool which is
some kind of appropriate for that sits
the Salt Works go and this one is focus
of actually modeling pipelines and so
actually it was very very easy for us to
provide zero automation because we
hadn't we didn't had to deal with the
tool around right because it was very
easy to do it was too instead we just
focus on modeling what we would like to
do and then which focused on
implementing it and we really
implemented as just step by step and for
us also the value is that we really make
it very very visible what is happening
in every face it might not be as
important in case your or takes three
months to do so but in case you would
like to do one every day it is very
important that you know for instance
what has to have to be deployed where
and what happened so this one helped us
a lot we made it very visible and we try
to automate everything on the other hand
it's a hard barrier to automate
everything right and actually you have
to get started and usually when you
start you have to do stuff manually so
we tried not to block for instance to
implement stuff like this just due to
the fact that there are some manual
steps no in the beginning we had tons of
manual steps because we started with
special steps so we models and male use
with all the manual steps in the tool as
well so they're not
out to block us and then we had one
pattern that is actually before we
implement automation we first implements
a verification for instance there should
be an RPM deployed with a specific
version number before you automate that
actually we do the exact stuff is
deployed you implement first that you
have the verification for this version
number and this could help a lot and
usually this is much easier then right
rather than just trying to deploy
something maybe it's failing and maybe
you never ever realize that you deployed
the wrong thing so we really try to use
a pattern verify first and then
implement it it also means that we had
of our general approach its take close
to be test rhythm yeah not really
because it's actually quite hard to
automate everything what we do around
deployments and server setup of course
you could do it maybe also with losing a
lot of cloud services it is actually a
very very good chance to do so but at
this point of time we didn't have the
situations that we could do all the
stuff in the cloud so for instance what
was pretty difficult to set up you
clusters and stuff like that so we
couldn't start with automating
everything but we did something yet we
did something else rather than
test-driven development or acceptance
test driven development we get something
like acceptance criteria driven
development that meant we discussed
first out in case we're done what we
should observe and then we really try to
have this feedback from the tool to
verify what we did for instances we
meant for implementing the world
automation what was the best test to do
one successful rollout using the new
version and we also yet
good speaking of the DevOps so the dev
ops is of course some kind of password
which is used quite a lot I also would
like to add def QA or something like
that and Liddy were actually I don't get
wise where there is no appropriate word
for doing something like that and for us
it means that we try to get rid of all
these very very rigid assignments from
people to specific tasks and very
specific loads for instance that the
developer here in the loops that the
developer here is just focusing on all
the development work and it means he's
not allowed to do any deployment on any
kind of server which is weird right and
and the QA guys is just doing automation
and maybe with black box tests all kind
of stuff he is not taking care of what
how the features actually develop maybe
it's not even asked or included in the
discussion before the feature is develop
and of course never ever someone talks
to the operation guide right before just
five minutes before they throws a very
very big feature over the wall and say
are we have to deploy it till 2moro 100
servers and then they find out it is not
scaling so that's a very very util model
it's also often means something like
that that for setting up the very first
box for a developer to test they'd say
something below you on your local
machine and local host it usually they
have to ask the operations guys I can
you please set up this box for me but
then you end up in the situation that is
saying ah yeah but we have some
production box here and this is of
course much much more important right
because its production so what happens
your poor developer is blocked which
means we lose capacity so and for us it
means a little bit so following that
actually we start that all the people
take over a lot of aspects and a lot of
tasks from the different roles before so
that means that the usual developer has
actually is doing quite a lot of
off which was also related to testing
right for instance a lot of test
automation stuff because developers are
very good in developing things right so
why should the test automation we
developed by someone else who has on
average seen in most companies less
development experience because sometimes
people started to use the poor dump guy
to do QA and so developers take over
more of the green starts the test stuff
but also they start to take over more of
the operation stuff especially using
cloud services it's no longer really
magic to set up in your own host right
it's pretty easy you could lock in on
Amazon and just click a button to create
a new instance it's very very easy and
so the development gas can take over
more responsibility we got in this stuff
for instances will not mean something
like I set up my very first book and
configure it box and configure it the
first time it's maybe two art in the
beginning but for instance to change
existing systems that would be a good
start for developer and using this
pattern so we actually shift around a
lot of the activities we do and to be
honest this wasn't an easy experience at
nokia so nokia was pretty front of this
model operations blocking everything and
no one is allowed to touch all these
systems out of course they had some very
very bad experience in the past right
the developers deployed something
because they had excess and they brought
down everything yep and relaxing these
rules a little bit doesn't mean that
we're actually going to be careless and
just deploying something it will
actually mean that we deploy with some
kind of very very highly automated
procedure which are really low risk
because it already done hundreds of time
so actually there is no big risk that
there is a failure
for me the most important learning is
actually around introducing continuous
delivery is this one eat your own dog
food for most companies it means for
instance for soundcloud that they use
their own tool that they upload their
own songs that fit figure out how it
feels to use a product for instance at
microsoft they started where a quite a
long time ago that every every employee
had to use in nightly build of windows
every morning and in case this one was
broken it really caused some damage but
in the end it really improves the
quality because no longer the nightly
build was crap right it's a very hard
mechanism to really improve your product
in case the first one was using it is
just the end customer it's really really
bad but why I'm talking about it related
to continuous delivery for me this is
pretty much because you could set up
your improvement process likes it right
so in case we would for instance we
would like to go from no rod automation
to fully automate a road which is doing
edit everything yeah then you assign it
to some guys that figure out or what to
do then the come up with a big roadmap
and plan and they estimated for three
months and then their development it and
developing it it takes four months five
months then you try first to use it of
course it's broken it brings down
everything okay this pattern is this one
right this is this blue pattern in order
to implement improvements we wait a long
time and try to try to implement
everything at the same time and actually
in case we will really believe and
understand that continuous delivery is
creating value then we should do so for
all automation process right that means
we just try to implement a very very
first thing which helps in just
it since was very very hard especially
also very very hard for me so I started
as a programmer so I wanted to write
clean code right and of course in the
beginning I had some tendency to write
very very generic code because I know I
in two weeks I have to reconfigure it
like that as this application has to be
exchanged with this one and what to
configure this value and this value this
value but wait a minute I start with one
application only i would like to
automate the road of one application
only i do not need any variables for
that so one example we tried very hard
to write non generic code very very
specific which is very hard and begin
very very hard at the beginning but on
the other hand it was for instance also
helped to build up trust we had some
members of the team who didn't had so
much experience with automation things
things so for them giving them a very
very big complex scripting engine which
takes a parameter from there and
something from there that wouldn't trust
it what so for instance we started with
a very first robot version B head beyond
the manual step was that we actually
just brought down all the steps which
the engineer executed on the first box
by hand put it in the script transfer
this one to the next box and repeated
the same steps very very easy and of
course we did it within a very very
controlled manner right because we
touched one box at one point of time
very controlled so note we don't take
any risk okay later next step for
instance was ah it was a little bit
funny that we every time logging on to
the production host and then execute
some comments so we introduced some
deployment of users which allowed to do
so so we executed all the comments from
remotely just step by step by step and
so and also during this phase we had
been very very carefully right because
we didn't trust it it so we did all the
steps per hand verified
scrub through every locks every single
line for every deployment in case we you
trusted it we continued with a second
box we upgraded so we started very very
carefully it means a sequence like that
for us meant that they actually went
through applying hundreds of changes so
in order to do 80 rods or I don't know
one more 100 120 over the last year we
implemented maybe roughly 200 or 300
changes with full sequence are very very
tiny baby steps in order to select what
you would like to do at which point of
time this is usually of course very very
tricky right usually you have to find
some kind of balance between I deliver
features and I improve my product so in
the development setup usually it means
ah we deliver features so we implement a
new feature or fix it back war on the
other hand we pay back technical depth
and you always have to find this ratio
right and there's pretty hard discussion
and for a delivery team like mine is
actually we had three major activities
one is delivering new features here that
means we do have to deliver robot to
production changes which were coming
from the development teams we would of
course like to improve something right
the green stuff but actually we started
having a lot to do a lot of firefighting
so it looked a little bit like that we
had quite a lot of firefighting every
release was wheeled nightmare and there
was no time left to do improvements out
okay and how to change it we try to do
it with one baby step at a time so we
liked selected the very first team which
hurts us which hosed us most and for
selecting it you could take a lot of
things into account like
how hard it is to do for its and how
long it does it take you couldn't take
it to account risk and actually what it
brings you in what brings you could
maybe mean that you really measure the
minutes that you would like to improve
your overall metric your psycho time so
for instance one very very important
driver is you would like to improve the
socket I'm right so every improvement
you do must be related in some sense to
the cycle time and otherwise it's
worthless so this is a main driver other
aspects which are also very important is
you should find out which kind of
problems are some kind of difficult to
approach at which point of time right
quite often to change stuff like this is
very political and you for instance you
cannot tell the operations manager in
the beginning yeah we have to have
automated access to scenarios and the
load balancers under this one is this
one otherwise our role is not working
the answer will be up sorry guys I don't
trust you the operations guy is going to
do it by hand this will be the answer in
beginning and it's very clear that is
the answer in the beginning as there was
no chance for the other one to build up
trust you never delivered something you
never delivered something which would
help him him to create some trust right
so it helps a lot to pick something
which is easy maybe a low-hanging fruit
and to approach the things which are
very tricky at the later point of time
for instance for us it meant we had to
improve the the approval process for our
Lord's the beginning we had to ask three
times for approval before we had been
allowed to deploy to production and we
had a lot of waiting time for that and
actually but later the approvals found
out that actually they're not really
verifying or changes in detail they're
just clicking and verifying a few more
formal things but was having more rods
and morals
muroids actually we improved their
understanding of our process and we
improved the Trust's they have so in the
case I said yeah your odds are always so
boring nothing is happening as in there
really likely to clicks about now then
you have a very very good chance
actually to no longer balls or someone
like that then it will agree are you
have proof that you do all the changes
like that given you do it in this period
of time samsung except so it's very very
important that you pick your right
battle at the right point of time I mean
what you said initially when you're sure
the slide is that there was too much
time spent on firefighting right yeah
but when you said what to improve you
said you would rather focus on cycle
time and building trust I mean I would
have thought that you would say well I
need to do something to get the amount
of firefighting down yeah yeah and
that's true and actually for us it meant
we had two different reasons for
firefighting let's say complete flaky
systems the current status of the system
was flaky and the other one was actually
the wrought procedure itself was the
problem and cost some other half so we
try to stabilize this one so actually it
also for simplifying the firefighting
what is the best mechanism to rod a
hotfix it you have to wrote very
immediately that is to press the same
button that you usually press so one of
our stakeholders especially is very very
fond of having actually this metric but
Lindsay and its really like that I'm
running around with an iPad and here is
a button come and press it and then it's
deploying the stuff through production
immediately and even in case it's a new
big feature release or not too big s0
delivering quite often or it's a hotfix
which I have to deliver in a few minutes
right so in this case automations will
rescue but of course we also tried to
tackle what is very flaky RO systems and
how to improve these things as well so
we pretty much try to address with this
improvement stuff we had that we would
use fire
fighting until the very time and in the
end has helped us a little bit that we
had that says this kind of very long
road in the beginning and the long faces
where you add a lot of firefighting less
improvement and do delivery took a lot
of time and was improving a little bit
we actually immediately had the
advantage that the next row odd was more
easy and also worse to mention the
stress level that were always producing
so one from Salt Works a principal
engineer consultant when he's teaching
the seminars vote to continuous delivery
stuff he's asking actually more
questions than I asked he's also asking
okay would you trust your old automation
up to this degree that you go to bar
ordered your first beer drink it lock in
press the deploy button and order and
few other piece for most people the
answer is no but and when he told me
about it I realized yeah actually yeah
we have this kind of trust so I told him
yeah I trusted come on let's do it right
now we really did as a demo we deployed
to production because it's what then
easy and it's not that all the systems
are as stable that never ever something
goes wrong but we have all these tests
in place which are actually catching all
those problems before so in case
something is messed up in our technical
infrastructure which might happen what's
going to be zero results the rollout is
usually that one of the service is going
to be read and not green after
deployment so we stop fix it and then we
continue but we usually try very very
hard not to end up in situation where we
bring down production completed good I
didn't mention a lot of other topics so
actually I didn't talked a lot about Q a
very important for us actually to pass
back the responsibility for QA to the
developers and very luckily with a lot
of teams and working together it was
very very naturally for them so actually
they hadn't been fond of sets just QA
has some no kind of
knowledge rather than know they wanted
to focus on the stuff anyway so they did
already acceptance test driven
development test driven development and
they introduced a lot of coding dojos to
practice staff access other aspect us of
course we try to do pairing to reduce
the bus factor we will try pretty much
to in to increase to the level of trust
and we have to always take into account
is very very much about people right
there's also reason why I focus is talk
not on technical things when you would
like to introduce stuff like this the
technical stuff is easy problem is how
to convince you right people to do the
right things at the right point of time
of course we have dev dev ops is
important test driven development and
one of the most important one is that
they actually learn how to cut your
stores into small things so like your
product owner of your small startup has
to learn how to find a very very small
story not this big story which will take
three months he has to learn how to find
a small story and the same idea is that
really helped us to really apply these
baby steps for this we have to learn how
to cut things in too much much smaller
six ok I would like to end with yet
showing you a few pointers to some stuff
which might be worth to read continuous
delivery is a main book covering this
stuff around lean there's actually stuff
around lean and software developer buys
up appendix Henry Kingi Burke is pretty
great he just recently published this
book here lean from the trenches and
he's asleep really explaining how they
manage to do very big some kind of
government or police project in Sweden
two approaches with saline very very
pragmatic and damped successfully and
one the oldest book here is a pragmatic
programmer because it actually already
gave all of the ideas which are aware in
case you do have to do something a lot
of times automated
around DevOps very unfortunately there
is not a lot of literature and available
there is the info q stuff and a little
bit stuff around and I heard about one
guys who actually starting to write the
first book about DevOps but actually
there is not a lot of stuff Iran okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
