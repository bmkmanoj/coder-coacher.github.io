fork that I have to change to speak here
you were referring to the holiday on the
big event dome actually when I told
people what I'm going to do now I said
I'm like the prebend you know when the
big bands are playing there's some small
little guys playing and I'm this you
know because after Jeff is coming so I'm
just leave with the early pre-program
soft factors a prerequisite for scrum
I'm working now is crumb about two years
i made the scrum master course her
before also in my previous work life
soft factors are important and the more
i go in self-organization the more i go
into pool instead of push the Moores
effects become important however I would
like to be modest it's a heavy topic and
soapy prepared your technologies most of
the people we are more aware and better
to deal with technology to fix something
then to address this I will also talk
about myself because I think instead of
saying people do reason please I give
make myself an example out of it first
the agenda I would like to talk about
what we are doing then I would like to
know from you because I would like to
have it a little bit more interactive
what your interest is in this talk
tonight and what are soft ex what what
are we talking about tonight then a
little exercise what is your favorite
soft factor because everybody has an an
individual one probably then why is it
important why are we focusing on that
then some basic tips probably this is
the most important slide at the end
where placed on my experience I would
like to give some inside of how to
address them because they are quite
challenging as
and then a small discussion rather I
would like to have it a more interactive
and I ask you a couple of questions if
you allow me to do so so first about
ourselves recycle bridge Klaus thanks
already introduced software company
individual software and we provide
exclusive team for customers long-term
I'm managing partner there actually as
cloud said the companies in in Saigon so
it's one part of the Swiss I key bridge
they they take care a European team with
my partner Thomas a Swiss however they
call him the Vietnamese especially when
we are together and on the other side of
the bridge myself like the ambassador of
the customer they are we try to be very
client-focused I think this is also
something which scrum is trying to do
very focused on results and everybody
can see if it's done or not I'm an
economist if you warn you i'm not a
scientist not and information
technologies however I program some
basic at University and I have a clue
what I know I have a great deal of
respect regarding software I come from
industry and why scrum I come from
industry and when I started by my my
working life they all started to
introduce lean lean management lean
organization especially in production
and all the factories who could not
manage to introduce that had to be
closed down because they could not cope
with the cost reduction programs we had
in place so
lean agile scrum community I'm now a
part of this lean agile scrum community
and his was like this I ran into Peter
Stevens maybe some of you know him he
was one of the early ones to get with
dry fork to start on this topic on this
huge journey and he told me you know
what what is chrome I asked him he said
in its chrome is something the managers
like it because you can reduce cost the
customer like it because they get a
better product and the developers like
it because they have more fun so I
thought that something for me because
for me as an economist is always these
black box when you are finished tomorrow
and tomorrow they say after tomorrow and
you can never get a grip of what's
really going on so before I continue I
would like to ask you when you walk out
to the beer what would you like to take
with you what what answers you would
like to have have received from me
please I go to the world come just talk
just come up with some questions yes
please lobbying for scrum yes yes
yeah further please ladies first yeah
that I have prepared for sure that one
as well little bit culture I will not
address them directly i also will not
talk about intercultural because it gets
even more difficult than it already is
in our culture yes ok that's enough I
think I go a little bit more people and
some of these factors also are
underlying that or underlying cultural
good thanks for for this contribution so
what are some factors actually fact soft
practice our human oriented practice all
things you cannot measure or you have to
set up special matrix trust
communication I look into some research
and obviously trust and communication
are the two soft practice mention which
obviously influenced results of software
products projects the most motivation is
also one but this was an Indian study so
it should apply to India as well etc we
could go on some some of em are here
hard factors I don't want to go into
into detail here I mean you're from this
field you have his background you know
cpu speed i can measure it loading time
for website you know you can measure the
etc so i would like to do a little
exercise with you i gave you some hint
now if you talk with your neighbor and
define which one is the most important
soft factor for you then second with
which one which one you would like to
improve because soft factors are things
which we have to master and we have to
become better in and the third factor
which factor you would like that
somebody else is improved because what i
experienced in my life especially in
software is always the other one should
do first is this so i always would like
the other one to improve something
instead of me so yeah we do this you
don't have to come up with with
questions i just want to do this little
exercise with your self i do it with you
with your neighbor most importance are a
soft factor which one you want to
improve and which one you would like
somebody else improve please go on
you
good good to see ya
very actually further discussion to
anyone who has one team came coming up
one first which which one was for you
the first most important most of all of
visual moderate motivation for you okay
then which one you would like to improve
yourself coming out now is the time to
come out communication thank you which
one you think somebody else has to
improve my wife for example or my
collaborator my team team colleague I
hear hear communication and you listen
more talk less okay thanks a lot so um
by focusing on soft factors i spend
about sometimes more sometimes less
about fifty percent of my time with
these kind of factors you have now just
discussed maybe once this want another
one another factor not directly you
don't discuss often i work also very
hard and not discussing is anybody
because we have to repair or to solve
solutions because these are factors have
not been adhered to so what is I'm alone
is this my problem may be my company's
problem may be all my customers a bit
strange bit funny
or they how he did we see we end when I
used to be a developer just the
developer I didn't find how to
concentrate all day long with my
programming work but when
some kind of management responsibility
comes into that it's much more emotional
and very difficult to concentrate on
over network okay this emotional power
supply and how much is it today before
it was zero I understand and now it is
okay from zero to fifty percent okay
because of teamwork some management bad
managers so sorry I know I understand
I'm provoked I'm a manager you know so I
can't take it so literally pro locally
somebody else like to share somebody who
needs less much less still today or much
more hundred percent only
troubleshooting only running around okay
good I don't want to go into the detail
with this I just think it is
extraordinary how and where the scrum
framework addresses these issues like
values and principles and then true
success so Jeff Sutherland and Kench
labor and the people working they have
really understood what the underlying
soft factors how important they are and
when I think back at the scrum breakfast
also when we have these these talks then
again and again we are discussing these
king these kinds of things not so much
also also the method of course and the
implementation but how to overcome this
up the obstacles good with this I would
like to go into some as I said it's a
tough topic we have to be modest I want
to be modest I have some basic tips out
of my life and I take myself as an
example general I think it is good
to have like as a general take these
kinds of attributes cool head sometimes
a bit i'm a bit hot tempered I get upset
if all the time I have to same to say
say the same things not done not so much
in public more with my wife already my
mother said you are street angel and a
breath at home warm warm heart I think
here it's important that we have empathy
for people empathy big empathy even if
things go wrong if people make mistakes
if I make mistake also empathy with
ourselves because already the Roman said
errare humanum is so error is human and
working hands you know I speak now as a
manager of managed to say you should do
this and then they say you should do
that and then it goes down the stairs I
think to involve yourself I think if I
involve myself more personally then that
has a big influence on people because
then they think you really care if you
involve yourself and I remember I was in
a restructuring in England as a Swiss
manager in administration and we had to
reduce workforce about twenty-five
percent of a plant of about 600 people
and in one warehouse I was responsible
for we had seven people working there
and we had to lay off for and it was
pure survival and then they came to me
and said hey Freddie I I don't know if
we can cope because with 7 and 10 3 and
then I said ok every month I come down
into the warehouse and wear a blue
overall like they had and work with you
and then we will check if it's not
because we also with si
and other processes we rearranged the
whole the whole processes and that's
what I did and sometimes they went on
the lunch break and that was the only
one and some people in the factory need
material and then they told me and I had
to look for it and said you don't know
where it is and they said yes sorry I'm
new here so but that had a tremendous
impact on the people and that was the
only manager in this plant being about
25 years running whoever had a blue
overall and went down it worked made his
hands dirty so the first tip the second
tip is find out the true reason and
actually it's easy said but I learned
that from a project manager at the time
in our company for example i'm a very
judgmental person or at least i am
brought up like this so I very quickly
make a judgment about something and I
have learned and also the hard way that
is was dead wrong I was dead wrong and
why are we judgmental because our past
experience our past experience from
childhood learn us and gave us today a
perception and this is perception we go
into human situations you can say it
differently some people say we have pink
glasses that's the same more or less if
you have pink glasses we say every we
see everything in rows and in pink you
can also say you have a mental model and
this tells you to do this in peace this
is also the same or
another allegory is if you have a hammer
in your hand you see only nails and this
is all the same what I'm talking about
and I can tell about myself that as I
said I was dead wrong and finding out
the true reason and even so as a manager
but also in a team on every level is
what it really happened because before I
thought people do not care maybe or
somebody is lazy and the longer I work I
saw so many patterns of people reacting
and this is a that's why you have a need
empathy if you don't have empathy then
you be judgmental for example i saw i
thought people they sabotage in but they
were yeah absolutely scared but it you
couldn't see it from outside they did
strange behave strange things especially
in another culture like for example like
Vietnam so find out the true reason and
and you have to do this with a dialogue
a friendly warm dial not finger pointing
even if it's bad what what happened we
have a difficult project at the moment
and I spoke about half an hour with the
project manager I don't say I still
don't find out find out what happened
really and why wait why gee you know
then people are you know I come to this
people are she was somehow evasive I
didn't got three but i will try again i
will try again so am i doubt the true
reason then we saw many examples i would
like to make one example is trust could
also take communication but any would
take too long but with trust and the
situation is everyone everybody wants to
have trust everybody not everybody
gifs trust or has trust in himself not
everybody gives trust to others
especially if the trust has failed you
told them to do so they didn't do it so
you have to check again you know you
cannot trust somebody for example I have
problems as a manager I like to delegate
but if things are not happening how much
and then find out the true reason what
was it a misunderstanding or is it a
people problem does this person have a
problem it then it's something else and
I cannot like generally handle these
situations and this is where managers
often fail let me go one step back why
is this why do we have problems with
trust one example one example thousands
of reasons but one example was actually
I I was a teenager when I heard this on
the radio it was a SF try I heard that
they made some research and in a
person's life from 0 to 20 he gets about
80,000 times blamed by the environment
by the parents don't do this come up
shut up do your homework go dress these
these jeans are dirty and and then but
your queen just for the sake of the
example and about only 20,000 times we
got praises so no no for me for me today
that I do not trust as much as I won't
like to others it's also because of
least he's had an influence on me lately
leave me it was only 70 9999 times but
also maybe only 10,000 praises
for sure he was also less so that has an
influence on us that has an influence on
us and as a consequence what we have to
know to give feedback it's a very
difficult task constructive feedback
because I don't know how you are now
it's be better but we are all little bit
wounded because we were many times
criticized and at the lean agile scrum
conference on fourteenth of September
there was Shawn who he was here last
time he gave the speech last time but he
was here last time as a as a in the
audience hey he said something very very
important he said 441 blame I need seven
praises to like compensate or balanced
out because of this and what are we
doing I'm not praising enough good
things and think of it when have you
praised somebody for the last time in
your family or private life of your
business I think we have to compensate
for this you don't have to say old ama
that's great without meaning we have to
put meaning behind it because although
my otherwise it's sounds Hollow good so
the conclusion is it is important but it
is challenging to apply challenging to
apply and with this I conclude I closed
the action is we have identified and I
think you I had to feel in your Sherry's
we can discuss this afterwards but
actually education in this respect I did
not have much what I learned I learned
myself as i said the hard way because I
ran into huge problems and I think also
in companies I think there is a lack of
investment for example we have a
customer
and it's very difficult and he is very
judgmental and it's clear that only one
part is responsible only us the supplier
he is my everything perfect I told him
his cane by definition lovely I went to
see him and fault okay at the telephone
many things can happen and he said let's
not talk about his vibration stupid
stuff of thing like what that was last
week so it is still not everywhere
except knowledge so maybe question for
for you have you had this who had enough
soft factor training in education it's
somebody at least have it some okay and
I think also people offered especially I
think also especially men think I this
is some talking issue do not talk 40 huh
let's do it huh but i think it's a it's
a good investment because I set amidst
is I close it's a prerequisite and when
you apply scrum you will always come
back to these things and I thank you for
your attention and if you have questions
we could go into the discussion Klaus
will say if we ran out already probably
anyway the slides if somebody would like
to take note they are on on SlideShare
and if somebody else needed it they can
also get it from me thank you very much
hey the investors people take quick said
any questions especially from my
experience and you talked about you
having basically working on a Vietnam
pool then we started talking about scrum
he said we have any client focused I was
working across geographies the
surfactants off my clothes and I just
toss all factors if you argue every
that's that's what I wanted to say
actually I would like to stay on the
topic what I and this we can discuss
bilateral because I don't want to talk
about offshoring not what i can say
trust communication it's the same thing
in offshoring it's just a little bit
more complex because it's even more
different than we thought find out the
true reason and also when I go to this
overcoming resistance you know also
there what why what is the resistance
you know you can apply the same thing
practical examples i think i did
cultural challenge as said it's the same
patterns of conflict what I often see is
that conflicts are not addressed to in
an early stage and then they spoil
completely out of control and you have
to have the sensitivity to find out to
address these things early on because
otherwise really makes it really
difficult and lobbying for scrum is also
not a topic exactly you can also come
come and discuss it directly with me
because I don't want to yeah because I
don't want to keep you before of your a
break
because all I ask the love anything but
I guess I can handle it with the same
answer time to prove reason for the
resistance and then you can overcome as
well just give up because exactly and
spend your time somewhere more fruitful
yeah can be a consequence is I think
it's a very important question first the
first line of defense I i think is
because i'm selling the projects and its
really agile manifesto I mean customer
collaboration before contract
negotiation if this contract negotiation
are really difficult and cumbersome and
these things come up then I think all
Jesus Christ my guys my medela
developers my colleagues they have they
have to work with this kind of person
later we will run into problems we are
not doing it and even if it has
financial consequences it's the first
thing and then the second thing I try
with this and then yeah sometimes it's
better to to stop better than men in the
Horde and a whore without an end you
know
no no very god feel very good sealant of
course dialogue a trying hard and also
dialogue with my colleagues because
sometimes I said I don't want to have to
pink glasses I have them on you know so
cut with with teams together you can
bring more clarity into the picture
let's say handcuffed Liberty on Charlie
of course sometimes you are more
depending on on the customer and on
projects and sometimes less because i'm
a partner together with my with my
partner to build the two of us and he is
the same in this field because at the
end we have to deal with it and i rather
don't do a project even if it has
financial consequence because the
headache I get is is never worth never
worth this this money because one
project spiraling out of control can
take most of my time to solve it and I
think we have to be honest there
last time last autumn I cremations
organization patients it's the result of
research emerging open and underpin such
as come and heal I skis petals up into
four pattern languages and some patterns
are in several languages and all fall of
Adam languages start with the pattern
community of trust so okay this guy's
the research that is given the most
important okay if you can write this
during the break like some link or on
the chart because I'm interested in I
think some of you to thank another great
or the third year happiness that makes
is turn it off okay thank you
