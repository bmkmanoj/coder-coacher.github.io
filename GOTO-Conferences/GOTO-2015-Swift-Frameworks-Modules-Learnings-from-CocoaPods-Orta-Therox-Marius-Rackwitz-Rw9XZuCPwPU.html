I am going to use my slide for this one.
We are talking about the
CocoaPods Frameworks.
This is something that most
of you will have heard of,
but we are going to go into it,
both: the details
of what the actual transition
was for CocoaPods Frameworks,
and the bit of advice
on how you could do it yourself
(because we have pragmatic time
from when we have had to transition
applications to Frameworks).
CocoaPods has a very
large amount of contributors.
More importantly, he is
Marius Rackwitz and he did all
of the actual Swiftification
and Frameworkification
of Cocoapods
(going from the old way
to the new way).
He is Orta Therox
(everybody knows him
as Orta, @orta on Twitter).
He used to introduce himself
as doing just the design work
and being the design dictator,
but that is actually not right.
He has done much more
for CocoaPods,
(e.g. CocoaDocs, which is a
huge project on it is own),
and maintaining our websites
(not just the design side,
but more!).
(Big inside stuff, and much more:
plug-ins, weird plug-ins)
- ([Orta] I do all the weird things).
(Whenever it is like frustrating
and CocoaPods will not do
something and I have to wait
for a release, it is time
to make a plug-in for it).
(It has a beautiful structure
for doing this kind of stuff).
What is CocoaPods?
CocoaPods is primarily a
dependency manager, and also
a community (really important
about that part.
It is really easy to
think that a single tool
can allow you to do something,
but one of the cool things
about CocoaPods is it allows
people to interact).
(In 2013 it had
the most amount of committers
to a single repo on GitHub, which is huge.
That meant that, at that
point, we were the only people
actively using GitHub as a source
for individual contributions).
It is a great reflection
on how big the community is,
in terms of what people are doing with it.
That is also reflected in
the complexity of the tool.
It has existed for five years now;

it is stable, mature.

Now that we talk about Frameworks,
we are going to talk
about some of the terminology.
First off, this is an Xcode project.
(You may have seen one of these before).

We are going to talk about workspaces.
In general workspaces (the
bit that you see on this side)
is where your project, files and groups
are kept.

We are talking about targets;
they are the apps or the extensions
that you normally have in your project.
Later, we will be talking
about copy or resource build phases
(you can get
to these when you click
on a target and you see build phases).
CocoaPods does a few of its own
(instead of the normal Xcode ones).
(We wanted to make
sure that you knew
all the bits that we will be talking about).

Integration history:
Frameworks have
not been there forever.
Before frameworks, we had static libraries
(static libraries have
been the common denomiator
until i07, because until i07
they were not available for iOS).
(At least not for the App Store).
You could use them unethically
and standard Frameworks
with a link, but you could not
distribute your own frameworks
with your app bundles.
We use them for the integration
because they were
unavailable on OSX and iOS
(were the only platforms
we had to support back then).
(two platforms. Could you imagine?)
(Just two platforms).
What are static libraries?
(It seems obvious but,
question to the audience:
(Please raise the hands).
Who of you would think they could explain
how static linking works,
or a static library is linked?)
(I see some hands raised).
(It is a trick question).
Static libraries are not linked at all.

It is not obvious in the main page
of LD but static libraries
are just a collection of object files,
and object files are compiled
with a lot of meta information.
The machine code you
have there is independent
from its position (and some
other stuff you have to know
in detail, but they are not linked).
They are just compiled object files.
(And how we get there?)
When we build our source code with Clang,
we get the object files and put them
into Ranlib (making
an archive out of them).
And archive has contents saying
which object files at which
position in the whole file,
maintains the file information,
and how this object file was originally named.
We do this for every architecture.
We use Lipo to
archive them altogether again
to a fat binary.
When we built enough of that,
this could look like that
(simplifications
are a applied here for
the sake of simplicity).
We have here a library banana kit,
which has a dependency to
the other library, monkey.
And a seal eye tool
as our program we want to build,
which depends on both of those libraries.
When we build this program
it is rather simple.
We just put everything together,
compile it and then link it
(that is our program).
For CocoaPods,
we set up the exclude project
(everything works like that).
We set up static library
targets. In addition
(because static libraries
do not contain or support
resources,
or other associated files),
we would need for example,
correlater models.
CocoaPods has solved that
with an additional build files
(used for the integrated target),
named CocoaPods resources build files.
It is nothing different
than run script build files,
executes a shell script
(which lives in a separate shell file,
as it is easier
to regenerate the separate shell file
instead of having them
living in the Xcode project
in a pods Xcode project;
that would cause bigger
change to the integration
and it is not that easy to review
just with that on).
We want to make it as easy as possible,
if you take in the pods project.
But that is all
about the integration
scenario of static libraries.
What we needed then
were dynamic frameworks;
they are required for Swift.
If you want to build for Swift,
from iOS 8 for iOS 7,
they are distributions
after standard libraries,
aesthetic libraries (only available for iOS 7).

If you want to target a later platform,
you will need to use the dynamic libraries.
That is the way for the future,
especially when Swift
once reach that point
where it comes bundled
together with the OS,
or other standard
libraries like foundation
(where you are used to a dynamic link up).
We adopted the dynamic linking
with the frameworks together.
First of all: what is a
framework, how it looks like?
If you tab that in the
finder (in your build product),
it is just a file bundle.
Because it has this file
suffix, it is displayed
in another way and find out
now some meta information
about frameworks.
If you right click on
it, you can tab
into it and browse it
(like any other directory).
Here we have the full expanded free.
We see at the top afield example
of a very popular networking
library, Alamofire
(if networking for Swift build).
The first entry is the executable,
belsky, a dynamic library
with all the file suffix down low
(because it is clear,
executable through
living in the framework
and having the same name)

Actually, they are static frameworks.
You can have a
static library at this place
and it just magically
works (is
undocumented that it works that way).
(But they are just side information here).
The headers
are automatically on the right,
pushing header Swift
or for object of seed to interface
the Swift parts of the model.
The umbrella header is important
(together with the model map)
because it is responsible
for defining the public interface.

The umbrella header is
referenced in the model map.
Everything transitively imported
by the umbrella header
is part of the public model
interface and available
for everything linking against it
(that place we have all
been using model imports,
which are available with
at import object of c,
and
for Swift. They are
based on what we see below,
as in the directory models
and Alamofire Swift model).
We also see
that there is some extra
documentation information,
which is used by another
part of the tooling.
Those are platform specific
(as we see by the file names).
In addition to that,
we have the info p list,
which contains some meta
information.
There is information
(e.g. the version and the copyright)
in the umbrella header, which
is going to rate by default.
There is a foundation expert,
your library name version
and it is a constant.
The version information
from the info p list file is pulled
at build time of the framework,
and read. A c
file is going to rate it;
the constant is not read at wrong time
from the info p list,
but is part of the binary
and is compiled into that
(otherwise it would
take a long time to assess
the version information
and that would not be helpful).
This information
are only necessary for import and linking.
If you distribute
your app for App store builds,
they would give more information
about what is going on in your libraries
and there could be
protected information
and the framework
documentation if you share code
across your app and your
extension.
That is ripped out.
What is dynamic linking,
or what are dynamic libraries?
In comparison to the
static linking
(from the main page this important detail),
it is a file linked image
(the linker run on it).
We compile
the source code and then
we run the linker over it.
We have the Mac
object file, which has a header
with some meter information
(e.g. dependencies),

and we repeat the process again
for every architecture we need.
(a little deeper)
With Swift files
the same, different artifacts;
in the first step
we compiled monkey swift
and then we exported words
in our public interface.
Next, we compiled banana kit
(making use of foreign symbols:
MKMonkey - we have to link that
to our monkey swift, the
library, and annotate
where it comes from).
We have this other
symbol, which is a ray
and comes from Swift's and a library.
(I will stop for sake of simplicity).
We compile all my program
and obviously we cannot
export there any symbols
because the program is linked by itself
and no one links to a ready program
(which is built for running).
Then we have to resolve the symbol c again
to both of our libraries.


With frameworks because we linked them
and annotated in our macro header

(there are other dynamic libraries
or frameworks around),
we have to embed them and make sure
that they are available on
runtime. The dynamic link
can be resolved when the program runs.
They have to be embedded in the bundle,
frameworks folder.
Build files are
a usual copy file,
and it is named.
You can rename the files in Xcode
and the destination is set to
frameworks from the comma box.
That is not enough for CocoaPods.
We have some special possibilities,
we have configuration
dependent pods.
Little demonstration how that
would look like for the pod file.
That makes sense if you want
to include some frameworks
which are not suitable for App Store
(e.g. user testing,
something you cannot ship in the App Store
because Apple has some
obvious (and not that obvious) restrictions).

We needed to come up
with a script which allows
to embed the pods that
are active for the current
build configuration
(Xcode is not able
to allow us a set up).
That is the reason why
we found in a configuration
a new build files (which
looks a bit different
than the default case if you
would set it up yourself).
(But what is happening
there is still the same).
Headers are stripped and the
frameworks need to be signed.
Everything is signed by itself:
frameworks are assigned individually
and your other executables
assigned individually.
(that is the way it is).

Now, a comparison.
You have seen static linking (before)
and dynamic linking (now):

what is better?
Frameworks are easier to distribute
and integrate into the app once
they are built and compiled
because they bring everything
together and they allow
to bundle resources.
They have a separate name scope.
Even at runtime,
you see the difference
(e.g. when referencing to a bundle,
you have a separate name scope).
Another advantage is
they allow to reduce the file size
of your whole bundle if you
share the same framework
across your app into your extensions.
We use it in both places,
but if you have to use
different API availabilities
(like in iOS), there is this restriction
that the extension API
may only be used in extensions.
They have limited access on,
for example, UI application -
you need to ship two versions,
which is not been available
since the very beginning
of when extensions were introduced,
(I cannot say exactly).
But you can have separate
frameworks folder
in your apex:
you can separate frameworks
and have two
versions of the same framework.
(what I have said before)
You have to really separate
bundle, which allows you
to assess resources by name
only from your framework bundle
and you do not get by accident
any other framework or any
other framework resources
or the app resources just
because they have the same name,
or name place at build time.
(that is nice).
There are disadvantages.
You have a dynamic library
as a final linked binary:
you limit possibilities for optimization,
because it is linked at
that time when you build it
(it could be on a different computer
if it is some closed
source third party library
which is rarely the case for CocoaPods).
In the same category,
dead-code stripping is
limited with static linking.
You can import the object files,
you need object
files which are not needed
or not included.
A real disadvantage,
because with object of c
you have
the object files included
(or at least the vast majority of them),
because the compiler is unable
to figure out at compile time
what is called and what
is needed at runtime
(because it is a dynamic language).
(something very
important to mention here)
You will have increased load times.
When you do it at runtime,
there is overhead for
resolving the dynamic links
to other binaries.
(I go over back to Orta).
- (I get control again).
For CocoaPods
we have to spell out
different things
and we ended up getting
freebies like the Clang modules.
To pull it off we had to extend
the code that you would write
when you are using CocoaPods
(e.g. use frameworks)


We did that initially to
make sure that people knew
that they were using frameworks
(and you have been pitching
lately that we should
remove it eventually).
- (We could recommend to use it).
(In some cases we could be
a bit smarter about it),
I think
we need integration scenarios;
it makes sense to have
it in the pod file end,
to have to use it explicitly.
- (Yes,
- at this point).
- (And that is been really useful).
We have had to to work
around Apple tools
(they are as good
as you expect them be
around using third party stuff).
Code signing has been difficult,
(even months after,
we are still seeing
problems with code signing).
Apple does not give
any notice upfront about
what is going to change.
On top of that,
they will
make changes on their server
that you will find out
when you are deploying your code to Apple
(at the end of your build).
(Things that previously
were not problems before using frameworks).
- You know probably yourself
from building your
application and insuring
that everything runs smooth,
there are limited possiblities
to really catch everything in
your continuous integration;
with an open source project,
we are even further limited.
We cannot, obviously,
deploy ultimately to the App Store
in our continuous integration.
We rely on user feedback
(we are luckily getting a lot of it).
- (a lot of it).


I have transitioned three major applications
from CocoaPods static libraries
to CocoaPods Frameworks.
(I wanted to give you
a rough gist of the process,
of how I have ended up doing it.
Marius says I should not be
recommending this entirely
because we have a
proper way of migrating projects).
I use plug-ins
that completely nukes
CocoaPods from your project.
Cocoapods-deintegrate and then I run it.
I use this when I am
switching between frameworks
and libraries and from
libraries to frameworks.
You have a clean slate
when you running
pod-install the next time.
(is what I would recommend).
(This is what it ends up looking).
It goes
through all these different
parts (where CocoaPods
touches your Xcode project
and shows you what has changed
and what is changing), and
gives you a good idea
of what has created a clean slate.
That is: deleting the pods,
changing some of the build phases,
and removing any empty Xcode groups
that CocoaPods will have made.
From there, it is as
simple as these three steps:
use frameworks in your Podfile,
that will dictate that the next time
that you do a pod install,
it will switch to libraries,
to frameworks.
Then, run your tests
(where you find out
where all the failures are).

The most common problems are:
1) pods that depend on other libraries
that are not yet dynamic.
Most people have seen this
from like Google Analytics,
or other
binary distributed libraries,
(Flurry is another one.
it is nearly always analytics libraries).
(To some extent, you just
cannot work around that).
I have ended up adding app code
that links two pods together
in order to make that work.
The other one is to bug
whoever is distributing
that library, that maybe
they should start supporting frameworks
(now that it is been a year).
(To some extent on their perspective,
it is also a bad thing
because they have to
dictate that they are
going iOS 8 and above only;
reasons for people not migrating
in that direction).
We often find that libraries do not look up
their own bundle resources.
They presume that the main app bundle
is already inside
which means that you end up
with missing images (most of the time).
With fonts,
we have pods that give us our fonts,
that we had to
dynamically link them
(we could not even
rely on putting
font names in our info dot p list).

Pound defies would allow them to
do whatever they want

with someone else's code
(e.g. with custom prefixes,
where someone would have a pound define
that would allow you to
remove the custom prefix):
that will not work anymore.
(Shame).
One of the apps that we translated
was one of the fist apps
to use CocoaPods
as a frameworks
(the moment you had a commit
that was workable, I shipped it
on one of our apps).
(I have the pull request).
Where I work
everything is open source
(you can go look at the pull request
of the transition from a static library
to a frameworks).
(This one is the first
time we started doing it).
Eidolon
is a Swift app. It was nice and easy,
because it was already in that process.
The next one was our oldest app
(the point we migrated
was about four and a half years old).
There was a lot of legacy code
in moving it over.
That transition probably took me
about two or three days of editing pods
and changing our internal structure.
(Again, this is open
source, so you can also go
and see the pull request
changing these things).
Finally, we had our
most complicated application:
over 60 pods,
a bunch being internal,
testing, open source ones;
transitioning was difficult.
(This one took about a week,
of someone who knows how to
use CocoaPods well's time).
(part of that was
made extremely difficult
because) A week or two later,
we realized that the
launch time was so bad
that every time you would click the app
for the first time,
it would time out.
(The watchdog would just kill it).
(It would stay there for the
full, eight seconds
before watchdog kills it?)
- I do not know, except
- [Orta] - Six?
(Ten? it is a
large amount of time;
really frustrating to watch).
We transitioned it and it turned out
to be the switch to frameworks.
Finding this,
having 60 pods linked into your app
at launch time was not working for us.
There is a big pull request
that is still not finished,
where we have multiple developer
tech support issue requests
with Apple (there is
many radars about this now).
(That is a prohibitive problem).
This and my eventual fix was
to convert it back. As an application,
at this point we were not using Swift,
we were not using extensions -
there were no reasons
for us to actively use it, we
were just switching to frameworks
to be ready in case we wanted to.
Even now you can
ship an app that does not require
you to be using frameworks.
It is nice that they are there,
but you do not have to use it
(if you do not need to).
Remember to rate this session
and rate CocoaPods
Frameworks as being awesome.
As it is two of
us, you will have to remember
that we are extra super cool.
And you can come help us out at CocoaPods.

This links that we made
a second ago will take you
to what we call the easy first issues,
which are things where,
people that do not know Ruby
can start making a stab at
some of these smaller bugs,
or smaller feature requests that we
(as the actual people building CocoaPods)
do not try, so that other people
can come and get them.
I strongly recommend doing this,
and helping us out.
- Please come and help yourselves.
you are very welcome.
- Thanks.
- [Voiceover] We have questions
from the audience.
The first one is, what is
your opinion on Carthage
and why is CocoaPods the
better dependency model?
Marius: This question is difficult to answer,
(at least the latter part,
without taking here too much time).
I would say both dependency
managers are very different
in the way they try to achieve their goals
and CocoaPods tries to
make the whole integration
and the whole thing,
as transparent as possible to the user.
Everything is
inspectable and
is as you used to have it in Xcode
and you would set it up on your own.
Even the build process is used
as what Xcode is giving you.
That makes it easy
to ignore Xcode about that,
because you do not need to have a
working Xcode project to
have our working pods spec.
If you do not like
to have state and maintain
information in Xcode projects,
pod specs are
a better solution for you.
Carthage is going a
different way at this point.
With four platforms,
I think we prefer
to continue the way we have chosen
(we are happy with that).
- [Voiceover] I think you
covered this, but they said
how manage with float times
through the experience
with apps being converted?
Orta: Yes, the
Tumblr app they posted
that they said
they went from roughly
9.3 seconds to five or six.
Which yes, at that
point we were...
- [Voiceover] The
takeaway from your session
is you can
use frameworks, just don't.
Orta: There is a lot of apps
that should be shipping with it
I guess the answer is maybe,
you are going to have to have
a crazy, hybrid solution
of some frameworks
and some static libraries.
Marius: I feel it depends on
your use case and how you use
dependencies and how many
of them and know about
the outside projects that you are using.
Dependencies and third party dependencies,
which are not actually third
party because they maintain
open source projects on their own.
If you have
codes scattered over
small libraries, it will definitely
have an impact on loading times.
But if you have a small amount
of big dependencies,
you could profit in the loading times
(a big executable
takes longer to load
than a small executable,
which has big dependencies).
Orta: Yes, n squares, the more
it gets significant,
but while it is still small,
it is pretty reasonable.
We are still shipping some apps
the have frameworks
turned on, or multiple.
But the big ones, no.
For the moment.
- [Voiceover] Questions from the audience?
- [Voiceover] That was nice
that you tried to try the Swift version
for CocoaPods in your own apps.
Do you have a test app that
you send off to the App store
with every version of CocoaPods?
Just to make sure that Apple still accepts
what you are doing new?
Marius: No, we do not do anything like that
because there is just
no proper way to do it.
- [Voiceover] If there is a problem,
somebody iwill call you
&quot;hey this just happened
where Apple said no&quot;.
Marius: Exactly, yes.
We try to prevent it
by having experienced
developers in place for code
review in our code team,
and using the technology
we built on our own,
but there will be always edge cases,
especially with f extensions
and previous stuff like
sharing dependencies,
on watchkit extensions
and the watchkit app
and having all the stuff in
place, it is just not too much
as you are really able to test it
by one big integration scenario.
- [Voiceover] As an idea
for somebody who has
free time on their hands, why
not create a server that just
checks out their latest
version of CocoaPods,
builds a project and sends
it off to the App Store?
Just to make sure it goes through again.
Marius: if you can make that
work without being able
to discard versions from iTunes Connect?

Orla: because you have no guarantee
that Apple are going to...
Marius: Especially
to tooling on the rep hand side of things,
is going to be problematic,
but with the tutorials around fast lane,
it could be eventually doable.
Orla: Let's get Felix. Felix can do it.
He will probably just do it in
a day if we ask him politely.
- [Voiceover] One of
the standard questions
I get when I recommend people to CocoaPods
is what should I check in to get,
check in just support
file, the entire pulse.
what is your current--
Orla: How about you, because
I have got different opinions.
Marius: We can both answer this question.
I would say it depends,
but I generally prefer
having the pods directory
in place because that is nice
for continuous integration.
It does not have to run pod install
and you make sure that even
on some pods, a force push to master
would be run and there is a
different version up there,
but just new commits for the same version
that could help them.
We rely on techs in the repository
and you cannot change the tech
when you do something
bad (e.g. a force push).
You should not do that
but the code could change
and you could get something different,
and you cannot prevent anything like that
because once you have the
pods directory in place,
it is no need to run CocoaPods at all,
or to have CocoaPods even installed.
You are much more independent
with having the pods directory in place
(in some way at least).
I know some developers
who came up with using
GitHub's models for a pods
directory specifically.
Orla: it is kind of ironic, right?
Marius: Not that much.
Your answer.
Orla: In all of our apps, we do not.
In all of our libraries, we do.
Libraries, you actually
get Carthage support
for free (more or less);
a lot of the time you
will come back to a library
after a long amount of time in between.
There is also the fact that
you cannot entirely rely
on other people hosting your
code that you will be bringing in;
checking in your pods
means that you will actively
have the code that is necessary
for your app every time,
in case Twitter decided to
take over the Twitter pod
and suddenly decided
they are not going to support
all the old versions
of this unofficial Twitter SDK.
If you have checked
your pods in before hand
you would still be able to
rely on that code existing
in your own fork (in
your own repo, effectively).
But in general, the applications
we work on (where I work),
these are permanently
developed applications
that are constantly going to
have development done on them.
When a pod disappears,
it is very likely we will
have found out by the
next day and we will have
found a mitigation
strategy for that problem.
It does not have
the clutter of it being
inside your code reviews,
as well as we include our application keys
inside our pods directories;
we have sensitive data in there too.
It is a bunch of yes and no reasons,
which is why
people ask the question.
In my opinion there is no
strong answer for one.
The multiple paragraphs we have
on the guides about it,
there are reasons for doing it
and reasons for not doing it.
You should find our own space for it.
Marius: Definitely.
(faint voice from audience)
(Orla: Right? that is the most important part).

Orla: (I would like someone)
I want to build a new
website on CocoaPods,
but I do not want to be
the one building it.
I just want to do all the designing;
if someone feels up
for building more Ruby websites,
that would be cool.
Want to build something
like medium
but for talking about pods.
I have not found
the name or the terminology
I want to use to describe it,
but I think that would be a nice
way of collecting them together.
You could say these are
the certain pods that I think
go well together or they
compete.
There are
many functional reactive programming pods;

maybe five or six
are worth your time.
But all of them have
trade-offs and this website
should be the way in which
people can express those.
That is what I would like to see.
Marius: I would like to see some
of the easy issues tackled.
But also
frameworks built for us.
We want to still enable
configuration dependent pods;
would be nice if we
could ultimately recognize
when no configuration
dependent pod is used
that we just use
the copy files resource files instead
and let Xcode do their job
(and not our fragile script
where we tried to reproduce to do the same
because there is no
officer to or from Apple
that functionality
is exposed
so that they could reverse that).
They have to replicate everything
what is done effectively
and do it on our own in the shell script.
That has shown to be
error prone in the past,
especially with Apple
changing our own things
and tweaking stuff.
I would like to have
the integration as close
as possible to what is the
way Apple would do it.
Orla: I would like to double that.
That is all good and proper,
but every time you press build
on a CocoaPods project you see
this little running script phase.
Fixing that problem would remove
that problem for everybody.
There are roughly 40,000
projects using CocoaPods.
If you could do that, you
would save maybe a second or so
from every single person
pressing build, every time.
That is a lot of time.
And it is totally worth
someone's time to build.
(But build my website first).
Thanks.
Marius: Thanks.
