I got the nice post lunch session so
everyone's all full I can see everyone's
got the itis we're gonna try to keep you
awake through this thing my talk is
titled DevOps the good bad and the ugly
we're mostly gonna focus on the bad and
the ugly right not that not that I don't
love DevOps right I love DevOps
but I think there's enough talks about
how wonderful it is how amazing it is
and there's a number of things that go
on when you make this DevOps
transformation that if you make it in a
vacuum you're kind of like maybe we did
something wrong and then suddenly it's
like oh no everybody had to figure that
out and you're like oh well I wish I had
known that so I'm gonna kind of walk you
through some of the things that we
encountered and hopefully share or save
you guys some pain before we get started
though I'll just kind of rehash my name
is Jeff Smith I manage site reliability
engineering at GrubHub how many of us
have heard of grub hub all right for
those of you that haven't go to it it's
awesome
grub hub com we connect diners with
restaurants to get food delivered and it
is a tremendous experience and I hope
you enjoy it and if you do enjoy it we
are hiring it is amazing how difficult
it is to get food from one place to
another tons of Technology tons of
interesting problems so if you're
interested grub hub comm slash careers
or you can see me after the talk I'm on
Twitter you can find me at dark and
dirty my email address is Jeff at all
things dork last but not least this is
not a diversity talk so surprise now
that that elephants out of the room
there's a there's probably a couple
things I should probably tell you about
myself too before we get started just to
kind of like frame the context of this
talk right
I guess I'm considered sort of a downer
on things right everything is terrible
sort of in my book and not because I'm
one of those grumpy people that just
hates everything but it's just that I
believe strongly that there
is no such thing as a perfect solution
and I try to eradicate any ideas or
suggestions that this solution that my
team comes up with is just gonna work
right because there's always trade-offs
there's always things that are good and
bad and you kind of have to deal with
that right even my four-year-old is
starting to learn that right it's like
oh I didn't know if I skip the ice cream
I could have cake later it's like well
yeah that's a trade-off right
same thing with systems design so take
everything I'm saying with a little bit
of grain of salt the other thing you
should know about me is unfortunately I
am NOT an expert I'm not a thought
leader I have a blog probably gets about
30 hits a month but so so your mileage
on this may vary but I want to just let
you guys know that you know we have kind
of gone through these pains and troubles
so understand that this is from our
perspective rainbows unicorns right like
that's kind of what we talked about and
grow us or in grub pops in DevOps man
that looks a lot worse on a big screen
like that holy cow but that's kind of
where we are with the state of DevOps
right now right everything is beautiful
everything is amazing there's rainbows
everywhere but that's not quite true
right and the analogy that we kind of
use is like imagine you're at a factory
and that Factory we say you know what
you guys need to get into rainbow
business just put rainbows everywhere
and they're like all right sweet we're
gonna do that and then at the end of the
day they're like you know we've got all
these rainbows up but it's always bright
out now you know no one can go to sleep
and we're like oh yeah that happens
everyone right so many people don't get
to that rainbow section and they're like
oh we must have done something wrong
right because obviously if other people
are having this problem they wouldn't be
espousing how awesome this is
there's a series of problems that comes
up and you have to address them
appropriately and not everything is rosy
so why the switch to DevOps for us a lot
of the common reasons that most of you
guys have right when you just have code
and you throw it over the fence to ops
nobody wins right it's problematic all
across most of us have probably
experienced that just a quick show of
hands how many people identify
themselves as developers and how many
people is ops folks okay all right cool
so yeah tossing code over the fence
isn't beneficial for anyone it's
problematic but the other thing is ops
and dev really have different mindsets
on how we approach problems right and
that's normal because in reality we have
slightly different incentives right as a
result of that we have slightly
different mindsets
but both set both mindsets are useful to
both groups right so there's a lack of a
development mindset in operations and
there's a lack of an operational mindset
in development so when we saw DevOps we
saw that as an opportunity to kind of
marry these two things and hopefully
execute better and bring that mindset
those disparate mindsets to both teams
so when we initially rolled out DevOps
the first thing we had to do is we had
to look at the org structure right
because you have people like me that are
managers that have direct reports and we
say now we're going to take dev we're
gonna take op so we're going to mush
them together and people say all right
but what does that mean right does that
mean I report to this person is my job
title changing these are all real things
that you have to deal with because there
are people involved right so if I just
told you you know one day like hey we're
gonna change the way we work I'm gonna
give you a slightly different title and
it's going to be awesome
you're gonna have a series of questions
that you have to have answered right who
do I report to who's my boss if I'm
working with this development team are
they my boss if if operations is here
you know what does that mean in terms of
what my responsibilities are as a
developer so that was one of the big
things we had to tackle the other thing
was tool sets and workflows for the ops
team as we kind of hinted towards
earlier there's a lack of a development
mindset in some operational shops not
all of them your mileage may vary but in
some of them there is that that
fundamental lack because we haven't
worked in those types of environments
right source control for us was a bunch
of back files with day time and it was
awesome
but it didn't work out so well so as a
result of that you also have to deal
with changing skill sets that are
necessary for the teams both in
development and operations right
Operations has to learn things or
surrounding the software development
lifecycle development has to learn
things in terms of like what it takes to
run a system in production the types of
data you need the types of alerting you
need
things like that so you have to prepare
yourself that it's not going to be just
we're going to take these two teams
we're gonna mush them together and
everything's gonna be magical there are
a number of things that are going to
have to be addressed from a skill set
perspective in order for you to be truly
successful so as I around in the DevOps
community I find a couple of different
or abstract org structures that exist
right the first org structure that I see
is ops team members aren't that are
embedded in development teams and they
report to those team leads it's sort of
like this unified team right there is no
real separate ops organization anymore
then there's a model where there's OP
team members who remain separate but
there's some sort of official engagement
process for those resources and that's
sort of this that's sort of the model
that we've use we have a separate tech
ops org structure but each sre reports
directly well not directly but reports
to a stream team lead so they're a
member of that team in in context but in
reality that line is dotted and they
still reporting to me and I report into
the VP of tech ops and then third one is
a new team is formed called dev ops it's
effectively a third silo and probably
after a year you'll realize that it's
actually released engineering I think
that's a a common pattern that we see
where you see a DevOps job and you're
like hmm this sounds exactly like
release engineering that's because it is
we'll talk about the third silo a little
bit more but you know avoid the third
silo if possible stop and think about
what you're doing you want to destroy
silos by adding another silo greatest
group of all time so this is a quick
look of what our org structure looks
like so we've got the VP and engineering
we got functional leads team leads dev
QA and business analysts then we have a
separate org structure where we've got
the VP of tech ops team leads and a
bunch of ops members that report into
the team leads like I said there's that
dotted line so that our ops staff are
part of the team right they participate
in the team stand-ups they participate
in the team's iteration planning
meetings but they still report to a
separate organization and why that is
we'll get into in just a second because
it's another thing that kind of bites
you
so some of the benefits of our choice
the way we ended up doing it is one we
do get closer engagement with our
development teams right because we're in
the stream teams because we're in the
iteration planning meetings because
we're in the stand-ups you know we are
interfacing with devs in a much higher
rate than we ever have before
and development is interfacing with
operations a lot more you know it's
always kind of looked at from one side
in terms of like what Ops is getting
from it but development gets quite a bit
of benefit too because now they sort of
have this contact person that they can
get the access that we've probably
grumpily denied in the past there's a
renewed focus on alerting and monitoring
now that we've got a single team that's
sort of responsible for this product
from beginning to end there's this new
focus on like well how is this app
performing right and it goes beyond just
CPU utilization and memory utilization
it goes into things like you know how
many orders per second are we doing you
know how long is it taking to fulfill an
order these sort of businessing metrics
that help shape and provide context for
how the services are performing that are
more than just like oh we're at 40% CPU
utilization right what does that mean
from a business impact standpoint it
doesn't mean anything
so having sres on the team having Devon
Ops work together one it gives sres an
avenue to kind of talk with developers
and say like hey what are the things
that we should be measuring and to it's
the same way the other way the
developers can say like hey you know I
don't know how the system performs
because I don't have access to your cool
tools give me the access so that we can
build this thing and make it run better
larger options for tool selection due to
ops staff being present early what I
mean by that is so I'm gonna give like a
little operational confession here
technology happens to us sometimes in
ops right like you're humming along
you're doing great you know you're
you've got all types of monitoring on
your my sequel database and then someone
says you know we've got a new product
coming in that's going to run Couchbase
and it's gonna have no js' front-end and
it's gonna be awesome here it is when
that happens to you your knee-jerk
reaction to say oh no no way not gonna
happen now going to do it I'm gonna give
you all these reasons why I guarantee
you and nine times out of ten if you
move that conversation nine months
earlier where the code is really just on
the back of a napkin and you say hey
Jeff we're thinking about using
Couchbase and nodejs I'd be like man I
just read a blog post about that that's
awesome let's do it it's the difference
between yay or nay from an operational
perspective so we're finding that
developers feel a lot more comfortable
coming up and saying like hey there are
some different tools that we want to use
here's why we want to use them let's
figure out what we need to do in order
to make that happen and a lot of times
from an operational perspective it's
like sure here are the things that we
need to do or address in order to do
that we know it upfront so that when it
gets to production everything is tooled
out the way it needs to be and ops and
dev are happy and ultimately it's a
reduction of us versus them right
because there is no us or them because
we're all sitting in the same quad right
sharing the same pizza sharing the same
jokes sharing the same crappy Wi-Fi
yeah cuz sometimes there's always that
belief right like Ops has better Wi-Fi
than us because they own it not true
ours is terrible too now that's the good
stuff
the bad and the ugly it's not too
terrible but there are some
organizational issues that come up one
of them being from an ops perspective
even though we've sort of taken our sres
and embedded them into the stream teams
there are a ton of things that ops are
still responsible for that the
development and product teams
I mean honestly they don't really care
about in the long term right that's it
they don't care about it that sounds
terrible but like it's tough to say hey
you know that really cool feature you
wanted to implement and you need me to
you know two hours a week for I can't do
that because I have to patch LDAP right
that's not really something that
development teams want to hear because
that's not really in their purview of
the things that they're responsible for
so we find that there are there was a
bit of tugging war in terms of resources
because even though we said hey you're
gonna have a bunch of dedicated
resources and reality they're not
dedicated they're partially dedicated
pseudo dedicated that looks terrible the
other piece is incident management now
developers are starting to help a lot
more with incident management but that
doesn't remove the fact that Ops is
largely interrupt-driven when it comes
to managing production right so how as a
developer do you plan your sprint if you
need the sre resource knowing that at
any point he could be pulled away and
forced to work on another issue right
these aren't insurmountable things
they're just things that you need to
figure out like how are we going to deal
with that how are we going to prioritize
these things
the constant context switching also
becomes difficult right because now
people are serving two masters right the
s re the OP staff is responsible one to
the development team and because they're
part of that team they don't want to let
the team down they want to make sure
they're meeting their deadlines but
they're also responsible to me right and
I need to patch my sequel I need to
upgrade LDAP I need to do a PCI on it so
that context switching tends to create a
lot of friction how do you address that
well you know you address it through
planning but if you don't know that
going into it you kind of think like oh
I've got this dedicated resource and
life is going to be great and it's not
so that's something that we've had to
deal with as well we've largely
addressed it through having a separate
operational planning meeting so that we
can lay out all of the things that Ops
needs to get done and we have an
opportunity to weigh those against the
things that the product team has to get
done so you know it's basically a large
meeting with all the team leads we
basically say here are the things that
we want to get done you guys say the
things that you need done we'll
prioritize together that way we're
making a decision based on the needs of
the business and we move forward from
there or then sometimes the meeting is
empty and it's like okay I guess nothing
needs to be prioritized I'll have my fun
with it
priorities a term that keeps coming up
not really bothered that priority
actually has a plural form right like
doesn't make any sense when you think
about it it should be priority it period
one singular but we live in a world with
priorities so who sets the priorities
right where does that come from
does it come from ops does it come from
the dev team I told you how we sort of
addressed that we need to balance the
ops work intake with the team velocity
what I mean by that is as the stream
teams start to do their
planning meetings right we have to be
cognizant that Ops has a bunch of stuff
that they need to get done too so we
need to make sure and that's my job
largely used to say okay I can't
overload these guys with too much
operations work because he has he or she
has a bunch of product work that also
needs to get done so being aware of that
balance and being you know very in tune
with the team leads is very very
important in order to be successful
because you have to understand what it
is that they're putting out for work and
what it is that you're putting in the
queue for work or out staffs needed for
every team my knee-jerk reaction is yes
seeing the difficulty I've had in hiring
I go maybe not right there there are
some teams whose work specifically in
like you know the the amount of
production stuff that they're shipping
out doesn't warrant a full-time op staff
member so in that case we basically give
them half time or we have an engagement
process so that when they do need a
resource they know who to contact so
that we can assign a particular resource
to address their needs they're typically
happy because they're like well you know
we don't need a guy taking up a chair
that isn't really you know helping the
team out we don't want someone sitting
in iteration planning meeting you know
90 minutes a week that's not getting
anything out of it so being aware of how
your teams are leveraging the sre
resources is very important dedicated
resources leads to poor planning right
because you assume that this person is
always going to be available that's not
always the case
it's problematic you have to still plan
for these resources and coordinate
appropriately now it's still a boon
because you have this dedicated person
that you go to and you know who to ask
and who to talk to and the way we
typically structure it is like you know
you go the team leads or anyone on the
team goes to the SRE
and if the yes area has a conflict he
escalates if not he or she can mediate
it right there and figure out what to do
next
so when the DevOps line is blurred when
you start moving into DevOps you know
you start to talk about sometimes you
hear about the model you build it you
run it right that's the idea that a
product team is responsible for a
solution all the way from code commit to
production deploy into monitoring but if
you're coming from a traditional
organization you've probably lived in a
world where it's like dev has no access
to production right we don't really do
that we're available for like second and
third level support if you need it but
largely that's on you guys that doesn't
always work in a DevOps environment
because essentially you've got this new
team member and you tell her like hey
you're joining the team you're part of
the team you're one of us you're the
only one on call see how that goes over
right look it doesn't go over well but
at the same time you got to look at it
from the development perspective or
they're like you know I kind of went
into dev so I wasn't on call so you have
to figure out what that balance looks
like but the other thing you have to
figure out is how do you give that
person the developer production access
because nothing I mean nothing is more
infuriating than getting paged at 2:00
in the morning
and not having access to do a damn thing
to help right can I look at this no I
can't see it because I don't have access
to production can I fix this no I really
can't because I don't have access to
production
that was weird they found it ok sweet
maybe they're just checking the lock so
yeah so that's something that you have
to address the way that we are
attempting to address it is basically
through instrumenting the hell out of
everything right push as many metrics as
many types of changes that you need to
do through some automation tool and try
to automate and try to audit that
automation toolset right we were just
having a conversation outside Steve and
another guy from a Braintree about this
new script that came out for ec2
instances that basically will flag an
ec2 instance if someone has logged into
it so you get a special tag on it so
we're going to be implementing that to
basically say Oh someone has logged into
this box for some reason let's run a
report let's find out why that person
had to log into that box so that we can
ask them what did you need to
dude that was on the box that you
couldn't do through another tool right
why couldn't you do it in Splunk why
couldn't you do it through data dog why
wasn't there a Jenkins job from there we
can kind of build up our repertoire of
tools for the common types of activities
that we do on a regular basis or
hopefully not so regular if it's an
incident but it's something that you
have to build and you're not going to
know everything day one so you're gonna
have to slowly iterate over it right so
don't beat yourself up when you're like
oh man we got to keep logging into the
box takes time this is muscle memory
right that's the first thing people do I
remember when we first implemented
Splunk
people were still doing X term windows
with seven sessions and broadcasting to
the terminal it's like dude you Splunk
source type of patchy access all the
servers are queried done takes a while
to get rid of that muscle memory and if
you've been in a traditional work for a
while I could see that being problematic
but when it comes to production asset
access you have another series of
problems that crops up - I love this
picture I absolutely love it
DevOps unicorn crapping all over
security right and that's what happens
if you're not careful right it's so easy
to why and just so you know I just threw
this in here cuz look this is hilarious
I gotta figure out something to talk
about this but but I sent it to our
chief of security too because I was like
this is pretty much what you've been
telling me right as we build up these
tools as we build up the assualt amasian
as we let the floodgates loose on
developers being able to help access and
manage production we have to think about
security right because that's still a
thing right audits are still a thing and
nothing is worse than when your security
guys like alright we got to do a no my
goodness what is going on with this
access login these servers right that's
what my security guy means and he's like
you guys are just crapping out rainbows
but I've got to shovel it up so you want
to keep that in the back of your mind
when you're out sort of automating these
things how is that going to tie into my
other processes specifically around the
Wolves of the audit right audits are a
fact of life they happen and they can
add complexity to DevOps workflows
mainly around like things like
you've sort of built a lot of our
organizations around the idea of
separation of duties right how many of
you heard that why you couldn't have
access to a server hey man you can't do
that separation of duties man you can't
write code and deploy it that's crazy
man that's that's crazy we don't do that
well we do that now right but how do we
address the audit concerns around that
how do we prove that you know this
deploy that we did was qaid by someone
other than the developer and those are
things that you kind of have to think
about in terms of your your tooling and
your tool chain right how many guys have
changed management in your environment
and how many of your deploys are under a
change management right so what do you
do right our answer has been automated
as much as possible right so we've tried
to define the workflow and as you define
the workflow we automate the hell out of
the workflow then we put the tools that
automate that workflow through change
management so if you make a change to
the tool set that's the thing that has
to go into change management but if
you're deploying and you're following
the standard tool chain those deploys
can just go now you got to work with
security to figure out what those
requirements are right because as much
as we like go through the process of
creating the ticket security doesn't
really care about the actual ticket they
want to care about the process that was
behind the ticket so we thought we had
to win we're like hey we're
automatically creating JIRA tickets done
no no no you know how do I know that
this was tested how do I know that it
was tested by someone other than the
developer how do I know that this isn't
a financial audit scope application and
what what deployment path has to change
as a result of that so work closely with
security to get an understanding of what
it is that you need to do in order to
meet that bar and honestly security
loves it right I thought it was gonna be
a nightmare my security guys like yeah
yeah you can automate all of that and we
can put a process around the changes I'm
all for it bend over backwards to help
me out he was willing to write code
which is scary because he doesn't code
but he was like I'll do it man he's a
full stack overflow developer
the other last one is probably the
biggest one right
your audit controls right so many people
go to the web and figure out what other
people are doing for their audit and
then they regurgitate that in their
audit controls you know what auditors
care about you say what you do you do
what you say that's it right so if you
don't need fingerprint verification for
every deploy don't put it in your
document right think about what it is
that you really need to address and your
audit and document it appropriately work
with dev work with ops work with SEC and
just say what you do and then do what
you say it's that simple
we've had in the past so many crazy
controls were reliable this is security
theater right here I mean this isn't
really adding any value he says we'll
take it out like oh we can do that yeah
you just can't do it during the audit
okay cool
things are moving a lot smoother be wary
of the third silo just don't do it don't
do it don't create the DevOps team I'm
begging you don't do it in fact I was on
a mission to destroy the DevOps engineer
role in my company every time I saw it
posted I was like no we're not calling
it a DevOps engineer I ultimately lost
because marketing won right so now we
have the same job posting posted three
times as a DevOps engineer as a site
reliability engineer as a systems
engineer why because that's what people
are searching for okay but when it comes
to the actual organization try to kill
it with fire if you see that third silo
forming up you want to know why because
it happens exactly as you think it would
happen
everyone kind of steps back oh well
that's DevOps this thing right that's
not us we're not responsible for that
dev and ops together leave it at that
the DevOps team also further
concentrates that sort of responsibility
kind of like I was just mentioning the
the the DevOps team starts taking on
like all of this automation stuff and
the other bit of that is a lot of that
stuff is the cool things in the field
right now in the industry right and you
can build a lot of resentment when you
have a
third silo and it's like oh no no they
do the AWS stuff they do the automation
stuff you just rotate backup logs and
you know I don't know get alerted when
the disk fills up that's not fun it's
not fun for anybody so you see the third
silo starting to form
kill it with fire oh yeah and the other
thing ownership of production
environment is even murkier right
because I'm not gonna let someone tool
out the entire process and then step
away like well it's not me if things
went bad all right sorry that deploy
crash call the other silo that's their
thing now nope
choosing a toolset so this is this is
controversy only thing with DevOps we
get so hung up in tools right you got
docker Jenkins ec2 we have all these
blog posts coming at us about all these
magical things that Google and Facebook
are doing right you're not Google you're
not Facebook unless you are but you're
probably not anyone at Google scale here
no didn't think so so reading about how
Google solves their problems while it's
interesting bathroom reading probably
not something you want to take back and
be like hey we need to implement this
because we're getting at least 120 hits
a second we need to be able to scale
dynamic calm down
solve your problems right so when you're
choosing your tool set make sure you
keep that in mind well what problem am i
solving for my company right what are my
organization's problems right you could
implement docker with kubernetes with
dynamic you know scaling auto scaling
groups but if you really just need to
manage sudoers better right there's
easier ways to do that commit to
iteration - you're not gonna nail it the
first time you're not it's easy to think
like oh man we're behind the curve
everyone's story is different everyone's
organization is different everyone's
gonna work at their own pace as long as
you're getting better that's the thing
that's awesome right one day you're
gonna sit back and you're gonna realize
like I remember maybe six months ago we
had in the outage it wasn't even an
outage
we had a degradation in service right
that lasted 15 minutes and we're all on
fire trying to figure out what happened
how did we not get alerted to this
sooner
what type of KPIs would have assisted
with this and then you stopped anything
and you're like man your and a half ago
this thing would have been down for 30
minutes and customer care would have
called us and told us like hey diners
aren't getting XYZ all right if you do
that iteration slowly you find yourself
in another place you're always making
yourself better and before you realize
you're gonna look back and you're gonna
not even recognize the past year like
how did we let that stand that's that's
insane so don't feel like you have to do
everything at once because the other
catch with that too is it prevents you
from making any progress well we can't
do this because we don't have elastic
auto scaling groups and we can't do that
because we don't have KPI metrics so
we're just gonna sit on our hands and do
nothing nope if it's something that's
tiny you know like oh here's this
service that we have to restart every
other week right automate that build on
that build on your successes makes a
huge difference and try to find quick
wins right try to find little things
that you can do today because you'd be
surprised at how the little hurdles that
you face quickly add up to become big
things so if you can find little things
to kind of help build that momentum
you'll get everyone on board everyone
moving in the same direction and it's
awesome but the biggest thing is to
solve your own problems please please
please
sometimes I wish Google and Facebook
would just stop writing blog posts
addressing skill set gaps is another key
area that that we're working through
still we've come a long way already but
they're still you know places where
we've got people that have come from
traditional ops environments right and
there may not be developers or maybe
that the bane that beacon they may not
be accustomed to infrastructure as a
code or the software development
lifecycle these people are still
valuable right like don't think you need
to retool your entire organization right
people can learn these are smart folks
so you just need to figure out where
your gaps are and address them
appropriately and the the field is so
vast so vast that
everyone doesn't have to be a hardcore
developer right everyone doesn't have to
be a hardcore performance engineer right
people can find their niches and provide
value to the team in those particular
areas so one thing that we did that
really helped was we had to choose a
common programming language for the
operational type of work that we were
going to do
we're predominantly a Java shop right
the idea of building tools for
operations in Java made me gag literally
they were like well we could you know so
we rallied around Python so now that
we've kind of chosen a common tool set
we're able to build libraries after we
build those libraries people can consume
those libraries and then it ends up
building sort of a natural order of
skill sets right we've got our most
senior engineers building libraries that
can be consumed and utilized by the
folks that are just learning right so if
you're coming into it and you're just
starting to learn Python you don't have
to wrestle these complex things like oh
well how am I going to dynamically fetch
data out of our key value store well
there's a library that's gonna do that
for you don't worry about it
we'll get you there eventually and then
you also have code that people can
review to sort of learn about you know
our particular style of how we do things
the other benefit to choosing a common
programming language is is easier
adoption in general right and it's much
easier to find resources when you
actually need to hire so now when we
hire we're like up if you have a
language if it's Python that's the bomb
right easy we don't have to worry about
well you know he's good in Ruby but not
good and go but he's kind of okay in
Perl Python is our language of choice if
you feel comfortable switching to Python
and you know that's that's also fair
game but the direction is clear
we also have to start hiring a little
bit differently for ops now that Ops is
becoming more of a broader skill set it
might be worthwhile to bring in people
from different areas as part of the
interview process right have someone
from dev interview ops folks right have
a DBA interview someone from ops right
get an idea of where this person
skillset lies because I think it was
charity majors that said you're looking
for t-shaped Engineers right broad in a
bunch of areas but deep in one area and
you may not have the skill set on your
team specifically to figure out where
that person goes deep but knowing that a
person is capable of going deep says a
lot about their capabilities for
learning for progressing and for
assimilating into your environment make
sure that you emphasize the common
language that's being chosen right
because you don't want someone to come
in and then me like you know alright
well I know we're using Python but you
know this Erlang thing is baboom how do
I get everyone to switch to that nope
make sure it's clear and upfront in the
interview process and also put an
emphasis on the development mindset
right doesn't mean they have to be a
rock star coder but make sure that they
understand the concepts right make sure
that they're on board with testing right
testing that's gonna be a big thing that
we're going to need devs to help ops out
with we'll get into that in a second but
just make sure they're on board with the
philosophy and the method of doing
things because it'll make the
integration with Devon ops so much
easier if everyone's on the same page
training isn't enough either we always
say like oh you know we'll train these
guys to do a thing right and somehow
that time just never magically forms you
have to commit to it right you have to
say like you know we are going to give
you this thing to do and we're gonna
make you responsible for it that's where
the motivation comes from that's where
we find the time to make these things
happen if it's just a goal at the
beginning of the year that says oh learn
Python it doesn't happen
same thing with development right if we
say you know you have to have a better
systems understanding you're not going
to get that systems understanding
through osmosis right you probably won't
even get it through just reading
location is the sort of cement that
fuses these ideas and concepts and
allows you to actually execute them in
the production environment find mentors
right you guys can swap op staff can be
mentored by dev and vice versa works out
pretty good it also sort of like how
many are familiar with the concept of
imposter syndrome right so I have
chronic impostor syndrome and what
impostor syndrome is it's basically the
idea that you have difficulty
internalizing your own successes right
so you're constantly in fear that you're
going to be called a fraud you're gonna
get called out right that imposter
syndrome is more prevalent than people
realize but it's also a barrier to
asking questions right so when you have
that sort of cross mentorship it gives
someone the comfort knowing that oh this
guy's asking me questions that he
doesn't know now I feel comfortable
asking him questions that I don't know
okay so training isn't enough make sure
you find a project that you guys can
actively work towards not everyone is a
developer not everyone is an OPS person
again remember that people have
different skills and those skills are
valuable and they can still be leveraged
and be successful in part of the team
right help team members get out of their
wheelhouse when possible right if
there's something that they're just
completely not comfortable with and
they've never tried it you know given
them something small to kind of play
with maybe they find out it isn't their
cup of tea right but at least now you
know as opposed to just some inane fear
that has existed since you know C++ 101
right and remember that emotions are
important we talk a lot about hug ops
and DevOps right but I think one of the
biggest things that attracted me to the
community is the sort of empathy that's
projected and discussed right we're
talking about actual human beings with
actual feelings actual emotions and you
have to take that into account not only
just during through your DevOps
transformation but as a culture in
general because once you build empathy
it makes teamwork so much easier Google
actually put out a study that basically
said team members that are most
effective are ones
are jerks essentially be nice to each
other
everyone's trying to do the best they
can
right all we can do is kind of help them
get along there all right
the journey DevOps is hard and your
journey will differ from others but it's
totally worth it so as you go out as you
start these transformations in your
organization's
make sure you're talking to other people
make sure you're engaged in your
community ask questions because chances
are someone has encountered that same
problem that you have be empathetic make
sure you're treating everyone with
respect make sure you understand that
everyone is in a different place so
don't give that you know Schneider mark
like oh you're still using classic ASP
it's not like I want to use classic ASP
I don't have a choice right that's just
where I'm at right now so keep that in
mind and just be good to each other
that's it
thanks very much that was awesome
I still have impostor syndrome as well
so yeah so questions you talked about
Python as your core language what about
the case where bash or similar would be
simpler faster or better so you know
modulo your your slider which is like
all tools suck right yeah so yeah we
actually have that same conversation and
we avoid like Perl or other languages
like that it's pretty much the choice
between bash and Python and basically my
bar is if I need any form of complex
data structure Python pretty simple
right like oh you need an array no not
in bash yeah yeah okay that's the only
other question we've gone here does
anyone have any questions like in person
without sliding into a keyboard yeah
right well can you repeat the question
please
yeah so the question was as in his
organization development is largely
responsible for a lot of the OP stats
and ops is sort of like a second-class
citizen how do we go about elevating the
OP staff to have an equal seat at the
table I guess the first question is do
you guys have any outages at all because
I feel like OPS's value unfortunately is
usually brought about when there's an
outage and there's some heroic efforts
the other day our CEO came to me and he
was like oh Jeff yeah I heard you I'm
taking a short sabbatical and he said oh
I heard you're taking a sabbatical and I
just wanted to chat with you real quick
of course I know you from all the
outages and it's like wow ah right like
I want to be the fire marshal I don't
want to be the firefighter right so
those outages is is the opportunity that
op should cease to have a seat at the
table and say like here are the things
that we could have done better earlier
in the process that would have prevented
the need for these heroic efforts right
so you know the fire fire marshal versus
firefighter so you you keep sort of
driving those points home and eventually
someone's gonna realize like you know
this issue happened before and we didn't
address that maybe we need to get ops at
the table sooner maybe we need to get
ops at the table earlier and once you
start getting involved in the process
earlier ops becomes invaluable
especially when ops starts adding
insight that developers hadn't thought
of simply because the mindset is
different
thanks Jeff really enjoyed this session
I have two question for you it seems
like your organization is but would you
consider your organization as a center
of excellence for DevOps that works
between tech ops and engineering I'm
trying to understand how do you have
your organization take DevOps and their
methodology to the next level by
learning what happens in engineering and
how that flow between both of those
organization and my second part of
question was what capacity you keeping
for your organization or your members to
elevate themself to the next level is it
50/50 where they do work for a
development team 50% and 50% for
operation I will stop there
Thanks all right so a couple things do
we consider ourselves a center of
excellence you know I don't know that
I've ever put that label on us just
because I feel like we're maybe it's my
imposter syndrome I feel like we're
always in our infancy in this process
right so we're always iterating we're
always trying to get better I feel like
we are a center of excellence in our
effort to be better but there's always
room for improvement right so I think
it's important to generate a feedback
loop with your staff with your
development teams to understand what are
we doing bad that we can do better
where are the things where we're not
meeting your expectations and vice-versa
so that we can continuously work towards
making that better in terms of your
second question I believe the question
was what are we doing to sort of enhance
our skill set right and what capacity do
we have for that so we're fortunate in
that our CEO comes from a very technical
background and he has a strong
commitment to learning so we have this
concept called learning Fridays where
basically every Friday they come in they
cater lunch and they say from you know
10th from 9 o'clock to noon get anything
that you need wrapped up from the pre
from the previous week done and then
from noon to the rest of the day to your
time learn tinker
come up with solutions that the company
might be able to use but it's your time
to kind of learn and grow your skillset
any way that you see fit and it's a
phenomenal opportunity because you know
one not a lot of organizations have it
but two not a lot of organizations have
it with the full support of the CEO who
basically came in and said listen guys I
didn't realize we had stopped doing this
we're gonna start doing this again I'm
gonna tell all the product managers that
they only get your time Monday through
Thursday so that's sort of a huge
commitment from the organization how you
do that in other orgs it's tough right
you really have to build the time in and
make sure that your management is
protecting that time because it's very
easy to get that time taken from you
yeah you mentioned that you had tried or
you you'd seen you had experience with
integrating Ops directly into the
reporting structure of developers
delivering products can you elaborate a
little bit more on where the challenges
are with that and what do you think
about potentially like having two
classes of operations where half is in
that reporting structure and then
there's kind of more global operations
that can work with them but is more
global for the whole organization right
right so good question
so the initial experience with with
integrating the team was largely on the
whiteboard right because we said all
right if we start integrating these
teams who is going to take these
functions at the sre group currently has
so a little background you know GrubHub
is about 10 years old now or maybe 12
and they started small scrappy startup
right so it's like everyone did
everything as we started to form in
operations groups you know the stuff
that would typically be held by an IT
organization was held by the sres
so when we started coming up with DevOps
we say well if we integrate these folks
how do we you know consciously put LDAP
support on the plate of a product team
so that's sort of what led to this
hybrid split that we have today the
other thing was we wanted to make sure
that the systems engineers and this
might show the
sort of hedging our bets we wanted to
make sure that the systems that
engineers had a mechanism for escalating
issues out of their reporting structure
ie you know hey there's this horrible
SSL bug we've got to stop everything and
implement the fix
well my incentives are a little
different and I need to get this product
out so the question was like how do we
make sure that they have an avenue to
escalate outside of that and that's
ultimately what led us to where we are
in terms of your other question with the
second operations thing yes that's a
thing we actually still technically have
that in our environment we have a group
that we call grub ops which is basically
our NOC and they are largely responsible
for the legacy system that we are
migrating away from so they are in a
support function for that and they serve
almost exactly like you were saying
where they're an Operations arm but
they're really not involved with the
day-to-day product stuff they're not
part of the scrum we were trying to
build that bridge from sre to grub ops
but I have effectively called it out to
my management as a third silo that needs
to be eliminated I think the the best
opportunity would be to also integrate
that group into the stream teams or into
the sres or or use them as junior
developer junior engineers right so we
say all right well we're gonna pair each
one of you grub ops folks with an SRE
and that'll be your mentor and we'll
essentially serve use it as a pipeline
ok that's unfortunately all we have time
for thanks very much Jeff thank you
