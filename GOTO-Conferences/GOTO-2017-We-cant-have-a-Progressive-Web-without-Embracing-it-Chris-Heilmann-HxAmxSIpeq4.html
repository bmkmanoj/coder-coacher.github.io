important that we have recordings of
these talks because there's a lot of
people that need this information that
we do here but they cannot afford a
ticket or they cannot afford going to
another city but they can't afford
looking watching YouTube so I think it's
very very important that we that we
share the knowledge that we have not
only to the people who are here but to
the world as a whole cause that's where
people learn things and I think the
Internet is one of the best resources
for that and we're not using it enough
the amount of views that I see on
conference talks is so minimal just sent
this stuff around tell people about it
showing your company we as speakers we
live for that we're sad lonely people we
we want people to know about what we're
doing okay so we're ready for this so
thanks very much for showing up I got 40
minutes which a lot of slides and I'm
happy to answer any questions later on
as well so I'd be around for a while I'm
talking about progressive web apps here
today and I was fascinated that when I
had conversations in the hallway here
people were just rule was progressive
web apps because I've been a lot of a
front-end conferences where it's the
topic for the last two years and
everybody talks about it so I want to
explain today what progressive web apps
bring to you and how to build them but
I'm not going to do live coding because
there's 10,000 courses out there that
teach that to you much better and the
resources of that will be available in
the slides afterwards and on my Twitter
feed and whatever so first of all I'm
Chris Hyneman and my big fan of the
Internet I'm code poet on Twitter if you
need pictures of hedgehogs kittens and
JavaScript and advice that's a good
place to follow me there's a lot of
tweets people accuse me of having people
that actually treat for me no it's
really me I just have a mobile with me
all the time and this is the great thing
about the internet nowadays that we can
do it from wherever weird that people
asked us to actually work in an office
and move to a certain city to work for
them right could be possible that way so
the web is not doing too well right now
I gave a keynote in Sweden about this
way I pretended to be a psychologist
that introduced the depressed internet
don't know why my partner said it's a
good idea but there's so many problems
that are going on with the web right now
they're censorship
of course that's bullying from people on
social media they're trolling of people
of social media does malware that is
happening with just a click of a button
and their surveillance people basically
tracking you people looking at you and
their security issues of course which is
kind of going into the malware thing but
a lot of things are just not secure and
people are not caring enough for T end
users data to keep them secure and of
course the biggest problem to me is
obesity and not obesity of the people
doing the internet stuff but the
Internet itself there's a great website
called HTTP archive where you can see
the average size of a website nowadays
and this is what's happening here we got
1.4 megabyte of a of website data along
with this images a lot of it is
JavaScript a lot of it is like fonts and
video and I don't know how we came to
get there when I started with the
internet I love that everything was
small immediate and I get the
information that I need but we don't
have that any longer nowadays just
because of developer convenience and
because of other business reasons we put
as much as we can into every website
that we have out there and if you think
about it if you go to another country
like I am right now and I'm on data
roaming and my your website cost me as
much as a ticket to the cinema it better
be as exciting and most of them they are
not most of them are just pushing things
in my face that I don't need and hiding
the information that I really came for
so considering our users this is
worrying because a long time ago we
moved away from desktop machines to
laptops to mobile phones all new users
are mostly on mobile devices
of course there's desktop machines for
b2b systems there's like all the things
that you have to use like room booking
systems expense systems that are much
more fun on desktop but the most of the
new end users are gonna be on mobile
devices and we're losing them because
kids nowadays don't care about the
internet too much on their mobile phones
they use snapchat and I still don't know
what snapchat does I try to understand
it all the time but I'm like okay what
are you doing here this is just bizarre
is any videos of yourself that go away
and ok fair enough
I mean they make money so I'm happy with
that but it's just to me it's
fascinating that that resource the
internet that I love to bid and I've
been working on for 20
years is going away and people don't see
the appreciation of it anymore and don't
understand that it is actually a great
gateway for somebody who cannot afford
education or has a country where they
don't educate you enough where they can
learn things that they don't know about
I remember cycling to the cycling to the
library and reading books when I was a
kid
nowadays I could open my laptop and find
all the information that I want instead
I watched 15 episodes of Game of Thrones
so the web the problem with a web post
way because that happened is the web
wasn't ready for the mobile form factor
it was actually made for the desktop web
for the desktop environment it was made
to be linked documents from different
universities talking to each other so
what we had is like the mobile was a
throwback to the web of old out of a
sudden we had really small screens bad
connectivity and unreliable browser
support this is what my job was in 2001
where it's a resolution was 640 by 480
internet explorer say 5 or 6 or even 4
was the browser that people used and I
had a pretty good connection to the
Internet and this is what we now have on
mobile devices still and mobile devices
it seemed worse because the connectivity
changes every millisecond no matter
where you actually walking you might not
have connectivity or you have things
like Wi-Fi that pretends to be there and
then you can a connector if you don't
have a key and you don't have access to
it and paid for it and so on and so
forth
you've constantly changing conditions
your phone is out of battery your career
you're in a train you don't even know
how connected you are and there's
hardwired browser and hardware with
unpredictable upgrades that was the
biggest problem with older Android
devices that came up with a browser that
should not have happened
and then basically I'd wire to the
operating system when your new operating
system was not available for your phone
you got stuck with a browser that was a
sad excuse for a browser for the next 50
years to come and let's not forget that
not everybody buys new mobile phones all
the time or is on a contract where they
get new mobile phones all the time
when I was in India when I was in Africa
I see people buying secondhand phones I
see people in England even one of the
most well for now richest countries out
there that where people buy second-hand
phones and give it to their kids because
if they drop that one in the toilet is
not as much of a problem with the
narrator dollar iPhone so these things
are
going away and it started committee well
if you remember when Steve Jobs in 2007
said you've got everything you need you
know how to write apps using the most
modern web standards to write amazing
apps for the iPhone today Steve Jobs was
all about the web was all about html5
was all about CSS and doing cool stuff
in the browser and then he died and
Apple realized as a different story to
the whole thing is much easy to make
money by controlling people them and
other people as well so when you go to
websites nowadays a lot of websites are
just a thinly veiled advertising with
lots and lots of videos and images for
like please contact the App Store and
download our iOS app or Android app even
this conference has an app I don't want
your app I've been at 23 conferences
already this year I don't want to have
23 apps on my phone and I have to delete
two days later that is 50 Meg of data
that is really easily displayed in HTML
easily displayed in a browser and even
available offline to you
interestingly Forbes had said like when
because Steve Jobs was against the app
market it was basically really against
the the the App Store and then Forbes
said that in 2014 that the biggest
blunder of what he said became the
biggest moneymaker for Apple I will see
you are elder you can read that up I try
to read that up but instead I get this
a quote of the day that has nothing to
do with the thing it was on Cyber Monday
so please buy more stuff because
obviously they don't have enough and out
of a sudden might mice and started
running on my computer and I didn't know
what was going on and then I looked at
it cause I'm a developer and I look at
stuff and it's a 902 word article which
is cool that it has actually nice length
of the article used to work in radio the
journalist is the kind of thing I would
write but it's actually nine point one
megabyte of data it has 522 HTTP
requests and if anything we set into
performance in the last ten years is
like every HTTP request is hurting your
users and yourself make sure you have as
few HTTP requests as possible
it has 52 point four eight second load
time so I really really needed to be
excited about this article because
normally people after three seconds on a
mobile phone go away or wonder if their
if their phone is broken and start
complaining about Android or iOS or all
the phone providers and then under the
page when I saw that there's from the
web there's this stuff that I didn't
come from that is in that page and
there's great stuff in there that I
really never cared about but it's like
obviously they get money from that and
the thing that started the fan and also
started speaking to me out of a sudden
and I thought I had like an FMEA
expression to God or something no I was
just an ad for Barclays where somebody's
talked over and I didn't even find that
until I scrolled for like 15 seconds
that there's an auto playing video
interrupting my experience of that news
article now I don't want to I don't want
to harp on Forbes but they were wrong
and then of course when you have any
when you are a security concerned person
like me you have an browser extension
running that tells you just how many
more people are seeing right now what
I'm reading and there is one called net
beam from Microsoft from Mozilla that
when I worked at Mozilla I worked on
that one and there I now know that 41
different websites get my data and are
listening in on me at the moment while
I'm reading this I don't know who they
are I don't know what they do with my
data I don't know if they actually
access my history of my browser I don't
know if they access my form validation
fields that are in there but
this is what people do nowadays and
we're like hey to read this please click
on these and please allow us to set
cookies on your machine so it came on
the publishers dilemma to a degree
because on the web users are in control
I can turn off all your ads I can turn
off JavaScript I can turn off your
images I can make the thing really break
but I'm not a person that does that
because I need to I might be a person
who's blind who actually cannot see the
stuff if you add it in the way and you
didn't make a way for a keyboard to get
rid of this modal dialogue I might be a
person that is on a slow connection in
Bangladesh Africa India that uses a
proxy browser that deletes all the stuff
so at least I can get to the content I
might have turned on reader mode in
Firefox so I only get your text rather
than your 10,000 ads that I didn't want
and uses a condition to not pay for
things but find ways around that's the
biggest issue of the web for years we've
been saying like ok there's ways to make
this cheaper a you don't need to clear
Netflix there's a streaming website
which probably does everything to your
computer that can be done wrong but you
can watch the movies that are not
available in your country and people use
the web for piracy or like soft piracy
as I call it to get around with ways
that you don't pay for so we've been
conditioned that way because everybody
sold on the web with the concept of free
free free nothing is free you pay with
something you either pay with money you
pay with your data you pay with being
the training model for the next
artificial intelligence system that
they're using you're being you're
getting no free stuff here if you don't
pay for it don't trust it that's what I
started to think about and somehow you
have to pay the bills and as a publisher
you want to make sure you somehow get
money and people don't block your ads so
you don't get any money so let's try to
turn users into products to sell to
others this is the model of like every
social media platform out there they
record what you do they record what you
type they analyze your photos to analyze
the emotions of your photos and sell
them to other people so out of choice or
necessity people are starting to fight
this so they're using adblock they're
using a brave browser they're using
Opera Mini or they're using the the
puffin browser or do you see browser
browsers you never heard about and have
millions and millions of users in Africa
and in China and
in Russia where people need the Internet
to be faster of course so riot
famously enough said the web is dead and
that applications are the cool new thing
so publishers started to flock to
applications and also end-users started
to flock to applications because they
gave them a better experience on their
mobile devices and not 10000 ads you
have to click away before you read 900
words so first of all for publishers
apps control the look and feel there's
no chance that a user can resize the
font and make it readable for them
because your artists department didn't
want the fun to be differently sized so
you can control everything in an app
there's a revenue resource apps cost
money internet sites don't cost money
people that don't expecting to pay for
an internet site at all but with an app
we totally okay to pay for it and it was
simple to pay on an animal by device as
well you can control the distribution
you can remove them from the market or
only offer in certain regions that's
another thing that people always want to
have I've got a VPN that changes my
location every two minutes so people
don't know where I am on the planet but
I cannot read some of the content that
way because it says it's only in UK that
you can access this video that is 50
years old or something
it's got inbuilt obsolescence new
versions cost more so you cannot make a
new version of your website and ask
people for money but you can make Angry
Birds one two three four five and make
them to pay money every single time for
different ones that they want to use and
you control the environment everybody
more or less does iOS first and then
Android second for the same reason that
the web failed in terms of payments iOS
users are happy to spend money and
they're probably more affluent as well
Android users are the cheaper ones that
want everything for free and that's
sadly enough the truth I'm an Android
user but and the big fairy tale that
publishers got told that apps bring you
lots and lots of money and you're going
to be successful whereas the web gives
you in asset value of tiers and every
user will break your experience that you
so handful II crafted now there's a
reality check for publishers the pricing
is not working we got a pricing race to
the bottom $0.99 apps are the things
that sell anything that costs more
hardly ever sells and that's a really
really sad fact of the matter so all of
you give you a 99
sent up and then make the game really
really hard to play so you have to spend
money for upgrades all the time and then
before you know it you spend $50 on the
thing just to go to the next level
there's a lock into the marketplace with
its own rules and restrictions Apple can
totally take it up away without having
to tell you anything about it and you
have then to explain to your end-users
why your app is not available and you
don't even know sometimes why it's not
available revenue share with marketplace
and auth provider so every revenue that
comes in you have to give a percentage
to do as provider as well which is
really bad if it's $0.99 that comes in
for everyone every one of your
applications and updates are hard and
may be delayed to by the marketplace
rules so you have to wait 2 weeks for
your app to get upgraded so that's for
security hotfix
that's a real big issue and it turns out
that people don't want to be locked in
and people are starting to get away from
apps and stop using apps 90% at 94% of
every revenue comes from 1% of the
publishers and these publishers are
Google Facebook Apple and that's about
it as a game developer you've got like
two months where you can sell your game
then it's not interesting for kids any
longer and they're not going to download
it anymore this is harsh but it is
reality 80% of the users who download an
app failed to become active users and
I've seen it myself I try to thing out
it's too annoying I delete it I never
use it again I've got so many ghost apps
on my phone that don't do anything and
just take space away I actually have a
build of Android that tells me when I
have juiced an app for a few months and
asked me do you want to delete it
because obviously don't need it in a
purchase however the money is and these
are regulated by the platform and cost a
percentage 60% of apps in the Google
Play app store has never been downloaded
this is amazing isn't it but it's not
surprising my brother is a comic book
artist so it tries to be and I bought
him
I bought him a tablet and then I'm like
I wanted to paper buy him a nice an
Android tablet I want to buy him a nice
painting app try to look for painting
app or tablet painting app on the
Android stores like paint discs at
pendous elephant paid this ruby paint
this copyrighted character or that
copyrighted character it's basically
just people
 the AppStore with lots of lots of
apps that don't make any sense the
average user downloads less than three
apps per month half of the u.s.
smartphone users download 0 apps per
month and the reason is that we're busy
inside Facebook inside whatsapp inside
10,000 other social networks we don't
even use the other apps in longer we
play a game from time to time we read
books on Kindle we watch Netflix we
watch these kind of things but we don't
use your app we only use your app when
we need it and is it worth my time to
download 50 Meg of data just to use your
app when I need it I don't think so and
that's the biggest problem that we have
users throughout a lot of apps but
besides which ones they want to stop
using within the first three to seven
days the average app mostly loses its
entire user base within a few months so
that means new marketing round new new
features more money being spent on
getting people back to your app after
1.5 million apps in the Google Play
Store only a few thousand sustained
meaningful traffic and this is what it
looks like the first two days do you
have excitement and then it dies as
really really fast and you got to do the
classic marketing materials that's why I
see buses with ABD's ads for apps on the
side I never understood this and I wish
I could block them but that's what we
have users spend 80 percent of their
time using just five apps as I said
Facebook Google services map services
Gmail these kind of things and the
market is full of spatter scams spam and
senseless craft as well this was an
interesting research by how to geek that
to look for Windows Windows Office on
and on iOS in this case and on OS X and
in the marketplace you find like things
like the template packs which was like
150 mechdyne loads of templates for an
app that is not available for your
operating system
but somebody makes money by selling
those things so how can we fix this we
want happy users and ethical good
publishers who do get paid that's what I
want the Internet to be I published
eight books I wanted to get money for
that that's fine
it's ok to ask for money but we should
actually make it by asking for money in
a a cycle sense and not just like sell
ads or track our users and sell them to
other people and the answer is pwace
pwace is not programmers with attitudes
because i just wanted to do that picture
it's actually progressive web apps
native install friction block 74% of
potential customers before they ever see
your app this is what happens you go to
the website that you paint that you did
with whatever around to get people to
download your app they click on the
thing they go to the marketplace they're
asked to login they're asked to give
their credit card details they asked to
give a pine the blood and the name of
their firstborn
they're asked to chat to chant a certain
song and then they can download the app
then they download the app which might
break down because the connectivity is
bad so they have to resume downloading
the app then they install it then the
app tells them by the way we need your
email like why am i in the marketplace
that knows my email by the app asked me
to sign in again for the other thing why
is that not pulled through so there's a
great resource saying like for 2000
users of a thousand users that want to
get your app in the end you end up lucky
if you're lucky with 150 and shows where
they drop off in user testing when they
don't want to do it any longer so let's
go back to the web and with a twist
because the app model has half its
benefits as well it makes sense to have
a focused experience on a mobile device
rather than being inside a browser it
makes sense to have an app that does one
thing well rather than like being in a
tap next to 10,000 other browsers it
makes sense not to have to type anything
in but choose buttons rather than like
typing in a URL typing a URL under on a
mobile device was never fun so we got a
twist here we weren't ready to go out on
the web with mobiles
so we started to simulate native
environments with packaged applications
I worked on Firefox OS I worked on Web
OS and we had like Windows stuff as well
and Apple at their own stuff and Google
at their Chrome apps so instead of
creating websites that work well on
mobile we package them up and submitted
them to market places a lot of the apps
in the iOS marketplace and in the
Android store I actually just a Apache
Cordova apps which is like a webview
with an HTML document inside British
ours is my favorite I fly British
Airways all the time and I load the app
and then it says like oh by the way
their web site can't be loaded you're
likewise is an app you know why can't
why
could you tell me from the beginning of
the website is down at the moment rather
me starting the app again in a 1.1
comparison when native apps they looked
rubbish and that's really really bad and
that partly because we put too much
stuff on the web we built on on large
desktop machines with fat connections
and great computers and then wonder 1 a
mobile device the thing is slow and
doesn't work you buy a really really bad
Android connect to this thing debug on
that device test your systems on that on
a 3G connection well America you have 3G
everywhere so doesn't really matter but
it's much more important to see what
your end users are suffering rather than
you having a convenient life as a
developer we get paid to do this job we
should be able to contain a bit of
hardship that way that's because they
want MEP products there are native apps
built-in web technologies and we just
basically try to copy what native apps
did rather than embracing what the web
does interestingly enough the mobile web
browsing overtakes desktop browsing as
well a lot of people as I said surf on
the mobile device and don't understand I
think I got like 167 tabs open in my
Chrome on my Android device right now
because I just forgot to read them but I
opened them they're like cool I will
read it later that's fine it's which
would think back to my Chrome but I
don't do that so we're looking much
better these days than we did in the
past so all the functionality that we
needed native applications for like
battery status camera access device
orientation these kind of things these
are all available in w3c standardized AP
is now in the browser and in all of the
browsers I worked on free browsers in my
life and I my job is basically to make
them all play nice and not fight each
other on features that are only
available in one browser so let's think
about the mobile form factor what does
make sense on a mobile device the first
thing is to have a small initial payload
show the thing as fast as possible if
it's under a second you're good if it's
more you will lose people people are not
patient on mobile devices we're super
patient on desktop machines what are
mobile devices every second is like oh
my god something went wrong
so I probably need to reboot my machine
and whatever
form-factor supporting content don't
show like 15 columns next to each other
on a mobile device where it's no space
if you need a good example for that go
to the go to con chicago website on your
mobile device it's not fun form factor
supporting interfaces make sure that
your buttons are big because we've got
six fingers and we slow with them and
we're actually we are in a bad
environment where we don't see the
screen because like the Sun is coming
into you're not here but the Sun is
going on your mobile device in other
countries and you can't see it properly
so make sure you use high contrast make
sure the interface is as simple to use
on a mobile device as possible have
offline in flaky connection support and
this is a very very important thing if
the thing doesn't work offline it should
not be called an app
nobody wants an app that tells you all
the time you need to go online this
makes no sense why is it an app then
taking advantage of the power of the
end-user device these devices have great
machines in them they've got great GPUs
in them they've got storage
opportunities for you any site that is
not loaded over the web on a mobile
device is a winner so use local storage
use indexdb use web sequel if you don't
want happiness in your life look look at
look at storage solutions that actually
work across mobile platforms to actually
put as much as you can on the user's
device so they don't have to load it
again because they will be offline and
every time you give a user an offline
experience they're happy avoid
interaction latency make sure that the
hundred milliseconds 300 milliseconds
when you click on a button really happen
when you have a scrolling interface
don't simulate native scrolling use
native scrolling instead anything that
is a bit laggy on a mobile device people
get very and this is not working where's
my data going I don't want it I don't
want this I'm going to delete this so
when it comes to money the best way to
bend the retention curve is to target
the first few days of usage in
particular the first visit that way
users set up themselves for success so
all the apps the top 10 apps that
actually kept user retention did the
best things in the first few days and
showed new features in the first few
days and created new features and
created better functionality so the
faster you can you can inter you can
interact the faster you
can change your application and roll it
out the better and there's been there's
two weeks of waiting for iOS to tell you
okay you can do a new feature now this
is what killed all these native
applications so progressive Web Apps do
all of that for you
progressive web apps are nothing native
and nothing you need an environment for
and nothing you need to download Xcode
or Visual Studio 4 or something like
that all they are is HTML documents with
an application manifest and the new API
called service worker and I'm going to
explain what they are right now so the
first step is the web management the app
manifest the app manifest describes that
the document is an application and not
just an HTML document it defines to look
and feel full-screen color screen
orientation it allows you it asks you
which access you need to platform
specific functionality so you ask up
front ok this needs camera access this
needs these kind of things and it's
standardized version of older similar
approaches we did in Firefox OS really
webOS we did in Chrome OS but now it's a
w3c a defined JSON object that basically
is on the root of your server and tells
prospective search engines and
prospective operating systems this is an
application this is not an HTML document
so this is what it looks like you have a
name your the short name you get the
icons you have to start URL you have to
display standalone or display browser or
display whatever if you want to show the
browser Chrome or not it runs in the
browser of the operating system it or in
a web view basically so you set your
stack is HTML CSS and JavaScript and if
you haven't taken a look at what these
things can do nowadays there's hardly
anything that you cannot do with them
that you can do with native ones the
only thing is reading for example smart
cards or access to USB is a bit flaky
still but other than that you can do
almost everything in there a very
important part that I forgot about in
this slide deck is that to be to turn
your HTML document into an progressive
web app you need to have HTTPS this
thing needs to be able to secure on a
secure source because otherwise we
cannot give you access to the camera we
cannot give you access to geolocation
because any man-in-the-middle any proxy
any
internet hotel thing can actually read
along what you're doing with that so it
needs to be an HTTP resource and in
essence if you're running a server now
in 2017 on HTTP that is not encrypted
you're a terrible person and you should
be ashamed of yourself
I can tell you horror stories and I give
security talks about what I can do with
an HTTP server on an internet connection
in this hotel like this make sure you
keep your end-users secure with a ship
with an encrypted environment so there's
a great system by a friend of mine Nolan
that works with me called manifests
where you can put the URL and it creates
the it creates the manifest for you by
scraping what your HTML document has
already in there so if you want to start
from scratch you can actually do that
and get the information in there and
that one has been around for quite a
while even iOS had things like that
where you can define to get a get an
icon on the home screen when you put a
manifest file in there it wasn't
manifest file in iOS it was meta tags
inside your HTML document because while
make it easy and cacheable so it was
already there but the big breakthrough
is the serviceworker serviceworker is in
use is an api not new it's an API now
that is supported by most of the
browsers out there in one way or another
and I'm going to come back to that in
the end the big players there are Google
on Android a chrome on Android Firefox
on whatever and also the Samsung browser
is also very very supportive of it what
serviceworker in essence is is a proxy
that is scriptable with JavaScript so
it's an HTTP proxy that can do anything
that that HTTP can do for you and
anything JavaScript can do for you so
what you can do is you can read content
of the web and put it into caches you
can name caches that you put your
content in and these will be on the
device afterwards when the user is
coming back to your app and it's offline
available for them so instead of just
relying on browser caching which was
always like playing bingo or something
you basically define the caches by name
you can purge them you can update them
you can change them you can you can have
different caches for different
environments by reading out what the
environment is so if one browser
supports web P image
the other one doesn't create one cache
of web P images by converting them in
JavaScript to web P on the fly so
enthuses never need to know why the
thing is very actually faster out of a
sudden so it allows you to intercept
fetch requests and respond with cache
requests so instead of loading
everything from the web you'll load
everything first from the device once
it's been loaded there so the first time
you load a PWA it's the same experience
like any other website but as soon as
the serviceworker starts hitting you can
start loading more content in the
background and putting it into a
background cache for people to get next
time so you see what is this going this
is installing an application by using it
and not in a very in a very simple
manner instead of used instead of people
having to download upgrades all the time
and replace the binary on their device
they just go to the website and next
time they go there
the next version have already been
related loaded in the background is
available for them it also means that
you have atomic updates of your
application you don't need to create the
whole new application every time you can
just replace parts of it you don't have
to turn your whole website into a PWA
you can use a subdomain and only turn
that one into a PWA whether com is a
great example whether com the American
version is just a normal website the
international version is a PWA
because they realize that people in
india and places like that using weather
comm need a faster simpler version of it
so if you're not embracing the whole
idea of pwace yet you can try it with a
sub section of your website Expedia and
pocky would come do the same thing with
certain hotel bookings these kind of
things rather than the whole page you
can intercept push events as well so you
can actually push things in the
background to other servers you can
actually tell the user that something is
happening so you have notifications and
you have update notifications and tell
the user by the way there's a new
version of that you want to load it or
do you want to keep doing what you're
doing rather than like oh definitely
version you're basica shots and now I
should download everything like that you
want to have and you have sync and
periodic events as well so you can sync
content in the background without having
to wake up the application that's
another very important part the biggest
problem of the web in the past was your
have to think open to get data native
applications had background syncing and
background content pulling and the web
didn't have that now we have it with
serviceworker we can pull content in the
background only when it's needed and
available for the user next time when
they come so even when they don't use
your applications you can call you can
read the content in the background every
day or so to make sure that next time
they come to the application they don't
only get the state that they left it in
but also the next version already cached
on their machine it allows you for
offline functionality to make the
application go offline it allows for
push notifications and that according to
any app provider is the biggest
retention point telling people that
something is new that something is
available please come back to our app is
a very very important thing it's also a
super dangerous thing because this is
going to be the next pop-up window
annoyance thing that people are going to
push in our face if they're not nice
people because any new push
notifications make me do something
give me a button to reply to it give me
a button to do something with it just
don't tell me there's new content in the
app available I don't care if I if you
tell me like hey there's a new
notification from your friend and I can
immediately answer in the push
notification window without even having
to go back to the app I'm happy to give
it that data I'm happy to interact with
it so get you your ex and UI developers
to really really look into what push
notifications to cause far too many
websites right now I load them and
they're like hey can I send you
notifications and I'm like well buy me a
beer first or something this is just you
know I don't want to subscribe to you
immediately and you can do background
sync where you keep your application in
sync and up-to-date all the time without
the user needing to know so progressive
web apps need to be HTTPS they have a
valid manifest with all required
properties they must have a
serviceworker they start URL define the
manifest must always load including an
offline state so that should be as small
as possible a lot of people just do an
app shell and then load the content in
the back and must apply an own
navigation independent of browser UI
because we might get rid of the browser
UI and then people would get stuck like
what do I do now and must be responsive
to different sizes and form factors
don't only think of mobile also think of
tablets think of hololens
think of dogs cats cows whatever you put
internet programs in nowadays we have a
completely different world than from
just tests of all mobile now first
success stories Alibaba is a global
leader in a b2b trade and they upgrade
it to a PW a 76 percent more conversions
30% more monthly active users on Android
14% more on iOS four times higher
interaction rate to add to homescreen
housing calm real estate platform in
India 38% more conversions 40% lower
bounce rate 10% larger average session
30% larger page load there's a great
website by Jason Grigsby called PW a
stats where all these case studies are
basically listed that show you the
success stories of other companies what
they did to turn their stuff into a PW a
so what about support not everybody
supports a not every browser supports
service working on every browser
supports manifest and it's what we talk
about progressive enhancement and I've
been talking about that for years and
years progressive enhancement to me is
like an escalator an escalator can never
break down but an escalator is broken
down it's a set of stairs sorry for the
convenience you can still go up there
right it's a bit more work but it's
actually still working and this is what
we should be building these things for
if service worker and a map web manifest
is not supported it's a website great
make it smaller make it snappy make it
beautiful make it work really really
fast in a mobile environment and you'll
be happy and using this you can support
the paths you can support old Android
browsers you can support huge are not be
named and you can support Netscape and
if you really wanted to these browsers
are not out of the way don't make
beautiful interfaces for these browsers
people are not used to beauty that have
to use these environments it just
confuses them you can support current
edge cases like the silk browser like
the puffin browser like you see browser
and Opera Mini which are all in used by
a lot of people and you probably never
heard about and after some checking all
the current browsers and what they
support can be supported as well so
let's talk about iOS to a degree because
iOS doesn't support any of that
don't know the reason I caused ideas but
I'm not going to say them publicly so
there's no official timeline when or if
serviceworker will be supported in iOS
that is not meaning that it's not
supported in in WebKit the WebKit
browser the open source browser is has
it in its a timeline that it's going to
be supported but Safari who knows now
iOS is 45% of the US market phone a
smartphone market and I always used to
spend $1 eight per user per app instead
of four per 43 cents on Android these
are numbers that are quite niche that
make sense to a business person let's do
iOS only right or let's not care about
Android until it's ready but then you
have to think that Android has 86
percent will global market share so if
your product is available and
interesting outside the US you will make
more money with an Android app than you
will make with an iOS app and you also
are not in need totally controlled very
very hard to upgrade environment that
you're in that said Apple allows
functionality like meta name Apple web
app comp a capable content yes keep it
brief and short and there is also a
Cordoba plug-in that is a serviceworker
that fixes that for iOS
what about desktop and other form
factors nobody talks about it desktop
much when they talk about pwh because
everybody fixes the problem of the
mobile web the existing PWA
implementations still leave web apps as
second class the native apps in many
ways we want to fix that and that's my
colleague Jacob Rossi on whose works
were working on the edge team on edge we
are planning on running serviceworker as
a Windows service in Windows 10 so
instead of funk itself the browser
needing to support it as soon as you
actually run it in Windows you get and
you put it into the marketplace of
Windows you get access to the plumbing
of Windows which does all the stuff that
your service worker does in browser
already it can wake up the browser even
the browser is closed and it may spawn
multiple service workers at once for
performance that's still in discussion
we're discussing these things publicly
by now as well we got a bucket tracker
where we answer people's questions
that's a really cool thing as well
because when I started on the web into
Microsoft was just this dark hole
somewhere where trolls live or something
and nobody could talk to them but we're
now available to you
also going to change the edge logo
really soon because if you look at it it
looks like a shower head going into a
sink if you look at the dark blue which
always confused me now on Windows Bing
crawls websites and nothing could stop
being from crawling a manifest and
realized that these are apps and flag
them up in search results or ingest them
into the marketplace so there's a few
ideas going around there sites where the
manifest can go into the Windows Store
and these web apps are then relapse
their Windows desktop Windows Phone Xbox
hololens surface hub things we released
today that I haven't read appeared many
things out there now what I found really
interesting is that Google's webmaster
central blog oops fair enough
that Google's webmaster central come on
max good that Google's webmaster central
blog talked about pwace as well and
these are people that basically build a
website in 2007 and never touched it
again so now they learn about pwace as
well not only the cool kids that go to
conferences like this so building index
super progressive web apps is explained
on the ground on the webmaster central
blog and it says like it's websites that
have taken all the right vitamins so in
essence the PWA is an upgrade to what
you do already and it gives you only
benefits there's nothing wrong and it's
not much work to do so thinking about
getting into an HTTP environment keeping
your users much safer putting a manifest
there and putting a service worker there
is not much hard work and there's so
much to be gained by that any web
product can become a progressive web app
not all have to be if your thing is just
a blog I don't want to install your blog
as an app that makes no sense but if it
really is something that I'd do
something with an app is probably a
better idea you reap the rewards of
simple maintenance and upgrade paths and
the form factor mobile users expect
mobile users expect an app you can
actually maintain your website you don't
need to do anything extra to upgrade the
theme because it upgrades in the
background automatically apps can
hibernate and wake up on demand there's
no need to have the browser open and
what I found really interesting is this
the great thing here about progressive
web apps is that it's the power of the
link what made the internet links that
link to other things the distribution
model of a PWA is not
place its the link and what is the cool
thing about link I can email it to you I
can text it to you I can send it to you
and whatsapp extend you in Facebook you
can send it to you anywhere so by
following a link you install an
application and you throw away all the
problems that you had with like go to
the marketplace sign up into the
marketplace oh you have no credit card
you're not going to get it these kind of
things you don't need to play by the
rules of a closed marketplace it's just
the web that these are the rules that
are there and you can send people a link
by the time they looked at the app it's
ready to use it is really a try before
you buy and if you just close the
browser and you don't put it in to put
the icon on your desktop then you don't
have the app and you don't have any
crafts on your machine either anymore so
in-app purchases are where the money is
at and you can do that dear if the own
app without splitting costs with Apple
or Google or Microsoft or other people
so you just maintain your website and it
turns into an app so for all intents and
purposes pwace are a good opportunity to
slim down the web and make it usable
again for people and that without
reinventing the great distribution model
that is the web because sending a link
to somebody is a great simple way of
distributing your content rather than
like going through a package marketplace
now I'm ending with a few resources that
you can play with service workers stop
the worker is a is a great website by
Jake Archibald explaining what service
workers do different it has different
recipes what to do with a service worker
and as you definitely course if you want
to learn a lot about offline web
applications using serviceworker there's
a PWA summit by google that was run
twice already so all these videos are
available out there and you can you can
look at great resources downloadable as
well there's a PWI checklist but explain
to all the bits and bobs that are PWA
should do and how to test for it and
what to do to get the checklist ready
there's a directory of pwace where you
can see what other companies are doing
and what's happening with them so you
can try them out a lot of them are also
open source on github so if you want to
take a look at how they've done it you
can do that there is a PWA training
course progressive web apps training
again by Google by a good friend of mine
that has a 12-step training course you
could do it in a day and the
that we have a betta out and where
there's got to be more at built in a few
days where we have a PW a builder as
well so in this one you just copy and
paste the URL of your website and it
generates the manifest for you it
generates the serviceworker for you and
it generates a binary ios and android
app from your HTML document just by
putting your URL in there of course
doing it by hand gives you mere
functional functionality and actually
more granular control but this is a good
way to get started and this is all I had
time for so thanks very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
