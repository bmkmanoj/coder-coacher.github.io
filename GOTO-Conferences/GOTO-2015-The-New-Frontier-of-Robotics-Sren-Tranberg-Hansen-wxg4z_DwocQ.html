track on obsession on on robotics and
and drones I'm I'm going to talk about
robotics mainly and my name is son Santa
Hansen I'm I used to be working in
research some actually a computer
scientist and I'm a couple of years I
worked as a system developer and then I
changed into researched and worked as an
industrial PhD for a couple of years on
robotics and now I mean now I work as a
consultant for the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs something called invest in
Denmark not related to robotics robotic
so much but but still I have I work with
IT companies and then I also recently
published a book on robotics it's in
dainius and it's not a a non tick book
but it's a kind of an overview of what's
going on on the robotics scene and
that's pretty much the basis of what I'm
going to talk about here so it's not a
I'm not going to go into depth as the
forum speaker but I'm kind of trying to
give an overview on the business side
and what is going on on the robotic seen
in general so yeah click and gates and
rate decision so first of all yeah this
is what I'm going to talk about just
setting the scene what is what is
actually a robot it started to define
then you would think and then we'll give
it some examples of what is happening
within this area and i'll also give some
tips and tricks on how to make your own
robot project and and and what are the
toolbox you can use so just to zoom out
a bit because what is a robot yeah
there's a hundred of different nificent
definition there's a lot of definitions
and and and depending on what definition
you take you can actually use you can
you can say
washing machine or coffee machine is a
robot because it has some actuators and
the sudden programming so that's a so
the mere fact that we don't have that we
not maybe not talking about the same
kind of machine makes this so Larry a
bit troublesome to make some good tools
because of course it's different if you
want to program for this type of robot
of this type of robot there are robots
but yeah very different devices and this
is just an an overview I mean we have
the human rights and we have this
industrial that we saw before we have
logistic robots that drive around and
drones also and they're applied in
different sectors so it's a very broad
range of technologies but nonetheless
there's a lot of hype about it and and
the amount of robot companies that are
coming out right now is increasing and
some of the new some of the traditional
IT companies are also looking into this
area most notably google so the people
in the sixth to talk about before Google
and after Google before Google went in
through verdicts it was all R&amp;amp;D or
mostly R&amp;amp;D and some startups and some
big companies like cuca and a BB and but
within the last five years or so five
ten years we see these companies like
google and cisco traditional IT
companies they're moving into the six
and that's changing the whole scene a
lot so if you're a app developer maybe
you should think about robotics also as
a bit the next big thing for whatever
that is one funny thing i found out it
was that disney is also going into
robotics oh what the hell is Disney
doing in robots and we're going to see
now what they're doing
fantastic so I actually made the these
guys who are developed developing this
in in Boston last year they had a
product called Spiro which is also kind
of a paste robot and they're just young
guys and I don't know how the managed to
get a deal with Disney but but it's a
it's kind of an app based product and
they use some of the facilities to
augmented reality and voice recording
and all that so it's a extension of a
traditional app oh right so so what what
what is all the hype about why is
robotics exploding right now and some of
the reasons is that that we have some
new techniques for for handling big data
a lot of unstructured data that we
didn't have before so I brought you
probably know Watson and deep mind in
these projects and also the spin a
paradigm shift about robotics normally
you would think about them as a closed
density and they should solve everything
by themselves with the with their own
synthesis and processes but now the we
are more talking about networked robots
and robots that are able to communicate
for example the autonomous car so and
then of course price is falling and on
signal on the sensors and there's also
some tools we're not good at making
tools yet but but there are some and
this is just the case you all familiar
with Moore's law but this robot at the
lifts well my right hand side your left
hand side the yellow one was made by me
too busy for some ten years ago and this
paper will come out it is X allowed in
Japan already and it's only two thousand
dollars so I mean prices are falling and
it's going to be that was just
completely unrealistic five years ago
but but now it's here and we see it in a
lot of six as we sit in the industrial
sector these are the traditional
industrial robots and universal world
which we saw already
have Baxter two armed robot with a hit
yeah it's not a joke it's out there as a
product and we see it in the logistics
also a lot of new transportation robots
coming out this one is also it's a
Danish product which is going to be
really cheap and kiva a small project
that amazon bought for like seven
hundred million dollars or something and
in health we see it in in surgery and
this peril our guests at least in 10
market they're quite famous it's a it's
a robot pit for people who are demented
so yeah and of course military they're
driving a lot of the devel development
drones and these pack dots and so it's
that they're pressuring a lot yep
they're pushing the technology a lot and
it what some of the new stuff that is
coming out is this this is your house /
this is your car this is your toothbrush
these are your google project but so
this is what as I IndieGoGo project and
she managed to get think three million
dollars and then some additional
investors went into it and she's a
researcher at MIT and I guess you
followed her also right yeah so she's
been working with this for many years
and now she it's a company but what but
but what is it it's actually a tablet
inside a device and they can move around
and there is some evidence research
evidence that this actually has some
effect on people on the way you perceive
it it changes a lot whether device can
move or not so that's kind of that
affects he is using on this and there's
a lot of stuff going on right now if you
just spend this was just something I
found actually yesterday looking at
birth meet the world's first artificial
intelligence personal robot it's very
ambitious I think
but but so let's see is running right
now the campaign I'm yeah so there's a
lot of stuff going on in this so
eighty-two percent of people living
there have a college degree that's the
rent one for us I'm not personally
convinced that this was well ever going
to work but I'm also biased because I
used to work as a research and and we
could we could not make anything work at
all so I'm we tried a lot but what is
happening is that we get a lot of you
different development platforms so this
turtle part is is a open source and open
hardware product you can you can buy and
and these two ones are actually a vacuum
cleaners that you can use as a
development platform also and and and
the one this one needs oh it's actually
a vacuum cleaner with a laser scanner I
think that's really fantastic imagine
that a vacuum cleaner with the laser
scanner so yeah it's a ladder so you can
it can it can be used for for mapping
your environment the traditional robot
vacuum cleaners they were just the mall
is randomly running around but but now
you can actually you can it can map the
entire room and rumba irobot roomba also
have a similar model and you can connect
it has a USB in you can connect it with
raspberry pi and stuff like that so for
less than I mean for eight hundred
dollars or five hundred dollars or
something you can really get a good
start that was very expensive just 5-10
years ago so it's changing the scene a
lot and Ross is our the former speaker
he called it JavaScript for robots
there's not that many stuff with tools
out there we don't have a visual studio
anything like that unfortunately the
state's when I was reated was the most
popular but but it's kind of not used so
much anymore it's not active Microsoft
had a robotics to do but it has not been
updated since 2012 so so Ross is
actually model is the de facto standard
and some people hate it and some people
love it it's an open source project by
Willow Garage and now it's a maintained
by
this open-source robotic found
Foundation and it's very because we
don't really know what is the device
reprogramming for it's very modular
designed it has to be that way because
if it's a industrial robot it's a vacuum
cleaner whatever it's two different
things but so if you need some
development tool that that fits into all
that then it has to be that way so you
have like a call and then you plug in
different modules and it also makes it a
bit tiresome to work with but but it's
there and it's it's probably the best
platform that is right now especially
because it has some simulators states
and and gazebo and States if you have a
number of robots that you want to
simulate and but with low fidelity and
and the other one is high fidelity but
only if you have like one or two robots
and it also has a really nice debugging
tool so you can yeah maybe it's going to
speak for ourselves hi I'm Josh Foust
the software engineer at Willow Garage
and I'm going to talk to you a little
bit about Barba's our 3d visualization
environment obvious lets us view what
the robot is seeing thinking and doing
developing on a robot can be very
difficult without knowing exactly what
the robot thinks is going on in the
world debugging by looking at numbers
scrolling by is difficult enough in 2d
unless you have an intuitive
understanding of quaternions and
coordinate frames debugging 3d by
numbers alone is not much fun arvest
lets you look at the world through the
robot size whether those eyes are
cameras lasers or joint encoders there
are two main ways of putting data inside
our visas world first arvest understand
sensor and state information like laser
scans point clouds cameras and
coordinate frames these have specialized
displays that let you configure how
you'd like to view that information
second we have visualization markers
that let you as a programmer send
primitives like cubes arrows and lines
colored however you want the combination
of sensor data and custom visualization
markers make our visit our fillet of
robot capabilities and research
the Ross navigation stack uses a
combination of these to show its current
path obstacle data 3d voxel grid and
topological map rvs markers have also
been used by motion planning researchers
to show planned versus actual paths
goals object detection and calibration
rvs is a powerful tool for debugging
robot applications it's free open source
and available now at Ross org so stuff
like that this is available and that of
course helps a lot it's still difficult
to make make a good product that
actually would but but this is certainly
a pickle and you can actually as a
traditional there some help if you had I
wish develop Android especially if I
invert there's a lot of software
packages out that most of it is it's run
by some University or anything or
someone like that so it's not a
commercial product or anything it's open
source most of it with with the benefits
and all the problems it has but but it's
out there if you into humanoids these
are this is algebra one from Francis is
the leading company right now so this is
I don't know I don't know what you can
use it for her to be honest and I don't
think the creator's i donate they don't
know it either but now it's there and
and there's a lot it is the small wonder
now is used for education especially and
that's what they decide the software for
so there is a very high level
programming interface where you can drag
and drop like Lego Mindstorms but but
you can also program Python and c++ and
I I believe that they make these
platforms and they send it out and then
they're kind of hoping for the community
you guys to take it up and come up with
some cool applications because that's
really where the platforms are they are
mall is now and they're cheap but
they're very few cool applications here
so if you're interested in this area
that's that's fairly easy to get access
to now and and that has changed a lot
also in very short time so these are
just examples of robots that are more
less based on standard tablets and
devices so we have one here it's a it's
a telepresence robot so it's instead of
a mica coming from almost going to
Copenhagen I could just skip the robot
and they can run around here and after
the session if someone wants to play
around with it for the rest of the day
is here available I'm leaving tomorrow
so it's only here today if you want to
use it so you can sit in your hotel room
and then join a concert one of the
systems downstairs I don't know it's a
possibility and and this one in the
Middle East a new one from this is about
the two thousand two hundred dollars or
something but this one from China the
middle one is only I think three hundred
dollars so the practice is just really
it's it's really really cheap now quite
impressive this is a project well on the
n-word n-word pace for products is is
growing quite a lot right now in this
port the yo-yo board is available in
most electronic stores and it makes you
able to control any device motors and
everything from a from a android
telephone and there is at the at the web
page it's a University of California I
think you can google and find it really
easy then this a step-by-step
instruction on how to make a cool robot
out of an Android device using this
board so there's plenty of help to get
so I'll just go through some of the
really basic theory on on robots because
unlike static devices or normal devices
who have tap in our stuff like that the
robots are moving around and that gives
a lot of challenges so how to control it
so so there's kind of two well the basic
paradigm is that you get some sense
input and then you plan what to do and
then you do it but but what did the
classical way is that you have piqued
you have a model of the world and then
you make
optimize plan on what the robot should
be and in the 90s you kind of change
that perspective a bit so we have more
like instinct reaction the robot just
reacts very fast they have some
behaviors that it does it doesn't have
an overview of the entire situation it
doesn't have a optimized plan it reacts
instinctively like these two vacuum
cleaners when they bump into a wall then
they change direction stuff like that
that that works the other thing also
works but only in controlled
environments because when you have a
moving device and then you have a lot of
sensors then you also have a lot of
noise you don't really know what what
comes in and it's very hard to with
traditional programming techniques it's
it's hard to deal with so you have these
sensor input that you have to navigate
around and so don't mix up traditional
programming with with robots it's
actually two different things it's much
harder robotics to make it work this is
just it's a complete research area like
you have user interface and human
computer in text and you also have human
robot interaction how to interact with
robots and that's a lot of research on
that but but just one basic thing is how
should a robot move around a person
that's actually what I researched a way
back for example it's very unpleasant if
a robot comes in behind you and just
looks at you like so how can you avoid
that you need to have an overview of
where other people in the room and how
can you navigate through these people
without without there being bothered
just just to manage that is is extremely
difficult because people are also moving
around so how can you make a decision on
that so if i should give some advice
based on my painful achieved experience
in robotics is that don't be too
ambitious i mean these guys and
Kickstarter who wants to make this robot
to participating actively in a meeting
and stuff like that I think that's maybe
a bit over the top this this is more if
they can just make it a navigate into
that conference room by itself I think
that would be a
pretty good so you talked about this
paradox that hot problems I easy and the
easy problems I have to just stop
picking up a ball and throwing it that a
child 23 years old can do very half a
robot playing chess and optimizing
something yeah optimizing a problem very
easy for robot for robot computer but
but but not so easy for us so the things
when you work with robots you often you
find out that this just making this
robot moving from a to be very tough
problem actually still it's not dissolve
completely it's getting better but I
mean there's still a lot of research and
this in this area so the but open source
is exploding right now also open
hardware but but i would recommend if
you have planning to go into this you
slit access the platform first if you
can make it work there and you can also
do your own platform but working on at
least you have a need to have a group of
different people with different skills
how much time do I have like yeah okay
I'm the funding side it's very good I
think it's actually never been better
than it is right now because EU is
putting a lot of funding in robotics I
have a very basic program and also
compared to just a few years ago we have
the private sector also investing in
robotics so especially the crowdfunding
campaigns you see a lot but you also see
more venture funds and robust talks and
different kind of business people
looking into this area so it's really
hot this and an EU horizon 20 to 20 has
allocated money for robotics also also
for entrepreneurs and small companies
and then there's a lot of regional
initiatives just later this month there
will be started a robotic stouter
startup hopping in Windsor and I see
that happened a lot of places in the
world
no matter where I that's probably some
people trying to find out how can we
make new companies in the robotics area
and this is just my I have my own
personal project where we use this
platform that's why I have it so it's
it's funded by by EU in this 5 web
program and there's still some calls
open in the fire where it's a it's the
future internet project alcohol and and
you need to use some open soft open
software that's developed there I'm it's
a good call in the sense that it's not
so complex to apply for and you can
apply this a single person it's it's not
a good call in because it's also you
need to use these software packages that
they have defined and they're not
especially suited for robotics but but
but you just have to do it so it kind of
a big counterproductive and that's why I
actually don't have a demo to show today
because I was planning on showing a demo
on what we're doing in this project but
again but weird what we're doing it as a
hybrid app so we have the with this
specific platform this are small SDK so
you control it drive for one forward and
backwards and turn and this hit can go
up and down stuff like that and then we
are using a cut over so we're actually
my fellow programmer he's he's a
freelance programmer where he's been
doing web pages forever so he's he's
using the languages that he used to hear
that he's normally using and the only
thing we have from the robot world is
that we communicate with this specific
sdk on how to control the robot and then
we have this and then we have some open
source vision software and from from
that we have that we are using from the
highway program so we are trying to
create this is a yeah this is like a
telepresence robot what we are trying to
make some autonomous navigation we're
actually trying to make a game out of
this I don't know that that was also my
the scope of my PhD so i have this may
be naive understanding that like we have
a lot of games on the traditional
platforms the tablets and the phones I
think robot games that's going to be a
new black that's at least a droid where
we convinced the you so we're trying to
make these physical games with this type
of what I can run around and you have a
new trend your track you have to solve
some task with the with the robot using
augmented reality and and other types of
vision software so yes so that's
actually what I had in mind and
questions yeah that's one question
asking when will you have the human
looking androids with the full aai well
fully I I don't think we will ever have
that I mean we are getting closer and
closer step by step but if a robot like
you and I I don't see that in the
foreseeable not with the type of
paradigm and computer technology we are
using today you can get something that
is really convincing for a while but but
but not fully convincing and i think
it's it's still there still a lot to do
we will have some more specific
applications long before that I mean
just just to make this robot work
probably is hard enough so there's still
room for for a lot of improvement yeah
but maybe we can I can just run around
here with the robot so you can see it in
live in action yeah
yeah yeah I have a lot of thoughts
actually have a entire six in here in
the book I meet my biggest concern is
right now is on on the privacy side
because you don't know whether this
robot is filming you right now and if I
control it around you don't know what it
knows about you so there's some kind of
imbalance about what you know about the
robot and what the robot knows about you
and and these I if you see if if it's
gonna go if it's going to continue like
this we will have a lot of small devices
navigating our tourism autonomously and
in our conference rooms and drones and
stuff like that so so I have my me my
biggest concern right now is on the
privacy side and there's a barium
there's a famous us robot robotics
researcher in concert robots mark so he
talks about with you maybe in a few
years we cannot be in a pack or in a web
public because you will have a dr drones
flying around and you will have this
Star Wars small robot running around and
filming and I mean that's that's a major
issue I don't think maybe also on the
official intelligence taking decisions
but but that's a bit more out in the
future just right now I think we have
some privacy issues on what what can we
allow these robots to film and and and
and we need this license plate that the
former presenter talked about I mean you
don't know if this robot does something
who does it belong to you don't know we
need something like that I guess some
unique identifier so we can track down
who has the responsibility for this
specific device so the very changeable
stuff I mean that it could be salt but
but legislation is way behind on under
technology as usual yeah I'll just gonna
diss ya
yes
on the legislation side yeah well I'm
surprised how little people know about
robots actually i'm a bit concerned on
the drone side they sacked there are
people working on that already but but i
think in general legislators and the
people in the political system are not
so much aware of what is actually
possible to do already I think it's
growing the tintin has been growing a
lot the last two years especially last
singularity University and people have
had their tongue a lot about also these
issues and of course it Elon Musk and a
lot of other people so i think the
attention is growing but but but i'm
still a bit surprised sometimes how many
times i've been talking about what a
robot is i don't have the number but
it's even in my own organization so yeah
it's a it could be better but it is it's
also getting better so there's still
hope Falls
alright so just maybe you've seen this
already but but this is the this is a
it's like a sick way kind of thing it's
hard for you in the back to see but but
it first so it's gonna feed back here
but I can move it around yep be careful
Hey not very fast as you can see but it
does work so what I what I see from my
screen maybe you consider you continue
also and then there's a the back the
camera on the back is mirrored down so
if i change to the other camera then i
can see if i'm drawing driving into
something but there's only one app now
and that's the one i'm using so but
there is a sdk so anyone can in theory
take this platform and make whatever you
like out of it and it's it's not that
difficult to get access to however you
cannot put it on the app store because
it's not a sin beta testing something
like that so you can only use it for
your own projects but but in theory so
the idea is that i can show i have
another promotion video we like that no
no I cannot no but I've experienced that
it falls over so I mean we have a
security aspect right is there I showed
it for journalists and it was in my
apartment and I showed it for
journalists in Copenhagen and it just
fell a pong filming down at the at the
flow and then I had to go drive three
hours to go back to my apartment to see
what was wrong with it and take it up
again so I mean when it fails your you
have to you need some confidence that
someone will will help pick it up
otherwise you just if it falls over here
in the conference and I'm somewhere else
it's just steals it I don't know I don't
know what to do yeah so it's it's skype
on wheels page
and it's pretty big in at least in the
u.s. let's see if I have yeah this is we
are in downtown San Francisco that's
where right at HQ is located and there's
about 85 people that work out of this
office and we have about 10 people that
work out of an office in New York as
well one of those people is a close
friend and co-worker of mine in Jordan
oplinger and he is my partner creating
original video content before reddit at
reddit we have a number of different
communication channels we're always in
slack we're also an email which is like
we're scheduling happens and stuff like
that but there was a need to have
communication back folks to our new york
city officer in san francisco office so
the the nice thing about the double is
like you can just hop in nobody needs to
accept the call which is which is pretty
big it's just like as if you were
walking into a room right from day one
it became very clear that it was a much
better way for us to communicate and i
think a lot of that has to do with the
physical presence that the double robot
is able to give somebody when they're
trying to participate meetings or when
they actually want to come up to your
desk and talk to you something as simple
as like turning to face different people
really like engages and helps maybe part
of the actual physical space also
raising and lowering the height on it
it's a level of emotion and interaction
that you can't get the slack or email or
anything else it really changes the
dynamic of so yeah apparently it works
really well at least it works when
you're controlling it it doesn't feel
that unnatural but but for the people
who are sitting them the robot is coming
it's a bit strange situation but I guess
you can get used to it but ssss as the
controller it feels completely natural
walking walking around talking to people
so maybe we'll all have one of these in
a couple of years who knows right okay
what okay I have more video so I have
little videos let's look at this one
then we present a novel robotic platform
leveraging smartphone technology that
was developed at a cognitive and Eater
robotics laboratory at the University of
California Irvine the motivation was to
create an inexpensive robotic platform
using off-the-shelf components and open
source software which could easily be
built by students hobbyist or
researchers yet still be able to perform
complex tasks we believe three main
components can fulfill these
requirements first a smartphone running
the Android operating system is used as
the on-board computer and sensing device
for the robot the computing power
compact battery sensing capabilities
communication options and intuitive
programming interface of Android phones
make them an ideal choice for robotic
onboard computers second an electronic
device called a yo-yo which can link the
Android phone to peripheral devices such
as servos motors and sensors last a
remote-controlled vehicle available from
any hobby store RC vehicles are robust
come in a variety of forms and provide a
platform that includes batteries motors
servos suspensions and electronic speed
controllers a prototype Android car was
constructed using an RC car an Android
phone a phone holder and a yo-yo for a
total cost of less than four hundred
dollars the Android phone sent PWM
signals to the RC car for steering and
speed control through the yo-yo which
was connected via USB using a laptop
computer we communicate over Wi-Fi to an
Android application that controlled the
vehicle and streamed video and sensory
information back to the computer next we
built an autonomous robot based on this
approach we built a base using a sheet
of perforated steel and mounted it on an
RC car infrared sensors were then
mounted on this base and the Android
phone was mounted on a pan tilt unit
made with servo motors panning and
tilting was achieved by sending commands
from the Android phone to the servos
through the yo-yo in a Follow the Leader
task which was a part of an Android
programming
students program to leader robot that
could be controlled remotely with one
phone and an autonomous follower robot
that used opencv libraries to visually
track an object on the leader robot as
well as avoid obstacles we also used our
platform for a research experiment known
as reversal learning and cognitive
science in this foraging task the robot
was controlled by a neural network
running on the android phone which
simulated brain areas necessary for this
learning the robot used local sensing
and gps to learn where researchers were
located and when to search for new
resources as they were depleted at a
location the android-based robotic
platform introduced here is flexible
innovative and affordable depending on
the choice of phone and RC vehicle its
usage can range from hobbyist to
educational to complex research projects
yeah so it's it's really really cheap to
do stuff like that now and and that's
what i think is changing the entire
scene the robot i use for my PhD was a
around twenty thousand dollars or
something like that and i could probably
do it today for maybe two hundred
dollars or less so that the mayor of
fact that you have that we have all
these devices and they're so easy to use
especially if you exploit the a droid
libraries and all the stuff that is
already out there for the smartphones
then anyone can make a robot didn't 44
yeah for a very small amount is mostly
it's just a matter of it well the
problem is of course you need to look at
the time and you need to have a killer
application i don't see that many killer
applications to be honest i see a lot of
strange applications but but not but not
a lot where i think i really need that a
lot of toys and gadgets and stuff like
that but but i think with the scene is
is lacking professional programmers and
the system developers also to make
really good solid tools that that can be
used we're lacking that so I'm inviting
like the former speaker inviting
everyone here too
to join this and and try to mature this
entire area bit that would be nice
because it's a bit it sits right now
it's hobbyist and researcher smoothly
and then a lot of startups are coming up
but but still there's room for everyone
to join here so that's kind of what I
and I can't talk anymore now okay
