off and on for about 15 years but
usually as part of another project part
of a project written in other languages
and so my perspective on R is a little
different than someone who starts and
ends their day just using R I'm usually
more concerned with R is a part of
something else so I'll talk about how to
mix are with other languages how to call
from are out to other languages or how
to use R from something else so why are
well the biggest advantage to R is the
libraries there's there's tons of really
useful libraries in R and for that
reason a lot of people use are even if
they don't really want to maybe they
don't like the language per se but they
want to use the functionality of our and
I would also say that R is the de facto
standard language for statistical
research but I'll be a little careful
when I say that when I mean that by that
I mean research into statistics per se
if people are using statistics to do
research in genetics or meteorology or
something else they may not be as likely
to use R but if you see a paper in a
statistical journal with a new algorithm
or new method or something you're very
likely to see code written in our Python
is sort of catching up to R or past are
depending on your perspective for data
science I mean there's a blurry line
between data science and statistics but
people who call themselves statisticians
are more likely to use are people who
call themselves data scientists or may
be more likely to use Python as far as
statistical languages go R is a very
nice language if you're coming to are
from say SAS R is a fantastic language
if you're coming to are from something
like Java or Python or another language
like that you may be a little
disappointed
as Dennis Ritchie said about see you
could say the same thing about our that
it's quirky flawed and an enormous
success all right and so why would you
want to mix languages to two different
use cases one is your writing our code
but you want to improve the efficiency
so art can be very slow especially for
things like loops it handles loops very
slowly and so you might want to take
some hotspot in your code and rewrite it
in C or something else that's this more
performant also with memory are doesn't
handle memory particularly well and so
you may run out of memory doing
something in our where the same code
rewritten in in C or some C like
language might have plenty of memory and
the efficiency in the memory are
actually closely related a compiler
expert the that I knew used to work with
the looked at the making are more
efficient said that our spends most of
its time allocating and deallocating
objects so the in the memory management
is deep down into our where it's hard to
make that more efficient so I'll assume
for this talk that if you're calling
from our out to something else that's
because you want to improve efficiency
and then if you're calling into our from
another language it's because you want
ours functionality maybe you're not
particularly concerned about efficiency
but you just want to do something that
there's a an our library for right all
right so I'll spend most of the talk
talking about ways to interact with are
the first one just to say a few things
about our itself as I mentioned art can
be pretty slow and so you might want to
optimize our and now give you my
personal algorithm for how to optimize
our
first vectorize r is a vector-based
language anytime you can operate on
things as vectors rather than writing
explicit code to loop through them and
if not don't use R or at least not for
that part of the code you can often get
substantial speed up by vectorizing
something if you wrote it in a way that
doesn't take advantage of vectors other
than that there's ad hoc tricks that you
can try they might give you 20 or 30%
speed-up but that way will drive you
crazy if you want a order of magnitude
speed-up you're not going to get it by
just rearranging the R code if you want
that kind of speed up you probably need
to rewrite everything or rewrite a
hotspot in some other language and
assuming that you are coming from
another language you're writing Java
you're writing c-sharp you're writing
Python something like that and you just
want to use a little bit of R for some
functionality you might be surprised by
the syntax a little bit of how to use R
so as I mentioned before our is a vector
language everything is a vector even if
you have a single number you don't
really have numbers in R you have
vectors of length 1 so it's not really
strongly typed in that regard and
everything can be null or n/a and as
much as I've tried I still don't really
understand the difference between null
and na like one of them is a missing
value and the other is a value that's
not there so that's that's as good
explanation as I can find and and people
are inconsistent in how they they treat
this but the thing to be warned about is
everything is potentially null when you
get a so you receive some R vector back
to your program it's ostensibly a vector
of doubles but don't count on it one of
those doubles might be a null or an na
like Fortran
vectors in our index from one not from
zero so that's something to look out for
and most bizarre of all zero is a legal
index in our it just doesn't do anything
or it's not clear what it does do but
it's legal it's not it's not like
stepping off the end of a C array where
you get an uninitialized memory it's
perfectly legal to access the zeroth
element of an array and it gives you a
type instead of a value or something
like that so and you can also have
negative indices in sooner right but
they don't act like you might expect
from say Perl or Python where say
negative one is the last element or a
negative two is the second-to-last
element in our it works completely
different if you have an array and you
index negative two that removes the
second element of the array or if you
have arranged negative 2 to negative
three that removes the second and third
elements of the array which may seem
like a strange thing to do but if you
think about what R is and it's designed
to be a language for interactive
statistical analysis well then in that
context it makes sense that you might
want to remove values you have outliers
you have missing values that you want to
ignore so it's a common operation to
want to remove things another similarity
between R and Fortran is that by default
matrices are filled by column not by row
so you can have our take a vector and
interpret it as a matrix by row but you
have to pass in an argument for it to do
that by default it works on columns just
like Fortran and some strange syntax are
used as a dollar sign the way most
languages would use a dot so to indicate
elements of a class dot is used more
like an underscore in C based languages
just as a conventional separator but
with no language significance and the
underscore used to mean assignment it
doesn't anymore in our I think it still
doesn't s+ but it used to be that if you
had food underscore bar that would
assign the value bar to the variable foo
which could be quite a surprise all
right so on two ways to interact with
with our you can always write packages
in our that call out to C or Fortran
this is the lowest-level interface and
not really one that's that's recommended
anymore but if you want the V most
control possible you could drop down to
the sea level and deal directly with the
innards of are you have to do a lot of
reference counting memory management
casting it looks sort of like doing
old-style comm programming and see but
these days most people would use our CPP
which I'll talk about in a moment rather
than going down to the the sea level our
CPP provides a much much nicer interface
that's as high level as it could be for
what it's trying to do and it still
gives you full control but at a higher
syntactic level okay so these days at
least our CPP is the most popular way to
interact between R and another language
with this you could call C or C++ or
Fortran from R and you can use even
advanced C++ it's fine using STL
constructs templates there's a rich
interface but between C++ and R and if
you want to go the opposite direction
you want to call our from C++ you can do
that too it's still part of this our CPP
project but technically it goes by a
different name or
includ so you I'll give an example this
is just a second
you can even inline C++ code in your R
so you have an R script and then
somewhere there's a hotspot you know in
the in the core of your your program and
you want to make just those few lines
into AC function you can do that still
staying in R and just passing the C++ or
C or C++ code to our CPP the way you
might write a string of sequel and send
it to a database inside a different
language so the main reference for our
CPP is the site our CPP org the
project's created by Dirk Edel Gadol and
he's written a book on our CPP so you
could find his book from Springer if you
wanted to read more about it that way so
here's an example if you want to use a
little bit of C from inside and our
program this is all our code you load
the our CPP library then call this
function called CPP function with a
string and then the magic happens inside
that function that takes that string
interprets it as C or C++ code compiles
it stores it somewhere you don't have to
know where and then creates a wrapper
around that in R so then after defining
this C++ function called add I now have
an R function called add but it's going
to be implemented in in C++ so it's it's
really seamless if you want to do it
this way and for a small amount of code
this is convenient if you have a larger
amount of code you probably want to
compile some sort of module we'll call
it that way or maybe you inline a small
amount of code that calls a larger
amount of C++ somewhere off the line now
if you're in the the Microsoft world
you're writing dotnet code
one way that's been around for a long
time is this object called RDECOM
creates a decom interface around are you
can you could call it from say visual
basic or some komlang guack pass it a
string of our code it'll interpret it
run it and send you the results back
I've used this in production it's a
little scary there's not much security
around that because you can pass it
arbitrary code but we just quarantine
that on its own box and just it worked
there's a couple of newer ways to
interact with our in the Microsoft world
there's the F sharp type provider so
which is especially convenient if you're
if you're using F sharp if you're not
using F sharp so you're using C sharp
you can still use the F sharp type
provider as an intermediary you have so
you have sticking little F sharp between
your R and your c-sharp code and there's
another project our net I've used Rd
comm I haven't used the F sharp type
provider or our net I've heard good
things about the F sharp type provider
in particular but I haven't used that
personally and a new way of interacting
with our from the Microsoft world is
through sequel server queries so
recently Microsoft acquired revolution
analytics a company that was
commercializing support for our and
Microsoft is in the process of
integrating our into some of their
products so you can do things like this
now you can have a bit of of sequel code
where we actually make our as part of
your sequel statement your inlining a
little bit of our code in the middle of
a say a stored procedure now this is
kind of bizarre if you think about
wanting to connect our and Haskell if
you think about it's hard to think of
two languages that are more different
Haskell is very much emphasis on strong
typing static typing correctness no side
effects functional language and R is
everything but that R is designed for
interactive use and so it's it's
interpreted its loosely typed or
inconsistently typed or word I don't
know what you would call it and R is not
particularly concerned with the code
being correct in that when there's a
trade-off between ease of use and
correctness R is going to be optimized
for ease of use it's designed for
somebody interactively exploring a data
set in that context you're not so
worried about type errors like you know
I want the the third row of this of this
data set well it is what it is I'm not
going to confuse that for a string or a
JPEG image or whatever if you're not
concerned about about typing where is
like in Haskell you really are well I've
been on a project where we were wanting
to use Haskell and R which you know took
me a while get my head around that
actually makes a lot of sense because
the languages are complementary so the
the project that we were using for
interfacing these two languages was
Haskell R it was cut just called H at
the time now it's called Haskell are
from twig i/o and the reason we were
interested in this was kind of twofold
we wanted to be able to call some our
libraries and implemented things that we
didn't have on the Haskell side and also
to be able to sort of mix our and
Haskell in some of our analysis being
able to call from Haskell into R and
vice versa
and so I mean this really is a
remarkable project to be able to
synthesize two languages that are just
diametrically opposite and and yet
there's there's deep integration you can
not only pass data between R and Haskell
you can pass functions like you can you
could write a function in Haskell pass
it to r2
optimize it or integrated or something
like that get the result back into
Haskell data types so there's a deep
integration there and it's all done
through this quasi quoting you can put
your our code inside this Haskell quasi
quote there's also as part of the same
project there's a ripple that's a
variation of the gh CI repple where you
can interact with with R and you can
also use Haskell via Haskell are in a
Jupiter notebook which I'll talk about
in a moment
by the way working with Haskell and are
together kind of improve my appreciation
for what R is is good for I mean
philosophically I'm more inclined toward
the Haskell school of things you know
like static type checking like the
compiler helping me to make sure my code
is correct etc and yet there's some
things that were just painful to do in
Haskell that we're easy to do in R so
when you're doing exploratory analysis
which is what R is good for you say I
don't care about gating types right I
just want to see if there's something
there first if there is something there
yes then we can go back and add all the
types and and unit tests and like that
but first I just want to know what's
there and I also don't want to have to
change the type of all my functions
because I want to insert a print
statement so for that kind of
exploratory work things were much more
convenient in R but then once things
were developed and you want to have the
assurance that everything is is
statically typed and no side effects
like that then it's nice to go back over
to the Haskell side now if you're
familiar with with emacs org-mode
org-mode gives you a way of gluing
different languages together including R
but also a lot of other languages and
like all things Emacs it's it's kind of
crufty it's al it's a little weird if
you're the first time you see it but
it's also very powerful again like a lot
of things in Emacs so it has has support
for many different languages you can you
can
use org-mode to call a little bit of
Haskell a little bit of C or Bosch or
whatever you can mix a lot of things
together
in this sort of markup for org-mode and
it works reliably cross-platform a lot
of things in this talk work but may not
work on the first try it requires some
tweaking and you got install things just
right like that but my experience with
emacs org-mode is that it works as
documented everywhere on the first try
now
it may not work as expected but it does
work as documented and it is well
documented so it's very good for
exploring you know if you say okay I'm
working along here I'm keeping notes on
what I'm doing calling some code calling
this code in Perl calling this code over
here and see all I need to call a little
bit of our maybe to graph something or
whatever then you could stick in a
little code in in our as well and this
organoid is also very good for literate
programming so the idea of literate
programming is that you you think of
your documentation as primary in your
code is secondary so instead of writing
your code and then writing a little bit
of documentation on the side you write
documentation an inline code as
necessary so you could think of it as
commenting taken to an extreme but it's
really more than that you can you can
reorganize things into the way that's
best for a human reader rather than
what's best for a compiler so you might
define part of a function here and
explain that and then you might define
another part of a function later and
then ask the environment to piece all
these things into a coherent thing that
the compiler can understand and I played
with this for a while and you know it's
fun to play with oh look I'm calling
these different languages and then you
know and it's just kind of an
interesting toy but I recently did a
project where this really saved my bacon
it was a it was a project where the
require
months were very complicated the code
itself wasn't that complicated but just
understanding what needed to be done was
very was where you're most likely to
make a mistake when you're pulling
things from obscure sources and saying I
think this means this it's not entirely
clear but this is why I think this Oh to
document all that the literate
programming in org-mode was really a
great way to go so I mentioned that
org-mode supports a lot of languages
there's a little confusion between
org-mode and org Babel they're kinda the
terms are used interchangeably
technically org Babel is the library
that org-mode is using to do all this
code management but there were about 40
languages the org Babel org-mode
supports out of the box and then there's
several others that sort of have
third-party support but aren't as
official as the ones that ship with
Emacs so an org mug file is a form of
markup you can mix text latex markup
inserting images inserting links and so
forth sort of like HTML but it's simpler
and you can also insert code where you
have a begin source in source tag and at
the begins or stagg you tell it what
language you're using and then you just
insert that code and we've pre editing
this inside Emacs if you're inside a
block of are you know you can have the
editor enter your are editing mode so
you have the syntax colouring and so
forth for R and then when you're in a
section of a different language than
Emacs can edit that as that language
even though it's all in one file so
here's an example in this one well mix
together our Python and and pearl so I
call a sine function I have a function
written in R that just returns the sine
and I called it sign underscore R just
to emphasize that it's written in our
that's not necessary you can call it
whatever you want I just added the
suffix to make it clear where things are
coming from and you have when you do
this you have to pass in default
arguments so I just said X defaults to
zero then from my cosign function I'm
gonna implement that in Python and just
so I can know that my code works if I
and not just by default I set the
default variable to one so that if
things don't get initialized my code
will be wrong so if you notice in the
source block for R the name of the our
language is with a capital R and the
source block for Python the name of
Python is with lowercase P most
languages in org-mode use the program
language name and lowercase some reason
are doesn't so it's a capital R okay
then moving over to the second column
I'm going to take the square of my two
values because I'm sine squared plus
cosine squared should equal one right so
I'm going to do this in Perl just have
another language and then my call
statement the pound plus call everything
in organoids starts with pound plus just
because that's something you're unlikely
to type by accident in in other code so
in this case now in the call
I'm calling the Python function which is
then calling the R and the Python or so
it seems
what's literally going on here is that
everything is going through Emacs Lisp
so this is really sort of a
hub-and-spoke architecture where things
are going in and out of Emacs Lisp so
the Perl is not literally calling R but
it appears that way it's being mediated
through Emacs Lisp under the hood and
then when you evaluate a code block in
org-mode you'll print out the results so
this case the results is just a number
the result could be a an image so if you
so you're doing something in some other
language but you want to use our for
plotting you can use our to insert an
image for a plot okay another way to
interoperate languages was Jupiter
notebooks Jupiter started out as a
Python but then they changed the name to
de-emphasize Python when there's support
for other languages so the the name
Jupiter came from the Julia programming
language Python and R so Jupiter
notebooks are very nice HTML based
notebook interface to different
languages supports a lot of different
languages separately so it's not really
so much an interrupt story as a
consistent way to implement notebooks in
different languages so you could have a
Haskell Jupiter notebook that's using
Haskell code and our Jupiter notebook
that's using our and they're consistent
but they're not actually sharing code
that way so compared to something like
the org-mode that we talked about
Jupiter notebooks are less transparent
for better and for worse better because
you have more of a WYSIWYG environment
you you know you sort of like a
web-based repple so you you're
interacting with something you plot
something that plot appears right there
right after where you plot it you don't
see as much detail which is nice if
you're exploring something of course the
drawback is since it's there's more
going on under the hood it's harder to
DIF the files they're not just plain
text files you could say okay what
changed between these versions because
under the hood a jupiter notebook is
json it's kind of semi human readable
and so it's harder to DIF than something
that's more explicit like org-mode
so some of the languages they're
supported by Jupiter kernels list is
growing every day there might might be a
new one since I made this slide it's
really nice so you have a new language
and you'd like to have this nice
notebook support for it you can just
piggyback on what they've already done
with Jupiter another Fork of the ipython
notebook is something called beaker and
this does give more of a language
Interop story than then does Jupiter so
you can mix you can mix different
languages and pass data between them
through this this global beaker object
I'll give an example that in a second
and one of the nice features about this
when if you're dealing with some data
set is that you can pass data frames
between languages so for a long time one
of the advantages of our was that it had
this this data frame this kind of like a
sequel table but the columns can be
different types and that just made a lot
of data analysis operations more
convenient and for a long time the story
was yeah I'd rather write Python but you
know R has this data frame Python
doesn't have something like that so I'm
going to keep using R and then West
McCanney wrote pandas this library that
that has among other things an analogue
to ours data frames so what beaker does
is it will translate between these two
types of data frame which is really
there's a lot going on there this is
more than just like you know converting
a string in this language to a string in
that language there's it's more
complicated but it's also very
convenient to go between those there's
also the feather project Apache feather
that does the same sort of thing that
has a way of of going between our
notebook our data frames and python data
frames we'll come back to that in just a
minute so here's an example of how you
would mix languages
using beaker in so you have different
cells in your notebook you know Python
cell you just if you want to create a
variable foo on the global beaker object
you said beaker dot foo inside it equal
to whatever it is it could be a string a
number a vector whatever then if you're
calling it from another language that
uses the same dot convention you could
call it you could retrieve the value the
same way you said it so if you were if
you're calling from Java you could just
you could have beaker dot foo on the on
the right side of an equation R is a
little different so you have to use this
beaker colon colon get function to to
pull things out of the global object and
set to put them back in so in this case
so I have hello world I stick it into
the global beaker object in Python then
in our I pull it out do something with
it say then I want to create a new
global variable answer I can set it in R
and then read it back in in Python now
one quirky thing there at the bottom and
I don't say beaker dot answer I say
beaker that answer bracket 0 because
there are no numbers in our there's only
vectors so when I set this thing equal
to 42 I actually set it to a vector of
length one containing 42 so that's why I
have to read it out as a vector even
though I put it in as a scalar all right
so some of the different languages
supported by beaker for our purposes has
our that's the one we're talking about
today and it has several these other
nice things incidentally it considers
Python 2 and Python 3 to be separate
languages so alright and then the the
final way of mixing are with other
languages that I wanted to talk about
was our marked down so this is more in
the spirit of org-mode markup similar to
Jupiter or
beaker notebooks but it's it's more
text-based so if you're dealing with
Jupiter you know you're you're working
in a browser and there's there's things
that are hidden from you if you're using
our markdown you're working in a text
editor until you want to export that so
you're working in your text file and say
okay I'd like to see this h2 as HTML you
export it that way but you're not
working in a browser per se and like
with with beaker you can exchange data
between R and other languages via data
frames and because this is meant for
this sort of document based computing
there are a lot of different ways you
can export our markdown different
journals have style guides for if you
say here's a our markdown file that I
want to export as a journal article for
this journal you can do that you export
to like to export to HTML and different
variations on that so some of the mark
languages supported by our markdown one
that may not be familiar is the stand
last one on the list stand as a language
for doing Bayesian analysis Markov chain
Monte Carlo and so forth which is
something that's popular in our so
here's an example how you would use our
markdown to use a language you just have
three back ticks and then give it the
name of the language in braces and then
just write your code and then three
backticks two to end it so inside the
our block I'm just writing are inside
the Python block I'm writing Python and
you can exchange data back and forth
between languages not functions as far
as I know but you can exchange data
between the your your blocks using data
frames and just go back a second one of
the languages supported by our
down is our CPP so if you have our code
in your your markdown file and you want
to optimize a bit of it you can create
another block of our CPP code and call
that code from your R code
all right so in summary why would you
want to mix R in other languages
typically you want to call out from our
for efficiency where you want to call
into R to grab some functionality R has
a number of differences if you're if
you're wanting to use are just like your
your a Java program you just want to
Radar for a few nice things that it'll
do for you a few things to watch out for
there's some quirks you know an array of
numbers might not all have contain
numbers etc and one thing about most of
these approaches is hardly any of them
worked on the first attempt that's just
the nature of the beast some of these
things are a little delicate and how you
install them promote for most of these
I've had issues where LK works on this
computer doesn't work on this computer
because maybe ours in a little different
location and I have to tell it where R
is or or the phase of the moon's
different or whatever so I will say la
these methods are a little bit finicky
and a little bit difficult to set up we
talked about work Babel and if said yeah
org Babel is the one thing that worked
very well on every platform that I tried
it on every computer I tried it on it
worked as documented but then again
maybe not as expected but if you if you
do read the documentation it does work
as documented and in general the most
mature most powerful way to connect
between R and something else is through
our CPP so if you have a projects not
not written in C++ you can use a foreign
fun
an interface to go through our CPP to
our which is probably the the best
overall approach so if you want detailed
control over exactly what's going in and
out of our our CPP is the way to go if
you don't need that then in some
languages you have a higher level
interface for going through things
alright so be sure to write the session
and if you want to if you have any
questions I'll I'll take questions right
now but if you think of a question in a
few days that you'd like to ask me you
could email me or you could check out my
website or whatever there is my contact
info and thank you very much okay so
which language do you prefer to use with
our and for what so most of the time I
use Python because it has what I need I
mean our is a is a statistical language
it's great if you're doing statistics if
you're doing more general programming
you have to do some file munging you
have to create a web service you have to
do this or that you know those kind of
things maybe could be done in ARB it's
kind of awkward the thing I like about
Python is it's not a bad language for
anything that I want to do maybe not the
best but it's it's okay so I can stay in
one language longer if I do that if if
the Python is efficient enough if it's
not fishing enough I usually write C++ I
don't in general I don't try to make
Python faster I don't try to make are
faster if it's not fast enough
I just punt and go write C++ because
then I know that it'll be faster whereas
if you try not make a scripting language
faster you're going upstream you know
you're going against the grain it might
work but you might spend a couple of
days trying things and get nowhere I
prefer just not to do that
so that was one question through the app
other questions live very yeah good
question so how does this work a
production versus exploration yes I have
used have used this in production with a
little bit of fear and in some cases and
not others so with the Haskell R we did
use that in production that is I think
that's that's safe the the people who
are developing it know about the look
the quirks of our memory allocation and
handling exceptions if something goes
wrong I'll they did a very professional
job of integrating those two and there I
could use are in production without
hesitation if you have some R code that
somebody gave you so okay here I've
written this R code all you need to do
is put a web interface on top of it I
would be afraid of that no matter how
well no matter what tool you're using
because people who are writing are for
their own use don't think about how
things are going to run on a server
they're print statements there could be
something where they're expecting
somebody and or something or whatever
it's not just not ready for a production
environment I've used the Rd comm thing
in production again with a little bit of
fear and trembling but we did we set up
quarantined it on its own server and use
that in production most of these other
things would be more for interactive
exploration like I guess somebody could
use Emacs in production to include
things together that would be kind of
strange but I maybe you could do it yes
sir okay yeah so the questions tools to
translate are to JavaScript so you could
run it in a browser I don't know about
that but our studio has a project called
shiny that will let you develop
interactive web page
using our yeah by the way I have a I had
a quote from Hadley Wickham I meant to
say more about Hadley he's now at our
studio if you're going to use our
seriously look up Hadley Wickham and his
website and all of his tools he's
written some fantastic code that that
protects you from some of the weirdness
of our he's he's written a lot of really
useful tools that let you kind of work
at a higher level
other questions all right well if you
think of something later shoot me an
email
I'll be glad to answer it later if I if
I can all right thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
