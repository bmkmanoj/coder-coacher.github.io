centrally the beginning of the beginning
of the comfort they they said Anne
Francis doors never Francisco boy I can
put the building and I'm a developer
advocate for Google not alphabet as
they're filled out of it but there's no
alphabet cloud platforms at least for
now so what I'm talking about today is
I'm going to be talking about go to me
and there's a talk that I gave go on UK
which is a conference in London last
year about program analysis bingo and
I'm going to lie velocity on all the
vehicle permit on the difference between
the atomic analysis static analysis men
of the different examples of those tools
that we have an apartment and then I
decided that this time like you to
completely the opposite ignore the
theory and just write code and show you
all the things that you can do it go
little bit at myself I'm a vocal
advocate for the go team and the Google
cloud platform and i'm on twitter if you
can see that that's my first name and
i'm also github so you can send messages
or buzz over full request whatever alexa
go so on the agenda there is basically
three things I first I could like to
know a little bit about yourselves even
those hiding on the left side of the
room and so how many of you have really
good before okay how many of you have
never been in a single line of girl cool
that's a surprising amount of people and
I'm you're going to be showing very
complicated girl stuff we're going to
write two things one is a hello world
and the other one
wetter so it's pretty simple done like
don't get too confused but there's
anything that is not geared to ask
questions the length of the talk
completely depends on the level of caffe
which means that I'm not really sure how
long it's going to run it should run
around 40 to 45 minutes but if we have
more time I have extra material I mean
we don't have time it now just we can
chat about more things if you try some
objects but if there's anything that is
not clear or any questions you might
have just feel free to raise your hand
okay so that's what I'm so I'm gonna
hide that paper now I'm gonna start when
I completely empty directory there is
nothing there you can see it cool and
the important thing is that I mean go
everything that you write all the code
that you write is in your go path
environment apartment and go back in my
case something go pack is my home which
sounds very deep but it just basically
everything that I writing code and go
will be somewhere inside of my mind and
that will generate three directories it
will generate source that contains old
come inside there's github and Google
because I have internal stuff and be
yeah bunch of different things and if
you look in tell them you're going to
find basically all the github code that
I'm a half years ever used it will be
there that is also key kg which is work
I compile stuff and you're going to see
that there is a couple different
platforms so there's go mobile and
there's
darwin which is the one I'm using also
Darwin for App Engine which is when I'm
writing code for a better and finally we
also have the binary that contains all
the binaries so when I compile some
gogoat and generate a binary I'll just
put it there and that is my environment
that's everything we need to know for
now ok so I'm going to start by writing
actually open I'm going to do it as
simple as I can it's actually very hard
for me to use go without any tooling so
I'm going to do text edit so you can see
how it feels to actually write go so i'm
going to write a HelloWorld so package
may function main out a little bit cut
up go down a bit ok hello go to and that
is my goal program and have to do import
fund we can also found shirt for forward
no don't auto correct me okay and that
is my goal program and let that hello
world and its really yucky but let's try
to run it how do you run in and go crazy
go wrong man go go oh yeah that's a
really funny okay and text edit actually
adds magic things in the middle so I'm
just gonna do package pain important for
me Franklin I go
Go Go remainder go hello chica cool we
have our hello world very simple now if
you've read any girl code you will
realize that this curve doesn't look
black code that you normally see the
formatting of the code is actually not
correct and that's actually going to I'm
going to talk about at another time
another tool that we have which is
static analysis tool but the saiga nice
tool that everybody will go community
uses all the time go found and go fault
what it does it's formats Yorker so it's
basically a free printer it's a very
opinionated 3d printer you cannot do you
need to look like you want you want your
 to look the idea is that the whole
community agrees on how the code books
which means that overcoat in the
community losing looks exactly the same
nobody nobody loves that specific format
but everybody loves that there's one
specific form so how do I do that well I
can do go fund oh man go go and that
will reformat it and didn't do much
really it just added those two lines
because they need to be there but the
cool thing is that this actually of town
you can also to W to rewrite and now my
main logo looks at you and this is
something that you're going to see every
single time that I'm going to use my
editor every single time that I same i'm
going to be running back so let's use my
editor where did it go there you go so
i'm going to be using vs code which is
actually pretty awesome okay so that is
my program if i add a line will remove
it go so that's the first to go font and
go to go go run what happens you can go
if you don't have it well it will not
come by if you try to run this directly
it will just say i don't know what font
is you need to import it and if you
import something and you don't use it go
will complain about the fact that you're
putting something and you
and this is something that a lot of
people the beginning cool thing about
because they find in pre annoying the
important thing to know is that again
there's another tool that will do that
for you and this too is Coco import and
go import what it does is if you're
missing any importance even you will
happen for you so I just say there it
just adds it and if you are using
another one on the logs it will add it
to and then when i remove it you will
remove it again so you can't forget
about all that import statement all
those things are automatically done what
is cool is that it is not is that this
doesn't only work on the standard
library that is cute but the cool thing
is that i can use all the things like
for instance there's a package called
guerilla which is a web toolkit imagine
that i want to use your honor i'm gonna
have these two because if you declare
local viable and you don't use it that
is also a competition or original you
see that the way it works is that it
went on my go bag found open code found
a package name with the name max that
has a function named new router and take
it out so that's actually pretty
powerful image that i can forget about
import statement which is really nice
cool so more things that are called
about go to me so I should go run nado
know and that is very nice and it makes
it look let go is interpreted which is
completely false go is come back and it
generates static batteries so you can do
go bills and when you took a bill now
you have that fine and that file it's
just a binary that you can send around
and you will run on any micro s 64 bits
what if I wanted to build something that
runs on
let's say doctor so I want to build at
liquor binary well it's actually very
simple go as Linux go bill and done now
I have a limit binary which is very
powerful the coolest part is go as
windows and on my Mac I just generated
dammit up exit and this works out of God
first computation is a very powerful
tool and is one of the reasons a girl is
very popular when you're creating client
when you need to distribute those
clients instead of distributing if you
imagine if it was a Python script you
need to make sure that the host that is
going to run that python script has the
good version of Python and also the
dependences when your soup when you're
providing a binary everything is already
there just need to provide a good binary
there's one more option let me did in
this demos know this conversion which is
going strong and going so what it does
it compels it and he installs the
battery on my thing so now I can go find
here been dead that's it that's it and
that's actually what you're gonna do
muscles I'm going soul or even there go
get go get is the coolest one of all
then it does a lot of things at the same
time so if we go to github gum go on
example okay I have something there I'm
gonna have to make sure that I'm not
cheating I'm gonna delete that right I
don't have that code it might be
possible anymore and now i gotta do is
I'm gonna do I want to run the example
hello world in fact that
Rick Rick oh so I can do go get it hung
com go learn / example / hello now
that's going to get help downloading the
code installing it everything together
including the binary on dope ass Dean
and that's actually pretty much what you
end up doing most most of time you write
your code inside of your boba then you
go get to install get the dependencies
etc any questions for this part so far
that is actually very simple that
there's the basic basic steps now what
else can we do well we can do go list
and go this is a very interesting too
because when you're running it just says
this is the name of your package which
is pretty boring because I can do that
with pwb right what is near here well
you can do things like well give me the
with using this format and then using
this ad and go template so i can use go
name and the name is the name of this
package the name of packets may kiss the
binary but also i can do doc and that is
the commutation I didn't write any
documentation so there's nothing in
there that is pretty sad i will write
some documentation so i say i catch me
says hi whoop and now everyone again
says package menses are cool not very
useful but you can do all the things so
give me all the import statements and
that is pretty powerful because you can
run this on whatever you want to run it
so i could run you know there's the
strings package in the standard library
what does string depend on it depends on
errors i owe you
and you can get a feel and if you want
to be a little bit fancy you can run
function yourself that I'm a part of
that template so you get the physics and
then outside you can build tools on top
of your go programs that are very easy
because the gold tools are ready there
the goal is to is already there for you
I showed that one of the ways of getting
recommendation for a package is doing go
list ah with a format duck duck which is
one way but they're not the best one the
best way is to run go dog go Doug will
give you the documentation for the
current package but also you can do yoga
for strength and it will give you
recommendation for all the function of
the strength in the strings package I
can do also i want to know the
recommendation for the strip to convert
function on the strings package and then
we'll get you exactly limitations and
that is cool but very often when we
reading the permutation ab browser works
better than the command line so you can
do start is on the board 60 60 and what
happens if i visit the port 66 now i get
to go home page and that is actually a
locally run version that go home page
the cool thing is that when i click on
packages I don't get only the standard
library I get all the packages on my
computer so I can go and look for the
example hello that we have that is a
minor so I'm gonna have it that's good
for strange you're going to say this is
a strange package that is inside of
coronaries whatever the important thing
is that off sign we got all of these
things for free you get
get all the examples and you can create
a around when you're writing code is
actually what you want to be checking
out you want to make sure the condition
that you're generating also generating
make sense okay okay so that is the end
of the basic stuff now let's run a web
server so how do you run a web server
first thing is say I'm going to handle
all the requests that start with / which
is all the requests with hunger that
I've already a minute and listen sir a
TA and humbler is something that given a
response rather and keep it request hey
that's something and just going to do
hello Chicago so that is my whole web
server that food web site and I can
demonstrate you it works by doing go run
makeup go and it doesn't work what is
going on I think I know yes so it's not
working at the worst part is that it's
not working but it's not telling me why
which is the awful part of it if it felt
very less it tells me is like it's
because you don't have rights to buy no
port 8080 or whatever be happy with that
but it's not saying anything so in gold
is no exceptions we don't use exceptions
at all instead we have this concept of
panic and you don't panic you Polly
panic exceptionally you should not be
panic all the time right so instead what
we use is we use the concept of errors
and those errors are values returned by
functions but need to remember to check
them now if you have an error that if
you have a function that returns
something and
there you cannot omit the fact that that
error has to be explicitly permitted you
have to say underscore to say I don't
care about this error I'm not checking
it but I know I'm doing that but in our
case the problem is that are one of the
functions is returning only one error
and we're not checking it and there's
two ways of finding this out one is
reading the reading your code code
reviews and all that stuff the other one
is truly and this talks about doing so
there's actually one function 112 cool
air check that does exactly that and it
tells me I an hcv a semester that
returns an error and you're not checking
so you should definitely check it out
error cool so let's go back here and we
can say we can see the documentation for
listening sir it says listen and serve
that given an address and hunger it
returns an error that error is not
checked so let's check that
cool so now everything that I don't you
just I'm actually taking for their in
these case you could you don't even need
to check that error because this is a
web server if it stopped serving
something went wrong for sure so that
error will never be nail but that's
right let go by that okay so I'm gonna
try again go run mint or go okay so Lisa
this is the 8080 fell because already
there is someone already hastening on it
and it's because i was writing that
before cool so i stopped the other
server let's try again and again that a
no dialogue it's mac OS way of saying
the web server is working so localhost
8080 and cool so now we have a web
server that is actually running not only
that but this is a 75 minutes no wait no
7 X that is it much better yeah that is
much back there is a 7 X web server that
you can just put on production and
running well you should add probably SSL
and stuff like that but other than that
here buddy runs it has everything it
needs to run a production so you eat
nginx or anything extra to write go I go
in web servers everything is in the
sound elaborate cool so let's make it a
little bit more interesting and by
living more interesting I mean worse so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
check on the path of the end of the
request I'm going to check if it's an
email and if they know and we at donut
on board I will do something otherwise I
will do something else so I'm gonna say
in my panties but and I got to do the
worst thing you can do every life which
is important regular expressions I'm
gonna say I must compile they say and
it's something going good org that is my
regular expression is ok so matched fine
Oh strings match back so I'm matching
that if match is not now then it means
that actually found something inside and
I'm actually going to extract that so
I'm gonna bring in F frontin hello
gopher and I got a key the name match of
one which is actually the thing it's a
regular expression so whatever at going
on in their nectar otherwise it's going
to say hello dear back when it doesn't
compile that is sad oh how many how many
I want too much of him why not our third
path is not art that URL the path and
that fpl and a printer cool that's the
compa that doesn't compile cuz i'm
actually forgetting the fact f printed
and receives a writer so where are you
right and now all the red things are
gone the compiler is happy but that's
not enough there's actually other tool
that is running which Go Go vent and go
back what is doing is a statical a
static analysis of your go go that works
really fast so you can do it on unsafe
basically and it's going to tell you
things that aren't correct from the
point of view of the compiler but
probably you're wrong and with that
probably it means that they're mine it
might have false positive it happened
something
I in my personal code name is in it
there's some weird cases where sometimes
you might want to add a little comment
seems like I know what you're doing let
me let me do this okay so what this is
saying it's saying you're calling free
println and then you're passing a pot
formatting directive oh yeah if you
doing things that's not for Internet
that's great dad so printf and it
doesn't open anymore print them and it
doesn't anymore cool so let's try again
go wrong may not go work and if I do
food it says hello dear food it's a
beautiful name ah but if I say go and
old r 0 something went wrong something
went really wrong that's it that is a
panic that is what happens when you
write by a code there's no exceptions
but sometimes you write things that are
just wrong and then a panic occurs when
a panic occurs in a web server the
request fails but the problem doesn't
crash which is nice cool so how do you
fit this let's do something that a lot
of people think it is impossible to the
widow i'm going to set a breakpoint and
I'm gonna debug it now I gotta refresh
crush whether it crush
how I think that is something out yeah
okay let me stop it okay so i started
now my server is running me I test and I
can refresh and I get the brakeman ready
so the support for breakfast is the
support for the Packers and go it's
actually compared to last year it's
actually pretty good right now even on
Mac OS and OS X is not the best place
for debugging pretty but it worked and
okay so let's see what's going on the
next step okay so much matches thumbnail
but what is much well matches the slice
with one of them that has two elements
and I'm actually trying to get the
second element directly so that's
actually wrong what I wanted to do was
get the second element of the first time
that that's on me okay let's write that
again good run yes and fresh and I says
hello go for food huh it's a gopher
which is good but actually just wanted
these so you know what I'm just gonna
drop the first character because I know
the battle it always starts with a slash
so I'm just going to say drop that and
keep on going with the rest yes cool
hello go for full logged off earth says
hello dear France s gmail or so
everything is working cool ship it no
there's a lot of things that I'm very
wrong with this so we're going to do
something that is better than just
trying testing your cutting production
which is running any tests and this is
going to be the first actually throwing
the second dynamic analysis to live in
it using the first one is what's the
debugger so I'm lazy so I'm going to do
a copy paste oh my
test right here actually not even that
one this one here wet test there you ok
so that is my test to say that something
is at the ad test file you need to
create a file that finishes with
underscore testicle and now that means
that when you do go build go install go
get those files will be ignored they
will be taken into account only when you
do go test ok so I pissed that the cool
thing about the import is not going to
say and all the inputs that were missing
up here automatically because they go in
for to know where they are cool now i
can do go test em I guess fail because
it's an expected hello gopher campoli
and God I did not say what I got that is
that's aa go for a convoy any God hello
africa point that is that very useful
I'm just going to change it by strings
contains and it contains a local boy
let's see test that doesn't compile that
isn't worse okay thanks there's
something I'm not able to pass my Oh
test how just say that test
following the string am i testing the
good thing yeah I'm testing the good
thing okay so I'm gonna make math test
much simpler go test now what Oh does it
work the other way not me versus way hmm
my testing is broken on why that is
hello gopher ok so I'm good what I'm
going to do is I just gonna go back I
think that may be the wrong that's wrong
go test that is very sad I don't know
what's coming on ok so I'm gonna fix my
dad by doing something you should never
do which is yes worked Go Go this yay my
desk passes why because I'm not checking
it and just dragging on getting 200 good
enough cool so now now that is my way of
testing stuff don't do that at home I
should write that book but we have a lot
of to see so we give them going ok so
now we can do is I can run that text
also from here so i can do run tests I
can I want to run tests on those package
and it says yeah I want to test out
there any us good now even better let's
show both at the same time that may be a
little bit shown much for it to it
doesn't mean okay so i can also run
tests and get the coverage and i can see
that my desk action are complete it's
testing only one part but it's never
testing inside so probably what I want
to do is I want to say you know what I'm
going to add another test that's hunger
to that uses something that doesn't
match let's run again then coverage and
now I ask now we're actually testing the
whole thing we're not testing anything
but technically we're running over all
the lines of God so that is actually
something that also comes with go test
the coverage is automatically supporting
cool so since everything is working now
the next step is next round so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to run go wrong
man go go go ok now it's running and
that is not what it's supposed to be
running that is going at a good place ok
tuning demo
ok
okay so I run at my server and at the
same time I'm gonna run this little tool
which is not really anything related
where you specifically to to go but it
when it's going to say it's going to run
25 seconds it's going to basically at
load testing of mine on my server it's
very simple statement going to use tango
routines and it's sending all of us at
the same time and once it's on it says
cool i was able to go 31,000 requests
per second which is actually pretty good
but maybe you can do better so cool so
we have these how do we make it better
not go we need more stuff we need more
information right so what I'm going to
do is I got an instrumentation to my web
server and to do that everything you
need to do is you need to import net
HTTP p prevail net SVP now if I say is
it will disappear cuz no import says
you're not using it so you're the minute
but I actually need it so I'm going to
say yes so that underscore is basically
saying i know that i'm not using it but
she'd be there I need because it's going
to be doing thinking about okay around
my mind back again and I becomes
localhost 8080 downloads like it's
working go but now there's this extra
thing which I can do debug people and I
get to this page and this page contains
all the information about my server what
is it doing it how is it doing it so I
can see that there's four girl routines
I guess you wanted story there's not
much going on so I gotta run I got
in some traffic ok now we have tango
routines actually working and you can
see that some of them are serving its be
some of them are waiting for connections
to arrive which cannot accept we have
our server running and waiting for the
traffic go so the next step is well I
want to know more about it actually
there's something that I forgot to
mention which I like a lot you can also
see the heat and the heat has a huge
amount of information and you should not
try to understand it but at the end it
says how many go how many garbage
collectors having run and also it tells
me the nanosecond for every single pass
in the last 156 process so you get parts
taste the extra to do extra monitoring
and that's actually something that
people do very often but I'm actually
pretty easy so no I don't want to write
that tell that to myself instead what
I'm going to do is I'm going to do go to
pee prof. i'm going to run it for five
seconds then I point it to debug p pro
pro what is that I don't know how to
read a keeper pre go to profit nice i
think sometimes i'm not able to read
what i write go so that's going to be
writing during five seconds and i have
deep rough and deep rough set ready to
go very cool tool that a lot of people
use and what it's the first time that
you see it you do top and there's
nothing it's like what and why is that
there's nothing because i get to prop up
with no traffic the error okay let's
let's run go work again and let's do
again five seconds now with traffic and
now after five seconds i'm a couple
tears because otherwise my computer
start and at the top and I'm still like
what is that is a lot of information and
run them and stuff like that but not
very useful to me I want understand
what's actually going on so you can do
when it's going to show you this cool
graphic with all the things that are
going on and somewhere in there you're
going to be able to find serve it to the
be made the hammer that is actually the
code blue bro these little thing here
and you need to understand everything
that's going on inside so it's actually
not that useful it's kind of going to
get it to understand what's going on so
instead what I'm going to do is I'm
going to replace I'm going to still run
good I'm gonna replace all of these with
go torch actually it's go torch during
five seconds and this is going to do
exactly the same thing but it's going to
present the data in a very different way
in a way that I like much much better
which is a flame graph how many of you
have seen flank right frameworks before
call it especially people like down from
Ruby and Python or buy used to it if you
were coming from C++ Java that they're
not that used to it ok so I'm going to
just open the torch and these White's go
bankrupt because it looks like a flame
the goals are completely random so it
just so it looks like a thing that's why
it comes out some of those colors but
the important thing is that basically
you have for the every week is actually
the whole time that you can execute in
that function and the functions on top
cycling on top other functions are
called by the function pillows so i can
see that there's somewhere here
you sleep before your rider flush that
is wit request finish request serve HTTP
ok and main hangar right here and I
don't know if you can really see that
but we can see that we can see that my
god is not doing what it should be doing
but I'm am going to find the wrong file
let me check I think that I did
something wrong it's at some point
that is Thorin on my couch okay whoops
where am I go to name demo somehow I
change the code of my that is not the
color is being executed minda go okay we
all agree that a huge size must compile
and then here it doesn't write to the
demo go to link devil ok so then only
should not change anything but it did
cast magic cool ok I got around it again
and again around my torch again because
then you will make more sense not not
open but actually generate that torch go
torch
okay and not going to put my torch and
go to mail handler and you can see now
it is much more things we have to find
all strings of match that is saying a
lot of time also we have the mask about
that is taking a lot of sign and finally
we have somewhere there the actual
writing of such the fpf Spain glorious
go so something that you can do what is
it is i'm going to start removing things
one of the things one of the obvious
things is that I don't need to compile
that regular expression every single
time that actually freedom so we're
going to move it out and I'm going to
say just do it once and then we should
work go run either go and run again
we should see that on the net CP here
I'm in the hunger the population time is
gone so not that something that we've
won how can we know that we actually did
better now well we can check your work
again and see that before it we have
actually before we had the maximum
requests per second because I was that
was the fully optimized code that's why
but we're going through twelve thousand
requests per second before it was
actually three thousand that is to go to
talk but at the beginning you get
something like 10,000 so it's a little
bit better now the important thing about
this is this is not good enough because
basically you're blindingly improving
your code based on current traffic of
things instead when sometimes what you
want to do is you want to write a
benchmark to write a benchmarking go it
is as simple as copying pasting and
benchmark is just a different kind of
test so it looked exactly like a test
but instead of having a test in Sochi is
the best testing Duffy and that has an n
that is the number of times that you
have to wrap that test so i'm just going
to copy that forget my test stop the
worker because it's annoying my computer
and I'm just going to love it here
benchmark hunger cool so how do i test
it go there that match and now i can see
that i have how many nanoseconds
preparation likes taking i can also say
bench men tell me how many allegations
i'm actually doing for preparation which
is a huge amount of allocations right
there so that probably one of the points
we have and also you can do cpu profile
profit cpu so now i want to do this it
will generate as
you're all right I can open that to view
your profile we go to pee bro so he
generate that test binary which is the
one that used to run people and I can do
props to you and again on the web and
see the whole thing and that is one way
to put it but I don't like this one so
instead what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go torch binary name is
different test and binary input is prop
cpu open torch and that will open my
handler with specifically what i'm
actually but what I'm actually verified
and will actually in benchmarking so
there's a lot of things that you can see
here one of them is using using flavor
using regular expressions is a really
bad idea I'm actually spending most of
my time backtracking or verifying is am
I actually done so the solution for this
is actually very simple forget about
regular expressions instead just use on
my yoke other code just tag that's this
string finished with at dawn on door and
that's it so before we do that let me
make sure so we have the 39 almost 4000
nanosecond corporation I'm just going to
change that code so replace my hunger
with so now we will use your regular
expressions and just try it again oh so
let's test bench and now we went from
almost 4000 to almost 2,000 and the
location went down by logic again you
could open it see what's going on open
your torch and see that the next step is
probably when you're doing wait what
oh ok it is now so small and I can't
find it there you go so it's actually
spending most of time writing which is
basically what we want to do the hope
the rest of the operation looks for your
brilliance how did you make that better
instead of writing like that just right
bye bye bye if you want you there's ways
of video st. applications I want to show
if you wanted to remove all the
applications something that you can do
actually is you can also do go test man
profile from da men and that will
generate another profile which is a
memory profile again I can do this so
what okay everything is
prov the men and I get the top and that
doesn't really help but if I do list all
my hunger would a fail oh that is sad
nobody should actually show the number
of publications that you have oh I know
object so it will also track no that is
actually here okay go to pee from demo
test problem man Allah objects ah God
objects I'm not able to write today one
sec I'm just going to make it smaller so
it actually worked gay that Alex is it
moves up 90 other one Xavier month haha
that's one flank pillows I love objects
okay and I can do list number and it
will show where all the open all the
applications are happening so then you
can follow inside and understand what's
going on you can also see the assembly
on it and see where the application is
actually happening and it's actually
going F with that directly so that is
that is the point where all the other
kitchen is happening how could you
remove it using different kind of riders
but we're almost out of time so let me
see with a half time for the bonus part
which is sized is actually for equal but
so all the things we saw we saw the go
to that has huge amount of things it has
the old reinstall get test and two but
also
covet build up of this protest which are
very useful and you should be using that
muscle time and then Gallo extra things
going for cooling air check go toward
start things are built on top of the co
ecosystem but are not topical tooling
itself and then guru guru is actually if
you've ever used go Oracle Oracle was
renamed for reasons to be called guru
and basically it allows you to
understand what's going on in your
program but in a static analysis way so
you can actually go to a function and
see show me the call stack show me one
call stack that ship that gets here from
me and it would not run your code it
would just analyze the whole graph goes
to understand how you can get there if
you want to learn more there's two talks
that get more into detail on the theory
one is a profiling optimizing go but
fraction of brown acid is an engineer at
work and he gave a great song the videos
are online my slacks are also lying I
will treat them in like a second so you
can also find Twitter and then the other
talk that I gave analyzing book program
we actually go over all the theory
behind it and the tools all the packages
in the standard library that power these
kind of letters and that's it thank you
very much and I don't know if we have
them dump requested but otherwise you
can plant okay
