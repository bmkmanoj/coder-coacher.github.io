freeman i wrote the book growing
object-oriented software guided by tests
but we've also started work with some
colleagues on a hardware based startup
building grifols for the Raspberry Pi
and this talk is about the painful
lessons that we learn as software
developers are entering the world of
hardware based product development and
the mistakes were made along the way I
hacked he started very very briefly on
my first code was written on the
magistratus but I really came to age
social status seriously in the sort of
the early PC generation nice night on
the spectrum and the thing about these
not that was for these was that you know
stuff didn't work that well you didn't
actually have to take them apart and
plug things in them figure out drivers
and stuff of course in those days you
know you have to do what you had to do
and so that there's a return to kind of
return to our roots partly with this
inertia but machines being open enough
to play with and also they take the
notion being able to take over stuff and
they interest me the reason it's it's
running for the prize that's the sort of
the origin story of the pie is that Abe
enough to even heaven anyway what is
down his name is who came up with this
was an admissions tutor in Cambridge
University and he'd noticed that over
the foot of 10 years that the kids who
came in New less than s before they
before they turned up and he realized
that it's because over time the only
machines they had access to were shiny
pcs which are expensive you can't
measure those or game consoles which are
sealed and they'd lost this sort of
thing that they were doing the school
the stuff that we're doing it at school
where there are that playing side and
breaking and so a lot of the motivation
for this is to have an open system
that's cheap enough it's what 25 30 quid
I don't cheap anyway cheap enough to be
almost disposable and so the kids can
play with it and they don't you know
they're not gonna get into trouble you
can have a bucket of them the corner the
classroom and whatever um personally the
other thing for me was to learn some new
stuff because this is part of being the
after a while of being corporate
Deadwood going a bit going a bit sort of
going off maybe a bit stale so for me
it's it's you know I know this is all
stuff but for me it told you to me the
other partners to explore some areas we
can't do in our day jobs like if the API
design design driver device drivers
which little bit of and also product
development and then there is a sort of
slightly more honorable motivation which
is to help grow the next generation of
techies whatever and try and support
what is turning into quite an
interesting movement sending the UK to
reform the catastrophe that is ICT
education in schools and there's a lot
of work being done on that area to put
our little bit it so
click Harbor this is actually real we're
not making this up so when we started it
was wrong as idea and I hadn't really
come out it was still sort of a clean
when they were having big big production
problems because it turned into a
massive success so we were missing
around this we are doing on this is a
legal board and the difference is
interesting because they're doing oh
really is just an embedded device
doesn't only have an operating rooms
just kind of stuff and it's very easy to
get started and then you can get small
ones which are really really cheap and
it's a great thing to play with because
it's so simple but there are limits to
what you can sensibly program on it
unless you get very clever as this like
the people board is full-scale unix
device but it's not very forgiving and
particularly doesn't have does it have a
figure output which the apply does and
it's quite expensive in comparison it's
about 60 quid 60 70 pounds which is a
what about 60 step to your office you
know so his pie which has and this sort
of turned up in the middle of all of
this and so we sort of switched across
to it and it's got things like Ethernet
you think us being one of those is
actually a my app so you can just plug
in musics computer and then audio and
video and then pins I opens across the
top part of this thing about bringing it
up and platform it's very cheap it's a
700 megahertz ARM processor which you
can now pop up for a gig and 44 gig of
ram I think it's this this is 22 to 23
orders of magnitude more powerful than
the work I did my PhD on
it's lifted on them ah anyway so there
are kind of two aspects to it the one is
because it's actually it's bad fit into
a small netbook in terms of performance
so you can just use it lots of people
just use it as a cheap laptop a cheap
desktop you know just hook into the
telly you know and keyboard and mouse
you buy these kids just put all together
and just use it as a really cute
computer that's a bit more accessible
than your average games console a lot of
people use it for media center PVR
things like that yeah using XBMC and
there are guys from doing some fantastic
stuff with there's a cutie group of
doing you know full-scale high
definition video and fancy graphics and
catheter and that's fine lots of kids
using do to developing things in scratch
which is this practical friendly run but
it's also got the solar aspect which is
you can plug pins into it and and well
that's bit about that is one of the ways
they kept the cost down it's not very
safe from that expect you can actually
blow the blow your plug the wrong
digital pins and so that's kind of like
the motivation for some of the stuff
we're doing the other thing to point out
is not hardcore embedded platform you
know this is not serious real-time
making a robot's fly kind of stuff
although you probably if you want to do
so what we have is is that these sort of
different io pins across the top there
it's a bit a little bit painful to get
to and like I said they're not protected
so this is a gem for paseo these a
couple of cereal
sira protocol forever and then just a
regular serial i/o and this is our first
cup of this discord which is here so we
just kind of extract it out when we all
the different connectors and then
there's a bit of safety in here so you
want resistance and the dogs are things
so if you plug it in all wrong it
doesn't matter and then useful things
like a button and everything this LEDs
and then the sort of helpful power to
drive little devices and things so
basically just to make pie easy to work
with if you want to yeah could you
briefly explain with the aircrews we not
very well general purpose i on i think
is so those are pins digital pins that
you can either set higher low yeah I'm
software in an upward very important
here I squared C or ITC is is inter
integrated circuit bus so it's a serial
blasts way you can address up to 255
different chips on a very simple serial
book bus doesn't go very fast yeah we're
as well SBI is serial peripheral
interface is a faster bus but unlike ITC
where you address the chips by address
by sending a bike to say was chipping
want to talk to with spi you have chip
select lines coming out so you have a
number of lines they had each chip and
then you will raise one of them high and
that chip will start listening to the
bus which means we're limited by the
number of lines that you can bring out
and the right beep I can either bring
out to SP our lives so that limits you
to have to high-speed serial devices are
you plug in there and then 0 is good
old-fashioned 0 just can only have one
thing look into it
yeah and things like so on the original
a key on your back come on it's kind of
that but anyone original you just get
any sort of you know the pins are
exposed but we foot gather together and
then you get you know each of each of
these connectors to see tool to the
ground of power and all useful stuff so
you just plug in connector into its
easier so it's just it's just helping
out a little bit too it's just a useful
button that you can with the jumper you
decide whether to connect it up to make
you power out similarly for the day so
it's got an appropriate pull up a
pulldown resistors and the Aedes got an
appropriate resistor to limit the
current going through the pie because if
you don't you'll end up drawing too much
current through the pine and damage the
circuitry so it's just you can quickly
get some flashing light and some button
input without having to actually do any
wiring up with a breadboard or something
the thing to remember about all the
stuff is is basically what most people
do they get it home and getting LED
flashing yeah and then they put in a
couple's name so i guess for several
buds until yeah and then obviously
there's a lot of people acting on
speciality no shoes things a whole bunch
of different people doing this there's a
couple the sort of the most a couple of
we've seen recently one is called a good
board chaplain for the netherlands i
think and in his is more he's a bit more
hard core than us so he's it's it's a
bit less well i guess you get a bit more
lower level access but a bit less
helpful yeah and then there's another
interesting one that we've seen coming
out of mass university call pie face
which again it passes a bit more closed
in a bit safer and they've got nice
ideas they've got screwed generals makes
it really easy to work with we didn't
get that far
so that's the basic known the other bit
would we be messing with so this is this
this is a more recent version of it with
nap we'll talk over in a bit and this is
a this is the spi interface and we've
got a court extender board which got
some examples down there let's see the
idea is you can get 16 connectors think
of 16 things to plug into and then these
these the ones that to be daisy-chained
so that's kind of like as far as we've
got within the hard way it's and foot
present for us it's been a learning
experience period I think so before I do
that I should prove that this works I'm
not sure everybody will see this stuff
going on about the software so while our
hardware gurus were like designing a
hard way and while we wait for the pie
because I guess anybody needs a pine
when they announced it everyone
immediately snapped up the small run
that they did and then everyone else had
to wait four months before they could
get hold it one now they are more
readily available but they were
surprised if you know surprising to
other people producing a surprisingly
popular everyone to one it's sold out
almost instantly so we couldn't get up
on me dearly so we started off with
beagle bones that have very similar
capabilities and also have a UNIX API to
it so the UNIX user level API is almost
the same so we were developing our API
is on the people by and then when the
pie came have we started work on the pie
but we still didn't have our boards
because they've been through many
iterations so we had we basically had
some some early prototype soldered up
with variables and they're using bread
balls while we're developing our
software just into it for a moment I've
got this all going just to find out you
catch the signet displeasure flashing
LEDs happy a Medusa that's it
these two are going off this is sort of
wrap it round and round this is
randomized this is sort of thing that's
extremely difficult to do on the Arduino
because it's just an event live whereas
unloaded running these are separate
processes and these are all daisy chain
too long so this is the i2c and they're
not doing very much and then this is
just civil sock thing on the SPR just to
prove that we can so it's just evidence
and then our big red button is also
tacked onto the hissy-fuss so that's
just rookie camp right I'll go so yeah
so we've designed the software while
waiting for the hardware we had a number
of goals that we were trying to aim at
with the API design so we wanted it
because we were aiming it sort of
education initially and people wanted to
learn this done and what did it keep it
very simple we wanted to not Holly the
details of the hardware so that you know
learning about the physical computing
this was much learning about the way the
hardware works what IDC buses me and
voltages and pulldown resistors and
things like that as it is like just
writing a nice API am writing to a nice
API at the same time though having done
something arduino work one of the issues
that we found was that the API is on the
Arduino for very similar things can be
vastly different so the API for writing
the GPIO digital pin setting values on
the digital pins it's very different if
you're if the pin is on board then if
it's at the end of an i2c bus where you
have to use a different API so we wanted
some common abstractions for a hardware
that was similar even if they happen to
be accessed over a different protocol
and we wanted to embrace the fact that
the raspberry pi is a powerful little
linux computer it's not a microprocessor
and microcontroller like the Arduino is
it there's a lot of good stuff that can
run on Linux if we want to use so
helpful demons are the programs of run
it at time maybe gooeys maybe web
servers and we wanted to be able to use
lots of the useful libraries that come
with linux and are available on many
languages on linux because it's linux
and because you wanted maybe we're
thinking put it into schools or people
might be connecting this thing on to
their network and if leaving it running
we wanted our suffer to be secure by
default so there's follow good linux
security practices and for example on
the pipe ID for other libraries make you
have to run your program with root if it
wants to access gpio we didn't really
want to do that we wanted to limit the
attack surface probably not really
worrying too much about i dinna mafia
trying to hack a bank account but maybe
you know school kid playing pranks or
try to hack exam database passwords or
something just good you know better to
be secured by default and then they have
to worry about this kind of to me
fingers crossed and as Steve mentioned
in hardware interfacing is basically a
concurrency issue you're dealing with
events outside your computer and trying
to juggle reacting full of these events
so we wanted to make some accessible
concurrency abstractions that would
allow people to easily handle the
concurrency aspect which is quite tricky
in the Arduino once you get beyond a
certain complexity rated to the API for
the idea between it Chuck's a problem at
you and you have to try and deal with it
with building an object models or what
have you and hopefully provide something
that makes that a bit easier so these
are kind of contradictory goals how do
we make something very efficient for
Hardware access and at the same time
than brittle Linux your goodness and we
can't fight an API for everything so
we're going to plant our flag in the
ground and say what we're aiming at is
an API for a sort of making your rugby
pie join the Internet of Things maybe do
sensing and publishing with to the
internet and interacting with the
internet that needs internet to physical
devices rather than something like
robotics so we're not optimizing for
speed and raw access to the devices and
real-time response which might be
necessary
robotics we're tending towards safety
and security and ease of use for allow
you to quickly not things up and
connected to the Internet so looking at
the software space around physical
competing there's a lot of options which
one had to be starved there's a lot of
languages out there that already
available and very popular and you know
you pick their Arduino model anything
that work very well on a linux platform
because it's based on an owner of
constant sort of on a busy loop and
although people have ported it it's not
ideal for fitting into the largest of
linux ecosystem scratch is very popular
with education ruby is very popular with
kids mage is very popular with cool kids
high school is well you know everything
issue about mention high school because
they've already done it probably and
poison well basically the decision was
largely made for us because the royal
blue poly foundation said that the
educational distribution of the right
click x is going to use poison as its
language for education so then i was
down to do on Python 2 or x 3 which is
whenever you don't think it bothers and
that's the big question and basically
plug x 33 because point into is just got
too much legacy craft we're thinking if
we are writing tutorials for people have
never really program before we've really
got to be explaining about the different
venue and i'll start classes and how it
doesn't work in as he put ticket of
things in your class and just like
there's lots of lots of legacy croft and
python to this is an example that i
spent a day debugging and if you say
bikes and give a sequence of white
values in 523 you get a byte buffer with
that sequence of white venues in it and
it buys it to you get that white python
which is not what you expect at all
there was a reason for that and it's a
reason i don't want to have to explain
the new people who need to program in
coming from you know forums i'm saying
like
it's not working and then I'm to debug
there so our overall structure then is a
poison API class library very Python a
very traditional in user space so no
device drivers but extractions that
would allow us to put device drivers in
if we decided we ever need to do that so
on the GPIO side we have a pin
abstraction where you can just set the
value of the pin of direction of the pin
and the pin missile has some properties
and it happens to go get it from the
from the pit the actual GPON on the
device when you actually want to read or
write them and then abstractions for
talking that I to see your SPI protocols
so OTC master is used on the mazda side
of the protocol to talk to particular
slave devices and and an spi device
represents one of the 2i devices on the
Raspberry Pi and then above the ITC
layer we have abstractions for the
particular chips on the boards that
we're producing our expandables like
these are mcp 2017 chips and they
basically provide more GPIO pins to the
device for us access and over an i2c bus
so we model the chip with an API that
split into two one of which exposes the
details of how the chip actually works
so you can actually use mcp 20 and if
your spaces or register to use to
configure the Pinzon and query their
values so it's all of those using all
the names of you see in the data sheet
if you actually downloaded the data
sheets and a manufacturer so you can
just use that the music guy to drive the
devices and then we've got another
obstruction using that which then gives
you the common abstractions for GPIO
pins which we the same as the ones that
is used by the GPIO classes so we've got
a common abstraction for on board and
off for GBA but we are exposing some of
the details if you need to even drop
down and see how
works and how it all fits together and
then off to the side we have a new set
ID of 30 IDC program that provides safe
access to the onboard pin so you don't
have to be rude when you're running your
pipe in code so don't have to run and an
internet-connected server which could
possibly be compromised as early as week
you can run it in normal user space and
user permissions and isolate it and then
it just uses a jeep am programmed to
basically take ownership of certain pins
on the board and back program really
makes all the different programs can't
interfere with each other's pins here's
an example this is the program is
actually running this big red button
here we create an i2c master to actually
access the the default ITC bus on the
Raspberry Pi we create a chip witches
will drop them down to the chip level
here for the using our MC beaton 3017
and so we create some the API to access
and registers with right certain
registers using these obscure acronyms
that we've taken from the from the
datasheet so we initialize its own you
want all the pins to the input all the
pinkies pull up resistors which
basically me as if when we press a
button it pulls it down to ground and
let me say and one is for data grand
report that is a one so that we can just
treat it as a boolean so was impressed
let me just read the registers and if it
isn't 0 obviously we're currently press
so we just detect when it has gone from
not being pressed to be impressed and
then we've basically inspire a URL
request web browser running or web
server running on the Raspberry Pi and
then
we continue holding in that in this
particular example we have wide
interrupts so quite simple quite compact
very poisoning we're using for standard
partisan context manager mechanism to
manage all the resources so hopefully as
simple as we can make it so that's right
playfully well we haven't really talked
about his view so he was also wanted to
have accessible concurrency we can run
lots of programs at once but actually
really want to be able to run lots of
things at once and have them talk to one
another I'm going to make that easy for
people to do so this is a really
interesting paper I found common sense
computing episode 3 concurrency and
concert tickets it's an empirical study
of people who have never done any
programming before giving them a problem
that is basically a concurrency problem
and seeing how well people you've never
programmed can actually solve
concurrency problems and this is
actually a repeat of a study where they
actually reproduce findings and what
they found was so people never
programmed before can actually solve
concurrency problems without a problem
they can recognize them they can come up
with strategies that can solve them my
takeaway is that it's all controller
problems in the problem domain so
hardware is an actually common problem
domain so it's quite easy for someone
who doesn't really answer our
programming and might not understand why
you need a monitor when you want to do
current Katya or lock around concurrent
access to two words at the same time but
they can understand out why the problem
domain is a concurrency issue and they
solve it by a message policy so that's
really interesting and also I like
writing for currency okay this message
passing so we're working on an API that
will apply some of the ideas of my
calculus to doing sort of pythonic pi
calculus on the Raspberry Pi basically
for doing hardware programming
so here's a very early sort iteration of
the API all right Bri and github this
one isn't yet but certainly our Python
areas and people have been using it and
commenting on it and we've been slowly
tweaking the design of as we as people
thrown in reducing of this this is the
final time so here we we could define
types of tasks we're just using a task
decorator so here's a Tarsus an LED
given a pin and an input channel it will
receive a value than the input channel
and set the pins value to that and just
continue to do that waiting for it
something to set the painting here's a
task that toggles a value they've given
a rate at which you want to set the
value up or down and an output channel
it starts off a false and then
continually sends the state and it's the
same through implement and we can
compose these tasks this is the i think
the beautiful obstructions of beautiful
concept 200 I calculus is that it's not
just threads and monitors is it it
creates a concurrency or process algebra
in which you can build processes by
composing processes and they have very
clearly understood semantics when you do
so so to create something that blinks an
LED I create a channel and then I have a
parallel composition or toggling which
that there's a things on to that channel
and an LED which receives from that
channel rise to the pin so I've composed
two processors for a new process and
then my main program is for each of the
pins and for a random rate of Britain 8d
bringing for that pin and then i'll have
a list of them using some pythonic list
comprehension I run the mall in parallel
and I run them as my main program so you
can quit quickly plug together pieces of
concurrent behavior and propose them I
met with message sending to build your
top
current chief solution early days yet
and makes people want you to do nice but
we're going to put it out there and see
how it works good yeah a couple points
of order in the middle of that one of
which is the name pie in raspberry pi is
not to miss it's not an accident which
is why we're working in Python because
that was part of the original plan and
in case of notice we're actually served
this is actually a browser that's being
served on the map which is being served
from a web server on the pie the Python
web server that's how the button is
talking to acknowledge so we got all
that going as well so a couple of things
explain things what is the other side we
have to go physical it wasn't busy and
it's a bit of a certain force for me
it's a bit of a change you get to live
too much in our heads in particular if
you're doing large for enterprising
systems as you never get to think about
to deal with anything as low level as
this and you kind of forget that beneath
it all there's some silicon some
electricity and ghost of the bits and
pieces and just the kick from FV that's
actually sold it up actually getting a
solving on for the first time in
literally decades and try to make
something that looks reasonable
remembering things like don't pick it up
from the hot end
don't reach for things when you have to
hop and when you have an eye in your
hand all that kind of stuff it's just it
takes you somewhere else that I haven't
been for a while more conceptually
there's like the snow the other thing is
is you start to discover that physical
objects behave differently from physical
objects not binary they're not digital
perhaps as a bitter words you get stuff
that looks right but it doesn't work
because there's a dry cell joint you
can't rely on you have to be a lot more
careful because you have the line the
stuff particular when you're assembling
things itself and carbon and stuff
actually working and you get it you get
side effects like this morning or the
last night while we're trying to get
this thing to work we reinvented the
theremin know about farrah mean it's in
somebody's played by moving you pick up
your move your hand up and down yeah so
we're even better one of those this
morning last night which is why me I did
you read it but it's tough that that in
my normal day today I just don't get to
see things like different manufacturers
you send off a spectra board like this
two different manufacturers it comes
back different it's not a one of our
colleagues fans very nice manufacturing
very nice colors it came back and the
pins of the holster to score because
they use a different something like that
so there's all these boards we can't use
etc etc coffee coasters or something
and the other thing about this is that
you can actually break the hardware so
if you plug you know if you play block
put your mains power into one of these
things then it will blow up and there
are more subtle things you can do to
sort of degrade the circus and that
tends to mean that some of your decision
is a bit more irreversible and you have
to move a little bit more carefully so
the nice example of that this is this is
just this board the are made up on my
first major attempts and it's not
obvious but that diet is the wrong way
around and take unfolding it and putting
it back together again putting back the
rubber around it is a ride pain it's not
losing that more than and suddenly on
one of these these little them active
seaboards the first time I did up for
the socket in the wrong way around yes
you have it and when you've sold eight
of these you realize it the wrong way
around that's too much trouble so you
learn to be a lot more careful perhaps a
little this refactoring is harder
unfortunately but it's just harder did
you find out that the down the family
room overlooking ah I can't remember to
be worth I think I was trying to connect
to the puzzling and stuff just wasn't
happening
something noticed that this was the
suddenly looked a bit different it took
a white took different uses very much
Vanessa so that's a nasty council to
Willie other things is because now
you're working across the hardware
software boundary at least I to me and
so you're debugging Wayne your car just
what work what's wrong with this code
this code is perfect what's wrong with
it oh my dad's wrong we're at vice versa
so it sort of does spread your to make
your skills right oh yes the other
things have to get organized and so it
does it does get a bit messy this is the
area of work colleague Rask Joe walls
who is just I don't know where he passed
the time yet you've got the whole thing
as well as all the stuff he built and
the software right he just been up your
sleeves it's hideous we're sure I can
take off but you because you find
there's a lot you end up with lots of
little bits and pieces and then the last
thing you want to do you need stock so
your last thing you'll be in the middle
of all these and you run out of
resistors or something something another
he's all on the web by the way if you
don't you've got a whole thing all all
the useful things you did that you
picked up or you know run out of run out
cable the last thing you want to have to
do is go down the shops because you
forgot you just remember cable so you
need to stop so this is this is the
ideal what's more realistic is rommel is
desk mine is like this but a little bit
smaller the other things you do need a
good iron it's it's not worth if you
want to do then more than the minimum
it's worth getting a proper iron and
gets hot enough as a proper temperature
control
but snap it I think one of the things
that we found that actually what
surprised me certainly those are even
designing bare boards they're still
significant usability component look at
an early so what we found early on this
is one of our early iterations of the
floor and that is this one right and and
yeah we've designed this to daisy-chain
to later too we were going for Jews all
these shifting ad on boards that we will
wear this is like this one daisy chain
will happen and it's great until you
like them with daisy chain when you take
it out as cross as a whole bunch of
these connectors and also the priests
just produce really daisy chain what
across the gpo connectors which is a
very thing that they're designed for ah
we've been so concentrating on the
schematics on the PCB layout on how to
deal the manufacturers and like how to
check our designs against their design
rules all this you can't really focus on
what are these things physically look
like how people actually going to use
them when they've got them in their
hands and they've got the necks of the
Raspberry Pi and so we have this
suddenly this problem that we want to do
assume usability style you know user
experience iteration but we've got
hardware which takes a very long time to
do the alliteration is on what the
filing was that we will finally these
issues or maybe just a floor and then
you've got either you can get like a PCB
fab done overnight if you're willing to
pay if you collected money will you ship
it away maybe two to three weeks later
so it will come back to your door and
we've got my 10 quarts and then you find
another issue with it so usability sort
of iteration in software you can only
sit down with the user and they'd go oh
can you put like the button over there
or make that a different color make that
bigger or maybe move the screens around
and you can iterate very quickly around
the usability report what not with
hardware
yeah 11 time you sent a little boys off
to manufacture Bulgaria and they let my
holiday from one so yeah we've decided
we have to change the way we produce
these boards and think about the
physical user experience of them much
earlier on the process so you're going
to do some paper prototyping of our
boards and we get the next board design
we're going to be made basically
thinking about the physical structure
than in cardboard and playing away with
it before we actually start working the
schematics you started basically but
that's yeah our latest design you can
see we've iterated or it a lot we now
don't overlap we've got rounded corner
so it's not scratching in your hand as
you're plugging these things in a lot of
things that you don't really think about
when you're focusing in on the
electronics and the actual PCB layout in
the schematic so two people believe that
this is as it turned up this isn't this
is the one before this one because
actually as it arrived this thing was
the wrong way around which meant that
you'd have to put this over there it's
just anything so what we started doing
is actually sketching out ideas for
future board designs on paper and email
them around and and and much earlier
thinking about what do these things
going to look like when they are
actually built we're using to paper
scanners I use paper which is a program
on the iPad called people confusing me
and we may be our ideas get bit fanciful
but you know this is basically we've
realized we just have to dress this
whole usability problem of the physical
feasibility seen earlier on in the
process
so yeah we started this trying to take
some of these lean startup ideas and
build a startup that way but the slow
feedback loop you have with hardware
products have made that actually very
difficult so we kind of fallen back to
some older techniques really we started
off with focus groups we've gone to open
source hardware and rather power user
groups and talk to people find out what
people actually want after these
products and then wrongly started a
newsletter whether you have to sign up
to the newsletter and show some interest
and some engagement with the photo and
and agreed to answer some questions that
we might send out in the newsletter and
we had some real success with an user
interaction finding out what it is that
people want after these things people
are really interested in before
properties out as shown interest and I'm
happy to engage with us and answer our
questions here's our growth / / from
march to august this year we've gone up
to a thousand people on our mailing list
we sent out questionnaires and we see
that when we ever supposing someone out
we get like a 73.5 percent opening which
is about three times the industry
average and i'll click through is about
10 times the industry i prefer someone
who's like open up newsletter read it
interested in it click through to the
question I wanted to answer some
questions about products or the
producers and God will buy into that
through this protest and and that's what
really actually open our eyes and showed
us there you know there's a shoes market
of silver solder asst listen maybe not
maybe you know before we actually trunk
Christmas into schools you know and
trying build products and tutorials and
documentation for people want to teach
you anything there's a huge market
people just want to learn using these
things and and and we
right trying to now meet their needs as
well alright so again if your your use
of this is all kind of obvious visual
team point and but there's now this this
certainly an hour there's this big
division between software people and
harder people and it's much harder
compared to what we used to just sort of
the whole t-shaped thing just stepping
in where you happen to be needed because
we just don't have the history we don't
have the skills so you have to manage
that a lot more carefully one thing we
can do is we can represent the naive
users and so we can have a sort of
discussion inside but have the
experience of using this stuff rather
than without the built and some
perceptions and tacit knowledge other
people who work on the boards the other
thing is is that was we probably ought
to have known but we're surprising it's
just how much slower it is to do this
thing with a distributed team then just
a visitar letting the distributed
software team because one of our guys
lives in France at the end of a not very
good connection and wrongly lives are
now is bust right away from where I am
so it's a little bit of an effort to get
there and the things that make it work
is when you get and you bought in you
just send a copy to ever everybody gets
copies um and things like nowadays you
get good really easy video conferencing
so you have to have the-- you know just
the Skyport
the meetup stuff so you can actually
with good cameras so you can hold at the
board and says what about this button is
that what you meant to do and it's it's
not great but it's a way of cooking so
just to finish this is the great thing
its freedom reason to tinker and this is
the motivational bit this picture is
actually it's a convertible furniture
companies they wouldn't like your office
to look like this um yeah it's just you
and the Machine there's no you know
third but no or internal organization
that's trying to stop you getting SS
machine tango you can't have that we've
actually moved to virtual this year and
da-da-da-da-da it's just using this
little bit of silicon down here which is
a much more entertaining satisfying
feedback loop then submitting a form of
waiting three weeks and it's
surprisingly easy right note the main
thing is it's easy the people have
written the lyrics drivers and got a
little work on the pipe and a fantastic
job it's so easy just to pick it up hook
it up you know learn some basic
electronics and make something happen
and it's a really satisfying feeling
compared to joking around Italy a grid
of data a database and putting in a grid
on the screen and taking some good add a
driver screen and putting it back in the
database yeah that's another huge amount
of stuff up there now and growing and
this is I think if you're going to do
anything sort of smaller than sort of
beginners is actually a bit easier to
work with and say that you are doing now
because for me anyway from our point of
view because they used to line it up
unix and all that kind of stuff and it's
you know you get you get to sort of
stretch stretch of it we either learn or
relearn you just keep up you two people
that used to do this
Sonny does and coming back to it so you
get to resurrect some old skills and
discover new worlds that pets making
mistakes actually soldering your
connectors on diets that are way around
and there's lots of community stuff out
there and the Raspberry Pi meetups are
called raspberry gems of course so
there's a all the puns are rapidly being
taken up so there's a shortage of puns
in this world and so basically the short
messages go for it that's it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
