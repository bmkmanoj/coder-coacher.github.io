before how many of you seen a rugged
talk before I know you have all right
ok
okay so usually I like to start with how
I'm going to finish I think we're doing
a terrible terrible terrible job on
doing software it doesn't mean that we
aren't performing our jobs it doesn't
mean that we aren't successfully driving
profits or creating any value but we
haven't really understood how important
software is and how important your role
is software architects and engineers
have become if you think about it look
up at the ceiling right none of us SAT
here in perpetual fear that this
building was going to crush us right we
have brick we have steel we have
concrete we take these things for
granted because they're dependable right
the bridges we walk over the buildings
you sleep in you know it's reliable
infrastructure the problem has become
and this is one of the founding
principles behind rugged is that our
dependence on software is becoming as
great as our dependence on steel and
concrete but it's not nearly as reliable
in fact I come from the hacker culture
and everything is hackable as long as
someone has the means motive and
opportunity they can inflict harm on
others who depend on that digital
infrastructure now the challenge is we
didn't use to have as much opportunity
but now that we're putting software into
everything well we'll get to that but
what I like to do is instead of telling
developers that they're lazy or
irresponsible or they're putting
everyone in danger that's not a good
strategy what I'd like to do because I
respect the software development college
so that's where I started my first
career was in software development 20
years ago it's that we tend to think
like things and innovations like going
from waterfall to agile or from agile to
dev ops or DevOps to continuous delivery
and continuous everything and a lot of
the things that we've taken we took from
other disciplines so I'm a big fan of
deming edwards deming revolutionized
Toyota supply chain principles in the
40s in World War two Japan one of the
only things we haven't stolen from
Deming is the actual supply chain bits
so I'm going to assert that if we steal
some of these supply chain principles
and put them in a modern software
development not only will you have less
unplanned unscheduled work not only will
you be on time on budget not only with
your operations people have fewer break
fixes
but you'll also have a faster mean time
to identify and repair if I can appeal
to the things that you're already
measured on in bonus Don and
incentivized on and it happens to also
make digital infrastructure safer that's
a really good thing so this isn't so
much a security talk but for the first
time in history I think doing the safe
thing happens to also be doing the
profitable thing so I'm going to
demonstrate some of those principles in
action and because this is a developer
conference I want to show some really
sexy data in a data visualization so I'm
going to quickly go to that I have to
clarify my title so I am Josh Gorman i'm
one of the founders of the rugged
software movement and authors the rugged
software manifesto as well as the eye on
the cavalry movement but between except
getting accepted here and today i
actually left the private sector so i
quit my job as the CTO of sonatype i'm
actually on sabbatical and i'm now at an
international policy think tank focused
on cyber safety at least for the
foreseeable future until we can get some
sanity wrapped around cars and medical
devices so i am still an advisor to
sonatype but i'm not here representing
any commercial interest and i love
zombies by the way one of the things i
like to start with is why do you do what
you do so whether you're at a hacker con
or developer conference there's
something that motivates you as a person
and what I realized way too late after
10 years of trying to tell developers
how to do security better is that any
strategy that makes me have to change
what you care about is a strategy it's
going to fail right people care about
what they care about and I need to meet
them and it embrace them there I wake up
every day and I want to make the world a
safer place I'm a protector some of my
hacker friends are not protectors their
puzzlers they want to figure out hard
problems some of them want to become
famous so it's about prestige so I
really don't know what motivates you but
something made you choose to get into
software something makes you choose to
stay at the job that you're at so
whatever it is that motivates you I hope
that there's something in here that can
help you do better job at what you
already care about so if you don't know
this guy and you haven't read the
Phoenix project this is Jean Kim he's
one of my brothers from another mother I
guess and when he comes from the
security industry he was the inventor
trip wire which is really really
important
for change management in servers and for
system integrity but he kind of gave up
on security because what he realizes
we're working really really really hard
to secure things but the things we're
trying to secure cannot be defended
their indefensible and one of the things
he was attracted to was IT performance
and he did this really amazing study
called visible ops that looked at the
top performing IT companies in the world
and figured out what made them good at
their jobs but the next thing he
stumbled across was this dev ops stuff
and when he started explaining it to me
I started having heart palpitations feel
I said this is terrible like we can't
even secure an agile environment it
moves too quickly how're we ever going
to do this with DevOps so we kind of put
our heads together and we said that
security DevOps was really the end of
security as we know it because there's
really no way with those cycle times to
really do a lot of the things that we
used to do but you know I stopped for a
second I so maybe that's a good thing
and I don't to apologize to my OS
brother in the room but you know I
looked at things and I said you know we
do a really terrible job at application
security so why are we trying to fight
to the death to maintain something that
doesn't work very well we have a lot of
good technology and we have a lot of
good tools and a lot of them are free
and we have a lot of training but the
adoption has been very very poor so I
said maybe it's not a bad thing that's
the end of security as we know it and we
said let's try to instead of being
afraid of DevOps let's look for the
common ground we might have now security
people have a pretty terrible attitude
this is how we view DevOps I'm not the
one that made this slide but I do love
it in some ways we tend to inherit
everything that happened before us and
the sdl and we try to clean up the mess
after but that's really not the best
attitude so what we realize is we're
going to need a bigger boat and we
weren't going to be able to do this with
Justin gene and I putting our heads
together if you haven't read his Phoenix
project is essentially the Bible for
DevOps so we started growing the tribe
and if you recognize this guy it's Jed's
humble one of the co-authors of
continuous delivery and lean enterprise
and we started meeting people like John
Willis from docker and the guys that run
DevOps days and we said let's take the
best and brightest from the DevOps tribe
and the best and brightest from the
security tribe they have good attitudes
let's find some way to have some
collaborate
together and she still doesn't know what
he got into but we we basically started
emerging these tribes and we've been
running these rugged DevOps days or
rugged DevOps tracks at various
conferences for free because we do think
there's a natural fit for us to work
together now who's heard the Marc
Andreessen quote that software is even
the world right anybody basically means
is everyone's becoming a software
company as a hacker I can't help but
think it's infecting the world right
we're putting software into everything
when I see software I know there's a
defect rate per thousand lines of code
and because of that every piece of
software you add is making that product
weaker now clearly you don't look at it
that way we love the idea we're gonna
have hyper connected cars and we love
the idea of the Internet of Things
coming into our home adds convenience
but I want you to think of it as well
that when you add software to something
you make it hackable there is no human
that can write unhackable code the more
code you have the more problems so it's
more of a trade-off and I started
thinking about the best metaphor for
this this still isn't the best metaphor
but metal when you galvanized steel
you're making it rust proof so you can
use it outdoors but what happens is the
act of making it galvanized which is a
benefit right rust proof is a benefit
makes it brittle so these things tend to
break more easily or bend more easily
and I think at some point we're going to
look at software that way and
connectivity that way that when we get
the benefits we want and we can accept
the trade offs we do it and when the
trade-offs are unacceptable we don't do
it but we're not mature enough yet in
fact I sometimes called the internet of
things like asbestos or cyber asbestos
right it was fire retardant it was
lightweight you were an idiot not to
make buildings like this using asbestos
but then we noticed it was causing
massive amounts of cancer and is very
expensive cleanup and we had to condemn
buildings because we were using that
material in an unsafe way so I start
thinking about building materials and
then I look about things like heart
plate every single one of you were
affected by heart bleed some of you just
in your social media accounts or your
banking you had to roll your passwords
again maybe or maybe if you're in charge
of a site you had to redo all your your
keys but if you're a programmer for this
this wasn't a security issue for you
they
was unplanned on scheduled work right
you had to stop what you were doing
you'd be late for your commitment to
your stand-up or your sprint and you had
to do rework now one of the things that
bothered me about heartbleed was that I
think it was a real wake-up call for
people we have this long-standing belief
that open source is more secure than
closed source and it's mostly a
religious belief and the truth is that
while there may be many eyeballs to
notice all bugs and all bugs will be
shallow it's apparently no one was
looking right so either they weren't
incentivize eyeballs they weren't
qualified eyeballs but people really
weren't looking at these core libraries
like openssl openssh and TP some of the
really foundational bits and as soon as
one little bug was found what people got
very little talk about is were 31 other
see bees in that calendar year so a
little drop of wat blood in the water
and all the Sharks circle and what we're
finding is there's tons and tons and
tons of remotely exploitable flaws and a
lot of these core libraries but the
other thing that we found is that only
about half of them got patched so within
the first month about fifty percent of
the internet exposed openssl got patched
it was pretty quick but the last long
tail didn't get patched and in fact the
number is climbing of unpatched systems
because new embedded systems are
shipping with the old openssl library so
that the population exposed nodes is
growing it's over 600,000 last time I
checked with Rob Graham but it's when we
look at which systems aren't being
patched a lot of them are in embedded in
IOT devices or industrial control
systems so Siemens industrial control
systems like the ones that Stuxnet
attacked they were good because they
admitted they were vulnerable and they
can issue a patch that our customers but
a lot of their competitors were also
vulnerable and couldn't be patched so if
you're not in embedded systems or cyber
physical systems maybe this isn't
important to you but what you should
start realizing is as we add software to
your cars and your medical devices and
your electric power plants we're not
writing brand new software for that
we're taking mostly open source code and
moving it over so if those things are
both exposed and unpassable that's a
fairly terrifying thing and if it's not
heart bleed it's going to be bash bug or
shell shock or Apache Commons
collections
if you saw the hospital ransomware that
took out patient care in California it
was just a standard piece of crime where
but they had to move patients from one
hospital to another imagine going the in
the ambulance and you're bleeding and
you're told you have to go to another
hospital because there's a piece of
ransomware that was a flaw in jboss it
was a known flaw and jboss that nobody
knew about or patched so I started
thinking about this in terms of your
life and the best analogy and then I'll
shift to the rugged and in the software
supply chains is you guys remember the
haitian earthquake earthquake in haiti
killed 270,000 people it was very
devastating and there's lots of
humanitarian relief actually 230,000
people it was a seven point 0 richter
scale earthquake and six weeks later
that got almost no coverage no news no
fanfare was a much much stronger
earthquake in chile it killed 279 people
you have a seven-point o richter scale
killing 230,000 people an 8.8 richter
scale only killing 279 people so when
all this the scientists and the and the
seismologist and everyone looked at why
the heck where there's so many fewer
deaths was such a bigger earthquake
there was a lot of factors involved but
the number one contributor was building
codes qi lai had modern building codes
haiti didn't so the earthquakes that
shook the buildings in chile flattened
the buildings in haiti and one of the
guys in the US government said well we
don't have building codes for building
code and i don't want to start licensing
each of you but we really don't hold
ourselves to any sort of standard when
we're placing lives and public safety on
software foundation's so many many years
ago i wrote the rugged software
manifesto before i was even really
concerned about the Internet of Things I
don't think we were even using that
phrase but i'm going to read two lines
from it ones for the security people and
ones for the developer people so one of
things you want to do and still almost
think of this as a Hippocratic oath for
your profession is I reckon knows my
code will be attacked by talented and
persistent adversaries who threaten our
physical economic and national security
the ones that Vela purrs like is right
before that I recognize my co w
in ways I cannot anticipate in ways it
was not designed and for longer than
ever intended in fact if you think about
the guy who introduced the heartbleed
flaw there's two lessons one is I here I
would love to meet the guy but I hear
he's like massively depressed now
because he knows that his one code
commit caused significant damage and in
pain in fact I really feel bad for the
developer whose code causes the first
fatality you know I don't want to scare
people away from doing the profession if
you're a good programmer I want you to
stay in I just want you to realize that
depending on what you're doing your code
may be used in a place that you would
never thought of before but the other
lesson is that it looks like the commit
was that like four in the morning on New
Year's Day so I like to say that friends
don't let friends drink in code so one
of the things that is a natural
extension of the of the rugged software
manifesto if that was trying to inspire
that maybe the things you're doing
matter more than you realized is now
that things are becoming more intense we
started a different group recognizing
that no one's going to come save us on
issues of Public Safety if the cavalry
isn't coming then you're the cavalry so
the I am the cavalry was a personal
commitment each of you can made and I
just stuck this slide in here because of
this morning's keynote but we've been
working for a few years now about 3.com
will be our third birthday on our first
birthday we published a five-star cyber
safety framework for connected vehicles
and we're trying to take the best
researchers and the best programmers and
make sure that they work at these car
companies or with these car companies so
that since all systems fail we want to
be prepared for failure so in a
different day in a different place that
we can dive into that but in general to
tie this off if all systems fail and the
keynote speaker alluded to this we want
you to be ready for failure so when I'm
explaining this to my neighbor basically
tell your customers how you avoid
failure tell researchers you won't sue
them if they help you avoid failure how
do you capture study and learn from
failure we're very poorly instrumented
how do you have a prompt an agile
response to failure and how you contain
an isolate failure so the fact the jeep
cherokee was hacked last summer by Chris
and Charlie isn't the issue the fact
that it could also shut off the brakes
or or kill the engine on the high
is the issue so we have very poor
preparedness for failure and since
you're going to be writing the digital
infrastructure that goes into the next
car I Drive I wanted you to know the
responsibility you have but back to
rugged DevOps okay so anybody in here
self-identify as a security guy don't
see any hoodies so there must be no
hackers because the only hackers wear
hoodies right okay there's one I think
there's a tremendous amount of common
ground and without getting it there's an
entirely different presentation here but
there's five things I want you think of
that we have tons of common ground
between the security profession and the
developer and DevOps profession I think
number one is that we we like to
instrument everything so the fact that
DevOps is about measuring anything and
everything gives tremendous visibility
in actionable telemetry and information
for machine learning when I was at
Akamai was a director of security
intelligence and the fact that we could
have the instrumentation of the fan
speed on a server or the CPU temperature
meant that if we saw a slight spike five
percent change in fan speed we assumed
we were compromised and we can use that
as an actionable security event so I
think the fact that the instrumentation
instinct is there for DevOps is really
good for security number two we like to
be mean to our code so the invention and
the precedent of things like chaos
monkey in the simian army from netflix
the idea that you want to be tested jazz
has this great line that the only way to
avoid failure is to fail all the time or
if it hurts do it a lot right i think
the actually the first one came from
netflix and the idea there is creates
room for things like gauntlet and break
man and a lot of the security tools
we've been building to do automated unit
tests to tighten feedback loops and give
you guys response the second you
introduce failure instead of three
months later after you've moved on the
third one is we both hate complexity
complexity is the enemy of stability
it's the enemy of availability it's the
events the enemy of security the fourth
one is we have accidental change
management which is really really good
for security as you use automation and
orchestration tools like chef and puppet
and run deck and ansible and whatnot you
end up with really good rigorous change
in audit logs which is excellent for
security so all
people in the security that think that
they're cleaning up the unicorn poop are
forgetting these amazing things and the
last one is I just think the attitude of
DevOps is about empathy and tearing down
walls and what I've noticed is if a new
group can give something to the DevOps
community such as software supply chain
hygiene which i'm about to show they'll
get back in spades because the
developers and say how can i make your
job easier you just made my job easier
how can i also make yours easier so back
to the complexity point this is a wiring
job I don't know I hope it's not too
dark and we talk about technical debt
all the time but there's also security
that which grows the same rate and the
idea is that technical yet debt gets
worse over time and we've gotten to the
point where our systems are so complex
that we can't even debug them anymore
the reason i like the micro service is
track in the trend yesterday's we're
taking these big monolithic software
objects that we can't debug or secure
and we're making them smaller and more
manageable okay my battery's not dead
okay but complexity is really killing
the software industry this is a
graphical representation of maven
central so at sonatype I was the
custodian the largest open source
repository in the world so whether you
know about sonatype or not if you've
ever done anything with Java you're
grabbing stuff from maven central and
the dependencies and the dependencies on
top of dependencies and the transitive
dependencies is a mess the number of
pieces of code you have to pull in for
the most basic little function is
getting to be insane so at some point
that complexity even though we're
getting lots of free code and lots of
really good functionality and we have to
reinvent the wheel at some point we
buckle under the weight of our own
complexity well the same kind of thing
happen in manufacturing a long long time
ago so most of the modern software
principles you get came from this guy
this is edwards deming he tried to go to
Detroit to the automotive industry in
the u.s. ignored him so he went to Japan
after World War Two he said if you
follow my lead i will make you a
prosperous nation and a profitable
economy in five years so he went to
Toyota which we now know as a car
company but at the time it was a
textiles manufacturer and he turned them
in the most successful and most
profitable car company in the world
and they had a dominant lead for 30
years before anybody else figured out
how to copy it so for him he just said
look we've got to find better ways to
manage complexity there's lots of things
he did but if you think about those
motivations I hinted at earlier most
developers they want to be on time on
budget with acceptable quality and risk
probably in that order right and what do
we do in the beginning we started with
waterfall and that's where I started if
I couldn't get a bug fixed it was gonna
be two years before I got on her chance
to get a bug fixed then we went to agile
and there's nothing more agile than
goats apparently an agile really
compressed the dev time and the test
time and made it more iterative and it
made us faster but not necessarily
higher quality so if you look at ad
jelyn continuous integration against
those three motivations you did a really
good job of being on time now some
people say the DevOps was really agile
for everybody else everyone has a
different definition for DevOps so it
really extended the promise of agile
with continuous delivery and now you had
agile with ops and you had on time on
budget but what we haven't been paying
attention to is in our speed and a race
to do this we've introduced significant
complexity we're having a lot more brake
fixes a lot more service interruptions a
lot more unplanned on scheduled work and
if you're a fan of lean and the eight
types of waste we've essentially added a
9th kind of waste in muda which is the
unplanted on schedule work that comes
with too much complexity in our software
supply chain so if you want to take a
fuller embrace of deming we go to Toyota
supply chains and he revolutionized the
way that you do this with a couple p
principles and the theory here is if we
add software supply chains or rugged
devops we can go faster be on time on
budget with acceptable quality and risk
so here's two different hybrid cars so
he showed some Tesla's the other day I
want to see how the Tesla does their
parts but when the electric cars first
came out you had to Toyota Prius and you
had the Chevy Volt the Toyota one cost
significantly less so it was 61 percent
of the cost they sold 23 thousand units
instead of 1700 so they sold way more
they made only twenty-seven percent of
their own car versus Chevy had to make
more than half of their own car and you
would think that if they made less of
their own car they must have relied on
more suppliers right but it was actually
the exact opposite they made 27 but
another senator car with only 125
suppliers Chevy did significantly more
so with far fewer suppliers they made
ten times better use out of each of them
and what happened was they just
dominated the competition and the price
point was lower their quality was higher
that you know the Chevy Volt was plagued
with issues including batteries catching
on fire which is yet another mistake in
a supply chain so when you study these
things you basically get three
principles and they're going to come up
in my data visualization number one you
want to use fewer and better suppliers
so you don't pick every logging
framework in the world you pick one or
two you don't pick every airbag company
for your car you pick a proven high
quality airbag company then you use the
highest quality parts from that
manufacturer so don't pick a
five-year-old vulnerable version of
log4j pick the least vulnerable version
in the car metaphor you don't pick the
bad batch of Takata airbags that was
defective you would go to jail if you
used a bad version or a bad batch you
want to use the freshest of ingredients
and then lastly trace which part went
where throughout manufacturing so that
when there is a new recall you don't
have to get a recall for every single
car in your fleets you'd go out of
business you just called people who got
the bad batch so tracking which version
of the airbag went into which vehicle
allows for a prompt an agile an
efficient response in software terms if
you've got three thousand applications
and you don't know which ones are using
which version of openssl when there's a
heart bleed attack you have to test
every single one of them or hope if you
have traced which parts went where it's
really best practices for manufacture
okay how's my time I got a late start
okay
someone give me some hand signals so
when you look at our dependence on open
source I'm not actually complaining
about this we've gotten so much more
done because we don't have to write our
own logging framework or are on
authentication library or on Krypto
we're able to use really good for you
available stuff so we ended the 2014
with 17 billion I think we ended 2015
with a 30 1 billion unique downloads
from maven central and I had a unique
purview into that consumption but the
challenge wasn't so much that we used
open source is that the attackers
noticed so it used to be that if I
wanted to find a flaw in one bank you
know ABN amro I want to find a flaw in
their bank website I would do some
reconnaissance I'd find a bug and I
would attack a bee and I'm amro not me
personally of course but now what I
figure it out is wait a second they're
all using struts2 so if I attack a flaw
and apache struts to I get every bank
right so it really is an amplification
with that shared dependence comes a
shared attack surface and it amplifies
the return on my investment so to speak
so one flaw can have a massive impact in
fact it's worse than that because when I
know I kak chua Lee can attack a bank
that's using apache struts to even if
they patch it I know that if I find
another bug in Apache strats to I can go
back to that Bank over and over and over
because it's unlikely you're going to
rip that out so that dependency comes
with the risks and trade-offs in fact it
was exactly that project that took down
nearly every bank when I was at Akamai
in fact this is one of the reasons I
decided to go into the software supply
chain business was I was trying to
protect them from anonymous DDoS attacks
or from Syrian electronic army or from
sequel injection and cross site
scripting and many of the things you see
in the ojas top 10 but I wasn't paying
attention to the fact that almost all
the attacks were now against known flaws
in open source libraries that everyone
was using so I really think that's when
things changed in fact I said to myself
why are they starting to target open SSL
or in this case apache struts too so I
mapped every single known vulnerability
for the CBS s score from 1 to 10 across
the history the struts project and this
one was the bad one in that particular
bug had been there for 11 years so no
one was looking back to that many
eyeballs fallacy but what you can tell
is that the number of laws and the
severity of flaws are growing up into
the
up into the right and that's not good so
it's open season on open source the one
that really bugs me and most of your
using this even if you don't know you
are as bouncy castle as a cryptography
library right it's actually called the
Legion of the bouncy castle cryptography
AP is for Java but we'll just call it
bouncy castle in 2007 it had a known
full remote code execution flaw it's a
security project written by security
professionals for security use cases
they care a ton about security they
don't need the rugged manifesto they
deeply care about security but everybody
has a bad day because all software has
flaws there's a certain defect rate per
thousand lines of code there's a lot of
code in there so they fixed it right
away they issued an update and in spite
of them having an update immediately in
2007 we kept looking at who's still
using the vulnerable version and it was
thousands and thousands of organizations
there were four thousand unique
companies to download it at twenty
thousand times and put it into 650,000
applications some of which you're using
right now on your iPhone or on your
Android so these are really terrible
avoidable mistakes right and there's st.
same thing for h2b client etc and these
things are making their way into cars
and they can't be patched so some of the
remote interfaces into these vehicles
are using known flaws in really old
versions of libraries and even if they
wanted to fix them they can't so I'm a
little less concerned about the math
being wrong with the Greek letters from
the keynote and a lot more concern about
someone using a ten-year-old known
vulnerability to hurt you and your
family so as we consume these parts from
the cloud we aren't really filtering out
the bad stuff what we see is
seventy-five percent of the stuff
downloaded had a known vulnerability in
it when you put it in your Nexus or your
artifactory we saw that when you do your
automated builds with Jenkins and other
things a lot of bugs are getting into
there and I'm gonna actually just skip
this because I'm gonna show you a data
visualization instead okay who likes
slides when you can do data okay I hope
you can read this alright so back to
that plane that software is eating the
world so here's a piece of software
right
big green piece of software eating the
world the problem is we don't write
software anymore right we assemble it
from third party and open-source
somebody be bold and tell me how many
pieces of open-source you think are in a
modern piece of software anybody Martin
someone says 100 good guess so here's a
hundred pieces most people guess 50 and
the truth is you probably picked 50 but
the software you pick pics other stuff
right there's transit in tendencies so
the average is actually 106 we studied
thousands and thousands or in the first
ever state of the software supply chain
report last year the new ones about to
come out so there's a hundred and six
unique open source projects of varying
size in your code now if it's a mobile
app it's going to be less if it's a big
application it's going to be more but
that's a lot of software bits and parts
right so back to the supply chain idea
from Deming we have a supply chain we
just don't manage it like one now who
thinks that they're all green and
healthy right there was a guy at
Microsoft who once said that software
ages like milk not like wine right it
gets bad pretty quickly so it turns out
that 23% as a ratio have some sort of
known vulnerability in them and who
cares about security if you just want to
be on time on budget but I'm going to
frame this in terms of the impact it has
on software development teams so some of
they'll be low medium and high they're
not all super serious ones like
shell-shocked but in there about a
quarter of the parts that you're using
have avoidable risks in them that will
cause unplanned unscheduled work you'll
have to stop what you're doing go back
to an old project download the new
version you another Jenkins build do
another unit test push it to production
then you can get back to what you're
doing so no one wants to do that and if
it was bad the day you chose it that's
that's completely avoidable so without
paying attention to hygiene about a
quarter of the components we have have a
known vulnerability and this might be
harder to see but we don't have to just
fear evil hackers we also have to fear
evil lawyers so these little purple
rings it's eight percent of the ones we
chose are being used against their
license so it's illegal to use it and
you
open your company to lawsuit I try to
explain to people why is this they say
why is this a big deal no one's going to
sue us I used to do acquisitions for IBM
and if you look at how much money nest
made when google bought them I think
what was it four billion dollars us if
they had had bad licenses in their
software based they would not have been
bought right depending on how serious
licenses are so sometimes there's
accidentally using a copy laughter and a
GPL can get you sued like Cisco got sued
when they bought linksys or it could get
you to me not acquired if you're trying
to have a good exit so this is the
average hygiene of a normal application
and when you think about this this isn't
that big of a deal because not every
single flaw is going to get you hat
right but if you go down to the bottom
here I can see what I'm basically saying
is if only ten percent of these in a
given year hurt you and it takes maybe a
hundred bucks an hour for your payroll
and it takes you 10 hours to stop what
you're doing go grab the new version do
another build get back on track these
are pretty conservative estimates but
what you end up with is with those
really conservative estimates that one
application is going to cost you thirty
hours of downtime and it's going to cost
you three thousand dollars wasted
payroll and you're going to say well
josh who cares about that that's not
that much but this is the base model and
when you go to scale it come on
no one's working on a single application
you're probably touching 10 and the team
you're on is touching a hundred and when
you get to simply even just a hundred of
these things you're now up to a quarter
of a million and waist just for using
something that was bad the day you chose
it completely avoidable and ten percent
is a really modest estimate most of you
last year had to fix at least openssl at
least shell shock at least Apache
Commons collections at least jboss maybe
plural times for each of those projects
because as the attackers are doing it
more so three is all it takes to get to
these numbers three per application so
to me this is a massive waste of our
time and effort and this is something
that starts to get your boss's attention
now even if you don't like those numbers
once you start getting into real sizes
like I work with some of the fortune 50
companies they have 6500 applications
that's 17 17 million u.s. dollars of
wasted development time that's serious
money so I don't convince them to do
better software supply chains because
they want to make you know safer code I
came in some new software supply chains
because they like money right so my
assertion I'm going to jump back into
the slides here my assertion is that if
you use fewer and better suppliers
higher quality parts and you track which
parts go where you'll end up with
material reduction in unplanned
unscheduled work for developers you'll
end up with fewer break fixes for
operations who are measured on five
nines of availability and vas mttr or
mean time to repair or recover and
you'll end up having significantly
reduced attack surface as well and
that's not about having to learn how
cross-site request forgery works which
is also important it's really about just
use the freshest of ingredients we had
one government website using 11
different login frameworks in the same
website so if you heard on the news
tomorrow there's a exploitable attack
and a logging framework you could say
well there's only 20 of those I have a
one in 20 chance of getting hit but if
you're using 11 of them you just up to
your odds of being hit so when I started
looking
at the open source hygiene itself and
I'll just make this point very briefly
you can read this if you want more data
we said how good are the open source
projects at fixing their flaws because
this is you know software on top of
software on top of software and when we
looked in all of the Java projects in
maven central what we found is when they
have a cve or known vulnerability in one
of their direct dependencies they only
fix them forty-one percent of the time
ever I asked two questions how often do
they fix them and how quickly do they
fix them mttr so they only fix about
less than half of the security
vulnerability so even if you're keeping
current on their version it still has
less than half of its bugs fixed and
when they do fix it it was 390 days on
average so over a calendar year it took
about a few hours for some of these
known CVEs to start getting exploited
worldwide and the best response that
some of these guys do is a over a
calendar year and on top of that if
you're not even taking those fixes like
bouncy castle from 2007 no wonder we
have indefensible infrastructure and no
wonder I'm so worried about my car and
my medical devices and my hospitals and
to remind you the hospital that had to
shut down patient care was because of
one known flaw in jboss in one library
just one it was essentially the same
serializer deserializer problem as you
saw with apache commons collections from
fox club so I would say we have a public
health issue I tried to be a little
generous and say maybe they fix the
level tens faster and they do it's 224
days not much better now too that's the
overall population if you look at
individual projects some of these
projects care deeply about security so
they fix most of their bugs and they fix
them within 90 days or so but the next
time you go to pick a logging framework
wouldn't you like to know the percentage
of bugs they fix how quickly they fix
them how much they care about security
because if you think the functionality
is basically equal the one has amazing
hygiene and one has terrible hygiene
this is a pretty easy fix for us to
incorporate into our profession and if
we did so we'd start massively reducing
on plan work in risk
okay so I'm going to skip this specially
because no one here cares about US
Congress things other than to say that
there's action going on in different
parts of the regulatory private sector
and public sector and the idea was
there's actually a push to do something
called the cyber supply chain
transparency and the idea is will
corporations or people who produce
software and goods start publishing a
list of ingredients just like there is
on food so the idea was anything sold to
the US government in this particular
case but many of your governments have
been meeting with in fact in the last 48
hours to say you must provide a software
bill of materials of the third party and
open-source libraries you used in a
machine-readable fashion number to that
list should not have any known security
vulnerabilities or CVEs in the National
vulnerability database and number three
because future vulnerabilities are going
to happen if you have a product that is
not patchable we don't want to buy it
anymore so tell us the ingredients they
cannot be known defective without a good
reason and they must be patchable and
those three things are starting to show
up elsewhere all the big banks globally
through the financial services I sack
have put that into standard procurement
language at least bullet number one they
want a machine-readable software
building materials from other software
providers and then they're going to
cross-reference that for vulnerabilities
state in any given time so they ignore
the last two underwriters laboratories
is very recently in the last two months
put out a cyber assurance program
certification for medical devices and
industrial controls devices and then
require a bill of materials no known
defects without a mitigation strategy
you must be patchable and they add a few
more you must do a static analysis you
must do a pen test and you must do
fuzzing so if you do those six things
you can get the underwriters
laboratories seal you're also seeing big
auditor firms globally start to ask
maybe this is the definition of do care
so if a company is hacked or a piece of
software is hacked because of a known
vulnerability that's negligence but if
there is an exotic zero-day from China
that's fine
you know no one could have blame you for
that so you're starting to put these
things into context and if you go back
to my bouncy castle case which is where
we'll end if those 4,000 organizations
had to provide a software bill of
materials and certify there were no
known vulnerabilities every single one
of them would have said oh there's a
level 10 flaw in this bouncy castle
library is there an alternative one and
they would see that yes it's been fixed
for seven years actually at this point
it's nine years and it would take the
alternative one which is stable API
consistent builds well and they'll move
on and this is how we'll start to drain
the swamp so I want to leave you with
this idea that these two little words of
known vulnerabilities not only is it the
right thing to do for safety and the
right thing to do for security it's also
the right thing to do for unplanned on
schedule work for the break fixes and
this is a one year old report but
verizon does the annual report on how
people are being hacked and compromised
mostly for credit cards and banks they
made this chart on with a data scientist
they said if you look at all of the
successful exploits in the previous year
they tracked it just 10 known SI VES 10
known vulnerabilities so ninety-seven
percent of the attacks there's been some
dispute over this stat but the general
rule holds so 97% not 8020 rule like the
keynote said ten flaws constituted
ninety-seven percent of the global
attacks and when you look at the ages of
those flaws eight of them had had a
patch available for more than a decade
so while I care about exotic attackers
and sophisticated attackers why while I
am concerned about nation states while I
am concerned about the OS top ten I
think this is a very very solvable
problem use the freshest of ingredients
from the known suppliers you're using
and it would have incredibly huge impact
on how systems are actually being
compromised right now so back to the
Deming thing of working smarter not
harder okay so I got a late start I'm
just going to wrap up by reminding us I
think it's very easy to take a slightly
fuller embrace of deming
is fewer and better open source projects
use the highest quality parts from those
open source projects and track where
they go the benefits essentially will be
less unplanned on schedule work faster
mean time to repair when things do go
wrong etc and what we've been measuring
at least in the last year and a half of
this experiment is that the
organizations that did this got a
30-percent boost and developer
productivity just by trying their first
year and don't take my word for it on
the hygiene just take a free health
check from either AppScan or what's the
dependency checker or there's a free
health check from the summit type booth
whatever you're going to look for find
out what your hygiene is and you might
be able to save yourself significant
wasted time and this isn't just about
your day job right it's up to us whether
our big cyber earthquakes right it's not
the presence of the earthquake or the
magnitude earthquake it was were we
ready for it with sufficient building
materials and sufficient building codes
so you get to choose if we're going to
be more like Haiti or more like Chile
and I hope the answer is clear so I
don't know how you're motivated but I
hope at least after this initial chunk
of the rugged DevOps track with great
content to follow that you are motivated
so thank you for your time okay super
are there any tools available that I can
use to cross-reference my dependencies
against the CVE reports yeah there's a
number of commercial and free ones so I
just accidentally mentioned know some
there's a free project for a mask called
dependency checker their commercial
tools from black dock from sonatype from
there's a little bit of one in very code
it's like mostly to respond to customer
pressure synopsis / code nomicon has one
and source clear so there's there's a
growing number of folks that will look
at fingerprinting the open source you're
using and to varying levels of quality
due to dependency mapping there's a free
one from so no type called a app health
check so that's free but if you want to
do that scale usually have to end up
doing some sort of commercial solution
but to get an idea of your hygiene don't
pay a penny from any
just there's plenty of free ways to get
a snapshot of your hygiene okay if
everyone is using proven libraries or
versions of libraries does this not
stifle innovation and the development of
new libraries I think your overall
economics of your choice is for certain
use cases where public safety or human
life are there we should hold ourselves
to incredibly high quality high
assurance high security libraries and
that's going to favor smaller less
complex ones and one of the more my
favorite things that happened after
openssl was you saw libri SSL boring as
a cells s 2 n a series of alternative
libraries that are smaller because when
you really look at the openssl product
it's way too big to ever fix there's
attempts to fix oh there's millions of
dollars being thrown at fixing it but I
like the idea that some stuff can just
be like a wordpress instance who gives a
crap right it's not going to kill
anybody some things require and command
higher so if you look at that as
stifling innovation anyone can make any
project they want but I believe as we
start publishing hygiene statistics and
security characteristics people will
gravitate towards higher assurance
higher quality ones where it matters
okay how do you evaluate open-source
libraries besides CVE oh I had this
really elaborate framework and whoever
asked this question just find me we
looked at number of attributes like
number of committers are they active
committers bug density perm thousand
lines of code fix rates recidivism rates
so happen when you fix something how how
how many tries does it take to get it
right we would look at declared license
observable license we would look at
adoption across the fortune 100 fortune
500 45,000 we would look at who has a
corporate contributor we had dozens of
amazing attributes and you could do a
weighted average score we were calling
this notion project integrity so when
you have a project that has like an IBM
putting payroll onto the project the
project's going to be okay even if it's
not great hygiene it's not going to be
orphaned we saw some of the most
dependent upon projects on earth had
zero commit
they were dead projects so even if you
found a really really bad thing sure
someone could go fix it but the projects
were dead and I don't think we've been
looking at these attributes but those
are just a few that you could leverage
to decide which projects are strategic
and which ones are not okay so before
choosing library I should check how many
qubits they that's one one indicator and
those indicators are not equally
important to everybody but they're
they're observable and their
representations on them perhaps okay I
think we can do maybe one or two more
questions anybody yeah so regarding the
verification of open-source libraries
you mentioned all these different
properties and tributes is there a
relatively simple way to get them or
because you said at IBM you had this
project I didn't have that at IBM but
yeah so it's great but it sounds like a
lot of manpower and time to invest in
something that larger companies can do
but smaller companies what I able to one
of the reasons I default the cve is it's
not the determining factor but it's an
an indicator of how much care goes into
the project to me the the committers is
pretty easy to see the lines of code
total lines of code and the bug bug rate
and fix rate you don't have to do all
those but those are pretty easy to glean
in fact I was encouraging like you know
my former employee to start publishing
these their fear was it's a fair fear
their fear was if they publish people
with really good hygiene they would have
the entire open source community hate
them because most of us are doing really
really bad hygiene on our projects but
my attitude was slightly different I
said what if we just published the
people above a certain quality level and
you give them a gold star and we don't
say who the bad ones are how bad they
are but they're clearly not a gold star
so I would love an alternative
description that won't get everyone to
hate my former employer but I think once
you define what good looks like people
might want to be better and want to be
in that good class and you might see
market behavior
change as well so if you know that only
to logging frameworks have a gold star
you might see a lot of drop off on the
older other ones and a lot of migration
including committers to a better project
so I think we've just started deciding
to play with this as a community I mean
this might be the first time you've
heard of these things but I think
there's plenty of room for for changing
the public health issue to something
more sustainable ok one last question No
ok thank you very much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
