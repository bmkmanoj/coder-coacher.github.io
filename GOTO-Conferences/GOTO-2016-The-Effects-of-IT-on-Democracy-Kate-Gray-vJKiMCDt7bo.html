bit about the influence of IT and
democracy and in the funniest way this
again is sort of showing what I don't
know I'm going to try to figure out on
this german keyboard which one will send
me to the next slide yay there we go
okay so I apologize so I want to thank
catherine Kirk and I want to thank
everyone at go to Berlin for bringing me
here my accent may have you think that I
recently flew in from the United States
I have not I've lived 17 years in the UK
and I'm extremely happy there albeit
let's not talk about the 23rd june until
later in the presentation and i don't
see myself going back to the US and it's
not just because of Donald Trump it's
for a whole bunch of other reasons that
we can discuss over a beer but I do call
myself a reformed political junkie
because there was a time in my life
where I would have been up all night
long there was a time in my life where I
would have made sure that every minute
of every day was consumed by reading
political news and those days have
passed so I'm kind of very much here
because of a very good friend of mine in
the audience Chris Young he had a
situation at work where he was having a
really hard time getting his team his
agile team to work with him I just want
you to know that's not my background I
don't come from a tech background I did
start in politics I went into business
strategy and marketing strategy and what
I really love about being welcomed into
the agile community is the level of
curiosity that you all bring to your
work the fact that you want to be better
teams the fact that you want to try
different things and so again I just
want to say thank you for letting me be
part of this today so when you think
about democracy you came here because
you want to understand if technologies
had any influence on it you want to
understand if it's gotten more people
involved and I did say in that little
thing hmm what was it like 30 years ago
or a hundred years ago but you know to
be honest since that vote in the UK and
the 23rd of June and sense that US
election outcome there's actually been
quite a bit of confusion over what
really is democracy
the painful truth is democracy is when
the majority wins and particularly in
the US it doesn't have to be too much of
a majority or in the case of our
brilliant founding fathers in their
electoral college it actually doesn't
have to be the voting majority it just
has to be the representation of the
states but it was never meant to be
perfect it was never meant to be a
hundred percent it was never meant to be
satisfying for everyone but you know
there are a lot of wonderful images of
moments and democracy that make it
really easy to advocate it people who
did brave things people who did
different things people who went up
against an evil power people who really
were not willing to settle and for me
these sorts of images became a source of
pride and a source of hope even if they
were up against something that they
couldn't possibly win the fact is they
still kept trying and this was the
democracy that I was part of and I
bought into great moments great people
things that need to be celebrated and
then things got a little funny because
when I worked in politics the leaders of
the political parties would meet on a
regular basis for a social dinner there
were no reporters there and they didn't
disclose the location they just did it
because they knew they had to have
conversations they knew that they had to
on occasion find a way to work together
and work through things but that spirit
really has started to go away and
although we still have those moments
where we believe that democracy is
something important and that we believe
that technology can facilitate democracy
what we have to ask ourselves is should
we be hopeful about democracy or is this
time to have just a little bit of fear
needless to say there's been an awful
lot written about this election and I do
need to be honest and tell you I have no
insider information that's going to give
you any sense of peace or understanding
it was a combination of factors and
depending on where you go for your new
source you'll get a combination of
information but I
the main thing we have to look at is
setting aside odd state decisions that
made people have to come up with new
forms of identified n tification they
didn't have to cast their vote setting
aside the timing of those FBI releases
on the emails setting aside the
melodrama of the birther movement that
gave Donald Trump an audience beyond his
television reality show apprentice fans
setting aside the fact that you're going
to increasingly see these stats that
fifty three percent of women apparently
voted for Trump but you need to keep
looking beneath those stats to see what
kind of women and if those women had
voted before don't just settle for one
story there are many but because I have
worked in electoral politics and I had
the good fortune of working for two men
who are sort of called the founders of
the modern way of campaigning both of
whom I can guarantee you didn't see this
coming as often happens both in
technology and in life you come up with
some good ideas and some good strategies
and things go very very strange because
I worked for them I'm going to focus
today on two things two of the
principles the strategies that they
always emphasized and those are really
quite simple understand the message that
will get voters to move their feet and
definitely learn to control the dialog
now the things that we saw happen in the
last couple of months actually started a
long time ago you may not be aware of a
very famous television debate that
happened fortunately before I was born
but not long before I was born and it
involves John F Kennedy and it involved
Richard Nixon they were both running for
president in the United States and in
fact in this television debate Kennedy
got it right he understood how to get
elected he understood how to give
message as the voters cared about
because he used the technology the
television and he looked young and
virile and together and handsome and
strong and he had good things to say
because he was always an eloquent
speaker and Richard Nixon seemed to have
forgotten touche
and probably did that classic thing that
I've seen many a businessman do I won't
put makeup on I'm not going to put
makeup on television and then they end
up looking really pasty and somewhat
dead and indeed their selection this use
of technology in its early stages this
debate had a huge impact on which person
people voted to follow the thing about
politics even if you set aside
technology in that is that when I was in
there I used to wake up and I used to go
for a run and then I would come back and
I would do my stretches reading for
different national newspapers crazy
clicking between the channels so that I
could catch all the morning news shows
oh and by the way the radio was going in
the background because when i was in
politics you were only as good as the
information you had and indeed it was
considered your personal responsibility
to not set up your boss by giving them
bad information so you went as many
places as you could looked at as many
sources you did find them pretty much
credible and you made sure they were
credible before you brought them in to
your boss and said okay you can make a
statement about this now it's
interesting one way the world has
changed one influence of technology on
this election is that about 200
newspapers endorsed Hillary Clinton many
of whom hadn't endorsed a Democrat for
over 100 years about 10 endorse Donald
Trump so again when i was in politics
the sources of truth the technology even
if it was old fashioned in print that
established what people were thinking
those things used to matter those things
don't matter today so as i said i'm
going to focus today on to really sort
of hard core strategies part of the
toolkit of a campaign and as much as I'd
love to tell you that Trump did
something different or that brexit did
something different they did use these
strategies I'm just not a hundred
percent sure they used them with the
intent and the values that they were
created back in the 70s and 80s I've
worked a lot with a polling firm
now a corporate research positioning
firm called pen show and in Berlin so if
we look at the history of how
technologies begun to affect campaigning
we can start right here when it comes to
controlling the messages pen shown in
Berlin as the last line of their little
wiki page says got a lot of credit in
the 70s in the 80s for the way that they
would go out and pull voters how quickly
they would turn around the information
and how effectively they would test
because this was their model what is
credible believable and meaningful to
someone they would do all the little
mathematic mixes of the responses and
they'd be able to give you as a
candidate or today as a corporation a
sense of what people will believe and
what will get them to change their mind
this was incredible what was interesting
about this is that this was testing
messages to make sure they were relevant
and I hands up guilty have been part of
this for a very long time I actually
believe in this it used some of the very
same research techniques that are used
by television comedies and dramas where
someone reacts by turning a dial at the
moment that they hear something that
matters to them so it gave you a chance
to decide is this worth saying or not
but technologies moved on a little bit
since then and where that original
campaign strategy was create messages
that are relevant to people now we're
moving into territory of full stop
create messages that people want to hear
have you ever heard of a firm called
Cambridge analytica you want to know
more about Cambridge analytica Cambridge
analytica is a very big quiet firm in
the UK and in the US ironically
potentially for part of my sins I was
asked to try to launch them to corporate
clients in the UK last year we'll come
on to that in a minute Cambridge
analytica was working for Ted Cruz in
the Republican primaries and when Ted
Cruz fell out Cambridge analytica began
to work with Donald Trump now the
interesting thing about Cambridge
analytica is their CEO or one of their
board members is actually CEO of the
Trump campaign and they're very
mysterious hedge fund
founder which is never a good thing in
life if you take anything away from
today anyone described as a mysterious
hedge fund founder is probably not the
kind of person you want to have dinner
with that person is given countless
millions to political action committees
that have supported Trump messaging all
along by the way little aside you
probably know this so my apologies if
you do the US now has a completely
screwed up campaign finance model partly
thanks to the Supreme Court fact
predominantly thanks to the Supreme
Court and by doing so someone can give
secretive hedge fund founder can give
millions to a political action committee
with very little traceability and very
little sense of people being able to say
oh that's bad Cambridge analytica looks
at things a little differently than a
simpletons of pension and Berlin they
aren't just looking at what's believable
what might move people what they
actually find credible they're actually
dot just diving into the psychological
profile of voters and thanks to the
Trump election they're now going to feel
extremely confident that they can do so
accurately and that they can do so with
no concern the interesting thing about
the press coverage they've had and if
you paid any attention to the general
election of the UK in May 2 2015 is that
you may have noticed that Trump as did
David Cameron about a week prior to the
actual election day began talking about
we're going to win we're going to win
now if you don't agree with Trump and
you don't agree with David Cameron these
messages you just want to laugh them off
but if you were slightly interested in
what they had to say these are kind of
rallying cries we're going to win we're
going to win and the most telling thing
which to some degree Cambridge analytica
gets some credit for is the way that
Donald Trump changed his schedule of
campaign stops within days at the end of
the election he went to places that he
shouldn't have gone to he went to places
she should have won with her hands down
but he didn't and indeed if you look at
articles that have come up both in the
Wall Street Journal and in other
publications you have members of that
team saying we
ooh when we looked at early voter
returns that older people they always
turn out whatever the weather they were
turning out that's always good for
trouble that african-americans were not
turning out and for Cambridge analytica
that was good for Trump and the
Hispanics were turning out a lot and
obviously they knew that probably might
or might not be of help to them but the
thing that they did is they targeted
those places where older white people
and the sort of people who weren't
historically that interest in elections
were starting to show up in the early
voting numbers in the exit polls and
there's no doubt that contributed to his
success in states that as I said she
should have won Cambridge analytica also
worked with the leave campaign and
here's the scary thing and why I kind of
do nostalgically wish the world would go
back to testing messages and move away
from creating them this was a lie 631
a.m. according to the BBC the day after
the results were in so one hour after
the election was called on the
twenty-fourth of June Nigel Farage
simply said yeah this isn't going to
happen there's no 350 million coming to
the NHS within an hour he knew he had
lied this is where if you want people to
vote with you we're now getting into
some really dangerous territory if you
don't like Trump you don't like the
leave movement and you possibly prefer
things to be validated by truthful
sources the end of the day a lot of
people did turn out for the UK
referendum seventy two percent and
although it wasn't an overwhelming
majority we've got a larger number of
votes but you probably also seen that
within days of the result being
announced besides Nigel Farage saying it
was a lie and several other things they
promised being displayed is not likely
to happen on immigration and such you
actually had voters saying I didn't
realize this what I was doing I didn't
know I was voting for this again the
human brain and I am no expert at it but
you're going to talk to some people
today or listen to them and they'll have
some incredibly brilliant thoughts it's
very easily seduced
and if you think about places like
Cambridge analytica and the role of
Technology in these things that's
something to be a little concerned about
because they clearly seduced a lot of
people now the other thing I talked
about is control the dialogue and
depending on where your loyalties lie
you might say oh there was no control
the dialogue he just made stuff up as he
went along but actually he totally
controlled the dialogue because he
understood thanks to Cambridge analytica
and others what the people he wanted to
control wanted to hear a lot of this
goes back to an entertainment reporter
named Matt Drudge Matt Drudge had an
email newsletter that had about 10,000
subscribers back in the mid-90s Matt
Drudge gets credit for the Monica
Lewinsky story Newsweek magazine a
credible publication wouldn't put it out
Matt Drudge put it in his email
newsletter and suddenly he had
credibility but he actually doesn't have
any credibility he doesn't really write
anything all he does is he takes stories
and other publications and gives them
salacious headlines and does all sorts
of crazy things to get people to want to
read the stuff he thinks they should
read so he's a news aggregator but he's
only selling news to a certain kind of
person and his meteoric rise led to the
creation of things like Fox News they're
easy to vilify for so many easy reasons
but at the end of the day Matt Drudge is
the first one that began to let people
think you don't have to take it from a
credible news source you can take it
from someone that you like you can take
it from them you can feel comfortable
knowing it's got to be true because he
thinks like me I actually like this one
a lot too because to be honest I'm not a
fan of Mark Zuckerberg it's great that
he's putting a lot of money into health
care and things like that but it is
interesting how quickly after the
election he stands up and says whoa I
didn't do it we didn't do it we didn't
influence anything although the stories
are legion about the fake websites that
made money by getting people to like the
about the spread of misinformation the
stats are out there at the end of the
day when you have a population in the US
where now sixty-six percent admit that
they look to social media for some of
their newsfeed you build on this history
that regrettably technology-enabled of
Matt Drudge being able to put out pretty
much any headline he wanted to make sure
he found people who wanted to think like
him and took them to the stories he
thought were most important Fox News
where to go with that they just took it
to a higher level but what they all did
was control the dialogue and Trump just
rode down that bandwagon he said you
guys have a group of people who want to
think like me I'm okay with them I'm not
troubled by who they are I'm not
troubled by the things they've said in
the past tech I'm not troubled by what I
say in the past because what I know is
having watched it and dredged having
seen it in Fox having seen it play out
in facebook and for those of you that
know more about the brain than I it's
what we do we go where we feel part of
that community we go to those who we
find like-minded now just to be clear
the Bernie brothers if you heard about
that which were the hardcore Bernie
Sanders kind of troll side they were
pretty vicious to Hillary too it's not
like it's all one-sided because I say
this from respect if you're in a
democracy you got to settle for the fact
that people think differently but the
key is technology has more quickly
enabled what used to take a long time we
used to have to knock on doors and again
that's not when i was in technology we
were in two telephones then whoo but
they used to have to knock on doors you
didn't know what someone was going to
vote somebody would come back with a
little piece of paper i actually watched
this because it still happened somewhat
in the UK on the general election in
2015 somebody comes back in reports okay
this person is leaning to this leaning
to that and you begin to build that into
a database and you know who to target
the other thing you've probably heard
about is that Hillary Clinton had an
enormous ground staff she had lots of
offices in lots of places where people
could do just that go out in canvas
make phone calls go find their neighbors
say get out the vote but this time I
didn't work this time other things
helped get out the vote things like
social media things like groups where
you find like-minded people and you feel
good about your values and not so bad
about the ones you don't have this one's
actually my personal favorite because to
be perfectly frank since I claimed early
on I don't know a lot about technology
i'm not going to claim to understand a
lot about this but what i found very
interesting in this USC study is that
the vast majority of these BOTS were
sending out there AI tweets from the
state of Georgia anybody here been to
the state of Georgia okay you wouldn't
call it the best-educated state in the
United States you wouldn't call it the
most socially integrated state in the
United States but at the same time I
also wouldn't see it as a state that had
the sophistication to set up a bunch of
bots and put out 75% of these were pro
Trump messages so showing my ignorance
and slight paranoia that tells me these
BOTS were coming from somewhere else and
you've all seen those stories from a
different country from a different place
from a different whatever needless to
say these were influencing these didn't
make Trump win but the combination of
these things that technology enabled
definitely has had an influence on the
play and since a lot of the Clinton
people worked for the guys that I used
to work for its lawyer Miller group came
from that way of doing campaigns that
classic 10 rules of the campaign work
the people build the ground swell get
the common ground do all these things
they were up against a different
competitor this time and they you can't
really say they fell short but they took
some things for granted that from now on
No campaign well I mean that's one good
thing to say this probably won't happen
again I had a friend many many years ago
who is running for Los Angeles City
Council and he lost by 15 hundred votes
because the day of the
election his opponent hung on people's
front doors you get a free dozen donuts
if you vote it didn't say vote for me
just show them that you voted and you'll
get a free dozen donuts they put out
2,000 of those and my friend lost by 15
hundred votes these things are illegal
now but you can see there's been a long
history of using whatever was available
to try to manipulate the minds of voters
it's so easy to just focus on Trump and
I apologize because given my accent you
probably think oh she doesn't see
anything else in the world but Trump's
just kind of a ripe perfect moment for
technology to say what are we doing what
do we care about the interesting thing
is if you buy into the less
well-educated people are the ones who
came out for the first time in a long
time and put Trump over the edge and
some of those tough states like Michigan
and Wisconsin and others you can't
condemn them for hearing what they
wanted to hear you actually can't
condemn them for being frustrated at the
belief that Obama might do things
differently for them and not having seen
it but you can say what if they didn't
have the ability to be so easily
influenced what if they actually were
forced partly through technology to
accept some of the things he said
because as much as I know the media has
gone out of their way to find women to
say oh I think it's great to be groped
which was a quote that I stumbled upon
in a bit of research 48 hours ago I
thought really how hard did they have to
look for that someone saying I think
it's fine he spoke that way because i
love it when I've groped I think it's
really kind of flattering it that being
said they'll be just as many who didn't
feel that well or it didn't feel that
way and wanted other reasons to vote for
him the end of the day was actually the
lowest voter turnout in 20 years it
wasn't a mandate which is a common
phrase that we like to use it says I can
do what I want now regrettably life is
cruel he kind of candy what he wants
because he's got the Supreme Court in
the house in the Senate but it wasn't a
mandate
and it wasn't people giving up on
everything it was unfortunately too many
people staying away people who obviously
did come out for Obama particular in
2008 I happened to by chance be in the
US on 2008 and I loved the cues I loved
the way people just happily waited they
were singing happened to be in Atlanta
but they were singing people were
laughing there were all sorts of things
but that didn't happen this time now I'm
not going to blame technology for a low
voter turnout but I'm going to say that
even with all the sophistication and
technology this ability to completely
manipulate people because as we know
Trump is bringing in the usual lobbyists
the usual insiders the usual things
because that's how Washington works so
all of his screaming about Washington
will change Ronald Reagan did exactly
the same thing you have to bring in the
people that understand how to get
business done it's not necessarily a bad
thing to know how to get business done
it's a bad thing and all of you in agile
can relate to this when you forget who
your customer is that's when it's a bad
thing so I took a few minutes of your
time to focus on to sort of hard core
strategies tactics tools from campaigns
which is make sure your messages are
relevant to your voters and understand
how to control the dialogue and I wanted
to share just a little bit there's just
you could read for days there's so much
out there but the ones that particularly
stuck out in my research were how
Cambridge analytica had moved the meter
from the kind of will this make them
vote to this will make them vote we can
control them and make them vote and how
social media had somehow through the
work of others 20 years prior gained
credibility that we all know it
shouldn't have because there's nothing
there that isn't kind of fun and
salacious to make up and add a few
attitude to a little bit of attitude too
but what does this mean it means to me
that everyone in this room has a better
understanding of how these things happen
then most people do now I don't want to
get anybody trolled so I'm not going to
tell you to go and start
you know tweeting the real Donald J
Trump and asked for lots of abuse and
death threats but at the same time think
about where in your life you can begin
to share what you know and what you
understand about technology with others
my niece who's now 25 told me that when
she was 10 and 11 years old and this is
not uncommon she was told to google
velcro farming and tree octopus these
are now from what I've seen relatively
common school things to teach people
that you know what everything you see on
the internet isn't true because yes
there are fake little articles that say
velcro farms are under attack because
California is running out of water and
tree octopus are an endangered species
because of the way that we're dealing
with the Florida ever great Everglades
excuse me and my niece is 25 she is a
social media generation she's everything
and it gave me so much hope when she
turned to me and she said I know
everything on the internet isn't true in
fact I know most of it isn't true we
know things aren't true we also know
there's some true things about the
people we like and they you know kind of
annoy us but you sort of either decide
if you really care about democracy that
you fight for the truth that you fight
for what is best for your customers for
all the people or you decide you know
what I'm going to make some stuff up I'm
going to ignore stuff I don't want to
think about and I'm just going to kind
of stick my feet in and say my way or
the highway politics were always about
winning but they were not always about
winner take all so my gentle challenge
would be as people who were kind enough
to come in this room and listen to a
little bit of my history having done
this for about 10 years and then I
walked away from DC because you only
survive in DC if you have no values and
I think values are a nice thing to have
my challenge to you gently would be if
you know that people who are educated
can make different decisions and you
understand better than anyone what
technology can do to influence not only
education but people's ability to make
decisions where's your local school
where's your local community group
where's your local anything where you
can help people to understand what it
takes to be able to create a piece of
false news on facebook how easy it is
help them do it help them see help them
see how dangerous it is because if we
don't then what we're going to have our
more campaigns like the one that just
happened because if I was the Democrats
you know what Cambridge analytica does
isn't really particularly difficult IP
it's just a lot of data and it's the way
they look at it they're probably
building their own company now been
shown in Berlin they're probably setting
it up all the guys left mark pen he was
once Hillary Clinton's top pollster he
got it wrong when she was running
against Obama these things can be done
it could get worse or we could decide to
make it a little bit better and with
that thang
