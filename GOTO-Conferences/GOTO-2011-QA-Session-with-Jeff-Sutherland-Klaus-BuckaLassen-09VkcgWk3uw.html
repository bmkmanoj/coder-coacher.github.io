job boys Anna kill for cut a fixed price
contracts oh I mean there's a yeah
there's a lawyer in London that's
working with my business partner
Gabrielle man Benefield they've been
working for over a year now writing a
book on agile contracts and it's been
very interesting talking to the lawyer
because she says lawyers look at
contracts differently that you would an
IT and we have to have make the lawyers
happy even though they have a completely
different agenda but the fundamental
basis of the contract is the money for
nothing change for free how many of you
know already know that model most of you
so why do you still have questions
what's the question how many are giving
change for free and contracts today in
here no one only one the strong
recommendation is always give change for
free it's a really strong competitive
advantage it's very low risk and for
those of you who are new to this if
you're going to do a fixed price
contract you have to be able to create a
backlog for the whole contract if you
can't do that you should not be in that
business you're going to have fail think
about the agile way of doing it is you
don't have to estimate all of it in in
detail you can use the way that you Thad
you lest amasian and that will cut the
time of estimation radically and at the
the things that are most important at
the front end you probably do smaller
pieces but as it gets brother out you're
estimating bigger and bigger pieces and
using the point mechanism it's extremely
fast at 1 telecom I work with they found
that and they base this on real backlog
that they do implement it with waterfall
and then they had workshops with scrum
estimation they found that the score
estimation was 48 times faster than the
waterfall estimation and it gave either
the same answer or better answer okay so
agile estimation is extremely fast the
change for free model for those of you
don't already know it is that and this
gets to the how does scrum handle change
the scrum backlog can change at any
sprint boundary so any time a customer
wants to put something in they can add
something and all they need to do is
throw away some something that's very
low priority that's of equal work and
scrum doesn't care it's fine the
contract doesn't change and I know try
fork I've seen some of the way they
handle it they have a little half page
addendum and the customer size off we've
changed this for that off they go and at
the end of the contract maybe they have
a hundred and fifty of those half page
addendums so they still have tight
control of the contract change for tree
is tremendously valuable for example the
example the example I talked about today
the CIO of o2 said I just finished 100
million dollar contract it cost me 270
million a hundred million euro contract
it cost me 270 million euro and was two
years late can scrum fix that and I said
did he get changed for free he said no I
said you paid 170 million dollars for
changes that you should have got for
free that's the problem scrum can fix
that but not afterwards so change for
free is easy but you should implement
that right away it's very low risk and
it will it also radically reduces the
customers risk of cost overrun now how
do you get them to cooperate in the
contract you say they must evaluate the
software at every sprint boundary they
can only introduce changes sprint
boundaries and they must you know
generally be good scrum
citizens if they're not it goes back to
time and materials that's it you already
have that contract they know what that
is so then they have an incentive to
either behavior or they're going to pay
more so that's kind of where you would
start now if you're good you can you can
do money for nothing and money for
nothing says there is you know CIOs
typically rank contracts in order of
return on investment they have a way of
calculating that and below that real
osim cut off they will not do a project
well even within a project there's a cut
off that exists where the value of the
next feature is not worth the cost you
can't really see that up front but you
will see it if you're watching sprint to
sprint you'll all of a sudden the at the
sprint reuse the end users will say oh
you know that doesn't give me much value
and the sea I always say well you know
we spent a couple hundred thousand your
euros for the hat it's so value we need
to stop right now because everything
coming further is even less value than
that and so money for nothing says you
can terminate the contract at any time
when you see that and deploy and the
vendor gets some percentage of the
remaining contract typically I've seen
twenty to thirty percent and the
customers say saves the rest the
customer gets the remaining value now
the problem with this for the vendor is
that you are taking on risk the contract
is capped at the fixed price and if you
can't deliver it as planned you're going
to pay for that now on the other hand
the value to you like one of the one of
the biggest consulting I've seen try to
implement this with thousands of
consultants they charged a premium they
said okay if we're going to do this
strategy we're going to charge thirty
percent more than our waterfall
contracts because we're assuming risk
you know you terminate we may have
people that are now unemployed and
customers they found a willing to pay
that they're willing to pay a premium so
they make thirty percent on the front
end then if they finish early they make
thirty percent by any savings they can
make and then they are convinced they
usually do a small pilot upfront to
establish a velocity and an estimation
practice that they and the customer both
agree on so they may do several Sprint's
you know several two weeks prints you
know six months to three months of a
pilot to establish the basis of
estimation and then the customer wants
to commit then for a longer term and big
companies like Deutsche Bank are tired
of paying for a hundred consultants time
materials forever you know they get it
they get a great proposal from big
consultancy maybe valtech does this all
looks good they got the best they got
their best resumes in the proposal and
then what do they get they get a hundred
kids right out of university they're
really slow and it takes forever and
three years later they still got a
hundred kids out of the university and
probably do kids and so they're tired of
paying for that they want to pay they
want to establish a velocity and then if
the consultant organization puts people
that are slow on it they have to pay ok
but the consultancy that I mentioned
they're convinced that they can raise
velocity at least twenty to thirty
percent they'll manage that velocity so
they're getting paid by points they're
not getting paid hours so if they can
raise the velocity twenty or thirty
percent they can raise their effective
hourly rate by at least twenty or thirty
percent so they're making thirty percent
freeways in this contract and last time
I talked to them they'd implemented
about 20 of them they had one or two
failures with a customer got upset
things weren't working but they said
that was no worse that was no worse than
the waterfall failure rate and in one
case they were able to work their way
out of it in the other case the customer
through the mouth but at the end they
made thirty percent three ways and all
the other ones so more successful than
waterfall and lower cost faster happy
customers and so it gave them what they
want was marketing leverage to upset the
balance of the Indian big waterfall
companies they want to disrupt the big
Indian waterfall companies by using this
strategy so they made it the CEO made it
a strategic initiative for the company
to execute on that so this money for
nothing changed for free you'll see with
the book ever gets out you will see you
know maybe it doesn't different types of
ways of thinking about contracts but
this model is that the core of all of
them and really it's all about how do
you kind of take different strategies
with different customers to actually
execute on this so for example I've seen
try fork they know that the waterfall
vendors of the bidding for million euro
they know they're bidding low and
they're going to make it up on cost
overruns type of materials but given
that their competitors are pretty good
at estimating waterfall they know they
can do it twice as fast with scrum so
they don't even have to estimate they
just put the pit in at 4 million euro
give them change for free
get to take the contract zero estivation
no time they got the contract yet on in
word they just changed the names and
boom because that's try park they're
really crazy like that so what else can
i say about fixed price contracts
michael mann would be because of did I
always told if he cries environment
affects the natural environment for
scrum absolutely you know the the first
team that really did this effectively
had a 10 million dollar contract and
they plan on 20 months and they were
going to be paid a half a million a
month they were doing monthly spreads
the customer terminated after three
Sprint's they said our juices are so
happy we got eighty percent of the value
of a functionality we want to deploy it
was a big construction company and they
got paid 1.5 million plus twenty percent
of the remaining 8.5 million 1.7 million
they got 3.2 million the customer got
their software 70 months early and save
seven million dollars now of course the
seals guys are upset about that now they
got consultants on the bench but the
management back at the office are saying
we thought we were going to get fifteen
percent margins and we got sixty percent
if we can execute every contract at
sixty percent margins we can sell this
company for a ton of money this is an
early retirement strategy for the
management and what you find is that
people that are able to do things for
example systematic and Denver competitor
to try fork is the cmi maturity level
five company and they good all this
scrum projects at half price of the
waterfall
and of course nobody wants to pay the
waterfall price so now all their
projects are scrum but what happened to
their revenue the revenue almost double
the first year they did this because
everybody wants all of a sudden they got
a ton more business everybody wants to
half price deal so this is a huge threat
to the big consultancies and of course
they need to they're trying to figure
out how to execute first before somebody
does this to them so I have a lot of
people from valtech and Accenture and
training classes scrum training classes
us okay maybe we should go out of this
one oh I'm gonna piping changes don't
like if you have a plunging as a
researcher yet you can say that
forgiveness clear and as long as that
this will feel the profile of next that
or something well this is really
interesting because my own companies
from egg you know I mean we do we do a
lot of consulting and training but I've
said we've got lots of partners like try
park that will do consulting and
training so i'm not interested in
building another training consulting
company you know that there's a hundred
of them out there that will work with us
and do it so let's give them the
business my goal is to expand scrum and
and also expand its outside IT and since
management is the biggest problem drive
it into the management structure
so we do things like work with the
business school our business school so
if that's the goal of the company what
should the business model be now you
know our team you know was struggling to
figure that out so they went and found a
guy a practice manager at boss
Consulting Group one of the leading
consulting groups of the company that
consults with companies on how to figure
this out and it turned out that he had
been about 10 years of boston consulting
and they have a program for somebody
that you know he's been traveling for
200 days a year for the last 10 years
and he wants to move to another job
where he's more stable no not so much
travel and boston consulting group has a
program for that where if you want to do
that for six months to a year you can
work half time you'll get your salary
and the other half time you can look for
a new job that is as less travel but
while you're looking you can't take any
money otherwise you go off the payroll
so he came to work for us as a volunteer
and and we built a quadrant of you know
some things are you know easy and some
things are hard and some things make
less money and some pizza things make
more money and let's get all everything
in the you know on the thing and then we
want to work on the things that are easy
to make a lot of money right okay so how
do we prioritize them now we've got an
ill-formed set of product initiatives
that we're going to have to figure out
what the market would be so when I'm
coaching the company now on including
the boston consulting group manager is
look at the Lean Startup book okay lean
startup is a big thing in the United
States right now
that's it Europe but it's a guy in
Silicon Valley started this you'd run a
number of companies look on valatie some
of them failed and some of them
successful and so we figured out okay
what's the model by which you would
start out a new product offering when
you don't know if people will buy it yet
and the basic thing is that and he had
done agilent companies and some of them
had failed and some of them and not fail
so what makes things work well the basic
thing is that you need to be agile in
your product backlog development and you
need to test your concept very fast so
how fast can you get something out you
know I've seen some people put up a
website and offer a product that doesn't
exist let's see what happens okay that's
maybe not the best strategy because you
know you can turn off the market when
you can't deliver it but how can you
very fast get a product up even though
it's not complete its limited and you
start and you know in a limited space
start to get orders and see what will
sell and he has many examples in there
of products that started out were a
great idea the greater the end most
interesting one is a instant messager
product that they were going to do with
avatars they thought people would really
want instant messengers that had avatars
and they would needed to connect it to
all the instant messenger system so that
they could you know everybody could move
to this new avatar thing but it would
still go out on all the other ims and so
they spent a lot of time doing this
integration they launched it they find
out nobody's interested in using this
avatar for out other ims and because
they're not interested in using it for
people that they're already ime you know
if their current group but they're
really interested in using these avatar
for people they never met
so he said we spent a year building this
integration it's always they pulled all
that cord out and threw it away he said
I should have done this in three months
and he calls that a pivot you've got to
get something out quickly and then it
either clearly works in a way that you
can iterate on it or it's the wrong
thing and then you have to take a
sideways motion to some completely
different thing and your ability to
execute that at the product this is a
product backlog agility mechanism so you
know he worked with agile and scrum in
the software development side but he
found that unless you get the product
backlog right it doesn't work so he came
up with these ideas he calls Lean
Startup on how to make the product
backlog agile so for that problem I
would look to lean startup and he's
written I think it's eric reason his
name he's written a really great book
about it yes but you know we haven't if
you look at the scrub guide it says
you've got to have a product older and
these are his responsibilities but it
doesn't go into a lot of detail on how a
product owner should execute in the
market it just says he needs to have a
vision and you have a business plan he
needs to prioritize things right to
execute on that plan okay well what
Erich is saying okay executing requires
a little bit more you know machinery
around it in a start-up environment to
be successful it's not that the scrum
part isn't right but we need to put some
parameters around how that how is the
product owner inspecting it adapting and
adjusting and so forth and there's lots
of cool examples about so that's one
example of trying to navigate into a new
market let's say you already have a
market one of the most interesting
things I've seen recently was the
Norwegian post office
so a Norwegian post office I think that
I think I was trying to remember the
number of companies they bought they buy
companies that ship stuff and I think
they bought a couple of dozen of them
and so then they will ship anything you
know not just a letter but who you know
little ship hardware you know it'll ship
you know construction vehicles you might
even ship houses you know you want to
move move a house from Zurich out into
down to zoo you know how would you ship
the house down there I mean I think
anything that ships anything the
Norwegian post office sinks that's their
business so now they have a website and
you again and you've got you know I want
to ship my motorcycle okay how do I find
out the price on that website and it
takes you know it took an average of
four minutes to figure out you know
where the place was that I could
possibly ship a motorcycle and how much
would cost and to click you know order
the motorcycle ship and they said that's
too slow and it needs to be 45 seconds
or less so they actually went out and
hired an external consultant who was an
expert and it turned out to be Tom guild
sob maybe of you know some of you know
tom gill and he came in and he said jeez
you know we need to use the team to help
innovate around this I know what the
business goal is 45 seconds to click
Submit order but i have no idea on how
to make this website get there the best
way but i think the development team
might be able to figure it out so he
went to the development team and he said
I want eight different ways to cut four
minutes down to something much less than
four minutes and I want you in the next
sprint to give me eight prototypes that
show that so he's essentially executing
what Apple does constantly they always
have they have usually have a dozen
fully working prototypes before they
will ever go into implementation
or product and they come back at the end
of spirit with these eight prototypes he
said okay now let's sit down let's look
at what's the business value of each
prototype how much does it help us and
what would it cost to implement he has
the development team estimate you know
rolling out this particular version and
then we makes a decision on which
prototyped implement then he tries to do
it fast and get it up and see if he
gives some results and based on the
results then he iterates again so he's
into the lean startup mode okay so this
is all agile product manager stuff we
have a certified product owner course
and my product owner scrumming says
they're all they all need to be better
than that because they don't teach this
kind of agile thinking so we're probably
going to write one that you know helps
take people through all these different
strategies on how to deal with stuff i
think the there was another question
about change that I don't think is part
of that and that was you know suppose
something some stuff comes into the
sprint customer wants tough Boggs
defects was that another piece of that
changes mainly when the when the client
is not very sure of the product even
after the prototype sometimes our
changes which are critical and involve
touching the architecture very deep
changes so that will change also the
cost of the project probably the will be
have to be extended or we'll have to
compromise other things so oh this is
how it is handled is the the product
owner deciding on that well the product
owner is responsible for ordering the
backlog and then delivering that to the
scrum team and the scrum team doesn't
care what they're delivering as long as
it doesn't change inside the sprint now
on the other hand they're going to have
to have to estimate things so the
product owner says okay we need this
change the development team is going to
say well in product grooming sessions
the product will be working with the
team okay it looks like this is what's
going to have to happen development in
to see odds going to take this whole
change architectural change and the
product on it going to say what's that
going to cost and the bulb is going to
estimate that now the product was gonna
have to figure out to do how to manage
the customer
so then it's good yeah now the product
owner has the team as a collaborator and
figuring out the cost trade-offs the
team the recommendation we haven't
talked to us about this in the class
yeah but the recommendation is to give
ten percent of the team's time to the
product honor for the purpose of
estimating backlog whatever backlog the
product I don't want is estimated yeah
when one guy of a team has a great idea
and wants a product owner who's to say
yes to a prototype then you need some
kind of influence in the product owner
to Mariah well the rule with the product
backlog is anybody could put anything on
the product backlog so sort of
developing as a braid idea should put it
on the product backlog now the product
owner is going to prioritize it now now
the product so is going to say when the
product grooming session okay what's in
it for me and the product loan is going
to have to okay here's here's the
business case for that you know where's
the business case scrum is intentionally
set up that way see the product owner is
always asking what's the business case
some and should be an together team
should come up with the consequences if
you're really making guitar changes all
it really means you're creating waste
because they are having away whatever
you did report it try and quickly for
the customer even worse in my opinion is
the internal customers sumin because
because the external customers really
worried about this money but the
internal customers they think it can
they can change change change and there
is it's very it's easy application of
the team to come up the show what are
the connivance the team shows the
consequences and the product on is
responsible for the revenue stream so if
the product I was not delivering on the
revenue the company is going to find a
new product order that goes the risk us
if you have no no
she knows about this and puddle only
things that's a business phones and
makes a sista team crazy coming yeah
right and say hey this directions there
is yeah there is a really when we work
with the venture teams on training
product owners it's really important we
talk about John Boyd's book John Boyd
was a fighter pilot that trained the
military and then starting going to
business training them on the Moodle
loop is anybody heard about the OODA
loop it's a variation of the PDA cycle
but it's different and Buddha stands for
observe okay in a fighter you observe
things are changing very fast and based
on what you're seeing you have to orient
yourself and then you have to decide
what you're going to do and then act and
the challenge in the and the fighter
world is to get the decision time so
short that you just observe orient and
you're already acting so somebody's on
your tail you see that you're orient and
then wool all of a sudden you're behind
him and john boyd was the only fighter
pilot that anybody knows that never lost
an air-to-air battle in combat or in
peacetime 100% he was like Musashi the
greatest swordsman that ever lived in
japan never lost a battle and so we have
to train the our product owners in the
you de loop and that requires a very
tight coupling of the product owner with
the team and the scrum master so the
product owners thinking maybe we ought
to go this way the team is already in
motion if the team feels that the
product owner doesn't know what they're
doing or he's confused or he's changing
too much it breaks the trust and the
bond and destroys the capability okay
so we really work with our venture
companies but with the product owners to
try to get them you know really clear
about the a biet need to be able to move
fast the team has to develop total
confidence in them and they need to not
do anything that's going to violate that
coupling if they do the team doesn't
trust them if they're not telling the
truth if they don't know what they're
doing the team will not follow if the
team will not follow we can't win in the
market so how to get that in your
product owners you know if you're your
big bank in Zurich you got a big problem
because they don't think that way so you
just have to do the best you can you
know knowing that there's going to be
problems if it's not done right I think
the second role is from Los Angeles to
change the product woman's blood wakey
yes true that he knows what he's right
the scrum master is responsible for the
process and implementing the process and
that includes training the product are
every company I've been in this job
since 1993 I've done nothing but scrum I
think I'm in the seventh from company
and every single company I've had not
only trained the product owner but
actually set up the product owner group
because usually you wind up with a whole
group and I've had the train the CEO and
the VP of Marketing I want the product
on our team and marketing I have to
train them all I have to train the
product ours and then they have to train
the team to support them that's the
scrum masters job as best you can you
know
part of the team in my appears and many
many many people because of the products
management background keep it ripping
apart yeah yeah you know the product
owner role is half the time with the
customer and half a time with the team
working with the team helping explain
what is needed from the customer so
they're part of the team and the
customer is embedded in the team and if
they're doing that then they're ripping
them ripping the product owner out of
the team and it's going to cause a mess
we go to the next one no it's a good
fighter pilot not Vietnam yesterday ms
yesterday you actually lost fight well I
was in reconnaissance so okay the same X
plus one five o'clock multiple teams
yeah boys one team is estimating our
backlog if you like 1432 due to a full
of effort you know there's a number of
examples on this you know Microsoft has
3000 developers working on visual studio
products and they they have to deal with
this may be the simplest example is
Citrix Online they implemented scrum
they have dozens of teams and they scrum
started to help them but very quickly
they realized they needed to manage the
backlog at the enterprise level say they
have multiple products and they have a
product management group and a project
product manager to them owns the product
like there's a product manager that owns
gotomeeting there's another one that
owns go to my pc and to implement those
products there are multiple product
owners involved in implementing those
products
so at the enterprise level they need the
product manager to propose a new release
it might be a new product it might be a
current product with more features and
to do that they asked them to initially
come up with their best guess you know
what's the cost revenue trade-off and if
that looks good they then tell them ok
get with the product owners and the
scrum masters and give us a better
estimate of the cost they then come back
again with a refined plan if it still
looks good they said ok go back to the
go back identify the teams that would
implement this if we would do it and get
the teams to do a real point estimate of
the backlog and come back up with come
back to us with essentially a fixed
price contract that's fully estimated by
the teams that would implement and then
we'll make a decision on the basis of
that then all their projects are
prioritized they have a product backlog
of projects that's been they do net
present value of calculations to you to
prioritize them and then they start
staffing at the top and they staff as
many as they can they're always driving
the top 12 closure as fast as possible
so if it runs into trouble they will
cannibalize lower priority projects
they're always trying to drive that
first one to close your as fast as
possible so using that strategy they
drove their time to delivery of a new
release from it was approaching four
years they've driven it down to less
than they were when they were start-up
averaging about five months and as a
result of that their market share has
now moved up past Microsoft there now
number two and now they're gunning for
Cisco which is the number one vendor
with WebEx and it's all been driven by
this enterprise level manager
of the backlog so that's how they do it
don't let me just say if you have a
small maybe not they small but you know
the high-performing scrum teams can do a
lot so it may be a pretty big product if
you have six scrum teams even but if
it's a common code base I like one
backlog and then the team's figure out
how to distribute it that will make it
go fastest once they distribute it you
need a mechanism for cross sharing of
backlogged during the Sprint they need
to self-organize across teams and
there's various ways of doing that and
some are really effective a patient
keeper we we the policy was anybody
could take any task and a spread and
give it to anybody on any team and we
had in our tooling we had built special
tooling on top of JIRA so that every
developer had a little workflow window
they could see what was on their list of
stuff that they will they were going to
be working on and if I assign it to Hans
okay I put Hans on there all of a sudden
Hans is looking whoa where did this come
from it's got to be done by the end of
the week they'll release it at the end
of the week so Hans has a choice by the
rule he can either take it or send it to
someone else really so Hans then says it
to Sally on another team and Sally looks
at this and she says I can't do this
there's a stopping rule at the third
person sally has to call a meeting of
three people and they have to decide
together how this is going to get done
that works really well because eighty
percent of the time people don't want to
have to have a meeting and they just
take them
that it causes dynamic load balancing
across teams yeah its weakest
interesting variation of musical chairs
people what would has to pay us and this
even empathy yeah that where it really
worked well but you know some people
with just I know some Enochian seems
that works in China they just tell the
teams you must self-organized to get
this stuff done if you don't we're going
to hold individual developers
accountable that should have
self-organized you have this you didn't
do it and you didn't get help you're
gonna have it's got to be very bad for
you at the end of the sprint and
conversely the person you asked for help
didn't help you it's going to be bad for
the two of you I'm gonna have a big
conversation about this so they let they
let the team's figure out how to handle
it okay we running out of time okay take
this question in the day and that is
human only separate those two have you
how the team did she say no to run crazy
stories if I know I mean a mini story
that's really a story about a young team
was terrible is about admitted made my
passport maybe i shouldn'ta acceptance
criteria let's first start in this can
you take that kind of story into a spin
especially started with what about to
destroy how do you the first thing you
need to do is is get clear to everybody
and you can do that with some historical
data on what is ready mean and then show
that stories that are ready go through
the sprint twice as fast as those that
aren't so then at the management level
it's a choice do you want stuff twice as
fast or you want to just ship
a pin to the sprint like you're doing
now if you have a good product or they
will help for example this and this will
hit actually one of the other questions
there was a three billion dollar company
in the united states that a healthcare
company and they had about a dozen
business units and a single IT group
that supported all the business units
with new applications help desk
everything and they had a ticketing
system they were doing about a thousand
tickets a week and the CIO thought scrum
could help with us so he hired a good
scrum coach in to help him implement
scrum the first thing that scrum coach
did was say okay there's no product
owner this backlog coming in from all
these business units and there's a lot
of stuff that doesn't have all the
information needed to execute on and
that's causing a huge amount of
dysfunction of the teams so I'm going to
move in and I'm the chief product on it
now and my first decision is that any
business unit that puts a backlog item
in that doesn't have the support from
the business unit needed to make it
immediately executable goes to the
bottom of the priority list in two weeks
he went from 1,000 tickets to two
thousand tickets and the senior
management was complaining in the the
management meetings the CEO we're not
getting our backlog done and the CEO
looks we were doing 1,000 tickets and we
now doing 2,000 and it's because you're
treading feed crap into their backlog
and they're refusing I think you need to
straighten up as a manager because the
CEO had the data to make that decision
so
that's a simple example of getting ready
backlog will double your throughput now
what is ready there's a good
presentation on high productive metrics
on my website that Scott Downey and I
have worked on and we train the scrum
masters to never take something and
that's not ready and not ready we use a
variation of the invest a credenza
mediately actually be actionable if you
can't do this immediately in this sprint
do not take it it needs to be negotiable
under discussion with the product how
are we going to do it there needs to be
a discussion that needs to be
understanding of it it needs to be value
if there's not a clear value statement
from the product owner that's understood
by the developers don't take it it needs
to be estimable if you can't estimate do
not take it it needs to be sized
properly and if you have its historical
data you know okay let's for 13-point
stories how many of those get through
sprint successfully Oh fifteen percent
okay we're not going to take any of
those anymore you have the data to make
decisions if Stuart you want the stories
that have an eighty percent probability
getting through the spread maybe they
can only be three points to get to get
that so that's all you take and finally
testable they need to be clear
acceptance tests that determine done and
if that is not the case the scrum master
does not allow it into the sprint now to
do that you have to empower the scrum
master so there are needs to be you know
probably some data at the management
level showing them the effect of putting
crap into the sprint and you need some
management commitment to support that's
simply what I do particularly with
venture companies I usually sit down
with the management I say how do you
feel about your development teams you
know they fail the last five Sprint's
they say we feel terrible we think they
should be doing more we're not customers
are screaming and then I say well do you
want to live that way forever I said be
I say because you're going to change its
going to cost you if you're not willing
to change you're going to have to suck
forever then they say well tell us what
we would have to do we'll see if we like
it I say well in this case you gonna
have to empower the scrum master and
they say well you know we don't know how
to they start of you know they whine and
they argue in there and I just say if
you continue whining and arguing with me
your teams are going to suck forever and
it's your response it's your fault and
if you're going to fix this you're gonna
have to change things and put some
strong things in place so either yes or
no now fortunately since i work for the
venture crew no i'm going to go back and
talk to the investors so they will
usually cave i said ok that's what we're
going to implement and for things like
that the the velocity of the development
teams will immediately accelerate so
they'll get immediate positive feedback
there's several things like that that
are just kind of so basic that you just
have to work with a management long
enough to get them committed to support
the scrum is that enough
I think this then you guys wanna say
here you can talk Jackie seeing one more
question you want to hear how many
people want to go for beers know how
many people want to stay you ready hey
I'm open to what right here horrible how
to get the locals from there are many
projects I've been in on where they've
got a big project and they decided to do
it you know the waterfall plan has come
out let me give you an example medco is
a great example because he was back in
2007 in July of 2007 the CEO of medco
medco was a 55 billion dollar company
that was its turnover and it had 5,000
developers and they they deliver
medications by mail order they have
robotic factories to fill the
prescriptions and so because they can do
it so cheaply people want to buy their
medications from medco so the CIO said
we're going to you know we're number one
and we're going to State number one the
way we're going to do it is we're going
to have we're going to change your IT
structure so that we can take
specialized patient groups you know
anybody who has lung disease we're going
to send their medications to a special
pharmacy pharmacy group that are experts
in lung disease they're going to
optimize their medications lower the
costs and improve the healthcare outcome
same thing for cancer things same thing
for diabetes same thing for every major
thing but to do that you know we have
this big IT pipe now that takes
millions of prescriptions every week and
we're going to break that into multiple
tracks it's going to be a big project
but in one year it's going to be done
and he goes to Wall Street and announced
to all the investment bankers that you
can count on this there a publicly
traded company he then puts the
waterfall team to work and on one
December they have the plan and it says
1 July 2009 and they talked about they
said the last crash that they had like
this it was waterfall was two years late
and so it's somewhere between one july
two thousand and nine and one july 2011
and the CEO says he says to the chief
financial officer what will happen to
our stock price CFO says well Mike go
down to a percent we can't have that he
said so we're going to we're going to
have a project leader for this and he
appoints an executive vice president and
for heads of business units vice
presidents who are running business
units has the product owner team and
their job is to bring this in in july of
2008 so in december their meeting saying
what the hell are we going to do you
know you got a project that's at least a
half a year and a half out it's going to
be delivered in six months and the CTO
says scrum they said well we don't know
what scrum is but you better bring a
team in here that stays here until July
and delivers this with our people and
you better do it right now because we're
out of we're out of time we're out of
options so he calls me just before
Christmas like the day before Christmas
he said you got to show up with a team
on two January that's going to deliver
this project for us he and I had worked
together in a different company
so I show up and they have hundreds and
hundreds of pages of waterfall
documentation this is very common and so
what we usually do is in the
documentation they usually have Excel
spreadsheets so we we pull the Excel
spreadsheets out and we run them through
mail merge you know every every row has
a feature we run them through mail merge
and we generate cards and then we take a
room like this and we start putting the
cars around the wall and and you know we
look at the cards we have to break them
out have bore cards you have to order
them prioritize them then we need to get
the development team and to estimate
them it took us a week a product on a
team was 15 to 20 people and then we we
bring the development team in
periodically to do estimation at the end
of a week we had a room like this with
six lanes there were going to be six
teams around three walls and the
developer and development team and
estimated the thousand points so this
was by 15 januari we had that and then
the I had to come to Europe to do some
training for try fork or something so so
the product other teams that southern
get in here we need to meet with you and
the team and we need to know we need to
know where you are so we go into the
meeting and the first thing the first
statement is from the executive vice
president are you going to meet the date
what's the answer to that no scrum is
about truth transparency and fluff guys
has been steady too much time in India
the answer is the truth I have no idea
whether your teams can meet your date
but I guarantee will beat your waterfall
date and if we don't you get all your
money back and that was gonna be
hundreds of thousands of dollars I was
committing myself and partners he says
that's not good enough you need to meet
the date show so what are you doing
scrum then you see you use equip it we
are we already had the prior to backlog
we already had it estimated I said we're
going to run three sprints and we're
going to trigger the velocity of these
six teams and at the end of those three
spreads it'll be one large we're going
to give you a date and I said it's going
to be a date that you won't like along
with the date that you don't like we're
going to give you an impediment list
it'll be prioritized the biggest
problems you have in your company and
your job is a management team will be to
make them go away not analyze them not
discuss them but make them disappear and
at this point the executive vice
president says Jeff I used to work with
for Toyota no problem I said yes we're
going to have a good successful project
I was excited to hear that that was the
end of the VD so on one Marsh we deliver
them the date I think we gave them one
December
and we said you know in order for your
teams to meet July they have to double
their velocity and here's the top 12
impediments in priority order that the
teams can't fix themselves their
problems with the company how long do
you think it took think it took for a
guy that used to work from Toyota to
remove all those impediments dream up
for days they really taught me a lesson
there is no impediment in your company
that has to last for more than a week if
you've got a guy from Toyota in charge
it's just the way it is so the only
reason you have them as your company
just wants to hold on to them they can't
give them up now during this time the
end of the first rent the team had
delivered a velocity of 20 then they
went to 40 then they went to 60 so by
one March they were down to 8 80 points
their release burned down looked like
this and then they remove those those
impediments immediately and within that
very same sprint they went up to 90 so
at the end of that spread we said you
know the date and now looks like 1 sep
tember and we need 1 July we have this
gap what are we going to do
what's that throwaway crap well we
started executing the scrum what I call
the scrum emergency procedure which is
number one can you do something
different you know you two points behind
the world cup and there's two minutes
left of the game you're not gonna take
stuff out of your backlog you got to
need those two points okay so you're
going to have to do something different
than you've been doing you know and okay
maybe remove some pediments that haven't
been removed so we we asked the
development team is there anything we
could do that would make you go faster
terms of removing impediments they said
oh yeah you know a third of our team is
in India and during the last sprint the
ite group shut down a port on the
internet for security reasons and none
of the Indians guys could get access to
clear case where all the code is put so
the velocity of theory of the Indian
teams was zero kind of sounds like UBS
bank right what is anybody here work for
UBS so I said well you think he could
fix that in the next friend I said yeah
yeah we that we it was really important
yeah all we have to do is tell them the
project management team this has got to
be fixed and they'll fix the I teen room
so okay we figured out that that would
get us about a third of the gap closed
and the second thing is can we get any
help you know and usually that means
offloading backlog not adding people but
awful can we get anybody else to do some
of this and we talked about that for a
while and we decided we were going to
need to go to the management team to
discuss this so before we did that let's
look at step three can we reduce backlog
and the product manager said no no we
can't do that we're already you know we
you know we we're down to the ball
you know we've got all the fat went down
to the ball we said okay we need to take
a piece of bone then it took us about
half a day but we we got another third
we still had a gap we said okay now
let's let's meet with the management
team and when we talked about we shared
the problem with them here's the
challenge and they said well you know we
probably shouldn't deploy this to the
whole company but maybe a third of the
company on the initial rollout would be
reasonable and if we chose that third
correctly we could probably eliminate a
little more backlog so it was actually a
very short meeting we just eliminated
that third and we declared victory and
this was in this must have been you know
by by the end of March by one April and
the management team said you know call
us if you need help we never called them
it came in on time and the stock price
had a nice uptick I said those guys you
know this is a billion-dollar project
you're not paying me anything and if you
look at their stock price it up ticked
on this then of course they had banned
all the challenges of rolling it out
across the company and the stock price
kind of went down a little bit but then
it went started back up and they've
they've doubled the stock price of the
company since this project so it did
leverage them there now an 80 billion
dollar company and they have 8,000
developers so
and down bro okay the CIO brought us in
and he said you know he said I went to
your sprint review of your team this was
actually when we're still in the middle
of this around April and he said those
people are on fire so I want to know how
we can get the other 4950 people on fire
like that and then we told him what he
you know you need to implement scrum and
here's what you need to do and so they
thought about it for a while you know
they thought about it for a few weeks
and they got back to us and they said we
don't think we can implement scrum the
culture is the cultural barriers are too
high we can do it with you here but
without you here we can't do it now so
we've kept in touch with them meanwhile
the CTOs biggest problem is he has all
these mainframe guys who take forever
deliver anything and his goal was to get
them on a release cycle a one-month
release cycle with a service-oriented
architecture where they could update the
api's every month and it took him three
years to get him there but as he's
getting the Mary's calling me okay Jeff
I want to roll out scrum everywhere how
should we set up the space i sent them
all i sent him lots of information about
how Microsoft does it and I just talked
to him about a month ago and he's got
scrubbed now deployed for all new
development and he's going to roll it
out across that whole company so for big
companies sometimes it takes a few years
to get things in order and it takes a
really strong person at the you know in
the engineering management to drive it
but you know medco is just a great
example the guy the CTO is brilliant I
could I was amazed not only what he had
done with scrum but technically he's
implemented the technology in there that
is really we leading the
state-of-the-art he can adjudicate a
claim in a nanosecond with tens of
millions of customers because of the
database technology and strategies he's
implement so those of you know big
insurance companies and stuff like that
how many insurance companies can
adjudicate a claim in a nanosecond so it
isn't just scrum they have a real
visionary that's rolling this out okay I
think we should have beer now
