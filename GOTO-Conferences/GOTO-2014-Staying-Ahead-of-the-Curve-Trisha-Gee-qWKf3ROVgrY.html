again I hope you all had a chance to get
a beer tears I hope you had a great day
so you are now part of an experiment so
because the first time we tried to do a
keynote without any chairs was in
Amsterdam two years ago and it was
because Linda rising one of our favorite
speakers she just told us about a study
that you learn much more if you stand up
so those of you who stand up will learn
much more the next hour those of you who
sit down you will you will gain weight
because you have a B on your hand and
you don't spend a lot of energy because
you're sitting down your brain will
start sleeping and it's really bad for
you those of you who stand up you will
use more energy you will come out more
fit live and brighter and more clever so
you have the choice now to just sit down
or stand up the other thing that we
noticed the first year we did the
stand-up keynote was that nobody really
dared to enter the room without chairs
the first guy entering he was like
running out against there's something
wrong here there's no chairs is normally
chair eventually we got every everybody
in the room and it was very noisy
because everybody's starting interacting
and discussing and how was your day and
it was really a lot of noise and I had a
problem like now calming you down and no
don't don't discuss now we have a
lecture here and today it was a mix if
so isn't it was not as loud as an empty
room but certainly much more noise than
tomorrow morning when we have a keynote
with chairs because then you just sit
down and you do your emails and you fall
asleep again so so once again you're
welcome to come forward there's no
nothing dangerous on this floor up here
please stand up if you want if you can
we have a few disabled speakers at least
one he can sit down I'm talking about
Michael hunger but yeah this is much
this is much better you will learn so
much more if you hear and with these
words I like to introduce Trisha and see
is also one of our favorite speakers and
I hope you're not going to explain why
it's better to sit down please welcome
Trisha hello good evening everyone this
is the first time I've given a
presentation where everyone was around
the edges as if they were terrified of
me and it's a bit alarming being all on
my own so do please come and join up
these are very brave souls who came to
to lead the charge to the front of the
room and if I say see you using your
laptop or your phone other than to take
photos I will make you come and stand
here so it's up to me to make sure that
you guys are fully entertained because
you don't have anything to distract
yourself and in which case all of your
attention is on me
which is simultaneously amazing and
extremely terrifying anyway I'm Trisha I
am a Java developer for MongoDB and and
I am NOT a consultant or a contractor so
I'm not here to sell you my services I
am also not yet an author of a book so
I'm not here to sell you my book what I
am gonna do is I'm going to share with
you my experiences of of this
challenging thing of trying to stay
ahead of the technical curve I do go to
a lot of conferences so I do hear a lot
of new technologies and I kind of have
to decide which ones sound really
interesting and which ones I'll just
have to leave for another day so the aim
of this talk really is not like I'm not
here to tell you which technologies to
use right now which technologies are the
most awesome obviously MongoDB obviously
but I am here to tell you please
whatever you do try not to rip out your
existing technology stack as soon as you
get home and put in all the new stuff
you heard at this point
because that never ever works and I've
done that so take it from me
so the key thing from this conference
from this talk is you're gonna hear
about and you have already heard about
lots of really exciting stuff you're
hearing about micro services and
usability and about continuous delivery
and DevOps and all these things and
you're going to want to try them all out
immediately probably and I'm gonna tell
you not to so having said that we're
gonna move straight on to the technical
part of this talk Java eight came out
this year who's a Java programmer quite
a lot of you yay who's using Java 8 ok
that's good because I'm gonna teach you
about lambdas and those of you who are
already using it know this stuff already
so we got lambdas this year everyone
else who is not a Java program is
laughing at us because they've had
lambdas for ages
we had lambdas they were called
anonymous in the classes and there were
15 lines long now we have a shorter
version so I'm gonna go straight in and
I'm gonna show you an example of where I
had some real code and I wanted to Java
ate it so I wanted to shove lambdas in
there like you know wherever I could
find a spot for them to fit and so this
is a real bit of code from an exec from
a demo I give it a bunch of other
conferences and what it does is it's
quite straightforward it's just like a
save automated and it takes an order
object and there's some case where maybe
it returns some sort of error response
and some case where it returns some sort
of success response so I thought fine I
can turn this into like an error handler
and a success handler and then I can
lunder it and that's all going to be
good so I'm just going to refactor this
oh dear this is not starting well I'm
going to reflect this so that it's
easier to put this into a method let's
extract this out into a new method let's
call it save ok and let's take the make
sure we can see all of this let's take
the success response here and instead of
returning the success response
let's do success handler dot on success
live coding it's like pairing with 300
people looking over your shoulder
don't look it might go wrong and okay so
let's refactor that pull that into a
parameter let's create the success
handler thing that's going to be an
inner class which I'm going to turn into
an interface because our lambdas are
single abstract method interfaces so I
just want one single method on this
interface I'm going to tell it it's a
functional interface so they can do
lambdas that was nearly a very bad typo
and then I can pass in as my success
handler I could pass in a new lambda now
I don't really know anything about
lambdas yet so I'm gonna pass it in as
anonymous inner class this is the same
code we had before for our success let's
return that and then let's just get
IntelliJ to lambda phi it for us because
I don't understand lambdas yet and
IntelliJ does magic so let's do the same
thing with them with error response cut
their error handler
oh no and error or pass this in as a
parameter as well do that and try not to
get IntelliJ to be too keen create an
inner class here this is going to be an
interface as well it's all the same
thing as before
perhaps I should have scripted some of
this so I don't have to type it all
wrong again
but you know let's give it an on error
method and then when we call the method
the same thing we need to create a new
error handler pass in the response that
we were doing before return get IntelliJ
to turn it into a lambda magically and
today I've Lam defied my method so I've
used a new feature in Java eight which
makes the code shorter and more readable
so this is 51 lines of code and the
original one was 31 lines of code so I'm
gonna say that maybe maybe maybe that's
not quite what I was going for I did
successfully lamb defy my coat did I
make it more succinct and more readable
probably not let's face it okay so
enough of lambdas
let's move swiftly on to another feature
of Java 8 which also came in this year
so with them with new Java 8 collections
you can actually do operations on
collections in parallel you could use
this magic incantation to say I want to
do this operation on my stream in
parallel and then this way I don't have
to worry about going multi-threaded
about doing anything complicated around
concurrency I just tell my and my data
my data structure to process itself in
parallel this sounds like an amazing
thing to do because most computers are
multi-core even my phone has got
multiple cores so we want to be able to
go parallel so we can do these
operations on multiple cores and and get
the benefit of our multi CPU processors
mostly C multi CPU environments so let's
do this I've written a performance test
is Martin Thompson in the audience I
really hope not because I don't want him
to see this and I have written a very
naive performance test it's a very
clunky and and the aim of this is I'm
gonna do something fairly simple I've
got here a list of coffee shop objects
I'm loading them from MongoDB I've got
46,000 coffee shops I'm gonna put them
into a list and what I want to do is I
want to use the new map function on on
our streams interface to get the name
and put it into a list of coffee shop
names for all 46,000 of those coffee
shops I want to get a list of all 46,000
coffee shop names ok so I'm using a map
function for that and I'm using streams
so this is going to this is going to
happen in serial so we're going to run
this performance test live what could
possibly go wrong
you know run this performance test live
and what you should see is this is my
CPU activity up here so I've got four
cores got MacBook Air and you'll be able
to see it doesn't use all fours like
Thoreau a fork cause thoroughly and
you'll be able to see how long it takes
if you're doing it in a traditional
serial way assuming nothing goes wrong
I'm not using the Wi-Fi so that's got to
be one advantage all right let's bring
up the Activity Monitor so this is gonna
warm up and we can see when this settles
down this is using about a hundred ish
percent of the CPU we're not using all
of our cause here yeah we've settled
down to 100% of CPU and we're going to
process this in a serial fashion all
46,000 of these of these coffee shops
and when we look at it it takes about
the on average naught point seven
seconds to do each one of these
operations okay so let's look at the
same thing if we go parallel it's
exactly the same test we have a magic
incantation of parallel stream instead
of stream we're done exactly the same
thing and what we expect to see is we
expect this to run much faster obviously
but also to utilize more of the CPUs
available so we'll run this and bring up
our Activity Monitor again deathly
silence you're waiting for it to go
wrong I know that so whoo
we're gonna warm the thing up we're
starting to see the usage of all the
cause Java is now taking 296 percent
okay so it's using much more of the CPU
power available and it's poor little
tiny MacBook Air um and it takes not
point six seconds it's marginally
quicker okay it kind of did what it says
on the tin it went parallel you'll stall
the CPUs available and it provided the
result in slightly less time than a
serial fashion that's good right we want
to go parallel to get faster now that
works really well when you have a lot of
data as I mentioned is 46,000
coffeeshops here and and it works well
if you're processing every single one of
those pieces of data what we're going to
do here is use a slightly different
function any match so if any coffee shop
of these 46,000 coffee shops is called
Starbucks and let's face it there's a
fair
chance that one of them's called
Starbucks then it will return true so
the thing I returned is just a boolean
not a new list of all the coffee shop
names but just a single value as soon as
it finds the right thing that matches
that criteria now we're going to do this
in serial so we're going to use just
stream not the parallel stream let's
find out how long that takes I'm not
going to bring up the activity Activity
Monitor because it shouldn't take too
long
30 milliseconds so yes not surprisingly
there was a Starbucks in my dataset and
it's at 30 milliseconds to process
46,000 coffee shops in serial so let's
do the same thing with a the magic
parallel stream here let's run this and
let's see how much faster this goes it
takes 118 milliseconds so it takes what
I take for 19 how much 30 30 and now it
takes a hundred and eighteen
milliseconds so going parallel in this
case has slowed down the performance of
that operation because all you're doing
is trying to process it find the first
one that matches it and then return if
you're going to have to spawn off
separate processes and split up your
data and then rejoin them it becomes
much more expensive so this is not a
magic incantation to use in order to get
better performance on operations you're
doing on your data so what exactly have
I just shown you I've just shown you new
to new amazing features of Java 8 that
are going to make our lives easier we're
going to have more succinctly lambdas
and faster code with parallel and I've
just shown that's not really true so
what's the point of Java 8 that is a
totally different thing altogether the
point is what we need to do is we need
to figure out why we are trying to
implement this particular thing why are
we using this feature why are we using
this language why are we using this
framework all the stuff that you're
going to hear about and have already
heard about in this conference instead
of just running straight off and going
MongoDB is amazing I should definitely
implement it which you should instead
doing that you need to step back and
think about what is it I'm trying to
achieve by learning this technology or
process or framework or language there
are three reasons I can think of why you
might want to learn a new technology at
a very high level the first of these is
for the business now the business
they're the guys who effectively pay us
they're the guys who are always asking
for something else right can you do this
no I can't do that I need this now a car
I can't really do that in my existing
infrastructure and often they'll be
asking us for things that may be our
difficult time-consuming or maybe even
impossible to do within our current
frameworks our current technologies our
current processes so a lot of these new
things that we hear about are ways to
enable the business to make more money
which is good because then they'll pay
us more money this is a good thing so
they might want to do something like
they might ask us for customizable
flashy dashboards and we don't really
know anything about this because we're
server-side Java developers or they
might ask us the they might tell us
they're going to go live in China now
cuz China's a massive market and that's
kind of in the window where we you
normally do our releases or we normally
do massive batch processes which take
ages or that's the downtime that we need
or and this is this has been common for
years you might be trying to store
different shape data in a single table
in your database so how many people have
worked on systems where their tables
that looked a bit like this so this is
the real data this is the coffee-shop
data but I worked at Ford Motor Company
I've worked in investment bank and we
always had tables like this where you're
trying to squeeze products that are not
quite the same shape into the same
database table so like a Ford Mondeo
does not have the same characteristics
as a Ford Transit van
for example foreign exchange instruments
are not the same shape as equities and
you end up with this kind of super
denormalized data where everything is
kind of null there's no safety at all on
the different different types and you
don't get any of the actual benefits of
having a relational database so now
you've got some business problems that
you need to solve
there might be some technologies that
you've heard about at a conference like
this or reading blogs or on Twitter that
seem like they might solve that
particular problem so our shiny
dashboards maybe you want to investigate
html5 and JavaScript and angular and all
those cool things bootstrap if you're
having trouble with your deployments for
example then there's loads of stuff that
you are hearing about at this conference
that might help ease that pain of
deployment if that's the thing that
you're normally doing in that window and
and obviously in the case of our
massively denormalized data and no
sequel database like maybe MongoDB might
be the right thing for you so in MongoDB
this is the same coffee-shop data and
it's stored effectively as JSON objects
in the collection and you could probably
see the coffee-shop at the top is as
much smaller it has far fewer
characteristics than the coffee shop at
the bottom and they all live in the same
collection they all live happily ever
after and it's kind of down to the thing
which queries the data to figure out
what to do with it it's much more
appropriate for this kind of fluid
dynamic schema if you like so if you've
identified a business problem that
perhaps needs a new technology to solve
it there are many different approaches
you can take in order to try figure out
whether this is the right technology for
you because it might not be which is the
important point really if you are trying
to solve a particular business problem
there's always think so
let's talk about spikes and prototyping
normally I know that we've never seen
this but normally with spikes and
prototypes normally you throw the code
away you don't put it into production
because it more or less does what you
thought it was supposed to do right
people they're going yeah I've done that
so the idea behind the spike is you take
a week or however long you have very
specific questions to answer during that
period of time and then you you
basically ask does the technology answer
these questions does it fix the problem
and often you go yeah it sort of does so
I spend a week working on it so we might
as well use it right and whereas in
actual fact yet it sort of does is not
quite the right answer you might want to
try it with two
three technologies which seems like a
waste but it's not because that allows
you to pick the correct technology and
maybe next time you have a business
problem maybe one of those discarded
technologies from that spike
maybe we pick that later it's not a
waste to do something and learn it's not
a the appropriate tool that's a very
valuable learning exercise so there's
other things like if you want to use a
new language for example Java 8 and
lambdas and you can use those in test
code before you start shoving into
production code and there's lots of code
in things like build deploy continuous
delivery pipeline systems which you
might have a bit more control over so
you can try out new technologies in that
area um internal tools you might want to
try something out either in some sort of
dashboard that's facing your team rather
than going straight to some business
facing or even external facing tool um
often if you're using if you're used to
creating very small projects you might
be able to try out a new technology
stack on a new project
I'd suggest perhaps taking one of the
earlier steps first before creating a
new project in the new technology but
that's down to you use at your own risk
and and if this is a business problem
which is going to genuinely change the
business if it's something that is going
to make them more money or well that's
really all they want really isn't it
more money if it's gonna make them more
money if it's going to change to be a
market changer for them then we can
invest some money in getting in some
experts so maybe get some people on site
to train the team in a technology and
vendors like well like ours and a bunch
of other vendors we will send in
consultants to work within your team and
tell you whether the technology is the
right choice or not and we do often say
no don't use this technology like
anytime anyone wants to do like a graph
thing with MongoDB we tend to say go and
look at neo it's gonna be much better
for you I knew you guys are here because
if you try and map graphs in MongoDB
it's just gonna be an absolute disaster
it's not a good thing to do so get the
experts in maybe even get someone like
thought Works in and get that get your
guys embedded in their team and share
share and spread some knowledge because
those guys have done this before and you
guys haven't so I'm I have no services
of my
to sell but people out there know how to
do this stuff and if it's gonna change
the business it's probably a good idea
to spend a little bit of money getting
that expertise in but sharing it with
the team and upskilling the team because
I've also seen consultancy teams and
contractors come in be hard to implement
a specific thing and then bugger off and
leave it behind and you are having to
pick up the pieces and figure out how
this thing works and then you re
implement it in some new technology that
takes your fancy anyway right point to I
apologize for talking too fast as usual
I have drunk far too much of coffee that
coffee else that is really good right
it's also isn't it
you guys are twitching as well and
reason to for learning and new
technology your team is feeling some
sort of pain there is something which is
slowing you down or causing you to have
to work weekends or get phone calls at 3
o'clock in the morning and these are
things that do not often get prioritized
for the business because they don't
directly make money for the business and
so let's see things like you've got a
mixed team with a bunch of different
programming styles maybe some people
doing more old-school traditional ooo
with older versions of Java and some new
functional hipster type people doing
functional hipster stuff and and maybe
it's difficult to communicate between
those different people those different
projects maybe your releases are painful
I've mentioned releases a bunch of times
because this is the sort of pain that
I've been through so many times
maybe your releases are very painfull
they take a long time and you're the one
who has to do the releases on Saturday
morning and not the business so they
don't care as long as it gets done
database schema changes might take ages
so applying a new column for some people
might take hours out of their release
cycle or even in some cases it can take
weeks to apply a new schema change to a
massive archive of data and a particular
pain point that I've had over the last
couple of years in this current role is
I'm very keen on the BDD style way of
doing automated testing I really like
that kind of these are my this is my
setup this is the thing I'm actually
testing
my assertions and and we had a much more
flexible approach to testing when I
first joined there the fact is we
actually had good automated test
coverage which is fantastic and but
sometimes you go back to a test and if
you can't read it or understand it or
figure out what it's testing like maybe
this one and then you start to wonder
what the what the point of the test is
so this is actually you can have a look
at and github right now this is a real
test that's in github right now for the
MongoDB Java driver it does test things
that proves the Java driver works it's
just me being anal about how my tests
should look but the point is that you
can figure out even if you can't read it
that this is testing more than one thing
the fact that the word assert appears
multiple times throughout the test is a
good indicator of this also further down
you get this idea or I've got a laser on
this you get this idea that we're
testing you can't see that more or less
the same thing with different inputs and
different outputs so it's the same steps
but with different inputs and different
outputs and this kind of offends me
because I feel like it should be
multiple tests because what happens if
one of the assertions fails right at the
very top and then the rest doesn't get
run and we have no idea if that failure
means everything breaks or just that one
thing breaks so there are a number of
different things that act me about this
testing style and also and this is more
of a something I didn't really notice
and about Java until I started working
with a document database MongoDB
effectively stores things as maps now
and until I started working with MongoDB
I didn't realize how ugly maps are in
Java they're kind of they're kind of
icky you have to do dot ads then looks
like there's all this text that's
boilerplate and it's not awesome there's
more of a niggle than anything else so
I'll come back to that obviously so now
that we've figured out that there are
some things which are hurting the team
some things which are productivity or
personally hurt are socialized because
we can't actually go out on a Saturday
because they're doing the release again
and there are a bunch of technologies
may or may not solve our problems for
example moving to Java 8 or maybe groovy
might allow us to use multiple coding
styles and a mixed in a mixed team
environment again DevOps tools and
processes might be a good way to to take
a look at our release process throw it
away and start again know never throw it
away and start again I've learnt that
the hard way and obviously no sequel
solutions might be a good thing if
you're doing lots of schema migrations
then you're thinking maybe I actually
have a more fluid dynamic schema than I
thought so I should move to something
which supports the fluid dynamics schema
instead of something which is very rigid
and relational and and the example I
wanted to point out is that modern test
frameworks are quite good at allowing us
to enforce things like better better
testing starts so I was forced to go to
a conference talk on Spock a couple
years ago and I didn't want to use
because Spock is using groovy and I'm a
Java person I don't want to learn Java
it's a Java open source project it needs
to be read by Java people and then I
still spoke and I was like I love Spock
I'm gonna use it everywhere so what I
did is I did a spike a week-long spike
and where the question I was answering
was will Spock provide us with the
structure we need around our tests to
force people to think in this BDD style
and will it give us advantages as a
testing framework so this is the same
test split into Spock tests obviously
there's more than one because that test
was was testing more than one thing and
but the interesting thing is that at the
second to last and the last tests
because here with Spock you can define a
series of inputs and a series of
expected outputs and your test sort of
looks the same all it does is do the
find one but it gets run multiple times
with these different inputs and
different outputs and if one of them
fails it still runs all of the others
and for us because we're a database
driver this was like a killer feature
for us because what we want to do is do
the same operation with lots of
different inputs and outputs and this
was the reason we decided to go with
Spock
not the fact that maps syntax in groovy
is very pretty much prettier than it is
in Java but it made our test so much
more readable so it aided our
readability
it answered the question for us spike
and we now use Spock and Java but we use
Spock and Java for our tests so if
you've identified that you have a
problem that affects your team and
you've identified a number of potential
technologies that might help fix this
there's many of the same things that we
saw on the earlier slide there are some
things missing off this slide for
example if you want to try a technology
out to fix a pain within your team your
development team or your ops team or
whatever I wouldn't try it out on a
brand-new production ready project or on
an internal tool that faces the business
I would try it out within something
which works and impacts us so we don't
negatively impact the business trying to
figure out how to fix our pain and and
the other thing I've added on the bottom
here is I don't know if you can all see
that but it says skunkworks projects and
hack days so this is a little bit more
there's a number of different advantages
of this some of which I'll go into in a
minute but at MongoDB we do skunkworks
day or two days once a quarter and
largely it's a good way to play with
technologies and see how they feel
sometimes at the end of that you might
have a project which is useful for the
team for example we were working on a
new tool to track people like me who go
off at conferences all the time and
we're working on tools to envisage this
or dashboards for that and you can get
some useful tools some useful
improvements out of this sort of thing
and it's sometimes a little bit of a
difficult sell but you're only asking
for one or two days of quarter in order
to reduce your pain and improve your
productivity so the third reason to use
and use or learn a new technology feel
free to move around a little bit by the
way if your needs are starting to ache
because look I am moving around I can
move you guys can move to the third and
most in my mind most compelling reason
to learn a new technology is for
yourself you sit in one of these talks
and you hear about this thing and you
think that looks awesome I should
definitely be using that or or I want to
yeah mostly that looks awesome and I
want to use that there are a number of
different reasons all the way from
is awesome I want to use it sort of
through I wanted new jobs so I probably
need some new skills in order to get a
new job of course no one here wants a
new job
right because you your employers are
sent you out here and you wouldn't own
up to wanting any job know some people
want new jobs or it might be theirs I
can see a niche in our organization
where we're starting to use this
technology or we have been using this
technology and maybe I could become the
technology guru because there's kind of
a hole there for that expertise and this
is something I'm very interested in I'm
something I hear quite a lot certainly
from new graduates and also from people
who've been doing the same sort of job
for quite a long time is this I need to
learn new technology because I don't
want to be left behind this sort of fear
thing as opposed to the sort of joy of
all reactive systems they sound amazing
there's kind of fear thing of oh crap I
don't want to be left behind I need to
learn stuff now that's a valid option
I'll talk about that in a minute
and so given that there are a number of
different motivators and given that the
reason to learn is for you there's also
a wide range of places where you can
figure out solutions that you're going
to learn so this is not the same as the
previous time is where I'm like yeah
html5 will solve that problem or no
sequel for this this is totally open to
your own interpretation I heard about a
new technology looks amazing I'm going
to learn it I am looking at job adverts
for the next big job and everyone
mentions html5 and I don't know anything
about html5 obviously you've got new
technology coming into your workplace or
maybe you think that there's something
which is being used but not used
properly there's always gaps there and
if you're kind of driven by fear pretty
much all of these are kind of weighing
upon you to decide which technology you
should be picking up because it's gonna
be the next big thing and you must learn
it so let's talk about that this is code
I wrote in 1998 or 7 either way it was
one of my first Java applets how cute
and it and it looks like crap not
because well partly because I don't
had to code applets and I was you know
only however old I was but also because
I'm using Java AWT and AWT was it did
the job at the time that was required of
it let's put it that way so I I was
learning Java at university I was
playing with applets on my webpage
because I wanted interactive web page
and applets as a way to do that in 1997
I didn't discover JavaScript until 1998
and so I was playing with these things
and then I did my internship at Ford
Motor Company I did three months in the
summer and we actually had written a two
Meg applet now I don't know if anyone
remembers what dial-up was like back in
1998 but my job was to test the download
speed for this a to make applet took 35
minutes to download yeah I had a lot of
time on my hands that summer I did love
research even though we didn't have the
Internet and so I was doing this project
who were working on this to make applet
and one of my Jobs was to try and figure
out whether this new funky UI called
swing was going to do was going to
benefit us whether it's going to be
faster to download for a start so I
thought right I've just spent six months
learning java.awt in applets and I'm
gonna graduate in a couple of years so I
should probably learn this swing thing
so went away I took an application that
I'd written in Pascal for my father at
high school and I really meant it in
Java and reimplemented it with a
swinging front end I had to learn
everything about we were learning Java
at university but I had to learn
everything about file handling because I
was storing everything in files
I'd heard of databases but I didn't know
how to install it on my 386 and I didn't
know how to get JDBC working so I didn't
use that I used files and that's fine it
worked and I had to learn all about how
to do a fully-formed Java app and just
so that I could learn a new UI
technology and I successfully did this I
say learn and I say successful I
obviously didn't learn how to do layouts
I remember thinking for ages I don't
know how to get their labels to line up
with the buttons but I'm like it worked
it's fine I rolled this out to my dad in
like it to his careers library
school um in 99 and he used it until he
retired about three years ago pork I I
really feel for him
I nearly rewrote it injures peas but I
was like now I've rewritten that twice
already I'm not doing it again the point
that this story is I spent about a year
doing this on my spare time in-between
homework in between learning stuff and
then when I went back to Ford for my
year out in 1999 so I kind of been doing
this yeah but better part of a year and
we were using Microsoft technology we
were using SP we were using BB and this
is pre met by the way and so I didn't
learn I don't use any of my Java stuff
that I'd learned and then when I
graduated in 2001 we were doing JSP and
servlets and in my entire career since I
did this in 1998 I have not used swing
once not once and I spent a year I
invested a year of my time my own free
time doing this to learn a technology so
that I wouldn't get left behind what a
waste of time so if you're learning
something for yourself because you want
to or to advance your career or or for
whatever reason you actually have so
many options of places where you can
learn about this stuff so I kind of
ordered it more or less from kind of
like lightweight approaches to sort of
more heavyweight fully invested
approaches and and I put user groups at
the top mostly because I helped to run
to user groups and user groups are
amazing but for me user groups are a
really good way to feel the pull up
pulse of the technical community and I
can turn up have a beer with a bunch of
people hear what they're working on here
the pain points here the things that are
awesome and then I can figure out which
technologies I think I might want to
invest some time in so user groups are
really awesome online courses there's so
much free education these days at
MongoDB we offer a bunch of free courses
for more going to be with Java and
Python and node and there's like a DBA
course and all these sorts of things
also there's obviously Coursera and
there's like free university courses
from Stanford there's just so much free
stuff to learn these days obviously
there's a classic of re-implement a pet
project in whichever technology you want
to work on and this I think is quite
intimidating for a lot of people because
you have to do the whole thing like
create
this whole project end-to-end which
might not really be your thing but I've
spoken to a lot of people lately where
they have their single non trivial boots
but well-contained pet project and
they'll re-implemented in a bunch of
different languages a bunch of different
frameworks so then when they're coming
on and trying out Scala for example they
don't have to do the investigation of
what is this thing supposed to do what's
the domain what's you know how does it
split how's it supposed to interact with
users
they're just reemployment the same thing
in a different idea matically for a new
language which is quite a nice way I
think of seeing the pros and cons of
different languages and frameworks um if
you don't want to do a whole project all
on your own
then there's always joint joining an
open-source project like so for example
well and what we've got an open-source
project you can totally join us but you
don't you know if you wanted to learn
swing it would be great to jump into
someone else's project and just work on
a swing stuff you don't have to worry
about ever all the other bits of the
project and also you'll be working in
someone else's code base so you'll be
picking up habits feel all bad from
someone else's code base and hopefully
if you've picked the right sort of
project you'll be getting constructive
comments from the maintainer zuv that
open-source project on how you can
improve your code so this is a lot
better than kind of working on isolation
on your own pet project my I looked at
the code the other day for my swing
application I will not inflict it upon
you because you don't want your eyes to
bleed but and yes I learned a lot about
how to use swing I didn't learn a lot
about how to do object-oriented design
never mind I shouldn't admit that I was
a long time ago I'm much better now and
who oh where was I am just touching
myself and the next option is there
might be projects at work you can lend a
hand on you could do this almost in your
spare time at work like an open-source
project but like in house because
there's always stuff that means working
on and we have projects inside our own
company which run which are written in
Java and I've done a lot of Java stuff
so I could go and help them out with
that stuff I haven't yet because it's
based in New York but I could if I
wanted to help them out with them with
new Java stuff and the kind of most
extreme way of learning and new
technologies get a new job in that
technology it is possible I don't think
we have the bootstrapping problem we
used to have I don't think you
and before in order to get a job in
Scala you had to know Scala but you
didn't know Scala because didn't have a
job in Skarloey and it was really hard
but I think these days more and more job
adverts say things like you know
self-starter hipster programmer I don't
know what do they say they say you know
a motivated polyglot keen to learn
well-grounded these sorts of things so
as long as you can program in one
language the expectation is you'll pick
up the others and pick up new
technologies so the only thing I'd say
about that is if you get a new job which
requires you to program in Scala and you
haven't programmed in Scala before you
might find yourself stuck programming in
a language which is not really the
language you wanted to program in so
maybe you might want to try out some of
the other options before getting a new
job to learn a language um where are we
I might have run out of time
oh I've been talking too fast and I
still haven't got to the end of my
slides the key point here when you're
trying to pick a technology to invest
your own time to learn because if you
look at this almost all of these
approaches require you to invest your
own personal time to learn them this is
not the same as I want to learn Scala so
I'm gonna rewrite part of our core
production code in order to learn Scala
no it's not a good idea you need to
invest some of your own time in this
stuff so if you're going to invest your
own time going to user groups or writing
your own project or do not do an open
source stuff you need to pick something
because you want to spend time on that
because there's lots of technologies out
there you don't have to be an expert in
all of them you certainly don't have to
be an expert in once you don't like or
don't care about
there's loads so just pick something
that you care about so that you can be
bothered to invest your own time in it
and if you can't be bothered to invest
your own time in it that's fine
but now I'll just admit the fact that
you're not necessarily going to upskill
except for in inside your own work
environment that's that's okay as well
just accept that and most of what we've
talked about when I was talking about
the
the business or teams requiring new
technologies to to solve a particular
problem that's kind of my house is
burning down and now I need to do
something about it
right that's like quick the database
isn't scaling if we swap in MongoDB will
that help no not if you don't understand
the technology I mean you saw what I did
with the the parallel use case right I
put in parallel so it should go faster
and it didn't and if you don't
understand the underpinnings of the
technology or feature or language it's
almost definitely not going to end well
so organisations can be proactive to
kind of help prevent this kind of
everything's burning down quick swap in
a new technology thing and then you've
got at least two problems and there's so
there are things you can do I mean as
developers we're totally on board with
all of these things right but our
organizations are a little bit less keen
to perhaps waste time doing hack days
and skunkworks projects and 20% time and
things like that um but these can be
more or less heavy or lightweight or
time consuming as you want so for
example I'm just going to point out the
user groups thing again because like I
help to run to user groups we have a
problem all the time with venues but if
you wanted to say if you're an
organization and you want your
developers to become more skilled and
one of the ways you want them to become
more skilled is perhaps by attending
user groups instead of forcing them to
go to user groups on their spare time
which is not a very good idea if you
offer to the user groups to host things
on site in your office that's a good way
to you know your developers were just
accidentally slip in there especially if
there's free beer you don't have to
bribe them too much and you'll also have
this flipside where you'll get and smart
people coming on site to your office and
maybe that's good for recruitment too so
and that's a really lightweight way of
helping your developers to become up
skilled in their own time a fairly
minimal outlay for the for the business
and then once you see that sort of thing
working maybe you can start introducing
things like brown bags at lunch times
and then maybe you might sneak in
probably not 20% time because they're
never going to go for that bird and it's
mythical as well I mean has anyone
really
20% time and the skunkworks projects at
one day a quarter I'm starting to hear
of big investment banks doing this now
so if the big investment banks are
actually allowing their developers to
not work on their work then this sort of
thing is starting to pay off for these
large organizations so lots of
organizations don't like this because
they're worried if I invest time and
time or mostly time and money upskilling
my developers they are going to up and
leave and that's not necessarily the
case the benefits far outweigh these
risks so obviously you put in you invest
some time and things like hot days and
skunkworks projects and user groups and
all these things your developers will
become more skilled theoretically right
because we're all smart people they'll
become more skilled they'll be able to
implement stuff better also they'll get
more skilled in a different range of
technologies so when a business problem
comes along there'll be some developer
who goes all right a no sequel database
is the perfect fit for this problem and
I know because I worked on it over here
or okay you're working on a new html5
dashboard I was playing with bootstrap
and stuff when we should probably use
that so this way we can pick the right
technologies at the right time and stop
this kind of twofold problem of like my
house is burning down and now I have a
new technology that I don't understand
how to use but most importantly for us
this sort of thing will give happy
developers happy developers like to
spend a bit of time playing they like to
invest in their own learning they like
to be given a tiny break from the day
job which by and large we kind of like
just to play with something a bit new
and if you're giving that to developers
too given that to us we're not going to
leave your company you're giving us
exactly what we want it see you're not
upscaling us so we can go somewhere else
so that we can do Scala 100% of the time
and find out that's not really what you
want we're gonna prefer to stay
somewhere where you're investing some
time and hours to play and investigate
new things should be a mutually
beneficial arrangement
so I've reordered my slides and I've got
no idea where I am this is oh you can
actually read that I'm amazed these
slides are gonna be online so you don't
need to worry about it too much
but I've kind of broken the approaches
down a little bit into I'm going to turn
my back on you I'm sorry I'm at the top
we've got for the business then in the
middle we've got for the team and then
down here we've got four years so
there's sort of three main reasons to
learn and learn and use a new technology
and we've got all these different
approaches here there's a certain amount
of overlap between the technologies for
the team and technologies for the
business you know there's a reason
amount of overlap there this is kind of
the moat at the top it's kind of most
risky like new projects and at the
bottom it's kind of most proactive with
like 20% time and skunkworks projects
what you'll notice though is that
approaches for learning new technology
for yourself doesn't overlap that much
with approaches for implementing new
technology in business so if you want to
learn something because you want to
learn it you're gonna have to invest
some of your own time in it and I hate
saying that because it feels like we
should be allowed to be trained up in
our in our day job but that's not the
way it works if you find something
that's cool and is not currently used at
work you need to invest some of your own
time in it if that's what you want to do
and you don't have to um so yeah I mean
there's a little bit of overlap here
like work projects and stuff like that
but this there's not that much so more
or less in summary but I believe I still
have more slides of course so you think
you're standing between you and more
beer I haven't had any wine yet because
I didn't want to have any alcohol before
I gave this talk so I'm desperate to get
to the end so I can have more wine so
what can I do back to us as developers
when we are sitting in these talks and
we hear about reactive when we hear
about micro services and we hear about
DevOps tools and we hear about Java
eight and we hear about all these things
which sound cool we should be thinking
about why is it that I want to learn
this technology ah no I knew I reordered
this wrong and we should be thinking
like things I'm gonna tell you about in
another slide firstly though most
importantly don't panic okay there are
lots of technologies out there they come
and go they open flow I mean I learn
JavaScript in nine
99 and then I thought it was dead in
2005 and I learned GWT and a bunch of
other stuff and now I'm back learning
angular and that's fine I don't feel
like oh no I've got like five years of
gap in my JavaScript knowledge you just
pick it back up if it comes back into
fashion you pick it back up it's fine
and if JavaScript JavaScript had died in
the meantime then it would have been
pointless me trying to stay ahead of the
JavaScript curve when I wasn't using it
at work because then I wouldn't ever use
it at work so technology's urban flow if
it's here to stay you can pick it up
again later
you don't have to learn it now and if
it's not here in a year's time
there's no point wasting your time on it
right now if you're not using it right
now so don't panic about all these
technologies which are being thrown at
us but if you do want to use something
because it's cool it's exciting or
whatever asset in the conference
conference still can you hear about this
thing and you want to learn it think
about why you want to learn it and
implement it so is it because it's gonna
solve this business problem that the
business has already told me they have
or I can just feel that they are gonna
have or that they definitely have but
haven't really realized yet so is it
going to solve a business problem is it
going to ease some of my pain as a
member of my team is it going to be
helpful for my team or a larger
department or is it just cool I just
want to learn it or is it just that I
want to I want to level up and move on
to a different job now that you know why
you want to learn a technology then you
can select the technology and that's the
topic of an entirely different talk and
I decided not to touch that with a
bargepole
the selector technology randomly because
you know why not and then use one of
those approaches in that mind map to
test it to figure out whether this is
the right thing for you and and ask does
it actually address the problem I was
trying to solve because there is this
worry
once you've invested some time in
learning a new technology or
implementing it in some pet project or
some skunkworks project on spiking or
prototyping there's this concern that
I've wasted all this time learning this
technology I should go on and use it so
that's not true if it doesn't address
the problem go back we select retest
because this way you're just gonna save
yourself a lot of pain in the long term
if it does address the problem then you
want to level up so you want to pick
perhaps one of the other approaches keep
using it more keep expanding it to teach
other teams and that sort of thing so
find out why you want to learn it select
it test it discard it if it's not the
right approach otherwise sort of iterate
and keep getting better at that
particular technology right so earlier
on I showed you implementing lambdas in
my code and I know that you're all dying
to see what the right answer that is
right you'll forgot your like lambdas
will of a I'm going to show you anyway
because because because it's my talk and
you're just gonna have to listen to me I
can see people sneaking out the back
there like this B right here so let me
show you the right way to implement it
well right way to write this particular
method and I'm gonna do that by going
right click get revert revert tada
perfectly readable code 30 lines of Java
and there's no complicated stuff there
if I should see this method again and
again and the only difference is the
return values the error and success then
maybe I might want to refactor it into
using something like lambdas I didn't
even need lambdas I could have just
passed in a response which is an error
response and a response which is a
success response so this is the right
way to solve this problem at the moment
um and then now that I've done that uh
that is the end of the presentation this
slides are available here I've been
