incentives the agile mindset how many of
you are doing agile of some form most
why did you decide to do that because
you looked at the extensive scientific
randomly control experiments that
clearly show that agile is better how
many of you depend did anyone within
good this is a trick question just like
the berlin conference because there
aren't any you decided to do agile
because you heard that someone else is
doing and it sounded like a good idea so
what I'm going to try to talk about
today as to do a scientific experiment
not just my opinion so we know that way
back there was a very famous Russian
campaign
who did some experiments with dogs and
he noticed that he fed the dogs at the
same time every day that after a while
elegant it was coming to the laboratory
and the dogs would start salivating who
does this sound like software
development the dogs would start
salivating even for automated any food
yet to come on that be is it possible
that the dogs can predict the future
since reading about my research I've
wondered if you should have talks on our
software teams to help us with
estimation effector our control studies
that show that's a pretty good idea dogs
are better than me arm and a lot of
things so they discovered it wasn't that
the dogs could predict the future it was
that a new by looking at what was going
on
that they were getting ready to feed
them so they could anticipate that and
out of that if you were wonderful idea
hope behaviorism the idea that if you
can care people for something over and
over again you can listen or bring about
the kind of behavior that you want by
providing the right kind of incentive
that could be a positive incentive
apparent a negative
stick and that's how you get animals and
I guess their animals are me that's how
you get animals to do what you want
anyone know what this is who is it his
name is Taylor his name is Taylor and he
gets a lot of bad press he was a very
smart guy studying how people were doing
it in the industrial age when he could
measure how people were performing
certain parts of a work on the assembly
line and he measured was the idea
were more efficient he said work
consists of mainly hold on particularly
interesting tasks and the only way to
get people to do them is to incentivize
them properly and monitor them carefully
and he was right he was talking about
people who did the same thing over and
over again who worked on the assembly
line and my careful measurement and my
careful placement and use with tools he
could improve their productivity he was
a very smart guy a scientific approach
that revolutionized the way people think
about how we work and it was effective
for the time now those of you who are
and Joel who have moved from waterfall
or some other process have done so
because you have a belief in a different
way of working and what we notice about
that new way of working
that there are some leftover words not
just from water fight a lot of leftovers
from the industrial age and this is one
of the idea that to get people to work
in a more productive fashion to be more
efficient that somehow the right
incentive will bring that about what we
know is that Taylor was able to prove
with scientific experiments and he was
able to do that at a time when what he
was doing was appropriate the idea of
incentive people but now I'm not so sure
I won't ask you to raise your hands
right no there are lots of managers who
who certain people in fact but somehow
think intensive optimize the environment
that we will get the best from people
the really sad thing about this
our selves so for those of you are going
to be around long enough to take the
class i'm going to teach on better ways
of thinking one of the problems we face
is that unless we feel we're working
hands down in front of the computer that
we are not really being productive let's
take another survey how many of you have
sat on the computer staring at that
computer screen one thing working
working on a problem anyone in we are
never done very good okay let's see how
long what's the longest amount of time
you've ever said without getting up so
sitting sitting sitting not getting up
to go to the toilet I'm getting up to
now have a piece of pizza not getting up
to go I haven't got the coffee sitting
sitting sitting in front of the computer
what's the longest amount of time and
you can remember anything oh come on two
hours two hours anyway for you to just
go to the toilet sorry I go to the
toilet no sorry no no
no age you said 48 hours you didn't get
up this is a woman suitable for saying
that
anyone more than 80 she's gotta head
down eight hours would you like to know
the record the record until go to
Chicago was 13 hours if you want to
think about that 13 hours not getting up
to go to the toilet sitting staring and
when those individuals said 13 hours I
said you SAT for 13 hours without moving
and the response in both cases of these
were guys the response in both cases was
yes but I solved the problem that is to
imply that that is the best way to solve
the problem by sitting by staring find
that is industrial age thing that if you
take a break if you take a nap if you
walk around and one side because the
what
so beautiful that that is not working so
no wonder we're still living in the
early nineteen hundreds and how is it
about work and how we think about
productivity I think it's time to look
him to do research in 1949 that was
gonna name Harry Harlow did an
interesting experiment would have talked
about monkeys today he was going to do
some experiments with these little
monkeys who I haven't had more about
puzzles so you put the puzzles in the
monkeys cages and before you get started
any experiment he noticed that the
monkeys immediately started to solve the
puzzles and he thought to himself have
you said to his lab assistants well what
I wonder why they're starting to work on
the puzzles we haven't given of a tree
yet so I stopped and I noticed that even
have to give a dream that the monkeys
liked working on the puzzles they seem
to enjoy they seem to think that it was
a fun thing to do even though there was
no
there was no incentive and after time
this was a revolutionary result because
scientists believe at this point that
there were only two kinds of reasons why
we did something all animals either
because of some behavioral need that led
us to eat or go to toilet sex or some
kind of external more and he said it's
clear that somehow these monkeys are
doing it not because of some external
reward but because of something inside
so he called that intrinsic some kind of
inner feeling that might be Jolie it
might be joy and in fact many that
further experiments he found that what
he did provide incentives when he did
have external rewards the monkeys lost
interest they concede to enjoy
they would only work on that when there
was a proper incentive and they wouldn't
just do it for Johnny so the little note
i have here is that he was almost afraid
to publish this and when he did finally
publish the results everyone ignored it
I like to think the scientists are
objective and that they pay attention to
all the wonderful experiments thank you
and instead what we learn is that they
hang on to their whole beliefs as long
as possible a lot of you know that
understand the organizational change and
what we see in all kinds of different
organizations that people do that
to always for a lot of reasons mostly
fear and that was true for the
scientific community who ignored the
idea of intrinsic motivation they held
on to their behavior ilysm for decades
to interesting economists who changed
the way we look at people forever one of
them the one that was still alive I got
a Nobel Prize for economics they define
the field of behavioral economics
economics cues to believe that we were
rational I let's take another survey how
many smart people in the room let's say
two
lots of smart people in the room so
therefore because you're smart you're
also rational indeed rational one
rational thank you very much one
rational group that's the foundation and
classical economics that we make
rational decisions so what diversity
show is that we're not and they did it
with a series of interesting experiments
one of them is multi ultimatum and it
works like this in the experiment on
here with someone else so Martin and I
already impaired today by hitting this
fabulous recognition from the folks that
go to so we be paired up and the
experiment would give me a certain
amount of money let's say ten dollars so
i have ten dollars and we play one round
of the game
give Martin a certain part of that ten
dollars and if he says yes Linda I will
take you have decided to give me and if
he does then we both get to keep that
money so let's suppose I say our pain
Martin I've got ten dollars and I'll
give you 2 i'll keep you would you take
it heartless very branch what most
people do in that circumstance around
the world not just in the US is they
refused to take it unless it's about
5050 if I offer have four dollars
or six dollars typically they will say
sure I'll take that and now we both get
to keep that amount of money but if it
is enough better split they say no I'm
not going to take that two dollars now
the question is is that rational we're
both get to keep the money no matter
what I want from heart we walk out of
the room we're going to have more money
than we did when we walked in so it's
only Rancho media accept any offer I
made but around the globe people in all
circumstances say no no if it isn't fair
I'm not going to take it I would rather
have nothing then let you have more than
these it's an emotional it's not
rational it's an emotional reaction
we're concerned with fairness alright so
for those of you who are religious let's
please say
prayer to the computer gods and we will
see if this video works it's a little
bit of setup this is an experiment with
movies and in the experiment the monkeys
are being taught to exchange form of
money for treats so the monkey is given
a token of some time the monkey returns
the token and uses that took it by
certain kinds of treats now in the
beginning of the experiment the monkey
uses the token to buy a cucumber monkeys
love cucumbers but you'll notice in the
experiment that the monkey that
initially into number can see that his
neighbor next door when he buys a treat
with his token is a cucumber but
is getting a great now monkeys like
cucumbers but they love so we shall see
what happens
here's the lucky getting the token says
oh right and now I he returns it and he
gets a cucumber you know my love 200
here's the token okay fine here you go
give it back to me and now I'm going to
give you a nice juicy great piece of
what wait I want I want to break please
it'd be great come on what oh no what
are you doing
I want a break don't help them pay he
got another break this is not good
thanks a lot or here's my chance maybe
it's the token let me test this out all
right I want oh this is not there's no
justice I want the problem with his
grapes I don't get any
that runs pretty deep runs pretty deep
our feeling that if it's not fair so
there's a program just recently in the
united states where they wanted to
encourage children to reach he was
reading is it enjoyable so they provided
these children and sentence believing in
that industrial age of coach that if you
insist you will get the behavior that
you design and what they noticed is
children in order to reach their goal of
having read a certain number of books in
certain amount of time would choose very
small easy to be Bulls so they could
gather more pizza now we know that in
any experiment
is going to work out when we offer the
incentive program for children it's an
experiment there are always unintended
consequences children don't read and
once they have an incentive and in fact
that's what the research shows is that
offering incentives conveys a message to
the participant you wouldn't ordinarily
want to do this so we have to be sent
you would in order to get the desired
behavior and what the participants
learning that is that they're not going
to do it unless they get a reward in the
future so we're teaching them in this
case teaching children that reading must
not be fun and enjoyable it must be
something that requires some kind of
reward and
for them to do this desire behavior and
of course over time in the United States
we are number one where the fattest
nation on the face of the earth not only
are we sitting too much way way all the
research is clear that tangible rewards
remove in some cases or work against the
enjoyment or the intrinsic motivation
studies on children studies on the
adults studies on older people show
clearly that when they are put in a
setting where their incentive to do
something they learn to paintings they
learn to only do it when there is
they lose the joy and of course in any
incentive scheme as of your phase of
freakonomics I listened to a lot of
podcasts on airplanes and the
freakonomics podcast is one of my
favorites Steve Levitt is an economist
at the University of Chicago and he said
no individual note is ever going to be
and smart as the people who are scheming
against you when you introduce an
incentive scheme no matter how clever
think there's a pretty good chance that
someone far more clever that you will
figure out a way to beat sentencing
Danny early who is a behavioral
economist has shown in a number of
experiments that there is
between the size of the bonus and the
performance but that correlation is
David you so the larger the incentive
the poor and end result the less
productivity for less creativity the
less enjoyment and even now decades
beyond behavior in studies where he's at
mba students and ceos what do you think
would be the best way to get teams to be
more productive to encourage teams to be
more creative all of them seem to have
bought into that industrial age practice
that is all
styx smart people continue to believe in
the face of mounting evidence that the
best way to get high performance out
people who solve complicated problems is
to provide incentives now there is some
positive correlation but it's only for
those Industrial Age practices that are
still around if you do the same thing
over and over again if you're working on
an assembly line tightly cold yes
incentives do work if you pay people
more for the number of units for use
they will learn faster there's also a
notion of closeness if the thing you're
trying to incendie weren't then
incentive
do work of a very good friend who lives
in Stockholm and she told me a story
about having her children learn how to
ski and she said I paid them every time
they fell down so the idea is that if
they don't want to try to fall down a
lot which they did they will find a way
around that incentives she didn't pay
them to ski she feed them from falling
that she knew that when alling down
repeatedly and picking themselves up and
going a little further falling down him
that she was really getting performance
improved performance in my state I
thought I was brilliant Google we know
needs for anyone who can thought it
problems with its browser pay in some
cases huge incentives which is what they
want to see they not paying for
creativity they want to find those
problems and then I just ran a story on
Zappos or does extensive training
come work for that company and at the
end of the training period which lasts
two weeks they say to the gather
prospective employees we will give you
three thousand dollars to quit them
brittle some you're taking and those
would probably the people you want to
get rid of any the ones who stay so this
is a plug for the influence strategies
class teaching and all of the thinking
plant those who have already invested
two weeks who say no notice it's worth
more to me than three thousand dollars
those are the people
you want to keep around also been some
interest of the studies again different
ways of applying incentives and in one
case this was a study in china the team
that was given the bonus ahead of time
saying you've already got the bonus and
now we want to see if you made those
performance objectives and if you do you
get to keep the bonus and they compared
that behavior with another group where
they were told now if you meet the
stated objectives we will give you a
long it'll take down again because these
experiments are repeated in different
situations those teams that were given
the bonus up front who were said you
learning on it as long as you leave
those performance objectives you can
keep that moments those people
outperform the other
so we don't want to lose things we will
increase in performance if we're given
the incentive ahead of time I just been
issuing an interesting book that was
about and I don't teach at University
and more but if I did I would like to
try this experiment so if any of you are
teaching the University try this at the
beginning of the price say everyone now
has an egg everyone's starting out with
anything now employees start having
exams or programming assignments and do
so well we're going to take points away
but right now everyone has a
a that somehow that turns on a very
powerful force which is called loss
aversion in our brains we need to lose
stuff even small amounts of things are
very strong incentives so in the sense
that the incentive of the laws of urgent
is very powerful we know that those
people are beginning to do something
they need certain kinds of incentives
they need friends they need
encouragement thinking positive feedback
of course you'll need to offer them
suggestions for improvement but the main
thing the energy is strong positive and
encouraging feedback experts on the
other hand do much better when all right
live there praise we offering some of
that
do better with a lot of suggestions for
improvement areas in other ways before
negative feedback so we are also
incentives more positive for beginner is
a little more critical and helpful
suggestions for experts here's what the
neuroscientist tell us these are two
important areas of your brain that
involved in its citizens the one part
has to do with reward or pleasure that
that's where we get evicted your shots
of dopamine we also know there's another
center of the brain that has to do with
cooperation and our agile teams
especially we're concerned when that how
teams work together we know that in the
brain there are dark lines and that
these two centers do not operate that
the second time in other words you can't
both work before the incentive and
and when there is a conflict between
those two areas of the brain the way the
architecture of the brain works is that
people go for pleasure every time over
anything and that will undermine our
cooperative helpful collaborative
efforts it gets in the way to provide
individual innocent we know that manager
is for instance have a very powerful
effect as far as the incentive of
encouraging people who run their teams
look at the day 80 days now I'm hoping
that some of you will be really
interested in this research and will
send me an email
listen to that paper or how can you more
about that information in particular if
you are a manager you haven't read this
Harvard Business Review article I
encourage you I have a copy of it it's
illegal don't tell harm send me some
email and only having second copy in
1988 they did a study that showed that
managers who adds or beliefs about the
people teams can actually affect the
behavior and they do so in a pretty
short amount of time they really have an
understanding of the actual performance
of that in fact when I resonate Grimes
really disturb under all managers you
then you suppose all managers make up
there
quickly about someone a new hire in
terms of the door everybody decided
whether this person is going to be okay
partner so I asked some friends some
friends who are managers and I said that
true you really make up your mind so
complete even before you really know
this person have you already decide
whether there could be okay and my
friend was a manager I guess what do
they do but we're always right of course
they are and that was the message of the
painting because the manager has already
decided the manager gives incentives of
different kinds feedback rewards maybe
even bonuses or promotions based on
those expectations and one on the basis
of
performance of the ok individuals casket
better improves whereas those who are
not okay I don't get the feedback and
I'll get the incentives they don't have
the bonuses they go into promotions and
their behavior deteriorates so the
managers create the kinds of behavior
they expect and what's even scarier to
all that we do that to each other lot of
studies of military events to show that
okay a certain on money hire new people
the thing that drives effective teams
the most important element and making a
team effective creative and productive
is how people feel how people feel about
what they are doing what I think it's
important or not whether there's purpose
have a good friend trains rescue dogs
and when there's a major disaster they
bring in all the dogs they can some dogs
are trained to find living people some
dogs are trying to find people who are
not living so when all the dogs are
brought in and if it's really a major
disaster there are not going to be very
many survivors so the dogs that are
training to find
human beings very depressed and at the
end of the day very discouraged so what
they emergency workers do is they hide
get some of the road so that at the end
of the day all the dogs who want to find
a living human being to find a living
human being and it hurts them they feel
better they feel they have done a good
day's work something you will find you
want to feel that they've made a
contribution I think some of these
things pretty deep if you can see some
of these feelings and dogs and monkeys
we've had them for a long time Danny
early did some interesting experiments
are plagued us since I lived in Denmark
for a year a moment I had two groups of
people building robots out of Legos they
brought the men for the experiment
there's group
and the arrangement was to build a robot
we will pay you in the beginning three
dollars and then at the end why you a
question would you like to build another
one and if so we're going to give you a
little lesson three dollars two dollars
and eighty cents and then when you're
finished in a second one will say would
you like to build another one will give
you a little less money and you can keep
on building as many robots as you want
now in the two groups there was a big
difference one group builds on average
over eleven robots before they said
that's enough I don't want to build any
more neurons the other group only built
about seven on average a pretty big
statistically significant difference in
the two groups I wonder why I wonder
what the difference was
well in Group one when the robot was
built and they said you want to build
another
they gave him another seven my god
something displayed in a prominent place
the first until when they had finished a
row of robots so the participants could
see how many they don't in group two
they said would you like to go for a lot
and if they said yes then they dismantle
the robot took at a party and handed
them the pile of esa's said here you go
build another one now they all knew that
this was just an experiment they all
knew that at the end of the day and all
the robots are going to be destroyed the
destruction of what they had just built
you be before they built the next one
whereas sell the first group to see them
all would that make a difference so
these people really want Legos so Dan
airily said if you take people who love
something place them in meaningful
working conditions the joy they derive
from the activity is going to be a major
driver and dictating at a level
effort however if you take the same
people with the same initial passion and
desire and place them in meaningless
working condition you can easily kill
any joy and want to build any more
robots they watch every single thing
they did torn down and it was just an
experiment some of the most exciting
research I have seen recently is from
Theresa my own her husband the study
group that they can for several years
were all software development so that
was even more exciting is directly
applicable to the time
and the message in this book is that all
the events that can deeply engage people
in their jobs the most important is
making progress in meaningful work they
found out in the study that most people
do care we have a feeling that maybe
most people are a little bit skeptical
resentful
when they do that's not true most people
enjoy what they do and are raised and
that this relationship between being
happy and what they do in having joy
leads to teamcenter more creative more
productive we're committed to the work
along with other people on your team and
the last finding out of all of us about
research is that what you have in front
of your team that can work within your
media bonds are so much more important
than what goes on at the corporate level
that that's actually an enjoyable
difference so that what we can do for
our teams is give them clear goals
singers what we're trying to do and as
managers if there
encourage people getting out of their
way helping them make progress you
should call that being a servant leader
group pitch in hell and then there's a
wonderful pattern for fearless change of
celebrate small successes find the joy
even little tiny celebrations so what we
know I hope is that there's a lot of
research that shows incentives will not
get you what you want it's not about
provide caring or the right stick it's
about purpose it's about making progress
saying that you're reaching goals every
day it's about join we know that
celebrating small successes is a
powerful way and move forward so hope
then this has been ok as a start for the
conference that maybe learn a little a
couple of things you can take that yes
maybe good ok so if you have questions
I'll be here for the next day thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
