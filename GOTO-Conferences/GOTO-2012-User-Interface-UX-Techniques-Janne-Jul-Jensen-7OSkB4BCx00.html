sensor next to making a good user
interface the reason for the but how is
because that is the question I've been
met with so many times by developers
because most developers today are
perfectly aware that usability is a key
point when it comes to making user
interfaces they also know all the things
that you should strive for but they
don't know what methods and techniques
to use to actually achieve this so ok so
I know I have to make a good user
interface
I know it's key I know it's important
how that's what we're going to look at
today just a really quick run-through of
what makes good usability there are tons
of guidelines out there the tons of ways
of defining what good usability is but
over the years I have accumulated these
10 guidelines and I think if you cover
if you covered in those 10 you're pretty
well covered overall first one simple
and natural dialogue what this means is
that the dialogue because that is what
you can see it as the dialogue that the
user has with his or her computer should
be simple and natural and that doesn't
mean natural language of the computer
that means natural language of the user
don't speak computer language to the
user because they usually don't get it
that goes to the second one speak the
users language that doesn't mean that
you can't speak a business language of
some sort I mean people like in the
health industry you can have nurses
there using it and they will have their
own language of their own area of
expertise and it's okay to speak that
just don't speak your area of expertise
this language meaning don't speak
computer language to them because that's
usually not their trade and they won't
get it minimize memory load all in all
people are really bad at remembering
stuff computers are really good at it
and nevertheless we tend to have we have
a tendency of making the user remember
rather than making the computer remember
that's what it's good at make use of it
use constructive error messages so many
times you
at an error message with some kind of
hex code and some kind of pointer to a
memory area or something it doesn't tell
me squat I'm a software engineer it
still doesn't tell me squat don't do it
don't either and then people go the next
step and they say an error occurred well
there I got that I want to know why it
occurred I want to know what I can do
about it those are the two things you
want an error messages it's fairly
obvious that an error occurred I want to
know why and what I can do about it
because I don't want to be stuck here I
want to be able to move on support
recall it is a lot easier for human
beings to recollect something from
before then having to remember something
out of thin air meaning if you can give
them a fin it amount of choices they
will be able to recognize in those
choices what they're looking for rather
than giving them a free text field that
they have to fill out on their own so
make recall and integrate it part of
what you do it's a lot easier than
having to use free memory make clear
exits that means never get the user into
a corner where they don't know how to
get out again there's a reason there's
so many back web sites where the back
button things up basically because
that is what users resort to when you
don't give them an exit then they'll
start using that and go back back back
back until they find an area of the
website where they can move in another
direction always give them exits always
make sure that if they've cornered
themselves okay this is not what you
want it I know that here's the exit
that's how you move on from there make
shortcuts shortcuts are brilliant the
reason shortcuts are brilliant is
because it caters to the expert users
but without bothering the novice users
most people have some shortcuts
incorporated into what they do on a
daily basis so they use control-c and
control-v in control X and then they
move on to control a in control s and
all these different commands and if
can become a superuser you basically
know all of your control commands the
good thing about those is that they
don't bother the nervous user usually
you don't discover shortcuts until
you're ready to start using them and
then you gradually incorporate them into
what you do so that's one way of making
a system that has to cater to a broad
spectrum of users when it comes to
experience that's one way of doing it
give feedback always tell the user
what's going on users don't have faith
in computer systems they don't have
faith in them doing what they should
they don't have faith in anything
working the way it should make sure you
tell them if something go wrong that's
the error messages but also tell them
when something goes right because if
they don't get the message that
something installed successfully they
aren't sure because it's happened before
that things didn't install successfully
it's also tell them when something goes
right also tell them how fine to a
process you are if it's a process the
users controlling to tell them how many
steps there are if it's a process the
computer is in the middle of such as
installing stuff tell them how long they
have to wait is it enough time to go get
a cup of coffee or should I take a
vacation to southern France prevent
errors that's even better
it's good to use constructive error
messages but it's even better if we
could prevent the errors if we can if we
can anticipate where it is they're going
to run into problems make sure that you
do what you can to make sure that it
never happens in the first place and
then finally thrive for consistency
people tend to pull on what they've
learned in the past so you want to make
sure that what they learned in the past
also applies in your software and in the
future because that's what they're going
to try and Alan was talking about it
with the gestures because there's no
consistency in the gestures used across
platforms people get get into trouble
when they move to a different platform
they start using gestures that used to
work on another platform and all of a
sudden it's doing something else and
they can't figure out how to get around
it so drive for consistency in your
software
all right so that's what we're thriving
for those usability principles to have
them fulfilled but we want to there's
tons of different techniques and methods
that can be applied during a process of
developing software one of the early
ones is the creative design workshop
what that does is give you an idea of
where we headed with this you we in try
for we make apps it happens very often
that a customer comes in say we would
like to have an app okay what would you
like that app to do we don't know we
just want an app that's when you start
turning to something like this because
then you start getting to know the
domain you start getting to know the
company that you're working with the
users they have what it is that makes
them tick
what needs they have all that sort of
thing get that uncovered and you can do
that with a creative workshop the reason
you can do that is because you bring
stakeholders together you bring the
designers to in you bring the domain
experts in you bring the users in and
you bring the developers in the reason
for having all of these in the same room
is because that way you get the input
that they are strong in the developers
know what is technically possible
the designers know what cool designs
have seen around the world and how well
that works with users the users know
what they want support for with what
they do on a daily basis and finally the
domain experts know the broader spectrum
of the area that you developing for set
the scene the purpose of this workshop
is design ideas we want to get design
ideas we want to find out what is we're
making and why we're making it and the
time frame is at least 4 hours but
rather 6 hours or more if you have if
you have a full day that's usually
plenty we make groups two to three
groups of three to four people each we
don't want to be more than 12 people
because then it becomes too many chefs
and you want to mix the profiles in each
group so you don't put the developers
all in one group put a developer in each
group design on each group user in each
group because then that way they can
feed off what each other know and the
materials it's the same as for making
Christmas decorations
the reason for that is because then we
all on the same playing field everybody
knows how to use scissors and crayons
and tape and there's a tendency if we
don't use something like this then
people bring out their laptops and then
if you're dealing with a bunch of users
who are not used to IT they feel
inferior
they won't contribute as much this
levels of the playing field for
everybody and it doesn't mean you have
to be good at drawing I can't draw a
stickman it just means that we can all
use it we've done it before
outline the project briefly what are we
making to who and why if you can answer
those three you quite far ahead provide
the necessary knowledge of the platforms
that means if you are developing
something for a tablet
tell the audience at the worship
workshop what are the characteristics of
a tablet one of the rules there is use
the platform use all of the hardware
that's in there don't just make
something that in principle could be
printed out on paper and put in your
pocket you want to use the GPS you want
to use the camera you want to use the
ability to play videos all this sort of
thing you want to use the platform
otherwise there's no point in making
something for a tablet so introduce them
to the platform so they know what we're
dealing with here and then of course
explain the process yes it is cutting
and pasting the old-fashioned way
because usually they don't believe that
when they arrive and make sure that they
see possibilities not limitations we
have a tendency of shooting down ideas
before they even have a chance to fly
tell them that if imagine for this one
day that we had enough money we had
enough time we had all technology in the
world what would you dream up what would
the ultimate system be to support your
everyday tasks in a specific area we can
always shoot them down again that
doesn't take long but let them dream for
this one day because it will give you an
idea of what their mental view of their
area is and what they're struggling with
on a daily basis and then of course
conclude by a presentation where all of
the groups from before present what
they've been making and the reason we do
multiple groups is because they never
make the same
and there's never a group that makes the
one perfect application is usually they
had something really neat with this part
of the application they had really done
something in this part of the
application so you make a hybrid in the
end you actually pull the best ideas
from each group the reason it works is
because everybody knows how to use the
materials and pictures say more than a
thousand words you can always make a
list of demands for a system and you can
write and you can write and you can
write and then when people have to
actually realize what you put in writing
they do something different this is
picture says more than thousand words it
really is true it's not computers so it
levels the playing field like I said it
gives you an unique insight into others
view of the field and that's very useful
because if you don't put the developers
together with the users they usually
don't know who they're developing for
they usually don't know what their
problem is they don't know what problem
they're solving either benefiting from
each other's area of expertise everybody
is contributing with what they know most
about the developers are contributing
technology the users are contributing
their area of expertise and so on and so
forth it provides the designer with
insight this is gold for me to have a
workshop like that because I go away
with so much knowledge of what can be
done what should be done what ought to
be done and so on and so forth it's gold
for me and it's support the visual
imagination and it's very concrete this
is down to you know actually making a
frame this is one screen where do we
want to go from there when I click there
I want to go to that screen it becomes
very concrete we're not just talking
abstract ideas here we're actually
realizing them if nothing else then just
on paper so this is just an example of
what it looks like and as you can see it
we might as well just be making
Christmas decorations there's tons of
stuff on the table everybody's talking
everybody's walking about using the
boards putting stuff up making
wireframes and arrows in between the
different screens and everything like
that it's it's super useful to have
something on and
the outcome can be very different
depending on what you're making but as
you can see it's not necessary to be
able to draw perfectly you don't have to
be a design or an architect or something
because it's very clear that well that's
an image that's a title of the image
there's a menu here some headlines here
with some text under pictures here this
might be an advertising I don't know
it's very clear what it is even though
it's very very minimal what you've drawn
and you have a very clear of the idea of
what you're making later so what comes
out of it is first and foremost design
ideas it's also potential problem areas
we find these key points in the
application where we can see we're going
to run into tale 2 problems there might
be technical problems things that aren't
actually available to us but that would
be really neat if they were that means
the developers go into their corner and
start digging see if anybody has made
anything like that before
it might also be problem areas for the
user this is really really where we need
support this is something that we need
salt it gives a better understanding of
the domain for everybody not just for me
but for everybody it has a heightened
engagement from all parties and this is
important everybody our stakeholders
this is everybody's baby now not just
mine not just developers this is
everybody's baby so there's a shared
ownership of the solution everybody is
proud of it everybody wants it to
succeed you get rid of a lot of politics
this way because people aren't fighting
each other people actually working
together making this together so that's
one way of starting then the second or
one of the next things that is usually
quite useful is we need to know who is
the user I think most developers in here
at some point have argued that my mom
wouldn't be able to use this right as
you nodding yeah that might be true but
would you mom be the typical profile of
the end-user often not so perception of
what your user is various it can be my
mom it can be the latest customer you
had and you presume this is the same it
can be stereotypes if it's a user group
you
haven't really met before are they old
are they young they lovers are the
experts what does their gender
what's the occupation there's lots of
stuff to know about your user imagine
for a second that I showed you a chart
of all colors all Pantone colors of blue
and asked each of you to pick one what
are the odds you would pick the same
color not very high right it's the same
it uses each and every one of you would
have a different admission ahead and
because of that you are developing in
different directions you are talking
past each other when you're talking
about problems that need solving you
need to have a shared idea of who you
use is and that's where personas come in
personas is a description of your user
you need to base it on your users of
course and if you haven't met them go
meet them they don't bite most of the
time what are they have in common so
find out what is the share trade or
trades across your user groups what
varies that's just as important what are
their different profiles you need to be
aware of group all of the attributes you
find for your users into roles and then
convert those roles into a persona this
is one example of a persona so you have
name and age it's very good to have a
picture as well because it makes it more
personal it makes it more believable and
in it you have a shared idea of who
you're referring to so please add a
picture it doesn't have to be of the
actual user find a picture that fits put
in their occupation their IT or domain
experience put in a tagline such as a
motto or a life way of living or you
know just a tagline that says something
unique about the personality of this
person put in a bit about their
personality and put in anything else
that might be of interest for instance
in this one they put in what kind of car
he drives that's because what they're
making is website for car dealership
then that's actually relevant if it's a
car enthusiast or not otherwise it might
not be relevant if you're making
something for the health system you
might not need to know
what car they're driving but put in
anything that is important as part of
the domain you're dealing with also look
at the context do they work alone do
they work together with whatever they do
in their daily life is it leisure or is
it work so that means is it something
that their boss says they should use or
is it something that they use whenever
they want to what platform is it on how
often do they use it all of these types
of things you need to uncover and then
once you're done you choose one primary
into secondary personas because you're
usually in the initially you'll end up
with like 10 different personas and it's
too many to keep in your head at once so
see if you can if you can bundle them up
see if you can make one personas out of
three or four of them and combine them
and then may end up with one primary to
secondary because that's what most
people can keep in their head start
referring to them by name when you are
making decisions when you're discussing
a certain thing should we do it this way
or that way
well Peter would think that this and
da-da-da-da-da-da-da and it will
actually be based on the same shared
experience or Peter eats and what his
preferences are so use it when you
sketch use it when you design prototype
code in all of the process user personas
refer to them you have a shared vision
of who your your user is what would my
persona do prefer think innocent in a
certain situation that will often answer
your questions and if it doesn't answer
it right away
it will at least spark a good discussion
a discussion that actually takes hold in
who your user is rather than my mom
these are another couple of examples and
as you see it doesn't need me to be all
neat and pretty it's basically just a
one pager handwritten with a picture on
it it's the work that goes into it that
decides how well they work
the design process because we okay we've
uncovered while we're making we know who
we're making it for as well now we need
to go into the design process how do we
go about this well as most of you
developers know coding and then having
to recode is a hassle it takes time it's
inconvenient and pressures the time plan
and all that so we want to do as little
recoding as possible what do we do to
avoid that the more specific we are
about what we're making before we
actually sit down and code it the less
risk of having to recode so sketch
sketch everything you're doing this is
the first sketch for density banks app
for for the mobile how many of you know
that one quite a few that's what I was
hoping that's why I took that as an
example this is the part of the app
where you can find your nearest bank
branch if you're looking to take out
money or put in money or whatever and
basically this is a map there's a few
pins and it's what it shows is that when
you press a pin and little box comes up
and it tells you something about that
specific pin you can switch between list
and map here and there's a couple of
other buttons that takes about three
minutes to draw but it gives you a very
good idea of is that what I want or is
that not what I want you can easily move
buttons around you can easily add
buttons as you go along that way you
know what you're talking about of course
what you don't know when you have a
sketch like that is how much can I
actually fit into that box by the pin
because my handwriting is significantly
bigger and more unreadable than what the
computer can make so start making it a
bit nicer just in this is drawn in word
not even drawn in any drawing program
because that takes too long just like
that no colors no rounded edges no
shadows lights and all that stuff just
to give you an idea of how much will it
actually take up will it fit into the
screen and then once you're happy with
it once your customers has nodded and
said that that's what we after that was
sort of a probe
then you start making graphics because
graphics redoing graphics will take just
as long as recoding so you don't want
him to make or her making graphics at
that point you want to do this first
then you can start fiddling with shadows
and rounded edges and all those really
polished things and that's when you
start coding when you have all of that
but this process making this back roll
from here if this is not what we're
after it doesn't take very long I do
like that draw for another three minutes
and off we go so unless it's really
simple code I guess you can't do it in
three minutes so that's the process and
that will save a lot of coding time if
you're really clear on what you're
making before you actually start coding
anything you can even even do usability
tests on this I'll come back to that in
a minute but that's just one screen it
doesn't give you an idea of the flow but
that can be done on all three stages so
as you can see here this is some of the
wireframes I've drawn for a nature
nature app looking for plants and
animals and stuff and what you do you
draw its screen you scan it in and then
you start fiddling around with the
pictures and then you just start adding
arrows making sure that you have all the
screens making sure that you don't get
any corners where the weather user
doesn't have any exit and can't get out
and this one where you've actually put
it into the into the computer into just
Word or whatever PowerPoint doesn't
matter and you start adding arrows so
you know that the flow is the way it
should be
and actually also when you get the
graphics on you have the flow of the
workflow as well gives you an idea of
have I missed anything
is there any weird loops where I can't
get out stuff like that so this gives
you an idea as well can't sorting this
is another technique this technique is
very good for structuring because now we
saw the work flow and on an on an app
it's not such a big deal because you
don't usually have huge
News but on websites when you have your
main menu
what should each point be may be named
what should be under each point so I
come to a website and there's a contact
and there's about us there might be a
press where do I find jobs yeah I don't
know why do I find this that in the
other this can help you card sorting can
come in either you know as an open
consulting or closed card sorting and it
gives you an insight into the mental
model of the user if informs the
navigational structure based on this
insight into their mental model because
if you know how they think things belong
together then you can make your
navigational structure reflect that so
what happens is you can have a deck of
cards like that with every single point
you want somewhere on your website and
any page on your website should go on
there you can have up to 250 cards liner
that's a lot what you make the user do
is sort them group them say okay these
250 cards group them as you think they
belong together yeah of course
forgot where I was talking to for a
second 256 sorry and you ask them to
group them together and they will start
and they will make these different
groups and then they realize okay this
group is kind of large and now I think
I'll split it up and make it into two
sub groups and then okay I have this one
card I thought I was starting a group
over here but it doesn't really seem
like there's anything else I belong with
it so okay so where do I put that after
then they will fiddle about with it for
a while and then you'll end up with a
number of groups you don't know how many
and you don't know how many cards are in
each of them ask the user to name each
group what would they call it and there
you are
there's your menu and your sub menus
what you find on each of them and what
you want to do then to check that you
got it right is that you take the names
they gave all of the groups then you
give those names to another group of
users along with the cards
and ask them to sort them into those
groups and hopefully you'll get the same
groups if you don't then you know that
the cars that ended up in two places
there might actually be a bias they
might actually be able to belong to both
what do we do then we might actually put
them both places that way one half of
the users who think it belongs in that
group will go there the other half will
go the other place and nobody will be
disappointed
the only problem you might get is if
there are certain cars that they don't
really think belong anywhere and you
might be missing a group somewhere but
this informs your structure very very
well and it means that you users in the
end can actually find what they're
looking for in your website or whatever
else it is you're making for instance
this one everybody knows this one I'm
quite sure how many people were
frustrated when they went from the old
menu system to the ribbon yeah why
because you couldn't find anything right
all other things you knew where was or
where you used to be you couldn't find
it anymore people were so frustrated and
people were so angry at Microsoft for
making this change but Microsoft like it
or not they actually do make informed
choices they don't just make a major
change to a major program that everybody
in the world uses on a whim
here's some of the key highlights from
the design process of the ribbon the
genesis of the ribbon came out of an
analysis of 1.3 billion user sessions
each one of these user sessions had more
than 6,600 data points as the design of
the ribbon involved we did card sorting
in both directions so opened and closed
we asked one group to sort functions
into groups and name the groups we asked
the second group to take the groups from
the first card sorting exercise and sort
functions back into those groups the
sorting matched up meaning you got it
right and based on how many users they
have put into this this actually worked
the reason that you guys don't know
where anything is is because you've
gotten used to the old way even if they
didn't make particularly sense you had
finally become able
remember where everything was the reason
this was a success is because the group
that wasn't loud meaning all the new
users who didn't went particularly
verbal about whether or not they liked
it they really liked it and it took a
lot less time to learn where everything
was in this new system than in the old
word but the loudmouth the people that
use it everyday people who are
opinionated just like us in this room we
were very loud about that's why they got
flagged for it but it is actually a much
better sorting of things based on
empirical data than what we had before
just an example
I apologize for anybody who doesn't
speak Danish this is from a Danish
website but it's a favorite example of
mine because it's very very good to
illustrate this this is from a website
that compares prices on hardware and
software and technical gadgets of all
sorts and that main menu of this has
grown and grown over the years at the
moment is 10 10 menu points where do I
find a headset in there yeah accessories
sound telephony yeah so that's 4
different places where you could be
looking for a headset where do I find a
network card for my computer network or
hardware yeah but that's the thing Wyatt
if I look at this what is the problem
with the categories on this one why are
there so many places that can hold the
same thing come on they overlap yeah
somebody over here they're too big yeah
now through the level of abstraction is
different because if you look at it I
could just take the hardware and
software and put those two there and I
didn't need anything else because
whatever is under all of the others
would fall under one of those two so
those actually the top levels and then
you have a number of levels below but
those below don't cover all aspects and
that's why they've introduced software
and hardware on this level as well
because that's the default that's where
you put everything that doesn't fit
anywhere else so this is actually a
brilliant example of when a menu happens
ad hoc along the way it shoots as the
website grows over the years and there
hasn't been made a specific effort to
actually make a decent menu here and
that could be done in a day with card
sorting all right but there are other
things to design in a website or
whatever else we're making than just the
menu and just like the developers know
there are design patterns there's also
such a thing as interaction design
patterns that means don't reinvent the
wheel don't reinvent a new way of going
through a webshop and paying for your
goods because there are actually ways
that our best practices in that today
and that works and that everybody can
find their way through so don't start
making up new things here same thing for
menus start and start using some of the
usual menu structures that are common
and that everybody knows so have a top
menu and then have sub menus under that
or have a top menu and then have the sub
menu in the left or something that is
the way it usually is and that people
the reason that this works the reason
that this is good to use is because it
supports the recall I was talking about
people recall this structure from every
other website on the web and they know
how to use it so they don't have to
bother with that they can actually move
on and start looking for the goods and
start buying stuff from you instead of
having to learn how to navigate your
site
so look up interaction design patterns
if you are making something that you
have a hunch has been made before and
that you have a hunch we'll have best
practices because there's no point in
reinventing the wheel and I know some of
you out here are thinking well then my
website will look like everybody else's
where's the new stuff how do I stick out
of the crowd don't stand out of the
crowd by making something the user can't
use because they don't want to be you
don't want to be remembered as the one
website they could navigate that's not a
way to stand out well it is but it's not
the way you want to stand out stand out
by having a really nice graphical design
for instance something unique there
stand out by being the website where
people think to themselves when they're
done after five minutes wow that's the
fastest I've ever shopped anything on
the web that's the way you want to stand
out not by making something the user
can't use it is also a method called
progressive disclosure and what it means
is you devise simplify and let the user
conquer your website or your app or
whatever it is you're making because
many many apps websites programs systems
today are so large that if you present
everything to the user once they will
get overwhelmed so start using steps you
want to use steps if you have long
complex tasks make it grouping into
steps everybody knows them Wizards
everywhere but there's a reason that
Wizards are so popular that's because
they they work group it into some
logical steps and then let the user take
one step at a time it avoids the
overload of the user memory because if
you present one long form to them on an
e-commerce site for instance it's like I
can't be bothered
go to another website there's just as
many fields and forms on the other
website but because it's been split up I
can overlook each of the steps make
levels if you have multiple levels of
user experience
in your group of users make levels it
means that you can make gradual
introduction to whatever it is you're
introducing them to and present only the
basics to them to begin with but if they
know where to look then they can get
into the more advanced options and this
is particularly for advanced set up or
detailed descriptions stuff like that
where you don't want to present it all
at once again this is a website a Danish
website that sells flowers fairly common
place and they have really got it down
to an art with the step by step because
you start out and you choose a bouquet
of flowers you choose the price you
press or order that's nice and easy and
then you think you're going to go and
pay but no then you get the option of
adding additional things so do you want
chocolate with that wine with that card
with that whatever yeah it is but you're
already in the process and then you see
okay yeah I'll fill this one out and
then I'll move on usually but if you
have if I had presented all of what is
coming on one page you would have left
maybe so maybe so but there's a lot
there's a higher chance of getting the
user through something as long as this
if you break it into bits that make
sense to them because yeah I quickly
realized okay this is adding extra so I
just went and pressed next because all
of what was in that page was about
ordering something extra and I knew I
didn't want that so I just went straight
for the next but if I had added
something little thing down here that
weren't related to ordering something
extra then I would have missed that
that's why you have to group it together
in chunks that make sense because then
the next thing comes that's about making
your own card just go and press No thank
you I don't wanna I'll just have a
regular card on there then you get to
who's actually receiving these flowers
and how and when and where also group
together that's something that belongs
together so
yes this is about selling more but let's
not fool ourselves ecommerce is about
selling more so of course they're going
to try a lot but if you are going to try
in that please try not to bother the
user any more than highly necessary with
it
don't oh welcome welcome them make it in
two steps like this that are grouped
nicely together because then they can
quickly skips the parts that they don't
want and then finally of course who are
you and then the payment form this is
another example everybody has seen this
one printer settings and this one has
all of the basic stuff that you need for
your printer so how many pages are you
printing in printing all blah blah blah
but if you are more advanced user you
have some specific needs like I want it
double side it or want it landscape mode
or whatever then I go into that one and
I get that opportunity and if I'm even
more specific I actually have that one
as well and I can go in here and I can
start really messing with the little
details but if you go back a bit then
that one it doesn't bother the users
that don't need it
same with that one it doesn't bother the
users who need it
so level make levels according to your
users experience level this paper
prototype testing I mentioned it earlier
when you have drawn screens of what you
are about to make we want to make sure
that this we might have agreed that this
is what we're making and this is a good
thing to make but you might want to dry
run it by your users first and make sure
that they can actually use it this is a
prototype test paper prototype test of a
website where you can you can decide
when you want your leave he's having
paternity leave my thing so he fills in
a date and at first you think okay this
is a bit like kindergarten its paper
everywhere and nobody will really
believe that's a system but everybody
has played make-believe when they were
kids
so that's dig in the garden that was a
sword and that wooden club house was a
castle so you don't need much to make
people believe that this is a website
you don't need much to actually make
them interact with it he has a pen and
that will act as keyboard and as a mouse
so he'll press on stuff with the cap on
or he will write the date if he needs it
and as you can see it's just stuff
flying in so it's a manual computer even
if we forgotten something if there's
some of the cutouts that we haven't
thought about making we'll put in a
piece of paper with an hourglass on it
and then we'll draw it on the side and
fill it in you can actually realize a
lot so yeah
he wasn't sure what was going on there
he got an error message and he's trying
to correct the error I think he actually
makes an error again then you know
there's something here I need to look at
because he tried three times before he
got it right what can't you get out of a
paper prototyping test what you can't
get out of prototyping tests this
performance for instance anything that
is related to how the user internally
works with this you cannot test but you
can test the user interface you can test
if the model that you have built of the
on the or of the website if that matches
the mental model of the user and that's
all I had questions
I would definitely let the creative
process flow and then because I it's of
course all sorts of ideas that are not
even feasible will come up at a workshop
like that you don't want to shoot them
down because you don't want to break the
creative process you want people to
think big thoughts that day and if you
keep shooting it down every time people
come up with stuff they're going to stop
coming up with stuff so don't shoot
anything down you can think to yourself
you can make a mental note that there's
something there about accessibility that
we have to look at before that would
work or yeah I know you would like that
but that's not even technically possible
at the moment but just make a mental
note of it and then see how much of the
idea you can actually work with hmm of
course if you can see there's headed
straight into a dead end you want to
stop them but be careful with how many
ideas you shoot down because you really
want to get them creative and you want
it you want them to think that they can
contribute and if you keep shooting
things down they don't think they have
anything to offer anymore yeah when you
put people together in these groups
making all this creative stuff most
people attending the workshop is not
used to working in that manner
right yes yeah so do you do any kind of
warm-up exercise or anything like that
before we actually go and do the
workshop that's a good question that's
actually a good question I didn't
mention that while I was talking about
the creative workshop a creative
workshop requires a good facilitator it
requires somebody that goes first
so whenever people are talking about it
it ideas because at first they won't
grab any crayons and they won't start
drawing on their own because they are
not used to working like that and it's
not the adult way of behaving so I will
grab the crayon and I will start drawing
said did you mean something like this
and then quite fast if I get it wrong
he'll take the crayon say no I would
want the button down here instead bla
bla bla bla because then we're talking
based on what I had just drawn and I had
pulled him in but it means that you have
to go first you have to not only show
them how it's done but also show them
that you're not brilliant at drawing so
don't be ashamed of your own drawing
skills because we are all equal here and
if you are good at drawing try hiding it
a bit yeah say a group of 12 people
what's a good average size to split them
up in smaller groups uh if you have like
12 people I would make three groups of
four because there's usually at least
dip for different caps like developers
designers users domain experts and I
would have one of each in each group so
if you have 12 make three groups of four
if you have ten make three groups of
three and one or four and so on and so
forth just it doesn't have to be
completely equal sized groups just make
it approximately three to four people
each group but there's you can get you
can go too low in participants
I wouldn't go below six participants
because you don't have enough different
roles represented then and and then of
course whatever they come up with the
suggestions will be screwed towards what
their preference is so you want you want
them to be able to ping pong off each
other so somewhere between six and
twelve is usually a good workshop size
yeah there's somebody down here I think
yeah
any figures to commencements and push
from front a resource professor it seems
like low voices it's a it's a good
question because it's something that
people are often faced with even if they
want to do something like this
management says well unless you can show
me some figures that this paid off in
the end then we're not putting money
into it and I didn't go particularly
into it but there is a there's a book
and I can't remember the title right now
cost-effective something something I see
me afterwards now find the title for you
but there are books written on the
subject of how to convince management
that this is a good idea because yeah
let's face it none of this will fly if
your management won't go for it that's
that's blatantly that's how the world
rolls basically yeah yeah now I didn't I
usually if you're making a website for
instance you have a fairly good idea at
this point in the design process of what
you want on your website your management
has stuff they want on there there are
certain groups in your company that want
to make sure that whatever they are good
at is advertised you want to have you
know the usual stuff about the history
of the company and contact us and
prayers and jobs and you can quite
easily come up with a pool of what you
want on your website and even if you
don't have the full amount of content of
your website at that point you will
still have the structure and you can
start fitting whatever comes after into
that structure and add that to the
group's after of course you should have
most because if you have less than half
then it doesn't make sense then there
might be full groups of menu points that
you're missing yeah
yeahit's pages is basically your sitemap
it is everything in your sitemap broken
into two well if it was an app for
instance then you would have your
menuing points there suppose the
Facebook app okay on the Facebook app I
want my timeline and I won't be able to
search my friends and I want the
whatever points you have in
possibilities you have in Facebook and
then you can start grouping that you can
do that for basically anything because
anything any system has some sort of
sitemap any any system has you can draw
a workflow like I had earlier and then
each of those screens would be one of
the points yeah that's certainly
possible use cases and user stories is a
very good tool as well but since I had
to keep 250 minutes I had to choose some
of the methods that I have found the
most useful and the reason I did not
choose use cases and user stories is not
because it's not very useful and very
informative but because most people
actually are using that already it's one
of the more known techniques and I want
it to introduce to you some of the
lesser known technique techniques but
it's a very good technique yeah
definitely anyone else yeah you often
have the case that you change an
existing process or could you speak up
sorry often it's the case that you have
to change an existing process or page
yes how do you deal with that are you
going to go completely blank in
it depends it depends if if what you're
looking for is a revolution rather than
evolution then I would go blank and just
scrap what you have and start from
scratch if you're more looking at
evolving something that's already
existing then I would definitely do a
test of what you already have do we use
the test of what you already have find
out what works and what doesn't work in
that and then of course fix what doesn't
work and and and whatever you find that
really works well be sure to have that
in your new system or site or program or
whatever it is and another way of
informing something like that is also
look at what your competitors are doing
and and I'm not everybody is so
saint-like but it didn't I mean good
people they get inspired great people
they steal that's what they say and I
think it's right I mean today to come up
with something that has never ever been
seen before you might go an entire
lifetime without being able to do that
and there's no point if people have
already invented something that works
really well why not get inspired by that
and then fit it to whatever it is you're
doing so look at your competitors even
look at related fields that have
something that might work in your field
get inspired alright I think that was
the last question
