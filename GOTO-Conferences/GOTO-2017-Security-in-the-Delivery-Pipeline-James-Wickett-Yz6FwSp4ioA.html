so who am i i work at signal sciences i
also help with devops days austin I work
at lynda.com I'm an author on stuff over
on the DevOps DevOps fundamental stuff
over there and I'm recovering from a lot
of years of operations work and security
work and and all that that stuff and I
wanted to start up front with a I want
to start with with a summary so if
you're like after these next three
slides if you decide like this isn't
this isn't really the talk I thought I'd
want to go to you're free to leave right
so hopefully hopefully you'll stay but I
think the the path that we're gonna try
to talk about here is security is still
making the journey from DevOps it's not
it's not over this is still undergoing
process security seize new opportunities
to automate and add value I think the
delivery pipeline we usually think of it
kind of a small like we think of it as
Jenkins or Travis or whatever but like
we need to think about the pipeline in a
wider breadth and I think culture and
truly need to align to help us make this
work and coverage for security needs to
happen mainly in three areas where you
inherit stuff where you build stuff and
you have your runtime and I have some
advice on the side like how to deal with
auditors and other people that are
blockers inside of your organization as
you're moving forward so I'd like to
start with a CI CD journey and how like
as you're thinking about going with
continuous delivery I wanted to give you
a little story like how I I went through
that how I went through that process so
I've done this at three different
companies and currently I'm at signal
Sciences and now we do about 15 deploys
a day we're moving fast we're always
kind of an enabling our team to kind of
go go quickly
roughly we've done about 10,000 deploys
in the last two and a half years kind of
development and we sort of were we're
getting things started and maybe more
than that but we'd kind of like lost
track of the early days we're not we're
not exactly sure and early on I I was
tasked at work it was like hey we're
gonna build this we're gonna build this
thing that like allows us to deploy and
help push this out and it's gonna be you
and you're gonna demo it in a couple
weeks and I was like
oh sweet like that's that's great and so
I you know said a prayer and I read the
continuous delivery book by John Bull
and it's like alright I'm gonna make
this like this happen and we're gonna
try to try to make that happen so I
really both jazz and Dave are really
great and really appreciate their work
that they did on that book it's totally
worth checking out
and one of the things that really was
helpful for me to think about in this is
like continuous delivery is how little
you can deploy at a single point right
it's like I want to deploy just like a
one-line change and be able to walk that
through the whole pipeline in the middle
as little time as possible and we
started talking about words like we want
to optimize for total total cycle time
that's the time that something goes in
when you when you push it into your get
your github or your version control
system and it actually rolls out into
production so time to push to time
customers are using it and so at first
we were like like five minutes or seven
minutes and now I think we get it down
to like let's see what it probably like
two minutes or so on average depending
on like if you change certain bits like
there's invokes other tests sometimes
and you get that'll be a three or four
minute deploy and then then we built a
button right we said let's build this
thing so anybody in the organization can
go in and once you commit code you
deploy it and and kind of off it goes
and and so we're also a security company
and whereas the software as a service
security company and we wanted to make
sure that continuous delivery and all
that stuff included security like this
couldn't just be something that we just
did and didn't didn't kind of fit with
our overall our overall story and before
I was in signal Sciences I also found
this idea of rugged software circa like
2010 and there's this lovely
presentation by Josh Corman David Rice
and Jeff Williams and in it they started
talking about things that that that gave
us new ideas of what security really
could be and so I think I pulled this
out of slides that I did in like 2012 it
was like security like it's always
there's a lot of problems with security
you're kind of judged on like absence of
events like success is not really well
known
it's high cost it's often negative in a
lot of organizations had a lot of fear
uncertainty and doubt and really it's
like a toxic word like you want to go
into an organization and like not get
promotions and not do well it's like
like I'm the security person they're
like okay you know go over there right
and anybody is that ever happened to a
friend yeah right so but rugged it was
like this idea and some of the people in
the security industry that had been
there for a long time started thinking
like well what if we started talking
about this is a quality problem and we
want to start verifying like we're
providing the right qualities that we
start adding benefits to the
organization stuff that's affirming
stuff that's positive and we're putting
like known quantities on things and
therefore there's a while there's like
we should have the software should sit
with like ship with like the cereal box
label to tell you like you know what
what stuff is included in this and all
the dependencies that are built into it
but at the time we were really trying to
wrestle with the idea of what does this
look like to do things in a different
way than the way we did before and then
about four or five years ago I started
the gauntlet project which is which I'll
talk about more later but that is a way
for us to help kind of take security and
DevOps and kind of merge those together
in a way that groups can collaborate and
I found over time like security is
different in a continuous integration
world and security has a dilemma and
that dilemma is that it doesn't really
know what it's doing doesn't really know
how well it's doing and I think that in
security we always kind of came up with
this idea like you're we have this
binary bifurcation of how we think about
about security so it was always are we
breached or are we unbreached are we
secured or unsecured and like we didn't
really resist it was just a one zero
type relationship there and I don't know
like that's it's not good it's actually
not true a state of reality it's
actually an over adduction ism of what
we're trying to do it and I think that
we would we would take these complex
systems and just try to say like I've
got a lot of firewalls and like
everything's blocked and so like they're
there therefore now we're okay
but I think that we we start kind of
moving away from that that question of
whether we're breached or whether we're
secure and we start thinking of how does
security add value
I think we're left with a different
approach we're left with a different a
different a different way of thinking
and I think that's going to be more in
line with the kind of the future as
security is growing so I'll quickly
summarize summarize how I think that we
got to this state so agile came on the
scene and everyone was really excited
and it tried to remove the kind of the
ability of not knowing what we're doing
and how we're getting there it just said
we're going to we're going to ship it
right and it largely worked in a large
and a large number of ways but really it
just created a culture that they gave us
fast delivery fast feedback loops and
but it never really
oh it sorry I got these slides that
order that's this is my funny slide so
that's about and those are about as
funny as they're gonna get I got it just
warned yeah like I mean I know it's
afternoon alright so but but we we
didn't really get a jellal the way into
operations like and it sort of stopped
there and I think that was that was
whenever we started to see the next rise
right and that's when DevOps came on the
scene there's a continuation of agile
operations in Tom ylim and Shelley's
book he says the same thing DevOps is
the application of agile methodology to
system administration and then let's see
in 2009 there's the famous we do ten
deploys a day over at Flickr
presentation of velocity this is a big
system operations conference and
everybody there just sort of lost it
they're like you you know you do deploys
once a quarter you know if you're lucky
maybe once a month if you're like a real
cowboy or something but you're not doing
tend to plays a day that's ridiculous
and and it was at that conference and a
couple other things that happen around
that time period what DevOps really
started to take off Patrick Dubois I had
the first DevOps days he coined the term
and had the event here not too far away
here and again and early days you know
we were really good at Photoshop in the
DevOps community so we were like
we just sort of wanted to like
illustrate our problem right it's the
development and operations to two
incompatible things because we kind of
had this wall between us and so we're
really spending a lot of times tearing
down the wall I'm like if you go to
DevOps today's events there's a lot of
cultural talks because in a lot of
organizations this is still this is
still existing or still kind of in the
process of going through that and we
always encapsulated it with this with
this presentation and or this this
graphic and it was it was just like it's
sort of this this picture embodies kind
of all DevOps I had to train some sales
guys recently and I said you know like
this here's two graphics I just showed
them this graphic in the previous
graphic and I was like that's DevOps and
they're like yeah we got it
like that's it right there like that
they got the emotion aspect and it's why
we really spend a lot of time in the
cultural pieces of DevOps early on
we also found in a lot of organizations
you saw like a ten to one ratio of
developers to operations folks like so
it's a complete order you know it's
roughly different for different
organizations different teams different
things that you're doing but there it's
an order of magnitude problem that we
just weren't able to solve right away
Patrick Dubois he says you know culture
is the most important aspect to DevOps
and for it to succeed in the enterprise
and I think it was like in 2011 or 2012
there's the Qatar IT Journal and there
was there was because there's early days
and it's like can you do DevOps in the
enterprise and I was on one of the teams
that was featured in that one of my my
co-workers Ernest molar and good friend
but our team had just kind of at the
right time like we had we'd gone cloud
in 2010 with with kind of a charter and
we also said hey we're gonna do be doing
this thing called DevOps and it was like
sure we don't we don't care let's just
do it and then we started to see like
how this was able to affect a lot of
changes in the enterprise and it was
really really fun time but it really
drove me to think about culture like how
are we how are we changing our culture
and I think there's four keys that I
would leave you to culture and I'm not
an expert on this I'm not a psychologist
or any of that stuff but I've always
seen like you have you start kind of
building a mutual understanding you
build shared language shared views about
how things work and then you put tooling
in place that helps encourage all that
collaboration and those pre
things I have a I have a five-year-old
daughter and when she was three or so in
her rooms position so like right when
you look out the windows you can see the
moon as its setting and so every every
time you know not all the time but
whenever there's like the right right
time of year and everything we and time
that night when she's going to bed and
we'd see it and we look at the moon and
we talk about the moon and we started
having like these same values and the
same same understanding and then I
started to figure out like a couple days
later I was like I got excited like I
would come home and I would tell my wife
was like oh we're gonna see the moon cuz
like the moon is out tonight and then
then I started installing apps like moon
tracking apps and like weather apps and
like trying to know like what phases the
moon and it's like now I could tell my
three-year-old daughter and impress her
with like the moon phase you know you
know it's it's ridiculous right but but
like all that stuff started to change
right like a new thing happened for me
like a new priority happened and I
thought that was to me I think that kind
of illustrates those four four key
aspects but all this you know we're kind
of here how we got here where was
security and all this has security just
been sitting by and and I really think
they have they haven't really
participated in this and they're just
now sort of making the making the change
part of the problem is like security has
always come from a compliance driven
aspect it's it's been inevitable in our
industry but that was a that was the way
that we kind of spent the last 10 15
years there's this really great book
it's about browser security but the
first chapter in the book he goes and
does this talks about this history of
security all over the way from like the
60s to like the modern day a web browser
and where we sit and I'd like to read
this quote for you he's talking about
risk assessment but doing security by
risk assessment introduces a dangerous
fallacy that structured inadequacy is
almost as good as adequacy and that
underfunded security efforts plus risk
management are about as good as properly
funded security work and does that does
that bother anybody in here does that
leave you feeling uneasy yeah it made it
like made me upset right I'm like what
what the heck like why would we
how believe that we could have this that
we could just have bad bad workmanship
bad quality and just say because we put
enough structure around it we put enough
legal policies around we bought enough
insurance around it then now we're good
like that that makes no sense you
wouldn't do that in the real world why
do we do this with software and why is
that why is that idea and also we saw in
organizations there's this there's
another problem like it's not just ten
to one it's like a hundred to one or
three hundred to one or three hundred to
half like like it doesn't matter what
the actual numbers are but like
everybody I've asked like these are
these are order of magnitude type
problems and security doesn't have the
resources and one of the hidden secrets
about security is like there's not
enough people in the industry to solve
this problem like if you said tomorrow
we're gonna like 3x our security teams
like you couldn't do it there's not
enough bodies to do that in the industry
and you've seen you see security people
hop jobs every eighteen months because
it's like recruiters keep calling them
and they keep doing it's just like just
like development but maybe even like
hotter right now like it's great it's
crazy
and also security because of all that
other stuff because they're they've been
addicted to compliance and kind of been
been sitting in the organization that
way because there's the large Delta
between you know how many people are
working on security is the cultural
outlier and a lot of organizations and
they don't really want the same thing I
had a friend so I've always kind of been
the security guy on the team and one of
my friends and he was actually like my
manager at the time was like well
security you guys just prefer to have a
system that are powered off and
unplugged and I was like well ok I guess
but like that that sort of hurts my
feelings you think I'm like it I like I
know that if we do that like I have no
job like you know I'm not I'm not an
idiot
right and then yeah you know I try not
to do this because I've lived the pain
on the other side but how many security
people have ever said like those stupid
developers right has anybody heard
security people say that as if a friend
would have said that right it happens
and it's not it doesn't feel good and
but I think this illustrates that is a
divide between the two also have I found
this lovely gym in a
a white paper from these people they're
doing web app firewalls and I'd like to
read this to you this is every aspect of
managing web app firewalls is an ongoing
process that's the antithesis of a
sudden and forget a technology that's
the real point of this research sits to
maximize value maximize value from your
web app firewall you need to go in with
everyone's eyes open to the effort
required to get it to get and keep the
laughs running productively so when they
go on to tell you like you need two or
three headcount to do this right a very
questionable technology that's for any
any effect and we don't have enough
people in the industry anyways and now
you're saying like now my new business
is running this piece of junky
technology right and I don't mention the
name because I don't want to you know
make fun of them publicly but Security's
always taken that same approach like
they put a really heavy constraint on
resources it's a big bottleneck approach
there is an article I guess last year in
Fortune magazine the average time to
deliver for corporate projects is not
only as has gotten worse it's increased
over the last five years which you know
as a DevOps person like makes you really
sad like I'm like why is that and then
the next thing he says well the growth
of security functions which is too
poorly coordinated and resulting a
proliferation of new tasks in the areas
of compliance privacy and data
protection is the main reason and the
main culprit for that and so ok so now
we now we see that security is is
causing a real problem ok this is a new
one it is 30 times cheaper to fix
security defects and prod are in dev
versus prod newsflash 2002 right and and
and so I this came on this came in my
mail in a in a flyer from a security
company within like the last year like
it was like hey we have news like it's
it's more expense you gotta be kidding
me right but security is feeling the
same pressure like they're behind as
well alright so that might have been the
funniest one so I'm a little worried for
the right for your sake for the rest of
the slides because that was that was my
best one okay well anyways Security's
ineffective oh that might that's pretty
funny too I like that one
all right mr. robot fans but I think
security knows that it needs to change
or die and I think it's true in the
history and I think we've seen it across
across the way Stephen Bullivant he's
written the firewall book that was it
was really huge and he came out with a
book last year or I guess a year and a
half ago he says companies are spending
a great deal on security but we read a
massive computer related attacks and
clearly something is wrong the ROO the
problem is twofold we're protecting the
wrong things and we're hurting
productivity in the process so it's he
sees that security is like in in both
ways like causing a problem we're not
adding value and we're protecting the
wrong things of course you know you
could just print a million of these
slides and show like they asked security
is expensive the the last DevOps the
state of DevOps report last year our
performers spend 50 percent less time or
median security issues than low
performers high-performing organizations
achieve quality by incorporating
security and security teams into the
delivery process and here are some of
the findings that they came out of this
rich mogul who's a big in the security
industry at RSA Conference got up and
said and in front of a large large crowd
and said a large percent of the
companies that are hanging out in the
show floor here will not be here in five
years and he said you know basically
everything that we know about the
security industry is changing that we
see that the writing is on the wall and
all that stuff is happening as we go a
couple years ago Zane Lackey gave this
presentation about how at Etsy they
deliver faster better cheaper and I
watched that and I thought it's that's
right on as a friend of Zane's but I
also was really really excited to see
that that approach all right so let's
talk about SEI CD pipeline and what that
looks looks like so I think for
different people pipelines are gonna
look look a little bit different and
most people will break it down into some
grouping of this like design build
operate or a design build deploy operate
I also like to think about inherit is
like one of the steps there and I'm just
going to focus on these three spots
inherit build and operate and I'll
explain what I mean at that here and and
there's there's other stuff you can do
in these pieces like you should you
should do all the design pieces there's
other stuff like for
and in your design you know you do do I
write dataflow threat models and all
that business but I'm not really an
expert in that so I'm not going to spend
time on that and then on the deploy
piece totally you should manage your
secrets vault other stuff like that also
not going to talk about that because
that's really specific to your language
your framework and all the stuff that
you're using but I'd like to talk about
these these three and these are the
three considerations I'd like to propose
and maybe maybe a couple questions that
you can think about that it might help
drive drive you forward as you're as
you're going through here
what have I bundled into my application
that leaves me vulnerable and and think
about not just the the couple packages
that you you know install with your
install with your your actual app that
you called in there your any
dependencies in the app but think about
like what about the OS level what about
the the provider that I'm using to
deploy it on the talk on docker stuff
this morning or this after this
afternoon was great because as you think
about all the stuff you're bundling in
it's like do you want a bundle in 128
Meg's or five Meg's of dependencies
right and you can start breaking that
stuff down for build do i do my build
and build acceptance tests and
integration test catch security issues
before release like how many people are
doing security testing in their build
phases couple yeah okay great but you
know I think there's there's a lot more
that can be done in that phase and we
often just sort of skip by that and say
hey we'll pick that up pick that up
later and then operationally it might be
an attacked right now and if I am like
is it working are they actually getting
any any successful foothold the company
I work for we kind of play in this laugh
space a little bit or we playing this
last space but we ask you know we ask
people all the time like do you know if
you're being attacked and like you just
usually blank stares right and it won't
out any of our customers I'd be bad but
like it's kind of like that's indicative
of the industry that's indicative of
what what we actually know what's going
on with our system Shane and Lisa gave
this talk over a DevOps days Austin
and broke it up into these four phases
and I liked it because really asked at
each of those phases different questions
and so I borrowed some of my ideas from
that and so just want to make sure she
had good good coverage there okay
security in the delivery pipeline so
inherit what you know we've already
talked about this a little bit today
okay open SSL right all of a sudden it's
like oh I have a lot of problems why
because I'm using this thing or
shellshock because I'm using this you
know old version of bash or whatever
Gareth rush Grove did a great
presentation on what's inside the
container and showing how many how many
containers have vulnerabilities in them
there's statistics out there saying like
30 percent of docker images out there
have vulnerabilities right now dr. hub
you can actually see the vulnerabilities
listed out with different types of
containers if you're using something
like Ruby you should be doing like a
bundler audit to check like what gems
you have going on there there's other
other tools like Linnaeus that do the
same thing if you're doing service
there's a thing called snick which does
dependency checking for service but
specifically a node there's docker bench
which will check for dozens of common
best practices and things that you're
doing for deploying and and and dealing
with containers in production also a
good Erland friend of mine has this
library called retire Jas it checks if
you're using any any JavaScript that's
like no longer any good we do this for
our for our sites where we're delivering
things and just you never know like
whenever something your keep something
statically a static static website and
then you know the version of jQuery or
whatever you're using is no longer any
good because it's got some
vulnerabilities you want to be alerted
to that so putting all that stuff in
your build pipeline is really great yeah
and I think that's kind of fits Kimber
if I have any other stuff on this but
you want to instrument your CI system
with all the checks for all the things
that you inherit and that's just as much
as you possibly can if you're using
containers like twistlock and aqua or
you know look at some of the type stuff
and Blackduck if you have some money but
there's a lot of like free stuff that
you can pull in I depending on your
language and all that stuff you just
pull those pull those in all right on
the on the build side Security's
function of qual
and I think that when we look across all
code languages this is from a white hat
security report like a couple years back
if you look across it doesn't matter
which language you're in
they all have vulnerabilities so across
the top is like ASP ColdFusion net Java
Perl PHP and then on this on the left
hand side there is cross-site scripting
and all like the OWASP top 10 all the
way down and they're just showing like
all languages everywhere have problems
and so we can't just say like oh I'm
using go like I'm good now right or I
can just say oh or using I don't know
yeah I don't know it's like you pick on
any one of the languages here you don't
want to do that so we used to go at work
so I guess I'll pick on that one but
also another problem with security and
the way that you like instrument that
inside of a build pipeline is security
tools are really noisy they you run them
and if you pick up like just an
off-the-shelf scanner and you hook it up
to your your system that you want to do
some testing on it'll like try to spider
it and then it'll of you know enumerate
a bunch of stuff and then you'll come
back like three hours later and it'll
either be crashed or it'll like show you
something may be useful or it'll show
you a bunch of stuff that's not really
true and if you've ever had as anybody
had to deal with security scanners so I
saw a couple chuckles so if you've had
to deal with those you kind of know I'm
talking about right and then in the end
you're kind of left with this like giant
PDF or whatever to deal with but so I
sort of felt that we really needed a new
way to collaborate across like
developers operations and security and
to see what we could do to make that
happen and I was hoping to really make a
language that would kind of put some of
that collaboration into practice and so
that's why I started working on a
project called gauntlet
call it is open source at MIT license
comes with a lot of pre can steps
that'll help you compose and in what we
call attack files some statements to go
ahead and like be mean to your code
which is our little tagline that we like
to use it doesn't install any tools but
it does sit really nicely inside of your
CI CD pipeline it's built on top of
cucumber it's not really meant to be a
peer replacement for like a BDD type
thing but it functions in the same way
so it has good
good handling of of exit status and all
that you can check it out at Gamla org
but the the general idea in our very
slick graphics here is that you would
run your code through the gauntlet there
there it is
did you see it just don't need it do it
again okay yeah you're gonna be like in
your and your feedback forms would be
like awesome graphics like I'm hoping
that will come through okay that's like
that's the full jokes that's all I got
anyways I'll just stick to the slides
now so if we look in the directory we
look at the attack files and it pulls in
all those attack files and you're just
getting started by doing it like a
simple gym install we also have docker
containers which I think you have an
another slide but if you read through
this it sort of fits kind of an English
language approach here so given I'm I'm
looking for cross-site scripting and I'm
gonna do it against a URL on my site and
you can make it more specific so like on
my login page I'm going to look for this
and then then you give it a scenario
with some description there and then you
say given that I have the tooling that I
need in place installed when I launch an
attack against this URL
I expect that the output should have
zero issues detected if not failed
failed the test and and send an alert
status out I was just talking to a
friend over at UnitedHealthcare and he
was telling me that it's like we have
saved millions of dollars using garland
for the largest healthcare industry
project out there right now in the
United States and I was like oh man I
should have figured I had to get tens of
those you know but you know he's really
you know saying that they were able to
start taking all these pieces of their
applications across their entire stack I
think there's this project spans like
three hundred three hundred applications
he was saying it started putting in like
default default checks so looking for
cross-site scripting looking for sequel
injection you can kind of set up some
parameters and like was starting to able
to bake up all these things together and
now they got everybody testing kind of a
low bar a low bar security threshold
there I did a workshop a couple saygus
about a year and a half ago with Matt
Johansson and it's
it's at this bitly link so if you're
interested in it it's got eight labs for
how to use gauntlet
it's got using gauntlet for doing things
like network checks if you want to like
do things like that or if you want to
check for application issues like
cross-site scripting or sequel the
sequel injection or other apses I don't
know it's feeling I don't know what I
was I don't know what I meant there I'm
sorry about that
and then handling reporting so you can
you can report in two different formats
you can pump out to JSON or whatever how
to hook it up with environment variables
and importantly showing you how to do it
in a CI system and a CI setup so there's
the the bitly link but you can check it
out again it's all using this project
inside of our repo instead of github
just called gothic gauntlets
- demo and I'm really sorry for the
spelling like when we released the gym
originally like the gym with an EE was
taken so you know you got a deal with
the smaller hipster gauntlet with it
just a tee there and so it's pretty easy
to get started we also have a starter
kit that installs a virtual machine and
gets you to bootstrap there and really
we're just trying to help think through
like creating feedback loops right we
want to create a lot of feedback loops
from development operations and security
and that's the hope that gauntlet would
do inside of those teams because now
you're able to take the the knowledge
strapped and and time time resource
strapped people in the security the one
at 110 won and they're able to implement
their kind of knowledge base into the
end of the system and everybody else can
reference it and you don't have to be a
security expert to see like oh like that
test started failing whenever I checked
in this new code like that's you know
you may not know what the test actually
does but you can now get to the root of
like okay now I have cross-site
scripting for some reason it wasn't
wasn't sure why also gauntlet demo is
also hooked inside of Travis so it runs
CI builds if you're interested in
checking that out and that's what those
those look like a lot of teams are using
Gallatin containers because you're like
I don't want Ruby on it so even for our
stuff inside inside of single Sciences
we use call it in a docker container and
it just spins up runs all the attacks
and then
and turns out the results for us and you
can check that out at gauntlet docker
other stuff you might want to check out
in this space zette attack proxy is a
really cool project it lets you do if
your views like a web proxy but it lets
you do replay of things and you're able
to do both fuzz testing and just other
type of attacks with it as well if
you're doing static code analysis
something like break man's a really cool
tool I think that was mentioned a little
bit earlier and that's but that's
specifically for Ruby hey check that out
alright I think we're in the last last
bit here how's everybody doing we're
hanging in ok good
all right so configuration run time you
know earlier today we're talking about
configuration is one of the biggest
problems that we have and and you know
problems we fix I didn't show you some
of the other slides from that white hat
report but it's like problems we have
today and then then come back a year
later percentage of problems that got
fixed and it's like yeah like you know
it's like or how about how often a bug
stays open at a corporation that's you
know medium level or lower it's like 200
days 500 days something crazy and your
do you think well how's that even
possible okay so for configuration
I like chef in spec you can do but you
know for using chef like that's useful
if you're using something else you know
check them check that out for those I
only know stuff that I know right
but you can do audit and do CIS
benchmarks on machines other stuff that
you could look at for cloud providers
ever do thread stack alienvault they'll
look at your cloud configuration and see
like did anything change in between and
be able to do reporting on that I know
there's other companies in the space but
I've some friends at some of those
places and I think those are good pretty
good options to least start taking a
look at there okay so for run time okay
and that's that's pretty much my best
gif and the whole thing okay so okay you
know run time is arguably the most
important place to start and I think
that's the most important place to
instrument because you're actually able
to see what is actually happening with
your application and it can inform some
of the other things downstream so you
want to think about am i under attack
and where am i under attack you can get
a lot of benefit using like something
like modsecurity and pumping that over
to a log stash did an elk stack and
reporting out of that other things you
want to look at in this space or like
rasp next gen laugh or like web
protection platforms which is kind of a
marketing mouthful there but you should
also look at other other companies I
know that
Ruben's company would also fit up here
on this list so you definitely want to
give them give them a check and the
marketing team was going to see this I
had to say that they're ours are the
best but really like you want to be
doing rasp you want to be doing
something in this space to see like what
is actually under attack what's going on
here alright so you want to start
figuring out how to detect what matters
so whether that's code instrumentation
in the actual app itself or whatever but
you're looking for things like account
takeover attempts what part of the site
gets more attacks than others most
likely of vectors of attack business
logic flaws I had this really
interesting conversation with a friend
and they were saying what they saw and
their runtime actually informed how they
were going to prioritize their backlog
because they were doing all these bug
bounties and they were there you know
saying okay
$20,000 up for grabs if you hack our
hack our site anything that came in high
or critical like that got fixed like
immediately anything came in medium or
low just kind of went into the backlog
and they paid out like a hundred bucks
or whatever for the for the bounty but
just never really prioritized in their
their environment and then through
adding runtime instrumentation they were
able to say oh like we are our login
page gets like these types of attacks
and like do we have anything with that
tag that's in our backlog oh yeah let's
prioritize that like those are vectors
that people are actively going against
our site with and so we want to know we
want to know that I should have been
should have oh well if you're doing a
bug bounty that's right here's a couple
of bug bounty sites that are they're
good these are also commercial but you
can I mean you can run your own of
course but these are something to kind
of make it easy to easy to hit there one
thing that I found is a is a problem is
a lot of times people will kind of you
say I want to do a pipeline developers
going to push code and then they say
things like
you know you gotta have separation of
duties and you know just like go to is
considered harmful we're gonna say
separation of duties is considered
harmful we're not we're not people you
know launching nuclear missiles right
you don't need two people to turn a key
to your you have like your paid staff
that are engineers that are it should be
allowed to be trusted with their
environment and you can defend this with
even in PCI I think it's like PCI 36 or
can remember the exact number but there
is a little wine it says like you need
to have separation of duties and but if
you read the guidance it just says the
same account that's used for development
cannot be used to use to push for
production it doesn't say that the same
person can't do it or whatever like a
lot of enterprises and big organizations
have interpreted this way I have a
friend who was an auditor and she's like
oh yeah we've been doing this for like
decades where where people would you
know just the same person that developed
it you know is also pushing it small
teams and you can take that same law and
process an approval control process and
like make it work for four big teams and
she was working at a big company doing
the same thing and kind of that's how
they do it so you just invest in
improving out your pipeline making sure
that the controls are so that
development and test and production
accounts don't match and that there has
to be some promotion going on there's a
there's a toolkit there's called the
DevOps audit defense toolkit it was kind
of a bunch of security and compliance
people that said okay we want to give
people that are doing DevOps and
security a way to move forward without
being blocked by all the lawyers and
accountants and stuff and so we they
produce this 20 page PDF and it kind of
goes through assists can different
compliance specs and it breaks it down
because system by system controlled by
control and helps you map to say yeah
here here's how we get over that and so
just a little bit of argument if your
auditor and kind of this document and
you should be should be square to go if
you're not I'd love to love to hear that
okay so there's three things that I
learned come on the journey and I think
we're kind of running late on time three
lessons I learned one security is not a
binary event so we want to embrace
feedback loops and continually kind of
continually innovating there we also
want to think of attack driven defense
instead of compliance driven driven
defense
no one no one's gonna be adding value
just by checking the checkbox of
compliance but if you're able to
actually actively know where people have
an insight into where you're undergoing
attacks or being able to defend against
that whether in development or in run
time like that's really beneficial also
there's a there's a lot of movement
inside if you're in security or your
friend in security might suggest to them
like every time their a blocker someone
is going to go around them and in in the
Riot Games office they have this big
sign that says like if you are a blocker
if security is functions as a blocker
you will be routed around right it's
because people are going to get the work
done that they need to get done
whether security says they can or not so
you want to be part of adding value to
the chain and you know putting as much
automation in place but not not making
those other things so all right so
here's the summary that we went through
earlier hopefully that went good like I
said if you want the slides you can hit
that email I should Auto respond to you
and I think that's it any questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
