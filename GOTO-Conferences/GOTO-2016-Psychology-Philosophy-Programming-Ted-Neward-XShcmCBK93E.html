me but this is probably this slide that
people least care about so we move on so
you come to a technical conference and
you see a track on philosophy and the
first session in that track is
psychology philosophy and programming so
I think it's fairly safe to ask what
exactly are we trying to accomplish with
not only this particular talk but with
this particular track and it wants to
I'm actually going to steal some
material that I've used in some other
sessions that I've done particularly
around software architecture and in
particular I want you to look at this
couple of pictures right now if we look
at this picture it is fairly safe to
assume that these two buildings were
constructed differently using different
materials different processes different
level of expertise etc as a matter of
fact I would be willing to wager that if
we were to bring your boss the clueless
manager or we were willing to bring your
users the idiots that you know give you
constantly wrong requirements and if we
were to put them in a room and say the
difference between these two buildings
they would be able to recognize it yes
agree if you disagree you're working
with either really coolest users or a
really hapless manager and I just can't
help you I'm sorry there'll be a support
group after the conference but this
raises a really interesting question
because every single one of us has lived
this nightmare speaking of psychology's
gentleman by name of Carl Jung has this
theory that we all share what he called
the collective unconscious it's kind of
like the force anything that one of us
feels we all sort of collectively
understand it's how we understood that
like you know Siberian tigers were bad
for our health back in the very early
days of the caveman
and every single programmer knows this
story where your boss comes into your
cubicle one day and says hey I need you
to create a prototype for the guys in
marketing because they want to know if
we can do a particular project and you
say okay boss
sure I'll go create that prototype I'll
just slap some stuff together I'll go
down to the lumberyard figuratively
speaking
grab some scrap wood slam some stuff
together over a weekend and voila we
have a dog out so I have a prototype for
the guys in marketing to look at the
next week your boss comes back and says
hey how's that prototype and you say oh
it's ready
oh cool let me get the guys from
marketing they sit down in your cube you
show it to them right you've got some
mocked up data you threw some jQuery in
there may be some bootstrap to make it
look good and the guys in marketing are
like that's awesome and you realize
what's coming next but you're like an
action star in a movie you're too slow
to ship it and now you are responsible
for project dog house and you go to your
boss a couple months later and say hey
boss I want to transfer to a different
department of the boss says no you can't
you're the only one who understands
project dog house and that's a mission
critical application and you say fine I
quit I'm gonna go work at the company
across town and that's all well and good
until a couple months later you're at a
Christmas party and your body who's like
you know got other friends from other
companies introduces you to somebody and
somebody says wait I knew that name
didn't you work on project dog house
I've got some questions for you
why on earth were you thinking and
you're like aha
so you leave the country which is not
hard at Amsterdam you drive for like two
miles in any direction and you're
outside of the country but you leave the
country you go to Seattle right not that
this is a personal story or anything you
go to Seattle and this is all well and
good for a couple of years then all of a
sudden somebody emails you and says wait
you work on project doghouse back in
Lindon it's a prototype but you've felt
this story right even if you've never
lived this story you know somebody who
knows somebody who knows somebody who
watched this happen right so when the
boss comes up to you and says hey I need
you to put together a prototype for the
guys in marketing you're like ah no
you're not gonna get me I know how this
works
I know what's coming next so when the
boss comes back a week later and says
hey how's that prototype coming you say
Oh boss we are making serious progress
we are almost finished with iteration
zero we are just about ready to finish
which language and tools and web
framework we're going to use we know
that we're gonna store it up on get
everybody has the appropriate access to
the source project we've decided which
continuous integration tool we're going
to use we have a meeting next week to
decide which of the four databases we
might work with and your boss is like
time out
I wanted a prototype what in the hell
are you doing and you're like whoa I
mean software craftsmanship man I know
what's gonna happen next and the boss
says yeah what happens next is you're
fired
and you each of you walk away thinking
the other is an idiot and this begs the
question because if you were to ask your
boss hey boss can I put together one of
these the same way I put together one of
those your boss would say absolutely not
that's ridiculous that's stupid but when
he asks you for a prototype and then
puts it into production because it looks
good
how exactly does this disconnect happen
this is I mean let's let's be really
clear most bosses are not idiots this
may come as a surprise to many of you
they're not idiots most people are
actually fairly rational human beings
the problem lies in the fact that
programming is an extremely ephemeral
activity look
want somebody in this room anybody in
this room to point to the software where
is the software this thing that we've
been talking about four to three days
depending upon whether you're in the
workshops that you've been working with
for some or all of your career where is
it point to it oh well you're pointing
to this metallic thing that you're
holding in your hand that's the software
or that's the hardware this is the
problem if we were to actually crack
that thing open if we were to actually
look inside really really deeply with a
microscope right we would see the
threads we would see the objects right
there really tiny because we get a lot
of them perper whatever in there right
and and and we would see the the sort of
the garbage collector coming around with
a broom and a dust bin to clean up the
objects every so often right we would
see the processes with their walls in
between one another right we would see
all of these things that we talk about
as if they were real what would we
really see electrical pulses doing this
really really fast that's what we do
guys we just basically make the thing go
like this really really really really
fast
unless you use groovy and then it's a
little bit slower
does it make sense then that nobody else
understands what we do because we work
in a world of make-believe we pretend
like it's real we put lovely pictures up
on the stage and we point to them we
create pictures of what is supposed to
be software we pretend like somehow this
has some reflection to reality we all of
us nod sagely when somebody shows us a
UML diagram and go oh I understand now
even when somebody shows a source code
is that the program no that is the human
representation of the instructions to
the machine to actually run the program
we can't ever see the program when you
try to debug a program what are you
doing are you actually looking at the
program and asking it how it feels it's
kind of like going to the doctor right
you go to the doctor cuz you feel ill
and the doctor says how do you feel and
you say well I feel ill and the doctor
says well what happens when I do this
does it hurt more or less and you say
more or you see less you say not at all
what do we do when a program is ill we
ask another program we fire up the
debugger and say program debugger can
you please tell me how program hello
world is feeling this is like going to
the doctor with your spouse and the
doctor doesn't talk to you the doctor
only talks to your spouse those of you
who are married you know what I mean
right
doctor says how is he feeling your wife
says he's feeling bad doctor says well
what hurts and she says his arm doctor
look I don't know whatever she said man
seriously I don't know does that make
any sense whatsoever it's an extremely
ephemeral activity we don't deal with
the real world guys we deal with this
incredibly abstracted world when we talk
about programs when we talk about
threads when we talk about objects and
the heap and so forth these are all
abstractions on
top of abstractions on top of
abstractions on top of abstractions
there is no other industry in the world
that is as heavily abstracted as ours is
and given that we deal with these
abstractions on a daily basis it would
seem reasonable that it would be a in
our best interests to examine these
mechanisms both the idea of an
abstraction what is it how does it work
as well as the very mechanism by which
the most important thing that we use
during programming that is to say the
gray matter between your ears it would
help to know how these things work now
this means that I draw from the liberal
arts of philosophy and psychology
psychology is kind of on the border
between liberal art and science people
sometimes go either direction depending
upon where you go inside psychology
first caveat I am neither a professional
psychologist nor am i a professional
philosopher I am however a programmer
which kind of makes me both and
newsflash kind of makes you both as well
so if you're going to pretend to be one
of these people it would probably help
to know what these subjects are about we
begin with philosophy that is to say
dead Greeks and togas what exactly is
philosophy the word actually means love
of wisdom or love of knowledge depending
on how you want to translate the ancient
Greek and in many respects it is the
fundamental root of all thinking because
it seeks to answer many of the questions
that we can ask ourselves as a matter of
fact anybody who's ever participated in
one of those thoughtful debates over
dinner with friends or family for
example if you could have fame or
fortune which would you choose you're
engaging in philosophical debate you're
thinking about things you're thinking
about and for whatever reason you may
say well you know at least with Fame I
have influence and I could save the
whales or if I have fortune then I could
actually run for president and we can
see how well that's working right this
is a philosophical debate interestingly
enough there is a there's a just a
deeply philosophical answer to what his
philosophy is to say that is the central
question that philosophy seeks to answer
and at a certain point you start going
oh come on that guy over here rolled his
eyes really that's philosophy but yes
that is because it is this act of
staring into a mirror in some abstract
form and trying to answer questions that
science can't as a matter of fact
philosophy is the fundamental root of
science it is kind of where it began I
already said all this there are
depending upon who you read there are
several different branches of philosophy
there's a gentleman by name of Roger
Scruton scru tion he's a very
opinionated philosopher as many
philosophers are and he actually breaks
it up into these five branches
metaphysics epistemology logic moral
philosophy and ethics and political
philosophy and you can break it up into
further categories you can actually I
mean that's one of the great debates of
philosophy is to try to break up how
philosophy applies and so on and so
forth
and this is really just a guidepost
realisticly philosophy is about talking
about things reasoning about things
arguing about things arguing about
things that in many cases we cannot have
empirical evidence around as a matter of
fact the word empirical evidence comes
from empiricism which came from
philosophy Aristotle was the world's
first natural scientist he is what will
gave root to a lot of what we now
consider the hard sciences as a matter
of fact there is a argument that says
basically that after we reach a certain
point where we can agree on what some of
the natural laws are around a particular
subject that subject breaks away from
philosophy and becomes its own science
physics chemistry astrology or sorry a
straw to me although astrology as well
all of these things have their roots in
philosophy Scruton himself says that
philosophical thought consists of
basically two qualities abstraction and
a concern for the truth and I won't even
begin to say the Philosopher's then say
well what is truth but that is one of
the exercises that we engage in it's
characterized typically by first of all
an unwillingness to accept somebody
else's premises as done see in science
we pretty much you know as I believe it
was Isaac Newton once said we stand on
the shoulders of giants so as to be able
to see further philosophy says how do I
know that's a giant I don't want to
stand on him I want to get underneath
him I want to figure out why he's
standing here students routinely
and in fact are encouraged to challenge
their teachers this has been true all
the way back to the dead Greeks Socrates
is in many cases considered the world's
foremost philosopher and his student was
Plato and Plato routinely challenged and
questioned Socrates Plato in turn
tutored Aristotle who in turn challenged
a whole bunch of Plato's ideas and then
Aristotle went on to mentor an emperor
that is to say Alexander the Great
that's actually not a bad pedigree if
you can think about it we routinely
challenge what others have said before
us this is one of the things that goes
back throughout all the history of
philosophy is this desire to argue to
challenge to force you to question to
force you to think about what you're
doing as I said most science begins as
philosophy because that's how it began
Aristotle said hey look if I take paper
and I apply fire it turns into something
else that's interesting and then other
people said well why does that happen
well if we apply energy as part of this
chemical reaction it transforms the
matter and then somebody else said well
why does that happen
and we start looking for evidence and we
start looking for rationale and suddenly
chemistry is born and you look into the
sky and you say look there are all these
little dots running around everywhere
and some of these dots are bigger than
others and then there's this big dot
that seems to kind of go around us on a
regular basis and it seems reasonable to
begin with the idea that yeah we are the
center of the universe and then somebody
says you know but if you look at all the
dots and the way they move that doesn't
really look right we really predict the
patterns and if this is in fact a
natural phenomenon then I should be able
to predict the patterns maybe the model
is wrong I'm challenging my teacher and
so Copernicus said no we aren't to the
center of the universe the Sun is the
center of the universe and we revolve
around it and then he was like killed
for it
and then other people said well no the
Sun actually isn't the center of the
universe we are actually part of this
much larger universe and now astronomy
continues to try to seek to answer those
questions that began with philosophy one
of the interesting philosophers that
predates Socrates is Heraclitus he was
an Ionian philosopher like I said he
predates Socrates by about a hundred or
so years but he had this interesting
theory that because he was trying to
figure out as many philosophers started
what is the world made of what makes up
the world what is the substance of the
world and he believed in this theory of
what he called the Union unity of
opposites in other words that the world
it's actually very reminiscent of
Eastern philosophy yin and yang there
are these competing forces that are
constantly challenging with one another
and that's what creates the change in
the world that's what basically leads to
things being different and one of his
interesting examples was the idea of a
river this is an interesting question a
river consists obviously of water but
it's not the same water from one moment
to the next because the water flows so
if we were to sort of freeze it in time
and we were to
give identities to each of the various
water molecules that's what makes up
this river in this moment but if you
wait a day all of that water has washed
out to sea and new water has come but
yet it's the same River he says this is
basically kind of the unity of opposites
the all these things are in flux he
thought the world was basically made up
of fire in the classic elemental type
terms because everything is under change
and the really interesting thing about
his philosophy is when he says that
unchanging reality consists not of
objects but of processes now bear with
me for a second this is going to seem
like a stretch but how many of you have
been classically trained as
object-oriented developers how many of
you have been struggling to understand
functional programming which is a series
of transformations aka processes we are
debating in many cases the same kinds of
things that Heraclitus was wrestling
with does our reality consists of
objects or is it in fact a series of
processes this is very much it's
obviously not the same because we're
arguing about two different realities
here one is the reality in which we live
and the others reality in which our code
lives but one says that these are
objects maybe mutable maybe not but the
other says these are all processes
things that are constantly producing
little bits of data that we may or may
not be interested in another philosopher
is an often ease another ionian both of
these guys like I said predated Socrates
and one of the things that he questioned
was the idea of belief if I believe that
I am in Amsterdam I have what he called
not a fact but a true belief when we
know something that is in fact just a
belief how do I know that I am in
Amsterdam well I mean I can look around
I can see the signs there in Dutch it
happened to land at Amsterdam Airport I
haven't gone to another airport etc the
case for me being in Amsterdam is pretty
good but how do we know
this is where we start you know later
philosophers would start to get into
again the empiricist school of thought
which said hey it's it's all basically
about what we can see from the evidence
around us versus the rationalist thought
who said well your senses can be
deceived have you ever had one of those
dreams where it all seems so real and
how many of you have seen the movie The
Matrix I mean these are all basically
exercises in hey how do we really know
that we're all not just wired up to a
giant computer that stimulating the
right senses to make it look like I'm in
Amsterdam this is what Descartes was
reasoning against for him it wasn't a
computer it was a demon that was
successfully deceiving all of your
senses how do I know I actually exist
and this is where he came up with coach
Edo ergo sum I think therefore I am
because I can have this thought that
proves that I exist at cetera etc but
it's engaged in this idea of how do we
know that what we know is true now you
say well that's all very interesting and
it's particularly appropriate here in
Amsterdam because you can go get really
really baked and then think about this
stuff but let me ask you a question when
you're working with a bug how do you
know it's a bug how do you know that the
data is incorrect
how do you know that the program that
you wrote is responsible for this bug
when you are debugging an application
you are engaged in epistemological
research you are trying to figure out
how you know what you know and I have
watched so many developers say well I
know the problem is in this particular
method and struggle with it for three
days only to discover that no in fact
the data is wrong because it was stored
to the database wrong would have saved a
ton of time if he'd just channeled his
inner Zinna Fannie's and said I believe
because that changes the whole tenor of
the sentence doesn't it I don't know I
believe I have a true belief that dot
dot dot I believe that
your code is wrong I believe that my
code is wrong I believe that the
database administrator screwed it up
when he created the schema this
particular way I believe because that
opens up the possibility of doubt and
now requires proof and that changes the
whole tenor of your debugging session
particularly if you're debugging with
somebody else now that's not to say that
philosophy isn't filled with all kinds
of weirdness there are bunch
philosophers are well well-known for
coming up with paradoxes that on the
surface of it seem logical but when you
get to their conclusion you go wood so
for example the surah T's paradox if I
take a grain of sand just one grain of
sand and I put it on the floor in front
of me do I have a heap of sand that's
actually where the word the Soraa T's
paradoxes name Sora T's is Greek for
heap if I have one grain of sand do I
have a heap of sand
most people say no ok so if I put two
grains of sand do I have a heap three
grains four grains five grains how many
grains makes a heap
when does this number of sand become a
heap there's a more modern version of
this that says okay if I pluck a hair
from a man's head does that make him
bald and if I pluck another hair and
then another hair and then another sorry
by the way when does a man become bald
how many hairs what percentage of hair
covered see this is why I grow it long
so I can just do this really good
comb-over right at what point does a man
become bald what's that
twenty eight
or you're depressing me man seriously
Thanks xeno in particular was a
philosopher who was fond of paradoxes so
one of his famous ones is that the god
Apollo and the turtle are getting ready
to race and of course Apollo is the god
of speed so you know that Apollo is
gonna win this race so to be generous he
decides to give the turtle a head start
it sounds kind of like the rabbit and
the hare this may have actually been
where Aesop started with in terms of his
fable but if Apollo every second makes
up half the distance between himself and
the turtle he will never catch the
turtle if you apply limits he does they
didn't have those back in the Greek day
I mean seriously
on the surface of it this seems logical
find the error in any of the logical
conclusions along the way and then you
arrive at a completely unsensible result
right well okay because he's not running
half the distance of the turtle he's
running in a fixed speed yeah we can
explain the paradox using modern science
but one of his other paradoxes was that
if I take a bow and I shoot an arrow
through the air at any given moment in
time the arrow is not moving if I could
stop time the arrow is just right there
right and so if I do this by definition
if I just break that up and look at the
air it's not moving at all and again
these paradoxes make you go would this
is what philosophers really do and it's
made worse because during the time of
the ancient Greeks there was a class of
individual men of course that were
responsible for defending the citizenry
against the rest of the citizenry
remember Athens was a was a pure
democracy if you were a citizen you
voted on the issues of the day and the
issues of the day could range from do we
go to war with Sparta or should Joe give
me that sheet that he owes me and you
had to be able to represent yourself to
the various people that would gather
in the forum and several people were
better at arguing these kinds of logical
legal questions than others and they
were called the Sophists which is where
we get the modern term sophistry because
these guys were basically really really
good at arguing anything if you wanted
to argue that the sky was in fact purple
not blue these guys could come up with
an argument to do so which is where
again we get the term sophistry meaning
somebody who kind of argues just for the
sake of arguing whether or not it makes
any logical sense whatsoever I have
frequently been accused of such just as
warning Socrates was the first of the
big three Greek philosophers and again
I'm just gonna doing a very sort of
light introduction here Socrates was
famous for several things one of which
was his teaching method specifically
what we now call the Socratic method it
began from his idea that I only know
that I know nothing which as a starting
point is a really really good place to
start
right you see many many zen instructions
and so forth that say look zen mind
empty mind I don't know anything
therefore I am open to everything teach
me I am open to learning that to me is
probably one of the most fundamental
things that Socrates has done is he's
given us that model to follow but then
what he would do is he would engage in
debate and as a matter of fact Socrates
never wrote anything down what we know
of Socrates comes from his student Plato
who wrote most of what Socrates was
talking about which of course begs the
question then how do we know that was
really Socrates as opposed to Plato's
interpretation of Socrates but in fact
if you look at some of Plato's later
writings he tends to argue with Socrates
if he really just wanted to put his
words into Socrates mouth he would have
done it with some of the earlier stuff
so we can assume that this is actually a
relatively faithful representation of
what Socrates would say
so Socrates would would stand up in say
oh okay well what is justice as a matter
of fact one of the one of the writings
that is really interesting to read is
Crete oh and this is written that
basically the day the week before
Socrates is about to be executed for
subverting Athenian youth because he was
telling them to basically question
Authority he was the ancient Greek hippy
of his day and Crito was one of his
students who basically said hey Socrates
I've bribed the guards we can escape we
can save your life
you can purse you know you can continue
to fight the good fight Socrates says no
why would I want to do that and it's
this very long treatise around
questioning why would I want what is my
responsibility to the state to my
followers to my teachings to myself
Socrates is the one who said the
unexamined life is not worth living he
was very big on the notion as a matter
of fact all three of the Greeks were
very big on this notion of eudaimonia
the good life what does it mean to live
a good life and so he would engage in
discussions with people many at the time
sort of wrote Socrates off as just one
of the Sophists because he would be just
sort of standing in the public areas and
he would just pick random you know today
he would be a homeless guy that gets
carted away by the police because he
would just stand there on the street
corner and say what is the good life
what is value to you what does value
represent what is good what makes your
life worth living etc and you know two
hundred and fifty two thousand five
hundred years later he's one of the
great philosophers which they basically
also suggests maybe you should pay a
little bit more attention to the
homeless guy out on the street maybe he
says I'm interesting Plato it is not too
much to say that Plato is probably
considered the bedrock on which most
Western thought rests there have been
several people who have said that
you know all of Western civilization is
but a footnote on Plato Plato in
particular was interested in political
philosophy Plato is the one who often
talked about the philosopher King is the
best form of government as a matter of
fact he distrusted anybody who wanted to
govern and the only reason that the
philosopher King was worthy of governing
is because the philosopher King didn't
want to govern because he understood all
the responsibilities that would come
with this which puts again modern
democracy in a very very interesting
light because all those people want to
rule and therefore by his definition are
not worth ruling in some ways he was
sort of the inventor of modern
philosophy he was so self-conscious
about what he was doing about how he was
thinking about examining this process
that he's the one who started talking
about what are some of the the impact
how exactly should we approach this
particular subject etc he was the first
one that started really thinking about
what is philosophy well it's the answer
of that particular question etc
Aristotle was as I said earlier one of
the first scientists of history became
the tutor to Alexander and as I said all
three of them were really focused on
this notion of eudaimonia and they all
came up with different answers for what
it meant to live the good life most of
them were centered around this notion of
virtue this notion of living a good life
meant living a virtuous life but they
had a very different sense of the term
than what we do when we think of virtue
we tend to think of it in the Christian
sense you know certainly in a sense a
certain lack of sin if I can bring in
the the religious reference Socrates
said virtue means knowledge my job the
good life means knowing things means
engaging in reason means essentially
philosophia
plato's was around the virtue of justice
verts virtues are states of the soul and
the just person is someone whose soul is
ordered and harmonious with all its
parts functioning properly to the
person's benefit Plato is not a big fan
Khaos he's not a big fan of things that
do not sort of move he's very
reminiscent of Confucius over in the
eastern part of the world which actually
predates him by several I think by
several centuries the unjust man's soul
without the virtues is chaotic and at
war with itself so that even if he were
able to satisfy most of his desires his
lack of inner harmony and unity thwart
any chance he has of achieving
eudaimonia how many of you have studied
mindfulness this is becoming a very
popular movement meditation and so forth
that says you want to essentially become
it you know at peace you want to become
one with the world by examining your
feelings examining the chaotic things
that go on within you et cetera this
almost sounds like he's arguing for
mindfulness as a practice another
question how many of you just out of
curiosity how many of you are wondering
what you're doing in your career how
many of you feel really happy with where
you are in your career how many of you
wonder if it could be better you are
engaging in this exact same question
what does it mean to live the good life
what does it mean to live the good
career how many of you in this room are
managing others how many of you want to
keep managing others this is the same
kind of question how do we keep people
happy working here how do I avoid losing
my entire team this is very much that
same kind of question right the Stoics
which were a school of philosophy that
later the Romans deeply embraced Marcus
Aurelius is one of the most famous
Stoics said look there are a lot of
things that are outside of my control
and so basically happens roll with
it you can't control things you can't
you there are just so many things that
simply can't happen enjoy the things
that you can now you might get fired
tomorrow your company might go bankrupt
tomorrow your company might get acquired
and you end up working for a company
you'd really rather not work for okay
look I can't control everything that
goes on in my career so let me control
the things that I can
and let me just let go of the rest
building on Aristotelian ideals of
belonging and benefiting others
flourishing thriving and exercising
excellence this professor riff
conceptualized eudaimonia as a six
factor structure autonomy personal
growth self-acceptance purpose in life
environmental mastery positive relations
with others how many of you think that
sounds like what agile preaches yeah
agile ammonia you heard it here first
folks this in many respects I believe
personally it's not the process it's not
the scrum that makes agile successful
it's that you're actually coming into
touch with the things that make life
good these six factors and if I give you
these six factors without using scrum
will my team be successful
it's very possibly very probably true so
does that mean waterfall is the bane of
all evil and agile is what will save us
no it just means that agile may make it
easier to get to some of these things
that's philosophy now the other side of
this that I want to get to is psychology
the study of the brain understanding
that for many of you English is your
second language how many of you can make
sense of this sentence most of you yeah
and just in case you weren't sure
or how about this can you tell me what
these two words say the cat but question
the middle letter in each of those words
is the same I promise you it's the same
because I cut and paste those two very
very carefully how are you able to do
this well it turns out that the brain
operates by what we call activations
it's essentially a giant pattern
recognition device and it's happening
all the time you are constantly
recognizing patterns you are constantly
seeing these patterns and your brain is
taking every possible shortcut it can to
identify those patterns quickly because
the brain is a highly energy constrained
device the brain operates on about 40
watts of power your laptop uses more
power than your brain does now think
about that for just a second your laptop
actually your four previous laptop and
the previous one before that took more
power than what your brain uses when you
look at this picture what do you see do
you see a gray triangle superimposed
over a white triangle superimposed over
three black circles that's the pattern
recognition that your brain leaps to
because we have a tendency to connect to
those things that is not actually what's
there I again drew this very very
carefully to make sure that there isn't
a Photoshop triangle sitting on top of
that but your brain immediately leaps to
that because your brain is a pattern
recognition device which means that
perception is a matter of here not here
consider this how many of you have seen
this optical illusion before of course
everybody has it's like grade school 101
right every time you want to fool your
friends and pretend like you're smart
hey check this out those two horizontal
lines are exactly the same length no
they're not yes they are seriously and
then you get out a ruler and you measure
them you're like dang they really are
question why does your brain think that
the one line on top is longer than the
one on the bottom because we all of us
have seen this pattern before you go
outside and you stand on the tram tracks
and you watch them go off into the
distance and you see the tracks appear
to converge and so your brain says aha
parallel lines converging I know where I
recognize this and don't stare too long
because you will get hit by the tram but
I recognize this and I know that the
line looks shorter in the distance even
though it's the same distance although I
get it I recognize this pattern you can
stand at the base of a skyscraper look
up see exactly the same thing but when
you present the brain with a different
picture your brain goes wood and your
brain says ok I have to I have to devote
a couple more watts to process this
there's no pattern to recognize here so
your brain says oh yeah those two
horizontal lines they're exactly the
same length because I don't know what
this is but I can perceive this picture
and I am interpreting it and I'm
interpreting it exactly for what I see
as opposed to the pattern that I think I
see the most likely way that you will
perceive something is in a manner
consistent with your past experience if
you've seen the same thing over and over
again then when you see something that
looks vaguely like it boom I got this
comes straight out of cache memory I
know what this is even if you're wrong
which then says would you look at this
what do you see you see my project
do you know what this is guys this is
the universal architecture because
whether you were programming today 10
years ago or 50 years ago they all look
like this box Aero box Aero cylinder you
want to be an architect practice this
drawing you are now an architect and
there are people in the audience going
dude how does he know we have a security
leak call the boss because that used to
be mainframe talking orab sorry terminal
talking to mainframe talking to flat
file and then it was GUI program talking
to server talking to database and then
it was browser guys how many different
times are we gonna reinvent this
particular picture it's the universal
architecture so as soon as you stand up
in the middle of a meeting and say I
know exactly how we should do this
project box there a box here a cylinder
everyone goes cool yes that's exactly
what I was thinking my god you're
brilliant seriously you can make a
career consulting this way I'm not
nothing not that I do that of course the
brain does some really really funny
things there's actually a very popular
psychological experiment called the
candle experiment which says I give you
a box of nails a candle and a book of
matches and your job is to attach the
candle to the wall now if you want to
know how to do this I'll tell you
afterwards because I want you to do I
want you to dinner with it for a while
but this was actually used as part of a
project as part of an experiment to talk
about incentivization you bring a group
of people see with psychology everybody
assumes that we are all kind of
psychologists and so when you want to
actually test psychology you actually
have to lie to people the candle
experiment was not really an experiment
trying to figure out whether or not you
could solve this particular
out-of-the-box thinking it was
more along lines of incentive and
motivation we took a group of volunteers
and we told them I'd like you to try to
solve this problem and then took a
different group of volunteers and said I
will pay you if you can solve this
problem which groups spent longer trying
to solve the problem the group not
getting paid it completely baffled
psychologists as a matter of fact it was
discovered several times it was first
discovered with monkeys psychologists
put some interesting you know just latch
and so forth into a cage with monkeys
and then they rewarded some of the
monkeys with bananas and the monkeys
actually played with the latches last
when they were rewarded with bananas
then when they weren't it completely
flies in the face of everything that we
thought we knew about motivation and
incentive ization and actually this had
to be discovered several times before a
couple of psychologists actually started
to pursue it what does this mean for us
it means that if you manage people
for example offering to give them money
for staying late encourages them to
leave early this is not an off
experiment this experiment has been
conducted repeatedly under a number of
different guises it is in fact pretty
much psychological truth if you want to
incentivize people don't offer to pay
them as a matter of fact there's woman
by the name of Susan Fowler who's
written an entire book one of several
different authors has written a book
around motivation and we know I'll talk
about intrinsic versus extrinsic
motivation motivation from the outside
versus motivation from the inside guess
which one is more effective intrinsic
motivation so then we start asking how
do I get some of that intrinsic
motivation all of this all that I'm
talking about here is the study of the
brain the study of behavior and again
psychology breaks out into several
different Sciences disciplines etc again
depending on who you talk to
but there's biological psychology right
how exactly does the hardware and
software interact up here this we were
you getting to more of the study of
axons and dendrites and so forth and how
precisely information is carried
throughout the brain how memories are
stored etc learning and to the
psychologist learning is long lasting
change in behavior right not just
learning 2+2 but how do I act you know
when I see changes in somebody's
behavior how exactly did that happen is
this in fact possible whenever we start
talking about criminals and punishment
and so forth this is where a lot of
behavioral or sorry learning
psychologists will come into play can
criminals be reformed can you make a
huge mistake right now in the United
States there's this huge cry over a
Stanford swimmer who engaged in a pretty
heinous rape of a young woman and people
be there are literally people calling
for him to be put to death I mean you
know the Internet is an ugly place but
his father was saying oh but its life
shouldn't be ruined because of one
mistake okay everybody agrees punishment
should fit the crime but at what point
do we allow for people who genuinely
change their behavior to reenter society
and can they change their behavior can a
zebra change its stripes etc etc this is
the area focus for learning
psychologists cognitive psychologists
memory perception thought some of the
stuff that I was showing earlier
research in cognitive psychology socio
cultural psychology psychodynamics
psychology but more importantly the
thing that's really important to here is
that there is also a set of myths about
psychology that I think are more
important to call out how many of you
have heard that we only use about 10% of
our brains on a regular basis guys I'm
here to tell you
right how many of you can remember
precisely what you were doing on the day
late Princess Diana died or the
Challenger blew up or some other
incredibly traumatic
turns out you can't there is a lot of
things about psychology that seem to
seem to be common sense the idea that
opposites attract the idea that we
should punish our children when they
misbehave otherwise they will grow up to
become bad people speaking of prisoners
and punishment and so forth that the
longer you spend with somebody the more
you will grow contemptuous of them these
are all adages that turns out psychology
says now actually not true
would you rather be mugged where there's
only one person observing or where
there's a whole crowd observing turns
out psychologically speaking you prefer
the one because in a large crowd
everybody assumes that everybody else is
going to jump in to help and they don't
safety and large numbers not really
these are very popular myths of
psychology and these psychological facts
all of these here are in fact verifiably
false and don't feel too bad if you've
believed one or more of these I have as
well but when you actually start hunting
up the research when you actually start
hunting up the cycle all the psychology
studies that attempt to prove or
disprove this stuff they discover
they're not true there's a couple of
reasons for why we have some of these
psycho mythology and I do believe that
they apply to us in this industry for
example in some cases we are misled by
supposed experts 10-15 years ago if you
had come to this conference which at the
time was called Joe and you had sat in
the room and I was speaking I'd have
told you that web services were a
wonderful thing soap was going to enable
interoperability across all these
different platforms I'm sorry
I didn't mean it I wanted to be helpful
I was trying to be helpful I thought
that yeah occasionally the experts get
it wrong actually a lot of times the
experts get it wrong all right we get
misled by experts people will that we
trust to have done the research and have
figured this stuff out are lying to us
not necessarily consciously but truth
and not truth in some cases we believe
we are the experts how many of you have
ever argued medicine with a doctor no
doc you're wrong that's not what's going
on with me it's my body I know no you
don't this is called hubris I was in New
Orleans back in 2010 which if the date
doesn't tell you much do you guys
remember the Deepwater Horizon the Gulf
oil spill right the oil platform blew up
and oil huge amounts of oil spilled into
the into the the Gulf there the Gulf of
Mexico I and several other speakers all
very very bright people are standing
under a display sponsored by British
Petroleum yeah the irony in the New
Orleans aquarium okay so irony of
ironies and we five people are standing
here arguing about what would be the
right way to clean up the oil in the
Gulf because we know and all of those
experts out there on the Gulf currently
trying to solve the problem they haven't
tried any of the things that we've come
up with yet because we are software
developers there's a hubris there's a
hubris that goes on and we don't just
see it in software we see it in lots of
other careers that are very cerebral in
nature we get this sense that because we
think all the time because we're very
good at a subject that makes us very
good at all subjects and it gets really
really fun when software geeks start
arguing about law or start arguing about
what is
or is not legal or ethical or whatnot
look you don't know unless you've been
trained as a lawyer you really don't
know the law you may be able to project
yourself as an amateur lawyer but let's
be blunt push comes to shove you don't
want the amateur lawyer arguing your
case in court you want the professional
in the same way that we hold contempt
for people who fire up a text editor and
to HTML hello world I am a programmer
you know you're not at best you're a web
designer understand that we have this
hubristic tendency to believe that we
are the experts in some cases it's even
worse the science is close enough the
science actually gets us to a point
where we believe that we have the
answers ulcers ulcers are caused by
stress right false this was believed for
many many many many many years until a
pair of Australian researchers actually
discovered that there is in fact
bacterium that can live inside the
stomach lining at which point they got
totally shouted down by all the other
medical experts saying look the acid in
the human stomach is so strong there's
no way that anything could possibly live
inside there but there is it's called he
will call Hilo back Terry I'm sorry
Helicobacter pylori this is why I'm not
a biologist it is an actual bacterium
that can live inside the stomach and it
can irritate the stomach walls and
create an ulcer and it can be killed
with a common antibiotic but for how
many years doctors basically said
nothing we can do change your diet try
to live a stress-free life the end the
science was close
turned out it wasn't close enough it
wasn't good enough and in some cases the
really hard part is where psychology
seems to contradict our common sense
opposites attract
oh of course I knew this guy in this
girl and they couldn't have been more
different and their happily married and
then I see this other guy in this girl
and they're just like each other and
they can't stand each other
ergo opposites attract of course
Voltaire has a quote at the beginning of
this section the problem with common
sense is it's not very common
everybody knows anytime somebody says
everybody knows that's when your
 radar should go off in flying
colors because not everybody knows they
really don't there's a talk-show host in
the state's Dennis Prager there are two
kinds of studies in the world those that
confirm our common sense and those that
are wrong this is a guy who has millions
of followers who believe him because he
sounds like an expert interesting I
don't have this in the slides but
interesting another psychological study
how many of you would voluntarily
electrocute another human being
depends which one oh that's dark that's
dark
ow Wow okay therapists to aisle four
please turns out most of you would there
was an experiment conducted in the 60s
where volunteers were brought in and sat
in front of a very complicated computer
console and told that they were
participating in a psychology experiment
and that there was another volunteer on
the other side of the console where they
could not be seen and that in fact
anytime that this individual got part of
the experiment wrong the volunteer you
was supposed to administer a short
electric shock and so essentially this
guy and a lab coat and glasses holding a
clipboard would instruct when and for
how long and for how much you were
supposed to deliver an electrical shock
and so at first you know you
basically turn the dial and you'd hear
on the other side oh wow
but then the authority figure would
order you to deliver harder shocks for
longer to the point where and this is
obviously part of the experiment on the
other side somebody is literally
screaming in pain begging crying until
after you've maxing the dial and leaving
it there for a couple of seconds you
hear nothing at all
vast majority of participants if this
were a real experiment would have
delivered lethal amounts of electricity
all because a perceived authority figure
somebody in a lab coat with glasses and
a clipboard told them to do you think
you're better than that
you're not science is uncommon sense
science is about questioning these
things and looking for these things and
common sense interestingly enough
changes over time there was a time many
many years ago where it was believed
that I could understand your personality
by examining the bumps and the ridges on
your head it was called phrenology
and when you talk about going to a
psychologist and getting your head
examined
that's where that phrase comes from the
idea that an expert would feel the
ridges on your head and say oh yes
you're actually a very controlling
asshole aren't you
that's phrenology and it was common
sense it was common sense that x-rays at
a festival couldn't possibly hurt you
it's cool science is not common sense
doesn't mean the common sense is wrong
it just means we have to treat
everything with skepticism and what's
wrong with this well okay I'm gonna
fast-forward through this section by
just saying one word Trump there's lots
of damage that psychological myths can
deal to us including the fact that we
may find our critical thinking impeded
in other areas
everybody knows that hibernate is great
everybody knows you should always use
spraying um why does everybody know that
what what makes that a fundamental truth
of the universe I personally have been
ranting for the better part of a decade
against best practices because there are
no such things so how do you bust it
well there's several ten actually
sources of error which I'll leave you to
look at later and then the rest of these
slides here are basically talking about
some of the science of psychology which
I do strongly encourage you to get into
to take a look at for example how we
perceive things how do we see depth why
do we actually have that reaction of the
parallel lines coming together with one
another perceptual consistency
perceptual said etc when I fast forward
to my last one oops oh no too fast too
fine screw it the end of the day guys
psychology and philosophy are huge
subjects I can't possibly do them
justice in 50 minutes much less both in
50 minutes but if you walk out of here
today and say wow and think to yourself
III never thought about that and I think
I should start thinking more about that
about the nature of models the nature of
properties does an object in the world
if its property is something is that
intrinsic to that object or is property
philosophical thought or how do I
interact with individuals how do I
understand motivation if this drives you
to pick up an introduction to psychology
or an introduction to philosophy book
then yeah this was worth it
